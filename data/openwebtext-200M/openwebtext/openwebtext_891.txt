Last week Kaufman Bros. analyst Shaw
Wu suggested that AT&T should revisit its current data plan options for the iPhone to keep it competitive in the tough economic climate .
Now , it seems that recent moves by rival carriers to lower prices put additional pressure on AT&T to do the same , according to Wu 's latest report to investors .
The complaint about high prices for the iPhone are n't usually centered on the $ 199 ( heavily subsidized ) purchase price , but the high monthly fees AT&T charges for voice and data options .
Wu , among others , has suggested that AT&T consider additional pricing tiers in addition to the $ 30 per month unlimited data plan , which is currently the only option for the iPhone .
Along with a $ 40 per month minimum voice plan , and taxes and fees , iPhone users are seeing monthly bills that start at about $ 75 and go up to $ 150 for unlimited voice , data , and text messages .
Recent pricing options from rival carriers are much lower .
SprintNextel offers its " Simply Everything " $ 99 per month unlimited plan , and even its " Everything Data " plan for 450 peak voice minutes includes unlimited data and text messages for $ 70 .
SprintNextel 's Boost Mobile subsidiary is offering a new $ 50 a month plan that includes unlimited talk , messaging , Web , and walkie - talkie service .
And T - mobile is currently testing a plan that would offer unlimited voice and data for $ 75 per month .
Wu believes the lower prices will keep smartphone adoption rates up , and if AT&T were to follow suit , it would be a further boost to iPhone sales .
" Overall , " Wu wrote in his report , " we view lower service plan prices as positive as it should help smart phone adoption maintain its healthy pace , even in this fragile economy . "
We can't deny that it seems wise for AT&T to explore this path .
Children 's fashion can be awfully cute , and often , incredibly expensive , which is a shame when the children 's clothing or shoes must be discarded only months after purchase .
Inchworm
Shoes have created a new , innovative technology that prolongs the life of the shoes by allowing them to grow with the child .
Inchworm shoes creates hot children 's fashion accessories , which can expand to fit children 's feet as they grow up to 3 sizes ( including at half - size increments ) larger .
The children 's shoes are " parent adjustable " with the touch of a button and a little bit of pulling encouragement , with an indicator to show the new shoe size .
" Parent adjustable " is code for difficult , but in a good way ; since no one wants their children to adjust their shoes during wear .
Inchworm Shoes are affordable children 's footwear , at about $ 39.99 USD per pair , and there are styles available from the line to suit practically any casual occasion .
The sporty children 's shoe designs are perfect for any pint - sized fashionista in the making , or the young and active .
Inchworm shoes are another great example of functional and fashionable styles ; but this time , the focus is upon children 's fashion .
EDITOR'S UPDATE : Inchworm Shoes are no longer available in the market .
Drives
Today , and for months now , the meds that stop me from killing myself have killed my sex drive .
My boyfriend , being stressed at work , initially assured me that his was also non existent and not to worry .
I found out he 's been wanking every day and hiding it from me so I do n't feel bad .
Now I know , I feel fucking awful .

Lindsay Lohan has n't had much to laugh about lately , what with the public meltdowns , court appearances , and endless fights with paparazzi chronicling the breakdown of her relationship with Samantha Ronson .
But the headline - prone actress has , it seems , managed to retain a passing acquaintance with her sense of humour .
In a bold display of self - awareness , Hollywood 's most prominent " train - wreck , " last week posted a video - taped message to fans on the internet .
It took the form a spoof dating advert , in which she claimed to be searching for a life companion who does n't mind her ( alleged ) alcoholism , or colourful nocturnal habits .
" I would define my personality as creative , a bit of a night owl , " she said , with a perky smile .
" I 'm a workaholic , a shopaholic and , according to the state of California , an alcoholic …
Well crash a few parties , a car or two , but at the end of the day I promise you : I never lose my Google hits - just my underwear ! "

The 90 second video was watched by a million people in its first day .
Pundits were smitten .
" It 's not just getting laughs , it may get her career back on track , " reported Robin Roberts , the influential ABC news anchor .
" It 's almost like an audition tape for people who could be hiring her , " cooed US Weekly 's Dana Sansing .
By yesterday , it had pulled nearly 3 million views , prompting widespread speculation that Lohan , who starred in hits like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls before her erratic private life saw her shunned from major Hollywood roles , might suddenly be on course to light up the screen once more .
So far , so normal , in the fickle world of Hollywood .
But the clip 's real significance had less to do with Lindsay Lohan than with the website where it appeared .
It is called Funny or Die , was founded by the comedian Will Ferrell in April 2007 , and in two short years has become one of the most important and talked - about brands in show - business .
Funny or Die , which is essentially a version of YouTube for comedy , is changing the way fallen celebrities rehabilitate themselves .
It has become the " go to " venue for film and TV producers searching for new talent , or trialing fresh material .
And in the eyes of some experts , the way it makes and markets content represents a blueprint for the future of television .
In October , Funny or Die helped Paris Hilton create a video mocking John McCain , who had used her image in a campaign advert during the Presidential election .
" He 's the oldest celebrity in the world … like , super old …
But is he ready to lead ? "
It stole the news agenda .
Nine million people watched .
Earlier last year , when the rumour - mill suggested that an intimate video of Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria was doing the rounds , she took her heat out of headlines by recording a spoof sex tape for the site .
" I 've gotta go to sleep , " she said , at the end .
" I have an audition tomorrow .
Something called Desperate Housewives .
It sounds crap . "
The film clocked up eight million views .

Funny or Die works as follows : it contains thousands of short , comic video clips .
Some are created by either private users ( there are tens of thousands ) ; others by the site 's own creative team , which is run by Ferrell , his writing partner Adam McKay , comedy producer Judd Apatow , and the screenwriter ( and Mr Brooke Shields ) Chris Henchy .
After watching the clips .
Users click on a voting switch labelled either " funny " or " die . "
The more positive votes a clip gets , the more prominently it is displayed .
That , broadly , is that .
But recently , thanks in no small part to the starry team that run affairs at the company , it has become a favourite outlet for short comic films recorded by Hollywood celebrities who , for whatever reason , are in need a bit of positive PR .
Last week , in the run up to the launch of his film 17 Again , Zac Efron - who despite his massive profile could use some artistic credibility - appeared on the site .
Other celebrities to have volunteered their services for it include Jack Black , John Hamm , Natalie Portman , Ron Howard and Gina Gershon .
" In the old days , if a celebrity had something to say , or if they were in trouble , they would go on the late night chat - show circuit , like Hugh Grant did when he was caught with the hooker , " says LA media consultant Jacquie Jordan , the owner of tvguestpert.com .
" Now , they can also do a skit for Funny or Die .
In PR terms , it has clear advantages .
First of all , it 's instantaneous .
It also feels a little understated .
From the public 's point of view , seeing a famous person doing an internet skit is like catching a famous person eating at McDonalds rather than Mr Chow's .
Its cute . "
The site 's first ever hit was called " The Landlord , " and featured a character played by Will Ferrell being harassed for overdue rent by a two - year - old infant .
That clip , released on the day Funny or Die launched , rapidly went viral .
It now boasts 62 million views , and is one of the most watched video in the history of the internet .
Today , the website boasts 45 full time employees in the US .
A spin -off UK version , run by Matt Lucas and David Walliams , was launched in September .
It is also taking to the traditional airwaves : HBO recently announced that it had struck a deal to develop a series of comedy TV programmes , called " Funny or Die presents . "
" I do n't want to overstate the importance of this deal , but this is the missing link moment where TV and Internet finally merge , " says Ferrell .
" It will change the way we as human beings perceive and interact with reality .
Okay , I overstated it .
But it is an exciting deal . "
In fact , Ferrell had a point .
Funny or Die 's tie up with a mainstream broadcaster may very well represent the future of television programme development .
In the past , new shows could only emerge via the expensive route of filming TV pilots , with all the vetting and market research that entails .
Funny or Die , and sites like it , provide a cheap proving ground for new comic material .
" It 's an incredibly quick , artist - friendly system , " says the firm 's CEO Dick Glover .
" That 's the point of it .
You can literally do what you want , when you want , without 28 page legal documents .
With the Lindsay Lohan clip , for example , she called us on Thursday , we had a script Friday , it shot on Saturday and went online on Wednesday . "
" Studios are also using us to try out new talent and formats and see if public takes to them .
On the other side of the coin , they are using it to find new talent .
CAA have already signed one or two writers who put material on our site .
So have UTA . "
Comedy is , of course , a perfect medium for internet TV , providing most of the content for several leading online stations such as the UK's Channelflip which carries a weekly skit by Peep Show 's David Mitchell , and Sony 's US site Crackle .
Most rely on viewers using email to forward humorous clips or shows to friends .
" You can tell a joke in a minute .
Or less .
And that makes comedy ideal for the internet , which is all about short attention spans .
It 's about snackable content , " says Chris McLure , the president of Candortv.com , a site that carries material by stand - up comedians .
The million dollar question , of course , is whether it can also make a profit .
With audiences for network TV falling drastically , and advertisers vanishing in the face of recession , the industry 's finances are in a parlous state .
Internet TV , with its low overheads , and vast reach , represents a beguiling commercial proposition .
" If you can reach the right audience with the right content , you can make money with all sorts of things that in the past would n't wash their face , " says Scott Nocas , a Vice President at Sony , who is responsible for helping Playstation users get downloadable video content through the console .
" I think of a show on one of the online TV stations called " You suck at Photoshop . "
It 's just this guy at a computer manipulating images and making snide comments , and it 's very , very funny .
The show would never exist in a network TV world , where you need 10 million viewers .
But online , it can be made for very little , distributed almost free , and with a relatively tiny weekly audience still make commercial sense . "
All of which , in a roundabout way , is same as saying that Funny or Die and its peers work on the basis that laughter really is the best medicine .
As Lindsay Lohan , Paris Hilton , and the host of stars taking a sudden interest in internet comedy , would no doubt agree .

Raw video : Local demonstrator seriously injured by tear gas canister hit to his chest during anti-fence rally , dies of wounds shortly after reaching hospital .
IDF says protest was violent .
Demonstrators :
We 're like sitting ducks ; soldiers fire at anything that moves ; army , PA investigating
He said he was able to take the step now because of plans to reduce troop levels in Iraq more quickly than they are increased in Afghanistan and because of an enlargement that has increased the size of the active - duty Army to more than 547,000 troops , a level it had not been projected to reach until 2012 .
The number of troops affected by stop - loss increased sharply under the troop increase for Iraq that President George W. Bush ordered in early 2007 .
Mr. Gates cautioned that “ scores , ” but not thousands , of soldiers might continue to be affected by the policy after March 2011 if they had skills that were particularly important to the war effort .
According to Pentagon statistics , 13,200 people are now under stop - loss orders : 4,458 in the Army National Guard , 1,452 in the Army Reserve and the rest from the active component .
The Army said Wednesday that it would provide additional pay of $ 500 a month to those currently affected by the policy , retroactive to last October .
Lt. Gen. Michael Rochelle , the Army deputy chief of staff for personnel , said that the policy had been “ a vital tool ” for successfully meeting the needs of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , but that Army leaders realized it “ has caused hardship on soldiers and families . ”
At its core , the stop - loss policy meant that all troops headed to Iraq and Afghanistan would remain in service throughout their unit ’s deployment  even if the time on an individual soldier ’s enlistment contract expired before the deployment ended .
It also prevented the movement of soldiers who wished to remain in service but had intended to change positions within the military or attend a military school .
The Army has said the rule was required not just to sustain the numbers necessary to carry out two wars , but also to maintain continuity in leadership and cohesion within units that trained for and then were deploying to war .

The Army 's new ray gun research project combines the zap of a laser with the crackle of an electric shock and the pop of a high - power microwave pulse .
Known as the Multimode Directed Energy Armament System , it offers a wide range of different effects against different targets .
Defensively , it could knock out everything from improvised explosive devices to incoming rockets .
As a weapon , its effects might range from Taser - like effects to a lethal lightning bolt – and it should be able to stop vehicles in their tracks .
Assuming the tech all pans out as planned , naturally .
The technology , which I describe in this week 's New Scientist magazine , uses an ultra -short pulse laser to create an ionized channel through the air ; down this channel , you can then send bursts of energy .
It 'll conduct electricity .
And it can also act as a waveguide for an intense pulse of microwaves .
These could be used to destroy the fuze of a roadside bomb , fry the electronics of a missile , or burn out the ignition on any unshielded vehicle .
( In a way , the Multimode system is a new twist on the devices developed by Applied Energetics , formerly Ionatron .
But that firm , which promised " laser - guided man - made lightning , " has been notably unsuccessful in actually fielding anything that works so far .
Plus they 've been accused of what might politely be termed controversial business practices .
And unlike Ionatron 's " Joint IED Neutralizer " – a vehicle - mounted device with an apparent range of just three feet , backers of the the new Multimode system promise it 'll be portable , with a much greater effective range . )
According to this presentation given by Barbara Machiak the Army 's Armament Research Development and Engineering Center ( ARDEC ) , the device " defeats / neutralizes full spectrum of materiel threats at stand off , " offers " multi- mode DE [ directed energy ] effects from one platform for anti-personnel and anti-material " and has " scalable effects from non-lethal to lethal . "
This raises all sorts of questions .
What would that " full spectrum "
of threats include ?
Does this mean we will have a portable , lethal ray
gun sending deadly electric pulses down a glowing ionized laser
filament ?
ARDEC would not discuss the project in any detail – and if
you look closely at that presentation , you 'll see one significant image
has been scratched out for reasons of security .
However , ARDEC does
acknowledge that it exists and that its first mission will be to take
out IEDs .
They aim to have a demonstrator working in a realistic
environment in FY2011 .
Danger Room asked Carlo Kopp – an assistant professor at Monash
University of Melbourne and an expert on electromagnetic pulse weapons
\– about the idea of using the laser ionization channel ( technically
known as a Laser Induced Plasma Channel or LIPC ) to direct a microwave
pulse .
He believes that the physics are straightforward enough , and
compared it to using a taut metal wire as a waveguide , although
engineering may be a challenge .
" Conventional HPM [ High Power Microwave ] is inverse square law range
limited , LIPC is plasma channel cohesion range limited , " Prof .
Kopp
notes .
This suggests that if ARDEC can create a long enough channel ( a
big if ) , this technology might be able to precisely deliver a microwave
pulse to a point target at extended range , rather than blanketing a
wide area .
It may also have one other key advantage , says Prof. Kopp .
High - powered microwave antennas have
a tendency to spill to the back and the side , " producing ' self kill ' on
the delivery platform .
If an LIPC scheme solves this problem it is
worth the extra complexity and cost . "
At present , the U.S. military is reluctant to put high - power microwave weapons on manned platforms
because of this risk of " self kill . "
So the new technology might be a
major step forwards .
However , ARDEC are not the only ones working on
this technology .
A Canadian team published a paper on a very similar project
last year –- except that they specify using an array of plasma
waveguides to form a hollow cylinder to contain the microwaves , and
theirs was strictly a lab experiment .
Two of the researchers come from
Defence R&D Canada though , so the military applications are
probably not lost on them .
And if the idea of microwaves being channeled along a laser beam sounds familiar , Then the MEDUSA " mobile energy device " which Sharon described back in 2007
works on the same basic principle " Microwave transmission using a
laser - generated plasma beam waveguide " – except that was an unfunded
scheme put forward by an unknown start - up company .
( Defense contractor BAE Systems ' Laser / microwave combination
weapon mentioned a couple of years ago is not related , that just uses a
laser in the control circuitry to improve the coherence of the
microwave beam . )
I have come across a number of other U.S. Army projects that appear to feed into the Multimode Weapon program , relating to lasers , microwave sources and pulsed power .
This makes it difficult to assess the overall budget and how long it has been under development - it 's at least nine years plus .
But if the research develops into something battlefield - worthy – a big if – it might be quite a big deal .
Perhaps we 'll see a one - shot portable bomb - zapper .
Or perhaps a weapon that could be very dangerous indeed .

Maria Sansone 's time hosting " The 9 " on Yahoo pretty much spanned the Web 2.0 era .
From July 6 , 2006 , two months before Google bought YouTube for $ 1.65 billion , to March 20 , 2008 , the same month Bear Stearns collapsed , Maria took 4 minutes every day to run down a list of nine stories her producers culled from the Web .
Probably the best thing about the show was the blog not officially affiliated with it .
Called " What 's Maria Wearing ? , " it answered just that question .
Here 's how Yahoo explained the show 26 months ago :

Overqualified temp
Asok the intern says , " It 's funny that you 're a Rhodes scholar yet you can only find work as a temp . "
Asok the intern says , " I am only an intern and yet I enjoy the power and prestige of being your supervisor . "
Asok the intern says , " In retrospect I should n't have challenged her to a cage fight . "
UPDATE : THE FIGHT IS BACK ON , according to Sherdog.com .
Hitomi Akano late last night withdrew from her April 11 Strikeforce bout against Cristiane Santos after " Cyborg " failed to make her contracted weight of 145 - pounds .
However , the Japanese import has since had a change of heart , agreeing to step inside the cage despite giving up several pounds to her overweight counterpart .
Santos originally tipped the scales at a whopping 152 pounds -- seven pounds over the set limit .
The California State Athletic Commission ( CSAC ) currently enforces a six - pound rule , which does not allow a fighter to compete who weighs in over six pounds in any division save for heavyweight .
Santos was given until 8 p.m. PT to make the cut to a minimum of 149.5 pounds -- a mark she missed by one pound at the deadline .
The CSAC opted to let her fight , so long as both camps were in agreement .
They were n't .
Akano was reportedly very upset that Cyborg was so far off the mark .
Strikeforce officials and " Girlfight Monster " representatives apparently stayed up until 2 a.m. local time to hammer out a deal , offering her a " very reasonable " win bonus ( whether she won or lost ) , as well as two guaranteed future fights , to change her mind .
It apparently worked , according to Akano 's manager , Shu Hirata , :
" " All I can say is that Strikeforce and Mr. Coker offered her something very reasonable and we appreciate his effort as well .
Of course as a fighter she always wants to fight but she wanted to get the right conditions to make that happen , that ’s all . "
This came very close to becoming the second major blow to befall the Strikeforce " Shamrock vs. Diaz " event at the HP Pavilion in San Jose , California .
Last week , Josh " The Punk " Thomson had to pull out of his lightweight title fight against Gilbert Melendez after breaking his leg in training .
Rodrigo Damm stepped up to replace him , but there will be no such rescue in this case .
An undercard bout would have likely taken its place on the televised portion of the card .

Updated July 10 , 2001
At the Evanescent Press in Mendocino county , California , we have been making paper by hand since 1988 .
Starting in 1990 , we began to experiment with the use of hemp which we first received as anonymous local donations from growers in the hills who were cultivating marijuana .
From the very beginning , we were impressed with the quality and strength of the hemp fiber , and we quickly began to locate additional sources .
We received raw bast fiber hemp from China , and partially prepared bast fiber hemp from a mill in Spain .
( Until recently , this mill in Spain supplied the pulp for most of the commercial hemp paper made outside of China , although now several other mills are getting into the act . )
But this hemp material has always been very expensive , and so we have tried to get permission to cultivate fiber hemp ourselves , on our own property , for the exclusive use of making into paper in our own mill .
The local donations have always yielded a very high quality fiber , but , unfortunately , the plants have been cultivated for their flowering tops rather than for the fiber , and so , instead of receiving long thick stalks with lots of fiber and very few branches , we receive odds and ends of small sticks and stems .
This material is almost impossible to decorticate efficiently ( separate the high quality outer fiber from the core ) .
However , from my researches into hemp ( e.g. , the famous Bulletin 404 of the USDA , Hemp Hurds for Paper Making ) , I understood that the hurds , or core material , although not as good as the bast fiber , was still quite usable , at least for commercial qualities of paper .
Our own interest has always been to make paper of the highest quality , and so ordinarily we are not interested in lower quality material , but , since we are interested in the commercial potential of hemp for paper , we use the whole stalks , although we use decorticated bast fiber also .
So , in order to have access to quantities of stalks with nice long fat layers of bast fiber , it is necessary to cultivate the hemp specifically as a fiber crop , and this we have applied for a permit to do .
Fiber hemp has almost no THC ( the active ingredient in marijuana ) .
Most varieties of fiber hemp contain about one half of one percent THC .
( For reference , wild strains of “ drug ” varieties of cannabis usually contain from 3 to 7 % THC , which in cultivation is usually raised to from 7 to 10 % .
Today ’s most knowledgeable growers are often able to attain THC levels of 15 % and even higher . )
But the THC content is not the whole story !
Fiber hemp also contains relatively large amounts of CBD , another chemical which interferes with the cannabis high , producing headaches , nausea , and a heavy , stupid feeling .
What this means is that it is just not possible to obtain a positive drug experience from fiber hemp .
Period .
When agents of the DEA asked me how I was going to ensure that there would be no “ diversion ” of the material to illegal uses , I replied that I would put up a sign on the gate : “ Fiber Hemp . Very Low THC . ”
I explained that none of my neighbors would be likely to touch any of those plants with twenty - foot tongs , for fear of taking away a seed by mistake !
Although ordinary fiber hemp , the sort which was cultivated widely in Kentucky and other states for many years until it was outlawed in the 30’s , would be most suitable for my needs , I was interested to obtain seed from the Bast Fiber Research Institute in the Ukraine , where seed has been developed with the lowest levels of THC , as low as .01 % .
My travels to the Ukraine led to my introduction to work on alternative pulping technologies which excited me very much .
I saw test sheets of paper made from a great variety of fibers , from whole hemp stalks to hemp hurds with no bast fiber at all , to sunflower stalks and other agricultural waste material .
Even better , the technology employed a closed system so there was no toxic effluent or any other source of environmental pollution .
But all of this is another story .
If you are interested , follow the links to the Alternative Fiber Pulp Mill , and the New World Pulper .
I returned from the Ukraine with a supply of seed , and arranged for it to be safely held for us in Amsterdam , pending the issuance of our permit .
Well , my hair is turning gray , and that seed has gotten old , and we are still waiting for that permit .
( When I updated this article earlier , in May of 1997 , that old seed had been distributed long ago , but it is no longer a problem .
When we get our permit , we will have no trouble getting seed . )
At the direction of the DEA , we obtained a safe for storing viable seed .
We installed an eight foot high chain link fence around our site , complete with eighteen inches of barbed wire angled out at 45 degrees .
We installed a locked gate .
We installed floodlights , alarms , and a telephone connection to emergency services .
Finally , we fixed up a little cabin for the use of a 24 hour guard .
You do n’t want to hear about all the run-arounds with Research Protocols and site inspections .
Suffice it to say that at long last , the DEA was satisfied of our compliance with all of their regulations , and that we were the first and only ones to do so , and so all we needed to do now was to obtain the cooperation of the State of California to be able to receive our permit at long last .
All efforts to obtain state approval for this project were totally frustrated until California voters decided that patients who use marijuana for medical use should no longer be prosecuted as criminals ( Proposition 215 , the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 ) .
Since legal authority in the United States is conditional upon the consent of the governed , federal laws proscribing marijuana have no legal authority in the State of California , at least insofar as they interfere with the rights guaranteed directly by the people in Proposition 215 .
In any case , we expect no opposition to our suggestion that we allow medical marijuana patients to cultivate cannabis within our federally approved enclosure as long as they leave us their stalks , since there must be some legal way to comply with the terms of Proposition 215 , and our proposal would provide a more closely regulated cultivation than any other proposed solution .
Actually , there was some opposition , I record , updating this history of events .
As a matter of fact , the DEA tacitly conceded my right to grow medical marihuana , but based their objection to my application upon my checking off the box on the form that said “ for non-human consumption . ”
Since it was still against California law to cultivate hemp “ for non-human consumption ” my application must be denied .
I clearly submitted a written amendment to my application ( previous paragraph ) , but this amendment was not accepted even though regulations allow amendments “ for good cause . ”
I thought that modifying the application to conform with the laws of the State of California was a good cause .
So this application was denied , and I had to submit yet another application ( my fourth since 1993 ) , with yet another $ 875 non-refundable deposit , in which I was careful not to check off that offending box .
If the account ends here , I am still waiting for their response .
( Update ) .
The story continues : On November 4 , 1999 , I received an “ Order to Show Cause ” why the application should not be denied .
In accordance with the Order , I sent in my request for a Hearing , carefully saving my receipts for certified mail , and also carefully saving the signature card of the person receiving my request .
Nearly a year later , I finally received another communication from the DEA .
( Perhaps they figured that a long enough time had passed that I would not have retained any documented evidence of my formal request for a Hearing ) .
I received a Notice of Final Adverse Ruling , based upon my failure to respond to their Order to Show Cause .
This “ Final Adverse Ruling ” was subsequently published in the Federal Register .
I promptly sent along photocopies of my request for the Hearing , along with photocopies of my postal receipts and the signature card of the receiving DEA agent .
Well , I could hear them gnashing their teeth in frustration as they were forced to publish a “ Notice of Withdrawal of Denial of Application ” in the Federal Register .
Next , I receive a Motion for Summary Disposition , which is a motion to decide the matter out of hand , without allowing me my right to a fair Hearing in the matter .
I responded with a clear summary of the case from my point of view , but after some time I received a very surprising decision from an Administrative Law Judge accepting the Government ’s Motion .
The logic of the decision was very feeble , but what is to be expected when you ask a judge in the service of the DEA to decide the case ?
( Shall we hire a fox to guard the chicken house ? )
We were proposing to rent space in our garden to the Paper Mill Hemp Farm , which was constituted as a cooperative association of medical marijuana patients .
However , the judge for the DEA stated that the law requires each person who manufactures a controlled substance separately to apply for an annual registration .
In the first place ( as I should have explained in my Hearing , had the Government allowed me such exercise of my legal rights ) , “ person ” is commonly used for corporations and other entities , so that the Government ’s interpretation was specious on the very surface .
But , in practical terms , it is pretty ludicrous for the Government to blandly assert that each member of the cooperative association should independently apply for individual registration !
The Paper Mill Hemp Farm is so constituted as to provide a structure under which the members may act collectively .
Since the Church of the Living Tree is the sponsor of the project and the owner of the property , it makes abundant sense that they should be treated as the responsible party in this case .
But after ten years and many thousands of dollars for fencing , security measures , and four separate application fees ( the annual fee is $ 875 , non-refundable ) , we are still very far from any Registration under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 .
It would almost appear that our Government is deliberately obstructing our efforts to comply with the law .
We have sent a letter of complaint to the Public Integrity Section of the DEA , but we have no illusions that there will be any change .
When the Government is determined to pursue its own agenda , in defiance of the expressed will of the people ( e.g. , California ’s Compassionate Use Act of 1996 , “ Proposition 215 ” ) , it is clearly useless to bang your head against such a brick wall .
However , the United States Government cannot build a “ Great Wall of China ” around itself , nor can it stick its head in the sand forever .
My company , Earth Pulp & Paper , is in the process of building non-wood fiber pulp mills for installation in Europe , Asia , Canada , and throughout the “ Free World . ”
Perhaps when farmers and processors in the rest of the world are making lots of money , and no one wants paper anymore made from America ’s wood - pulp mills , there may be a change in policy .
But if we are too busy building non-wood pulp mills everywhere else in the world , American farmers and business people will know where to direct their complaints .
We have tried to introduce our technology here in California , but we are taking it out of the country .
Agents of the DEA are free to congratulate themselves on their victory .
We will make no further efforts to cultivate hemp in this country .
Kelley Coffman - Lee ’s plan to advertise her love of tofu on a license plate ran afoul of censors at the Division of Motor Vehicles .
The 38 - year - old mother of three asked the DMV to approve a special plate emblazoned with “ ILVTOFU ” for her Suzuki SL - 7 .
It was not 2 B .
The agency turned down the request , saying the plate might be offensive to some people .
“ My whole family is vegan , so tofu is like a staple for us .
I was just going to have a cool license plate , and the DMV misinterpreted my message , ” the Centennial resident said .
It turns out that “ FU ” is on a long list of letter combinations barred by the division , said Mark Couch , spokesman for the Department of Revenue .
Think of it as “ Eff you , ” he said .
“ We do n’t allow ‘ FU ’ because some people could read that as street language for sex , ” Couch said .
A committee meets periodically to update the list so that plates stay free of letters that abbreviate gang slang , drug terms or obscene phrases made popular in text messaging , Couch said .
Among the more than 200 examples of alphabet soup are obvious red flags such as PIG and KKK and head - scratchers such as BUB and HEN .
The rear of Coffman - Lee ’s vehicle is festooned with a multitude of bumper stickers that leave little question about her feelings on issues such as global warming and meat - eating .
As a vegan , she wo n’t consume or wear anything that comes from an animal .
“ But it ’s not just about food .
It is a philosophy of life .
It means you have compassion for animals ; it means that you do n’t want to see them performing or research done on them or them being eaten . ”
So far , Couch said , no carnivore has requested ILVMEAT .

The Republicans can do a Nixon - goes - to - China by offering a better version of universal coverage .
There is , after all , substantial concern about the Democrats ' reliance on universal coverage through a government - controlled system like Medicare .
Some distrust government 's ability to make good on its promises .
Medicare currently owes $ 36 trillion in services to those who paid for its use when they hit 65 .
Have you seen a spare $ 36 trillion hanging around ?
( For perspective , that amount is equivalent to about three years of US GDP . )
Another concern is that government will control costs by rationing health care to the sick .
The government - controlled UK health care system , for example , has the lowest uptake of cancer drugs among the five biggest European economies and correspondingly low cancer survival rates .
Concerns about rationing are not demagoguery .
How else can a government control costs ?
Many experts dismiss as wishful thinking the Democrats ' claims of achieving efficiency by implementing dazzling information technology and other technocratic tools .
And because the truly sick constitute only 20 percent of health - care users , but account for 80 percent of health - care costs , they may as well wear a bull 's eye on their backs : they are a politically vulnerable target for cost control through rationing .
Transforming the government into a monopolistic buyer of health care will also affect the supply of doctors .
All too many doctors , saddled with massive educational debts , refuse to see Medicaid patients because they are pay so little .
But if government were the only payer , some prospective physicians , facing the prospect of incomes totally controlled by the government , would reluctantly enter other professions .
Finally , a government - controlled system would likely impair the medically and economically important genomic sector .
US venture capitalists have provided billions for research that may provide cures or even preventions for genetically linked diseases .
Kiss that money -- and the important personalized medicine industry it could create -- goodbye under a system of government - controlled universal coverage .
Venture capitalists will find it too risky to invest in markets where one payer controls prices .
The Republicans could instead offer a consumer - controlled universal coverage system , like that in Switzerland , in which the people , not the government , control how much they spend on health .
There are no government health insurance programs .
Instead , the Swiss choose from about 85 private heath insurers .
Rather than being stuffed into the degrading Medicaid program , the Swiss poor shop for health insurance like everyone else , using funds transferred to them by the government .
The sick are not discriminated against either -- they pay the same prices as everyone else in their demographic category .
Like the US , Switzerland is a confederation of states that , as in the US , oversee the insurance system .
Enforcement by the tax authorities has produced 99 percent enrollment .
Playmate Hope Dworaczyk Wears A Painted On Jason Kidd ’s Mavericks Jersey
Do you remember April 2009 Playboy Cover Model Hope Dworaczyk ?
It has been reported that she was been dating and pregnant with Dallas Mavericks point guard Jason Kidd child .
Child ?
Judging by these photos I think the reports of a child are a little false .
However , a year has passed and she ’s about as pregnant as my dad and if you have n’t reached the health unit in school yet , check this out .
Contrary to popular pre-health unit belief , it actually takes 9 months of growth in the womb to conceive a child and no Stork is involved in the process .
If that shocked you , closer to Christmas I ’ll tell you about Santa Claus .
You ’ll freak .
[ HoopedUpOnline ]
Either way if she is pregnant or not , Hope Dworaczyk is fantastic and our hats go off to Jason Kidd .
Having a beautiful girl like Hope Dworaczyk pose in Playboy with only your Dallas Mavericks jersey on , putts Jason Kidd at a different Mack level .

KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - Fast food chain McDonald ’s lost a lawsuit in Malaysia on Wednesday after an appeals court overruled a decision that its trademark had been infringed by a local restaurant called McCurry .
“ Where the learned judge , with respect , erred is to assume that McDonald ’s had a monopoly in the use of the prefix ‘ Mc ’ on a signage or in the conduct of business , ” Judge Gopal Sri Ram said , overturning a 2006 ruling in favor of McDonald’s .
The McDonald ’s operation in this Southeast Asian country of 27 million people is run as franchise by prominent businessman Vincent Tan and has 185 outlets , according to the company website ( www.mcdonalds.com/my).
McCurry , by contrast , serves Indian fast food from one restaurant in Kuala Lumpur as well Malaysian dishes such as fish head curry and is short for “ Malaysian Chicken Curry , ” according to the company website ( www.mccurryrecipe.com).

One club owner said students turned up as soon as schools were closed Students from schools and colleges in Japan shut down over fears of swine flu have been flocking to karaoke clubs to fill their new - found free time .
The students were told on Monday they should stay at home if possible , but some club managers said they were busy as soon as the closures were announced .
More than 4,000 schools , colleges and nurseries have been shut temporarily in Hyogo and Osaka prefectures .
The move was made as Japan confirmed more than 170 cases of swine flu .
" We suddenly had a number of high school students after 2 pm yesterday , right after the announcement that schools would close for a week , " one club manager in Osaka told the AFP news agency .
Most Japanese karaoke clubs are a collection of private rooms which can be rented out by groups , and the manager said every room in his club was full at one point on Monday .
" I 'm expecting something similar today , " he said .
" I do n't have the right to say ' you should stay at home ' . "
Turned away
But another Osaka club manager , Yoshikatsu Ishida , took a different view of the sudden surge in business .
He told AFP about 10 different groups of high school students had turned up at his club wanting to sing but he had turned them away when he found they had been told to stay at home .
Japan confirmed dozens of swine flu cases over the weekend , pushing the total to more than 170 , the highest number outside North America .
Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura told a news conference on Tuesday that the country needed to prevent further spread of the infection but also to " maintain public activities " .
Japanese officials have said they are phasing out quarantine efforts at points of entry to the country and focusing instead on domestic transmission .

Food and Drug Administration gave green light to a new female condom FC2 that could be alternative to first ever previously approved condom for women FC which hardly generated decent sales since its launch back in 1993 .
Both contraceptive products have been developed by US - based Female Health Co. that plans to build distribution channels in America and developing countries .
First version of female condom , FC , was n’t widely popular because of its relatively steep price and noisiness .
In 2008 , just 10 percent of its sales were in the United States .
What sets FC2 apart is the material it is made of .
Instead of polyurethane the company used synthetic rubber characterized with both more tenacity and less cost .
This makes new version cheaper and , with thinner walls , FC2 has become way more comfortable and quieter .
As it was said earlier , Female Health Co. is planning to distribute the product in both US market and developing countries .
New female condom is positioned as the only woman - controlled contraceptive and method to prevent sexually transmitted diseases .

Socialism is n't a utopian dream .
It is a part of the real world , a struggle already in progress .
Brian Jones examines
Marx 's revolutionary ideas in this last of three articles .
KARL MARX is widely condemned as a utopian dreamer .
The irony in this is the fact that Marx is distinguished from previous socialists precisely by his departure from a utopian approach .
The real utopians were the socialists before Marx .
They dreamed of an egalitarian society , and drew up elaborate plans for them -- rigorously detailed blueprints for industry , education and social life .
The utopians hoped that if these plans were presented to rich and powerful people , they would be convinced by the rationality of socialism , and they -- the bourgeoisie - - would give us an egalitarian society .
I have an image in my mind of Donald Trump leading a march for economic equality .
Now that is utopian .
Marx and Engels were the first to bring socialism down from the clouds and put it on a real - world , scientific basis .
Their starting point was not ideals , but reality :
The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones , not dogmas , but real premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination .
They are the real individuals , their activity and the material conditions under which they live , but those which they find existing and those produced by their activity .
Marx and Engels were the first socialists to support trade unions .
Why ?
Because Marx and Engels were the first to see socialism as the logical end result of the class struggle that was already in progress .
We are usually taught that change is the product of enlightened , courageous minorities working on behalf of the grateful masses .
Marx 's was a 180 - degree change in approach .
" All previous historical movements , " he wrote , " were movements of minorities , or in the interest of minorities .
The proletarian movement is the self - conscious , independent movement of the immense majority , in the interest of the immense majority . "
This continues to be a radical departure from the usual way that revolution ( or really any social change for that matter ) is conceived .
Furthermore , this " immense majority " is organized in the first place , not by people preaching socialism , but by the capitalists !
As Marx and Engels wrote in the Communist Manifesto :
[ W] ith the development of industry , the proletariat not only increases in number ; it becomes concentrated in greater masses , its strength grows , and it feels that strength more .
The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalized , in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labor , and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level .
Series Marx is back SocialistWorker.org columnist Brian Jones introduces the ideas of Karl Marx and his contribution to the socialist tradition .
The return of Marx
Marx becomes a Marxist
Marx ’s vision of socialism
Today , " the various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are ... equalized " to an amazing degree .
Basically , in 2009 , the life of a wage laborer has the same essential features in every corner of the globe .
It 's the spread of capitalism all over the globe that explains why you see people organizing unions all over the globe - - from Nigeria to Venezuela , from South Korea to Canada .
Further , socialist proselytizers do n't have to convince people of the " idea " of fighting back .
Capitalism forces people to do that .
When management tried to take away all of their sick days and cut pay by 25 percent , the workers who make cookies at the Stella D'oro factory in the Bronx went on strike .
When the owners of the Republic Windows & Doors factory in Chicago tried to close the factory in December and cheat the workers out of their severance pay , the workers occupied the factory .
This movement of the " immense majority " is not a utopian dream .
It is a part of the real world , a struggle already in progress .
Ever since Marx , it is these struggles that are the starting point for the socialist movement .
As Marx wrote in a letter :
We do not confront the world in a doctrinaire way with a new principle :
Here is the truth , kneel down before it !
We develop new principles for the world out of the world 's own principles .
We do not say to the world : Cease your struggles , they are foolish ; we will give you the true slogan of struggle .
We merely show the world what it is really fighting for ... explaining to it the meaning of its own actions .
BUT WHERE is this struggle headed ?
What is the meaning of a strike ?
Even small strikes ( such as the two mentioned above ) can have big implications .
In effect , the owners are telling the workers how it 's going to be , and the workers are collectively saying , " No , this is how it 's going to be . "
Who 's going to decide how many sick days there will be ?
Who 's going to decide whether the factory stays open or closes ?
Who 's going to decide the hours , the pay and so on ?
A strike is like a revolution in embryo , because it 's the first step towards working people saying , " We 're going to decide . "
When students occupied a cafeteria at New York University to protest ( among other things ) the outrageous rate of tuition , their classmates gathered in the hundreds outside the building to support them , chanting , " Whose school ?
OUR SCHOOL ! "
What 's the implication of that ?
Furthermore , what if the working class actually won this struggle once and for all ?
What if the students and teachers took over the schools ?
What if the nurses and doctors controlled the hospitals ?
What if we -- the workers -- controlled all of the workplaces ?
If capitalism was the product of the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the kings and queens , then the outcome of the new class struggle -- the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat -- is socialism .
As Marx and Engels wrote :
It is not a question of what this or that proletarian , or even the whole proletariat , at the moment regards as its aim .
It is a question of what the proletariat is , and what , in accordance with this being , it will historically be compelled to do .
Its aim and historical action is visibly and irrevocably foreshadowed in its life situation , as well as in the whole organization of bourgeois society today .
What is it that is foreshadowed ?
Marx is saying that a truly collective society is foreshadowed by the life of the working class under capitalism .
We already work collectively .
If we struggle , we must struggle collectively or we lose .
Marx pointed out that if the working class were to rule , the only way it could rule would be ... you guessed it : collectively .
WHAT WOULD that look like ?
Marx and Engels ( unlike the utopian dreamers ) wrote very little on what socialism would precisely look like , because it 's not for two people sitting in a room to decide .
The whole point is for the " immense majority " to remake society as they see fit .
We do n't have to draw up elaborately detailed plans for a socialist future , but we can imagine the broad outlines of would be possible if we , regular working people , ran society :
--
We could provide free health care to everyone .
--
We could house everyone ( why not free housing ? ) .
--
We could feed everyone ( why not free restaurants ? ) .
--
We could give people real leisure time , to spend with their friends and families , travel , pursue other interests .
Impossible , you say ?
Well , it 's happened before .
In 1871 , the workers of Paris took over the city and ran it for two months .
They set up an egalitarian workers ' government .
They abolished the standing army , and instead armed the people .
They elected representatives with no term of office and no perks , who were paid only an average worker 's wage and were recallable at any time .
They opened up education for women ( unheard of ) and for working people in general .
Marx described how :
The whole of the educational institutions were opened to the people gratuitously , and at the same time cleared of all interference of church and state .
Thus , not only was education made accessible to all , but science itself freed from the fetters which class prejudice and governmental force had imposed upon it .
The mass of people participated directly in the running of the Commune , and they planned to reorganize the factories under worker 's control .
Crime virtually disappeared since everything was organized for the purpose of meeting people 's needs .
Marx wrote that the masses of Paris had " stormed heaven , " and the wealthy classes of the world howled in protest :
It is a strange fact .
In spite of all the tall talk and all the immense literature , for the last 60 years , about emancipation of labor , no sooner do the working men anywhere take the subject into their own hands with a will , than arises at once all the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of present society , with its two poles of capital and wage - slavery ... The Commune , they exclaim , intends to abolish property , the basis of all civilization !
Yes , gentlemen , the Commune intended to abolish that class property which makes the labor of the many the wealth of the few .
It aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators .
It wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production , land and capital , now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labor , into mere instruments of free and associated labor .
But this is communism , " impossible " communism !
Even this socialist society , Marx argued , is not some dreamland .
It 's really just a first step :
The working class did not expect miracles from the Commune .
They have no ready - made utopias to introduce ... They know that in order to work out their own emancipation ... they will have to pass through long struggles , through a series of historic processes , transforming circumstances and men .
They have no ideals to realize , but to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing bourgeois society itself is pregnant .
If you think that capitalism is an utterly corrupt system , and that our society is " pregnant " with the possibility of radical change , and if you have some intuition that we , the working people of the world , could run things in a better way , then you should join the socialist movement and help to make that dream a reality .

The video shows the legs in their natural , metallic finish , as well as dressed up in some fur .
Which , I ’ll admit , was rather disturbing .
If you ’re not satisfied with Paul Krugman or Nouriel Roubini as your guide to the current turmoil , you can always rely on E.M. Forster .
It was Forster who grasped the essential drawback of the Internet long before anyone else , depicting , in his 1909 story " The Machine Stops " a world in which individuals communicate in isolation via machine .
It turns out he ’s pretty good on 21st - century financial crises , too , mostly because the underlying processes remain so similar to those of a financial crisis he studied .
Only the scale has changed .
Forster ’s great - aunt Marianne Thornton helped raise him after his father 's death , leaving him 8,000 pounds upon her death , when Forster was 8 .
That legacy gave him the financial cushion to become a writer .
So he wrote Marianne Thornton : A Domestic Biography 1797 - 1887 , stringing her voluminous letters together with scene - setting prose .
As it happens , the fortunes of the Thornton family turn on history ’s first episode of successful central banking : the Bank of England 's intervention in the 1825 financial crisis .
Marianne ’s younger brother , Henry Thornton , was 25 in 1825 .
Though the Thornton ancestors had built a successful bank , it had passed out of family control a decade earlier .
But in the middle of 1825 young Henry was invited to join it as the most junior of six partners .
Marianne writes of profits of 40,000 pounds a year , which is quite a lot when you reflect that Jane Austen 's creation , Fitzwilliam Darcy , the richest commoner in early 19th - century England — other than Nathan Meyer Rothschild — receives ( I refuse to write " earns " ) only 20,000 pounds a year from his estate of Pemberly .
Forty thousand pounds a year in income corresponds to a market capital value of 1 million pounds , which bears the same proportion to the size of the British economy then as $ 10 billion would bear today .
The bank — renamed Pole , Thornton upon Henry 's joining — was not small change .
To join it as one of the profit - splitting partners was one hell of a 25th birthday present .
But , then , these were the kind of people whose house had not an address but a name : " Battersea Rise . "
And now let me turn the microphone over to 28 - year - old Marianne Thornton .
Writing in December 1825 to her friend Hannah More , she said : " There is just now a great pressure in the mercantile world , in the consequence of the breaking of so many of these scheming stock company bubbles . "
Sound familiar ?
These were not bubbles in high - tech stocks or in mortgage lending and house prices , however , but bubbles in shipping lines , canals , and textile - spinning factories .
And , of course , the bank of which young Henry had been a partner for only four months had gotten itself badly undercapitalized .
The managing partner " had been inexcusably imprudent in not keeping more cash in the House , but relying on [ the bank 's ] credit ... which would enable them to borrow whenever they pleased . "
Except , of course , that in 1825 just as in 2009 , no bank can borrow cash on the one day it really needs to , for every other bank really needs it on that same day .
Which is why there came a “ dreadful Saturday I shall never forget , ” when a run on the bank was made , with “ one old steady customer ” withdrawing , without warning , his entire 30,000 pounds , leaving the bank vault “ literally empty . "
According to Marianne , the other bank partners fell apart :
The managing partner " insisted on proclaiming themselves bankrupts at once , and raved and self - accused himself . "
Senior partner Scott " cried like a child of 5 years old . "
Partner Pole was away at his country estate .
Another was on a business trip .
It fell to 25 - year - old Henry to deal with the fact that in the last business hour of Saturday , " they would have to pay 33,000 [ pounds ] , and they should receive only 12,000 [ pounds ] .
This was certain destruction . "
Henry Thornton frantically searched the City of London looking to borrow money .
He found banker John Smith , who always has been “ particularly kind to Henry . "
He told Smith he could hardly expect him to lend the bank funds , but asked if Smith could at least tide them over until the 5 p.m. closing time .
Smith asked if the bank was solvent and Henry gave his word .
Well , then , Smith said , Pole , Thornton would have all he could spare .
“ Never , [ Henry ] says , shall he forget watching the clock to see when 5 would strike , and end their immediate terror .
...
The clock did strike ... as Henry heard the door locked , and the shutters put up , he felt [ Pole , Thornton ] would not open again but would be forcibly liquidated Monday morning . "
There were , however , other characters in motion .
Robert Banks Jenkinson , Second Earl of Liverpool , first lord of the Treasury and prime minister of His Majesty George IV , had been having whispered conversations with Bank of England Gov. Cornelius Buller and his deputy John Baker Richards .
Liverpool said that it was of vital importance that the banking system of London not collapse under the weight of speculation and the popping of all those stock company bubbles .
Liverpool claimed he could not get Parliament to appopriate money to save the banks or to prop up asset prices : Parliament was populated by tax - paying landlords who did not especially trust the stock - jobbing financiers of London .
Liverpool had spent much of the past year warning bankers that if their " overtrading " were followed by " revulsion " and " discredit , " that he would not spend Treasury money to rescue them .
However , Liverpool told Buller , the Bank of England might .
The Bank of England had a peculiar semi-private status with enormous autonomy .
And everyone knew it was too big to fail — it was , after all , the bank for the entire British Empire , and the empire would stand behind it .
So the Bank of England could save the situation even if the government could not .
Moreover , it seems Lord Liverpool said to Buller , if it becomes necessary I want you to print up banknotes in excess of the legal limit , and to lend out your gold reserves even though the bank ’s charter requires you to keep them in your vaults .
Banker John Smith had gotten wind of these conversations between Liverpool and Buller .
And that Saturday evening , after the banks had closed , John Smith told Henry Thornton that if Henry truly believed that Pole , Thornton was solvent he , John Smith , would undertake to get it cash from the Bank of England .
This was a shock .
" [ T ] he Bank [ of England ] , " Marianne Thornton wrote , " had never been known to do such a thing in the annals of banking , " and so " Henry had little hope from this . "
Nevertheless , the following morning , Sunday , at 8 o'clock , Bank of England Gov. Buller and Deputy Gov. John Baker Richards , along with every member of the Court of the Bank of England who was in London , were assembled to meet John Smith and Henry Thornton .
Marianne Thornton picks up the story : " John Smith began by saying that the failure of [ Pole , Thornton ] would occasion so much ruin that he should really regard it as a national misfortune , " and he also praised Henry Thornton beyond all reason , saying " what he had seen of the conduct of one of the partners ... had convinced him that could [ the bank ] be saved for the moment , " the crisis would pass .
Smith " then turned to Henry and said , ' I think you give your word the House is solvent ? '
Henry said he could ... [ and ] had brought the books .
“ ' Well then ' , said the governor and the deputy governor of the Bank , ' you shall have 400,000 pounds by 8 tomorrow morning , which will I think float you ' .
Henry said he could scarcely believe what he had heard . ”
I can scarcely believe it myself , even now .
Blowing that number up to account for the difference between the British economy then and the British economy now , that 's a $ 4 billion commitment secured on the word of a 25 - year - old .
Amazing — although there was a joke making the rounds last April that JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimond could have borrowed an extra $ 2 billion from the Federal Reserve if he had been willing to pledge his dog as collateral .
Monday morning , in the pre-dawn dark , Henry Thornton was at the Bank of England with Gov. Buller and Deputy Gov. Richards .
For security reasons , they were alone .
Buller and Richards counted out 400,000 pounds in bank notes .
" I hope this wo n't overset you , my young man , " Marianne Thornton claims one of the two said to Henry , “ to see the governor and deputy governor of the Bank [ of England ] acting as your two clerks . "
Henry Thornton arrived at his own bank before opening with 400,000 pounds in cash .
The run on bank funds then recommenced .
But " rumors that the Bank of England had taken them under its wing soon spread , and people brought back money [ on Monday ] as fast as they had taken it out on Saturday . "
This was the birth of central banking as we know it .
The Bank of England had accepted the role of maintaining orderly markets and financial stability in a crisis .
Why ?
Because the prices of financial assets are too important to be left to the market when it is panicked and when letting prices reach market levels will mean unemployment for hundreds of thousands in 1825 , or tens of millions today .
Ben Bernanke 's Public Private Investment Partnerships — the vehicles for purchasing banks ’ toxic assets — are a natural development , even a Burkean development , of policy that has been pursued for 184 years now .
When politicians wash their hands of a financial system in crisis and fail to intervene on a large scale , things do not turn out well .
The most notable example was 1929 – 1933 , when , at least according to Herbert Hoover , Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon persuaded Hoover that " even a panic is not altogether a bad thing ” because " it will purge the rottenness out of the system . ”
Did 1825 turn out better ?
We think so .
George IV was not executed on Tower Green .
Lord Liverpool 's head was not carried about London on a pike .
The spinning of cotton into thread in Britain in 1826 was 11 percent lower than in 1825 — the first serious industrial recession — but it bounced back and grew 30 percent from 1826 to 1827 .
And the bank of Pole , Thornton ?
Alas , Henry Thornton was irrationally exuberant when he swore that the bank was solvent .
The bank was eventually closed .
The partners lost their capital shares .
The Bank of England had to wait years before getting its emergency loan back .
( They did not care much ; they were too big to fail , and Lord Liverpool thought they had done well . )
Henry ’s career prospered thereafter .
Even though the financial ship that he had seized command of as a junior partner foundered , the consensus was that he had displayed great energy , good judgment , a cool head , and a facility with figures that made him worth backing in the future .
On exposed shores , it ’s better for barnacles to grow shorter , thicker penises ( Image : J. Matt Hoch )
In calm waters , barnacles grow longer , flexible penises with greater reach ( Image : J. Matt Hoch )
Longer is n’t always better , according to some men , and it seems the same is true for barnacles , too .
The hermaphroditic filter - feeders can grow penises up to eight times their body length – they have the longest penis length relative to body size in the animal kingdom – but new research suggests that stouter members are sometimes more effective for mating .

Glued to a rock year - round and unable to self mate , a lengthy penis increases a barnacle ’s odds of spreading its seed .
The animals regrow their penises each year , just before their brief mating season , and previous research has shown that water conditions play an important role in shaping the budding penis .
In calm waters , acorn barnacles grow long , flexible members in order to reach as many mates as possible .
However , in choppier waters , the barnacles develop more muscular penises with far less reach .
“ It ’s kind of like toughness versus flexibility , ” says J. Matt Hoch , a marine biologist at Stony Brook University in New York , who tested whether barnacle penis plasticity actually affects reproduction .
Fertile waters
To do this , he set up two experimental barnacle beds – one on the wave - exposed Atlantic shore and the other in a protected harbour near his university .
A few months before breeding season and before penis growth started , Hoch collected barnacles from a site exposed to moderate waves and moved them into his two experimental love nests .
After their penises sprouted and mating began , Hoch quickly took half of the barnacles from the moderate site and transplanted them into the exposed site , and vice versa .
At the end of the mating season , he counted up the number of fertilised eggs .
Predictably , barnacles raised in calm waters that grew thin , flexible penises struggled when forced to mate in choppier waters .
They fertilised significantly fewer eggs compared with their lengthy counterparts that stayed in calm waters .
Barnacles with thicker penises , on the other hand , fertilised just as many eggs in the harbour as they did in the open ocean .
However , barnacles with thin penises mating in calm waters fertilised the most eggs out of all the groups .
Interestingly , Hoch noticed that in rough waters , barnacles with thin penises suffered fewer injuries and breaks than barnacles with more muscular members .
He reasons that the waves were so rough at times that the barnacles with thin penises did n’t dare come out to look for a mate .

Josh Gordon , The Age ( Melbourne ) , September 7 , 2008
AUSTRALIA has been singled out as a target for “ forest jihad ” by a group of Islamic extremists urging Muslims to deliberately light bushfires as a weapon of terror .
US intelligence channels earlier this year identified a website calling on Muslims in Australia , the US , Europe and Russia to “ start forest fires ” , claiming “ scholars have justified chopping down and burning the infidels ’ forests when they do the same to our lands ” .
The website , posted by a group called the Al - Ikhlas Islamic Network , argues in Arabic that lighting fires is an effective form of terrorism justified in Islamic law under the “ eye for an eye ” doctrine .
The posting — which instructs jihadis to remember “ forest jihad ” in summer months — says fires cause economic damage and pollution , tie up security agencies and can take months to extinguish so that “ this terror will haunt them for an extended period of time ” .
“ Imagine if , after all the losses caused by such an event , a jihadist organisation were to claim responsibility for the forest fires , ” the website says .
“ You can hardly begin to imagine the level of fear that would take hold of people in the United States , in Europe , in Russia and in Australia . ”
With the nation heading into another hot , dry summer , Australian intelligence agencies are treating the possibility that bushfires could be used as a weapon of terrorism as a serious concern .
Attorney - General Robert McClelland said the Federal Government remained “ vigilant against such threats ” , warning that anyone caught lighting a fire as a weapon of terror would feel the wrath of anti-terror laws .
“ Any information that suggests a threat to Australia ’s interests is investigated by relevant agencies as appropriate , ” Mr McClelland said .
Adam Dolnik , director of research at the University of Wollongong ’s Centre for Transnational Crime Prevention , said that bushfires ( unlike suicide bombing ) were generally not considered a glorious type of attack by jihadis , in keeping with a recent decline in the sophistication of terrorist operations .
“ With attacks like bushfires , yes , it would be easy .
It would be very damaging and we do see a decreasing sophistication as a part of terrorist attacks , ” Dr Dolnik said .
“ In recent years , there have been quite a few attacks averted and it has become more and more difficult for groups to do something effective . ”
Dr Dolnik said he had observed an increase in traffic on jihadi websites calling for a simplification of terrorist attacks because the more complex operations had been failing .
But starting bushfires was still often regarded as less effective than other operations because governments could easily deny terrorism as the cause .
The internet posting by the little - known group claimed the idea of forest fires had been attributed to imprisoned Al Qaeda leader Abu Musab Al - Suri .
It said Al - Suri had urged terrorists to use sulphuric acid and petrol to start forest fires .
To see higher - numbered choices , select " Recommended Cameras " under the " Categories " heading in the right - hand column .
At the outset of this list project , I warned you that there were going to be a couple of choices you would think were cop-outs .
Choice # 6 was originally intended to be one of those ; it was supposed to be , " An entry - level DSLR of the brand of your choice . "
But the more I thought about it , the more I thought people would object to that — the purpose of a list it to make choices , not leave them open .
So I ended up picking the compact Olympus E - 420 , based mainly on its current price .
Of course , not long thereafter , it occurred to me that what I had really done was cop out on copping out .
This time , I 'm determined ; my resolve is steely .
This choice is going to be a real cop -out , dammit .
Choice # 3 is : " A mid-level 4/3 or APS -C DSLR of the brand of your choice . "
A cop -out ... sure .
Yes . ( Finally . )
But , as usual , there is method to my madness .
First of all , this is a list of recommendations .
For most photographers , I really do feel that the best possible choice of cameras in the current market is ... a mid-level 4/3 or APS -C DSLR of the brand of your choice .
For most photographers who are ambitious to do good work but who are not pros , this level represents a sweet spot .
Putting significantly more money into a pro camera is often not the smartest move , and spending an appreciable portion of this money on a significantly less capable entry - level camera might also not be the smartest move .
This tier — these cameras — represent a sweet spot for the manufacturers as well ; these are superlative products that utilize many of the previous pro-camera generation 's innovations of technology , but that do n't have the cut corners ( example : poor viewfinders ) and dumbed - down feature sets ( example : " scene modes " ) of cheaper models .
So which one should you choose , exactly ?
It is n't that important .
That 's what I 'm trying to say .
It ’s really unfortunate that with the photography hobby exploding in the digital era , so many people have been gulled into the false , not to mention asinine belief that brand loyalty has something significant to do with photography , and that minute differences in " image quality " ( the very concept of which I could take issue with ) mean anything at all to anyone .
As long as you have a competent tool , the brand of camera you choose just does n't matter .
Whatever you choose , it ’ll have some strengths , it ’ll have some weaknesses , and you ’ll get used to both if you use the thing enough .
When they look at your work , nobody cares what brand camera you used , and you do n’t get any credit one way or the other ( i.e. , positive or negative ) for the name on the box you happen to choose .
What you want from a camera is for it to be " good enough . ”
Beyond that , I ’m here to tell you that the next incremental improvement in your work is not going to come from buying a slightly better box .
Sorry , did n’t mean this to be a rant .
I realize that most of you reading this already know all this .
But seriously , here ’s how to buy a camera : figure out what lenses you need first , and who has them ; figure how big a camera you want to carry ; figure out ( from that and from the pricing and your budget ) what level or tier you ’re going to be looking in ( and this level is a good one ) ; then pick one and get on with it .
Photography is all about looking : looking at the world , and looking at pictures .
It ’s not about cameras .
Well , it is , but it only begins with the camera .
It does n’t end there .
Shooting skills , visual sensitivity , craft and technique have more to do with how good your pictures will look than the brand name on the box .
With apologies to all those anxious corporate marketing and advertising departments out there .
This group currently includes :
( Prices are of this writing ; check links to be sure .
Note that at least two of these cameras are likely to be replaced in the next 12 months . )
This is the type of camera most of our readers own .
There are a few differences between them .
Choice for most people will depend on the following : brand bias ; current investiture ( or lack of same ) in compatible lenses and other system accessories ; specific feature needs or wants ; habit ; hand - feel and idiosyncratic ergonomic appeal ; and price and purchase opportunity .
However : again : all of them are superlative products , all of them are cameras that skilled shooters could easily use to do top - quality work , and all of them are more camera than most photographers really need at a minimum .
I have to mention , too , that no matter how carefully you choose , your choice will change meanings dismayingly shortly , because all of these cameras will be old news all too soon .
Okay then ... within the context of " do n't obsess , " here are a few of the pertinent differences that might affect the choice of one or another :
• Canon and Nikon are the market leaders , with the broadest ranges of accessories , the largest selection of specialty lenses including super - telephotos , and the quickest adoption and widest accommodation by third - party software providers .
Dominance can translate to profits , which then translates to re-investment in R&D .
However , dominance can also translate to complacency : both companies ' current cameras are based heavily on previous models , and neither the Canon nor the Nikon have body - integral image stabilization , largely because both companies make more money by putting that feature into their lenses .
• The Nikon is the only one of these cameras with video .
• The Olympus has a slightly smaller sensor .
This does not have a detectable effect on image quality at most ISOs , forum hysteria notwithstanding , but it does have a noticeable effect on comparative high - ISO performance .
On the plus side of the same ledger , the higher " crop factor " translates to more effective reach for telephotos of the same focal length , and the smaller coverage allows Olympus to make some of its lenses faster .
• The Pentax , Olympus and Sony all have body - integral IS , meaning it can be used with any lens , even those that Canon and Nikon do not make available with IS , and also meaning it does not need to be purchased repeatedly ( and expensively ) in each and every lens you buy that has it .
Imaging - Resource.com has announced a verifiable protocol for testing IS , which will be coming online gradually over the coming months .
• The Pentax is the only one that is fully weather sealed , although only the DA Star lenses are also weatherproof .
• The Olympus is the only one with an articulated viewing screen .
• The Pentax is the cheapest .
• The Olympus is the prettiest .
• The Nikon has the best sensor rating at DxOmark.com .
( Current ranks of this group : Nikon D90 11th , Sony A700 17th , Pentax K20D 21st , and Canon 50D 30th .
The Olympus E - 30 is unranked , although it would probably rank last of this group . )
• Olympus has the newest and , overall , highest - performing selection of zooms , but also , by far , the worst selection of prime ( single - focal - length ) lenses .
• Pentax has the best made - for - digital compact primes , which are an afterthought to the other four manufacturers .
So , the takeaway from today 's recommendation : shopping — exhaustive , hysterical , argumentative , absorbing , never - ending , absurdly excessive shopping — has come to dominate many online discussions of photography .
This is a distraction .
A good shooter with a poorish camera will still shoot rings around an inexperienced goof with the latest , most fastidiously chosen , and most strenuously defended techno - wonder — and all of these cameras are truly excellent devices that will serve any thoughtful and hardworking photographer very , very well — very well indeed .
Pick one and be done .

Featured Comment by Shawn Barnett of Imaging - Resource.com : " Hear , hear !
Though we 're happy to report all the details and offer our opinions on digital cameras at Imaging - Resource.com , it 's the camera you have , know , and use that will get you the best pictures .
Though I can often steer individuals to one camera or another based on features or image quality , it 's also heavily based on their individual needs and biases .
In the end , I 'm confident that most of the SLRs on the market will serve well , because competition has forced SLR makers to produce some pretty fine equipment .
People should still think about what they want from a camera , but too many wait too long and miss out on the fun of photography .
( So if you have n't yet , click the button on the A900 already , Mike . ) "
Featured Comment by Sam G. : " Consider this a perspective from a first time DSLR buyer .
Mike replies : Valid concerns , for sure , Sam , and I 'm sorry if today 's recommendation is n't ideally helpful .
However , I think I covered this in the article at choice # 6 , which is why I linked to it at the beginning of today 's article ; the last paragraph of that earlier post addresses your concerns directly .
For the record , I think you did the right thing .
I have a friend named Vitold who is a very successful software designer .
He can afford any camera he wants , but I encouraged him to forego the higher - level models and start with a D60 , and he loves it .
The point is that he is learning his own preferences .
Later , when he goes to purchase a higher - end camera , he will know more about what he likes and wants .
So will you , very likely .
You must understand , too , that part of my motivation here is to counteract some of the prevailing attitudes among shoppers for ~ $ 1 k camera bodies .
The arguments tend to polarize , and people say some pretty ridiculous things sometimes .
This is caused in part by the tendency for discussion forums , and indeed whole sites , to be broken down strictly according to brand .
I think this is a mistake , frankly .
My first experiences on the internet were on the old Compuserve Photo Forum in the early '90s , where the categories were n't organized that way ; although people ribbed each other about each other 's camera choices , brand partisanship was much milder and more collegial and friendlier than it generally is on the internet today .
Today it 's gotten out of hand in some cases .
So the answer to your objections is probably that people coming from point - and - shoots should n't be looking at mid-level cameras .
They should buy a closeout model or an entry level model or a used camera first , and get some experience with a couple of different cameras .
Instead , they typically invest tens or hundreds of hours in " paper " ( now , onscreen ) shopping , and in forging alliances and defining prejudices — all without gathering firsthand data for themselves .
Which I find rather silly , not to mention counterproductive .
The fact is , you really can't make an intelligent , informed choice of ~ $1 k mid-level DSLRs if you 're new to DSLRs entirely , and that 's probably not the best way to proceed anyway .
What you need to do first is to try some different cameras — make " photo - friends " with whom you can swap cameras on a shooting jaunt for a couple of hours ; look into rental options ; certainly , patronize a local store that stocks some of the models you 're interested in .
( A hint : if you take a valuable camera you own into a camera store , you can leave it as " collateral " while you take the store 's demo camera out the front door for a little quick test shooting .
I used to carry my Leica M6 into stores and leave it with the salesman while a took his demo outside for half an hour 's worth of shooting ; they knew I 'd be back .
This allows you to examine some files or negs you shot yourself back at home , at leisure . )
But basically , I 'm assuming here that mid-level cameras will be looked at mainly by people who have already owned SLRs , whether digital or film , and that they wo n't typically be the first step up for people who are just getting into photography and have previously used only camera phones or mass - market digicams .
For those who are making such a big jump , a random choice among leading models probably is as good as anything — they just do n't have a basis for intelligent , informed comparison .
Your second - to - last paragraph above pretty much confirms as much .

Kuwait City 's stock exchange lost 38 % of its value last year
The global economic crisis has cost Arab countries $ 2,500bn ( £ 1,690bn ) in the last four months alone , according to Kuwait 's foreign minister .
Sheikh Mohammed al - Sabah told reporters in Kuwait City that oil - rich Gulf Arab states had postponed or cancelled 60 % of development projects .
He did not give details for his figures , which were released days before an Arab Economic Summit .
Stock market falls and a low oil price have contributed to the losses .
The biggest loss was an estimated 40 % drop in the value of Arab investments abroad , which had previously totalled around $ 2.5tn , AFP news agency reports .
" The Arab world has lost $ 2.5 trillion in the past four months , " Mr Sabah said after meeting fellow foreign and finance ministers .
Kuwait City is due to open a two - day Arab Economic Summit on Monday , the first of its kind .
Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa earlier described the meeting of 22 heads of state as " the largest and most important " Arab event of 2009 .
The diary , channeling the frustrated rantings of has - been regulator William K. Black , accuses the Obama administration of illegal conduct .
Black , who supported the presidential campaign of Barack Obama , excoriated both President Obama , and former President Bush , and their Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Hank Paulson , respectively , for deliberately and consciously violating the law .
Specifically , the Prompt Corrective Action Law , passed after the savings and loan crisis , which mandates that severely undercapitalized banks be promptly put into receivership ( i.e. , nationalized ) .
( emphasis in original , believe it or not )
This is a lie .
Not a reasonable difference of opinion .
A lie .
A material misstatement .
Now , it is true that the diarist got this lie from Black himself , and may have been merely negligent in passing it on :
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Well , certainly in the financial sphere , I am .
I think , first , the policies are substantively bad .
Second , I think they completely lack integrity .
Third , they violate the rule of law .
This is being done just like Secretary Paulson did it .
In violation of the law .
We adopted a law after the Savings and Loan crisis , called the Prompt Corrective Action Law .
And it requires them to close these institutions .
And they 're refusing to obey the law .
BILL MOYERS : In other words , they could have closed these banks without nationalizing them ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Well , you do a receivership .
No one -- Ronald Reagan did receiverships .
Nobody called it nationalization .
BILL MOYERS : And that 's a law ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : That 's the law .
BILL MOYERS : So , Paulson could have done this ?
Geithner could do this ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK : Not could .
Was mandated —
BILL MOYERS :
By the law .
WILLIAM K . BLACK : By the law .
Again , let me repeat .
This is a lie .
And quite a lie it is .
It is a lie on at least two levels .
First , the Prompt Corrective Action ( " PCA " ) law does not give the FDIC ( or OCC or Federal Reserve ) the ability to take over any Bank Holding Company ( " BHC " ) .
BHC's are regulated and governed by the Federal Reserve , pursuant to The Bank Holding Act of 1956 .
The PCA applies to insured depository institutions , i.e. the retail bank operation as opposed to the investment bank and bond trading desk .
Amongst the financial institutions that are thus not subject to the PCA are :
JP Morgan Chase
Citigroup
Bank of America
Wells Fargo
HSBC
Goldman Sachs
Morgan Stanley
And , of course , the PCA also does not apply to AIG , which is an insurance company and not involved in banking at all .
So , pretty much all of the really big players do n't fall under the PCA in the first place .
Their commercial banking subsidiaries very well may , but your local Bank of America branch is not at the root of this crisis .
We can seize the banking units that are n't the problem , but we can't seize the banking units that are the problem .
( See the UPDATE regarding the horror show that could result from plucking a retail bank out of a conglomerate like Citi ) .
And we wo n't even get into the whole problem of international banks like Citi , CSFB , or UBS .
Second , the diary is a blatantly inaccurate because it states an impossibility .
What ?
It claims that Obama is breaking the law by not nationalizing a bunch of banks , when the language of the statute explicitly gives the government considerable discretion in deciding whether to do .
The PCA does not mandate that the FDIC take over any bank .
Incredibly , the diary in question actually links to and quotes the Prompt Corrective Action Act .
TITLE 12 > CHAPTER 16 > § 1831o § 1831o .
Prompt corrective action ( d) Provisions applicable to all institutions
(2) Management fees restricted
An insured depository institution shall pay no management fee to any person having control of that institution if , after making the payment , the institution would be undercapitalized .
SNIP ( 3 ) Conservatorship , receivership , or other action required
(A) In general
The appropriate Federal banking agency shall , not later than 90 days after an insured depository institution becomes critically undercapitalized — ( i ) appoint a receiver ( or , with the concurrence of the Corporation , a conservator ) for the institution ; OR ( ii ) take such other action as the agency determines , with the concurrence of the Corporation , would better achieve the purpose of this section , after documenting why the action would better achieve that purpose .
We generally teach children what the word " or " means during grade school .
If you are told that you need to go left or right , that does not mean that you are mandated to go left .
It is dishonest to pretend otherwise .
And , let us not even get into the fact that there is no indication that the banking units that could be seized -- the retail chartered banks -- are poorly capitalized .
Rather , all indications are that it is the BHC's that got stuck with the toxic assets that are struggling on that end .
And , by the way , the FDIC has been seizing commercial banks , including Washington Mutual when it has determined it to be necessary .
But , for obvious reasons the FDIC has decided that trying to gobble up the entire banking system is neither legal nor wise .
In short , the claim that the Obama administration is breaking the law is a BALD FACED LIE .
It is not being an Obamabot or cultist to point this out .
It is being intelligent , rational , and objective .
It is the fools who automatically believed that Obama is a criminal because of a Daily Kos diary that are behaving irrationally .
UPDATE : Big Tent Democrat misapprehends , or perhaps I have failed to explain , a crucial point .
Let 's step back and take Bank of America as an example .
A great deal of its toxic garbage is concentrated not in its retail and consumer banking divisions , but in its investment banking and securities trading divisions , especially after the acquisition of Merrill Lynch .
In other words , its chartered depository bank is doing just fine and is no danger of missing capitalization requirements .
However , its other divisions are struggling under the weight of the toxic assets and could fail .
But , no one can touch those .
Or , let 's take Citi as an example .
Per Time 's excellent Justin Fox .
Former employees of a packaging firm in Dundee have seized the factory and have started a workers ’ co-operative to run the failed firm themselves .
Incredibly , both business chiefs and socialist die - hards are hailing the move as revolutionary and say similar the worker buy - outs could be the way to stave off mass unemployment during the recession .
The Soviet - style bid to take over the company began last week when staff members at Prisme Packaging were told the business was to cease trading with immediate effect , and that there was no money in the coffers to pay their redundancy .
The 12 disgruntled employees decided to occupy the factory until they were paid .
The group contacted the Big Issue Scotland after their first night at the plant .
Speaking from inside the doors , 25 - year - old employee Matthew Duffield said : “ We ’re very frustrated and we want what we are entitled to by law . ”
During their week - long sit-in , the workers became convinced they could keep the business running .
After consulting Dundee North Law centre , they are now taking legal action to secure their redundancy money and ensure Prisme is dissolved legally .
“ They treated us like second class citizens and wanted to wash their hands of us , ” said employee David Taylor .
“ We were not prepared to accept this .
We ’re not militant people – just little people who refused to be little anymore .
We stood up for what we believe in and we are all proud of that . ”
The Dundee employees have now forged plans to take over the cardboard box - making business as a collective , and begin trading again under a different name .
Some members of staff have worked at the factory for 14 years , and contacted clients to ensure enough business would still be there .
“ We know what we ’re doing and we think we can run it better ourselves , ” said Duffield .
“ We have customers quite willing to come back to us .
It ’s early days , but we ’re confident we can make it work . ”
Duffield said the co-operative was already negotiating to rent the industrial unit warehouse from the existing landlord , and have been give first refusal on the cutting tables and box - making machines by the firm who had leased Prisme equipment .
The Dundonian workers have received supplies from friends and family , and funding from local trade unionists .
Business bodies have hailed their “ entrepreneurial ” ingenuity , oddly in tune with the socialist parties who have also united in praise of the defiant enactment of Marxist principle .
“ It ’s a tale of people getting to the end of their tether and saying we ’re not taking anymore , ” said firebrand socialist and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Tommy Sheridan .
“ They ’ve showed tremendous courage to take the stand they ’ve made .
They ’ve turned their defiance into something positive , and it shows their initiative to take it further and start a cooperative .
They may not have realised it , but they ’ve planted a flag for socialism and worker ’s control . ”
A spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses said : “ It is a viable way forward for people .
It shows there are opportunities for the entrepreneurial spirit even as businesses collapse this year .
Anything that helps save jobs and keeps places open can only be a good thing . ”
Dundee MP and SNP deputy leader in the Commons Stewart Hosie is also excited .
“ I am delighted that they have taken it upon themselves to start a phoenix company which will benefit from their experience and their years of working together .
They are doing all the right things to make this business work as a co-operative . ”
The Dundee start - up comes in the same week as one woman in Dorset re-opened the Woolworths branch she worked in before the company ’s collapse .
Claire Robertson , 34 , who had been with the firm for 18 years since starting as a Saturday girl , re-launched the popular Dorchester branch as Wellworths .
She has promised to keep the famous Pick ‘ n ’
Mix selection , and hopes the shop will become known as Wellies .
None of the management from Prisme Packaging were returning calls for comment .

The government plans to spend £ 2bn for ISPs to intercept details of their customers ' emails , VoIP calls , instant messaging and social networking .
Under the proposals , mobile and fixed line operators will be required to process and link the data together to build complete profiles of every UK internet user 's online activity .
Police and the intelligence services would then access the profiles , which will be stored for 12 months , on a case - by - case basis .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said today she had " ruled out " the idea of a central government - run store of communications data on privacy grounds .
Instead , the consultation on the Interception Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) proposes a " middle way " requiring ISPs to retain much more data than they currently do .
Most of the proposed 10 - year budget for the system would be spent on deep packet inpection equipment that would allow ISPs to tap into third party communciations data carried by their networks .
Authorities are worried that the growth of internet - based communications services such as Skype diminishes their ability to monitor who contacts whom , when , where and how .
" This option would resolve the problem that some communications data which may be important to public authorities will not otherwise be retained in this country , " the IMP consultation document says .
" However it would not address the problem of fragmentation : as data is increasingly held by a wider range of communications service providers , it might take longer than it does at present to piece together data from different companies relating to one person or communications device . "
In response to such fragmentation , the government plans to order ISPs to " not only to collect and store data but to organise it , matching third party data to their own data where it had features in common " .
The plan is likely to be seen as onerous by ISPs .
According to one senior industry source , many in the industry hope the next government will abandon it .
" I do n't know anyone in the communications sector that will be sorry if IMP gets cancelled the day after the election , " the source said .
" I agree that what we 're asking the industry to do is something that will put a burden on them , " Smith said at today 's IMP briefing for journalists .
She said providers will be refunded the cost of collecting and processing the data by the government .
By tapping ISPs to collect and process communications data from across the whole internet , officials will avoid opposition to the plans from websites and other third party services .
Facebook recently voiced opposition to government monitoring of its users , but when the data is intercepted in transit , it will have no choice .
Intelligence and security agencies already have close relationships with ISPs .
The IMP consultation will run for 12 weeks .

Dave Cooper ’s pet mantis , Cinco Zapatos , was a good - looking Giant African Mantis with a notable distinguishing feature : her sixth leg was missing .
It did n’t seem to hamper her much .
Her first weeks as Dave ’s insect familiar were uneventful until Dave returned from a three - day trip to find that Cinco Zapatos had molted — and had become Seis Zapatos in the process .
Cinco Zapatos had regrown most of her leg .
Though it ’s a shock for us to witness , the loss and regain of a limb is no big deal to a young insect .
Bugs lose legs and antennae in fights , flights , accidents , or even a botched molt .
After a few weeks of limping , a new leg appears in the span of an afternoon .
Insects retain the pathways required for cells to differentiate and reorganize at a wound site , an ability that humans have nearly lost .

In the weeks leading up to her molt , the tissue below Cinco Zapatos ’ injured stump was quietly preparing for the fireworks .
A blastema , which is a layer of progenitor cells , formed under the wound to rally and reorganize cells into the form of a new leg .
The blastema cells are n’t stem cells that have never been differentiated ; they are local cells that have de-differentiated themselves in order to serve a new function in the regenerated limb .
The cells of the blastema reorder themselves into all of the necessary tissues to create a new articulated limb , which is formed as a folded structure inside the injured stump .
Cinco Zapatos ’ new leg burst forth when her molt opened the old exoskeleton that contained it .
Many insect appendages are structurally primed for a quick interchange .
On predetermined planes of autotomy within the insect leg , most of the living tissue terminates .
This leaves a small weak area gap with nothing but a muscle , a bit of nerve , and some brittle exoskeleton -- a perfect place for crack initiation .
An insect ’s leg is built to break on this plane in order to escape predators .
Within the next 30 hours , the severed muscle degrades , and the regeneration begins .
Mantids have a convenient plane of autotomy right between their trochanter and their femur .
But even mantids like Cinco Zapatos , who lose a rear limb at some less favorable amputation point , can grow a new one .
The process is simply slower , and the new leg may be a cruder approximation of its predecessor .
For example , the mantid ’s two thick prey - pinching forelimbs have no plane of autotomy ; in contrast to the spindly and replaceable walking legs , the complex forelimbs are n’t intended to be disposable .
When a reckless young mantid loses its forelimb between the femur and trochanter , a smaller , less complex copy will regenerate .
These mantids are lucky .
Older mantids who lose the same limb segment later in life do n’t generate much of a replacement .
The loss is usually fatal .
The poor forelimb regeneration prognosis underscores some regeneration rules of thumb — an insect can grow back appendages most successfully if the amputated portion is uncomplicated and the insect is young .
Surprisingly , these rules are true for a human as well .
Though we do n’t think of ourselves as regenerators , humans have a latent ability to grow back just a bit of complex limb structure .
Last year Lee Spievack became famous for regrowing a segment of his finger thanks to magical pig extract powder ; however , injured children under the age of 12 do this regularly without the help of pulverized pork .
As long as their outermost finger joint remains intact , the suggestible cells of children are willing to differentiate into the skin , flesh , bone , and fingernail of a brand new fingertip , shorter than a Giant Mantis leg but no less complex .

According to reports , President Barack Obama plans to convene his Cabinet for the first time today , where he will order members to identify a combined $ 100 million in budget cuts over the next 90 days .
Just how laughable is Obama ’s latest stunt to try to maintain his “ fiscal responsibility ” credentials ?

Thanks to some generous contributions , there now exist well - designed web sites for two projects of mine : Processing.js and Sizzle.js .
Processing.js was released almost a year ago ( May 8th of last year ) and it finally has an official web site .
At this point the project is being primarily maintained by Alistair MacDonald ( on Twitter ) with active discussions taking place on the Processing .js Google Group .
On the new site you can see an an exhibition of cool Processing .js code , a full API reference , and a number of demos from the Processing .org site .
I especially like the fact that the header of the site is a live Processing .js demo .
Thanks Alistair for the great site !

Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys has influence with Somali Islamist groups Islamist opposition leader Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys has returned to Somalia after two years in exile .
He fled to Eritrea in 2007 after Ethiopian troops ousted his movement , the Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) .
While in Eritrea , Mr Aweys broke ranks with fellow UIC leader Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , now Somali president .
The US has labelled Mr Aweys a terrorist , but analysts say his return could help stabilise the country 's fledgling government .
Mr Aweys flew into the Somali capital , Mogadishu , early on Thursday - an unpublicised and low - key return from exile for one the country 's most influential conservative clerics , the BBC's East Africa correspondent Peter Greste said .
" [ Aweys ] will be staying with us , and we shall be having discussions on the current political situation in Somalia , " Omar Abubukar , leader of Hizb al - Islamiya , an allied political party , said on Thursday .
Constant conflict Mr Aweys and Mr Ahmed both headed the UIC , which ruled most of the country for the second half of 2006 .
They fled to the Eritrean capital Asmara , where they formed the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia ( ARS ) .
The two men split after Mr Ahmed - considered the more moderate of the two - agreed to UN - led talks with the government that brought him to power in January 2009 and saw Ethiopia withdraw its troops .
Mr Aweys accused Mr Ahmed of siding with the enemy , and last July declared he had taken control of the ARS .
Mr Aweys is an influential leader of one of Mogadishu 's most powerful clans , so his arrival in the capital suggests that relations between the two men has improved and some kind of agreement is one the table , our correspondent says .
If that is the case , it could significantly improve security in the capital , and give the government a badly needed boost of authority , he adds .
Radical Islamist guerrillas such as al - Shabab , which control parts of Mogadishu and much of central and southern Somalia , have sworn to topple the fragile government .
Somalia , a nation of about eight million people , has experienced almost constant civil conflict since the collapse of Mohamed Siad Barre 's regime in January 1991 .
Sheikh Aweys is on a US most - wanted list of suspected terrorists with links to al - Qaeda .

Lee Odden is the CEO of TopRank Online Marketing and editor at Online Marketing Blog .
Now more than ever , company marketers are charged with improving performance with fewer resources and shifting marketing budgets from traditional to digital tactics like SEO and social media .
There are significant benefits from combining search engine optimization and social media marketing tactics ranging from increased social network discovery via search to the ability to attract links for improved SEO .
Making the most out of combining SEO insights with social media marketing tactics can be accomplished with a roadmap that identifies the audience you ’re after , the goals you ’re trying to reach ( and can measure ) as well as a strategy that sets the stage for the tactics you ’ll use to execute your game plan .
Read on to get a better understanding of how SEO and social media complement each other and a step by step guide for creating a social media roadmap .
The benefits of SEO and social media
From a marketing standpoint , you can look at the benefits of SEO and social media two different ways .
First , implementing a social media marketing program without optimizing content is leaving money on the table .
Useful social content ( blog , video , images , audio ) that cannot be discovered via search is a lost opportunity to reach an audience that is looking .
For example , The Student LoanDown , the popular blog about student loans and college financing from Wells Fargo , identifies 29 keywords in its Keyword Meta Tag and does n’t rank in Google ’s first page for 26 of them .
Those that do rank are variations of the blog ’s name .
While there is a generous amount of cross linking within posts , a basic blog template optimization effort leveraging keywords and other minor adjustments could improve search traffic for this site substantially – without any compromise in content quality or user experience .
Social interactions and media sharing amongst social network participants create the kind of content that can improve a brand ’s visibility within search results through profiles , videos , blog posts , or other media .
A good example is Stormhoek wines ’ first page Google rankings including blogs , Facebook and Twitter .
On the flip side , implementing SEO programs without leveraging the content distribution and linking benefits of social web participation makes link building for SEO an uphill battle .
The nature of the social web encourages participation : sharing , voting , commenting and linking .
Popular social content gets exposure , traffic and can result in a substantial number of relevant inbound links .
The famous Blendtec iPhone video has attracted over 6,000 links resulting in a top ten ranking on Google for the word , “ blender . ”
Content + Links = Search Engine Success .
Social media roadmap
However you look at it , SEO and social media work well together as long as there is a framework for doing so .
One way to build SEO and social media programs efficiently is to follow a social media roadmap :
1 . Find the audience ; understand their behaviors , preferences , methods of publishing , and sharing .
Most companies that are involved with the social web in the channels where their customers spend time have a good sense of where to start .
Many companies are ahead of the game by tracking their audience via social media monitoring software that identifies keywords , conversations and influencers such as those pictured in the Radian6 screen shot below .
2. Define your objectives .
Objectives are often driven by marketing or sales , and SEO has long been directly accountable to substantial improvements in web sales .
Social media is not direct marketing though , so different objectives and measurements apply .
The role of SEO in a social media effort is to directly influence discovery of social communities or content via search .
Do a search for Zappos on Google , for example , and you ’ll easily find more than shoes : Twitter , Blog and a YouTube channel are all on the first page of search results .
Indirectly , social content can boost links to website content , improving search traffic and online sales .
3. Establish a game plan .
The game plan for reaching objectives in a combined SEO and social media effort will often focus on content and interaction , since it is content that people discover and share .
Whether a keyword - focused strategy for reaching goals means publishing new content or creating an opportunity for consumer - generated content , it must involve proactive promotion and easy sharing amongst members of the community .
4. Create a tactical mix .
The tactical mix for a social media marketing effort is based on doing the homework of finding where the desired audience spends its time interacting with and sharing content .
Whatever the tactical mix is , it ’s an investment in time and relationships – not a short term “ link dump ” to promote optimized link bait .
Much of the content creation and promotion for a social media marketing effort happens within the tactical mix and , of course , that means optimizing content for keywords .
Whether content is created by marketers as part of a social destination like a niche community or a promotion vehicle such as an interactive ad , keyword glossaries become useful for writing headlines , deciding on anchor text for links and outreach activities like blogger relations .
5 . Measure your goals .
Goals measurement should roll up to the specific objectives , both direct and indirect .
Leveraging both social media monitoring services as well as web analytics can provide marketers with the insight to improve results .
Radian6 and Webtrends have recently announced a partnership that will bring web analytics and social media analytics together all in one interface .
In the meantime , marketers can use specific measurement tools to monitor the effect of their social web participation as well as the search engine performance of SEO efforts .
Extend the value of your investment
By involving SEO insight in a social media marketing effort and vice versa , marketers , public relations professionals and advertisers can extend the value of their investment .
Well optimized social media content marketing efforts can attract new network participants via search .
News content that experiences distribution via social news and bookmarking channels can facilitate links to company website content directly and indirectly .
Advertisers that fund social media campaigns can continue to realize the traffic benefit from keyword - optimized interactive content long after the campaign has ended .

TS Jesse in In Bed With Jesse
In Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain 's epic history of American punk , Please Kill Me , Iggy Pop protests that his memory fails him when it comes to his activities in the 70s , an inevitable side effect of his legendary personal regimen during the era : " I did n't go home at night and write this stuff down , like , ' Dear Diary ... ' " he says .
He certainly seems to be having difficulty remembering a story from the mid-70s now .
" I think , " he drawls , down the phone from Miami , " I 'd shot some very bad skag and woke up in a bedsit in a rather undistinguished neighbourhood , with no idea how to get back to W1 .
I was looking for a tube entrance , rather stumbling and struggling and I met some chaps who told me they had some sort of group called the Brighton Port Authority .
I may have sung for them for subway fare .
I know I 've never gotten a fucking penny from it .
I think one of them was the guy from the Housemartins , but I do n't remember much more about it . "
This time , however , the problem is less his Herculean drug intake of the time than the fact that he 's making up the story on the spot .
If you believe the advance publicity , the Brighton Port Authority 's album , I Think We 're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat , is a collection of previously unheard recordings by a mythic Brighton musical collective that existed between the early 1970s and early 90s , and boasted a selection of special guests ranging from Iggy to Martha Wainwright to Dizzee Rascal to David Byrne .
But you should n't believe the advance publicity .
The BPA 's debut album is a collection of collaborations between Norman Cook and various friends , recorded in Cook 's home studio and then " completely forgotten about " .
" I 'd find myself looking at tape boxes , " says Cook , " going , ' Martha Wainwright ?
I did a tune with her ? '
She could n't remember it either .
You know , time passes , alcohol was involved .
It 's all a bit sketchy . "
The story of the BPA was made up to cover " the bits we do n't remember " , says Cook .
But , sitting in the living room of what Iggy Pop describes , not inaccurately , as his " very English , very understated palatial pad " , he seems unsure whether to keep up the pretence .
On the one hand , influenced by his friend Damon Albarn 's Gorillaz project , he has put a lot of effort into constructing the BPA story - there are fake BPA photos and flyers for a gig with the Clash and Roxy Music , and YouTube films .
On the other , Cook seems almost pathologically predisposed to tell the truth in interviews : as he has often noted , his candour , not least on the subject of his enthusiasm for drugs , became something of a problem when he married TV presenter Zoë Ball .
In any case , the true story of how he actually encountered Iggy Pop is n't much less exotic than the official version .
They met while Cook was DJing in Miami , " in one of these really silly clubs to which I want you to understand I never go " , chuckles Iggy Pop .
" I 'm not an aficionado of boom - tish - boom - tish - boom - tish music , but I was single at the time and I heard a lot of chicks go to these places . "
He has a long and complicated story about being taken there by an out - of - work Las Vegas stripper and a starstruck French girl ( " ' Mon Dieu ! ' she said .
' It 's Iggy Pop ! Sacré bleu ! ' " ) who attempted to impress him with her chemical arsenal : " She opened up the double breast of her trenchcoat and she had the entire inside lined with specially designed drug pockets .
It was like a tradesman 's toolkit .
She had it all !
That scared me , so I ended up just listening to Norman in his Hawaiian shirt . "
For his part , Cook says their friendship swiftly became physical : " I gave him a big hug , and the next thing I know , there 's tongues involved .
The next day , I phoned up Zoë and went , ' I snogged Iggy Pop on stage last night ' .
It 's that kind of relationship we 've had for a long time . "
And , as seems to be the case with everyone who makes Cook 's acquaintance , Iggy Pop eventually ended up as a house guest in Hove .
( " The weird thing is , " Cook recalls , " he 'll tell you all these tales about doing smack and that , but he 's the perfect guest , very quiet and polite . " )
And , as seems to be the case with everyone who ends up as a house guest in Hove , Iggy wound up drunk , in the recording studio next to the living room : " Most people are into doing it , but sometimes I have to give them Rohypnol and drag them in there , " Cook guffaws , " and date - tape them . "
Now well into his 40s , Cook remains a firm believer in working while under the influence .
Fatboy Slim 's greatest hits were famously recorded on Sunday evenings , after a weekend of partying , " to avoid the comedown " .
For the benefit of anyone who might doubt the efficacy of such a working method , Cook is keen to point out that in a period of about three weeks , he came up with every one of the tracks that made him a household name : " Rockafeller Skank , Praise You , Right Here Right Now , the remixes of Brimful of Asha and Renegade Master by Wildchild .
It was like bam - bam - bam , like lightning striking , I was on fire .
I still hear those songs all the time , and in the right environments .
I was watching the Superbowl the other night and the teams came out to Right Here Right Now .
You know , it 's not like I did a tune about dogs and so when there 's a thing about a lost dog on the local news it always gets played in the background . "
Perhaps understandably , he sees no reason to take recording sessions more seriously now .
" A whole part of the process is being freed up from constraints , and here there 's no constraints whatsoever , apart from the fact that at some point , everybody has to go home .
It 's nice to go a bit free - form .
It stops you thinking , ' Oh God , it 's me and Martha Wainwright , or me and Iggy Pop , what will people 's expectations be ? ' "
Nevertheless , there are drawbacks to this approach .
" You do end up with quite a lot of twaddle , a lot of self - indulgent ranting , extended jams . "
These have been ruthlessly excised from the BPA album : whatever accusations you may want to throw at Norman Cook , you could never accuse him of musical self - indulgence or lacking a keen pop sensibility .
He has recently been playing a homemade remix of Arcade Fire 's No Cars Go , he says : " It was Zoë 's idea , but I thought it sounded a bit like Big Country or something , so I took all the boring bits out . "
By boring bits , Cook means everything except the song 's chorus .
You could argue that 's a wilfully shallow approach to music , although it 's worth noting that Cook credits his longevity as a DJ and producer to a certain wilful shallowness .
For someone who 's managed to translate his fabled affability into an entire album , Cook cuts an oddly solitary figure in Dom Phillips 's new history of 90s dance music , Superstar DJs : Here We Go ! - not least because he's the only one of the superstar DJs who still seems to be enjoying himself , in contrast with , say , Radio 1's leathery king of dance Pete Tong , still joylessly playing the clubs at nearly 50 , even though he considers DJing " the ultimate glorified manual labour " .
Cook seems to have emerged from the druggy hubris and chaos detailed in Phillips 's book with not just his career , but also his dignity , intact .
His eyes narrow a bit at the mention of the word " dignity " .
" I agree with you that I 'm still enjoying it , but I think it 's because I never did it with dignity .
I think the superstar DJs who have fallen from grace are the ones who thought that there was dignity in what they were doing , perhaps took themselves seriously just for a second .
We 're not artists .
We 're not creating art , we 're creating a party .
You have to remember it's all about the party , it 's not about you .
If you do n't take yourself seriously , there 's nowhere to fall . "
Other DJs used to get " really pissed off " about his self - effacing attitude , he says , not least when he told a journalist that " a monkey " could make his records .
" I remember Tom and Ed from the Chemical Brothers going , ' Actually , we really believe in what we do . '
Well , I believe in what I do , but the art of it is not to believe that it 's anything more than what it is . "
Accordingly , getting Cook to admit to any kind of serious intent behind his music is a tricky task .
Nevertheless , there does seem to be something a little more weighty behind the BPA and its attendant story than just a record of a drunk producer mucking about with his famous friends and making stuff up for the press .
The last Fatboy Slim album , 2004 's Palookaville , sold substantially fewer copies than its multi-platinum predecessors .
Cook thinks that might be because " a lot of Palookaville was quite obscure , at least by my standards .
It was as close as Fatboy Slim would ever come to Kid A . "
He laughs uproariously .
" Which is obviously not that close . "
The truth may be that it sounded like an album made by a man who was sick of being Fatboy Slim , at least in the studio .
The best moments were those that least resembled his earlier work .
Today , he is at pains to point out that he's not retiring the Fatboy Slim name that keeps selling out beach parties around the world , but admits he has enjoyed working " outside the confines of club music " , creating a new pseudonym to add to his lengthy collection : Pizzaman , the Mighty Dub Kats , Fried Funk Food , Freakpower .
" There is a chance that Fatboy Slim might not make any more records , " he says carefully , " but as a DJ , I 'm doing bigger and bigger shows and having more and more fun .
Rumours of Fatboy Slim 's demise have been exaggerated . "
He reels off a list of parties Fatboy Slim is set to play in Japan , Australia , eastern Europe .
" There are times when I think , ' Please make it stop . '
I know it seems like the best thing in the world , and I know I wanted it all my life , but there 's no off switch . "
Actually , he says , that 's one of the good things about Palookaville 's relative commercial failure .
" I was quite happy to take my foot off the gas for a bit .
And the tabloids leave us alone now .
I came out of Radio 1 yesterday and there was a paparazzo , and he looked at me as if to say , ' Yeah , I know who you are and I 'm not going to even bother raising my camera , ' which was really nice , really liberating . "
He grins .
" I 'm very happy that some people do n't give a toss any more . "
“ Even people who have money to spend are feeling somewhat a sense of guilt in spending money when reading and hearing of difficult times for so many other people , ” said Edward Piegza , president of Classic Journeys , a tour operator based in La Jolla , Calif .
“ But if they can see their spending is actually having a positive impact in some way , they are more able to justify to themselves that their travel is doing good . ”
IN January , Jill Stanley , a retired personal assistant from Washington , took a 12 - day Conservation Safari , operated by Abercrombie & Kent as part of its Philanthropic Journeys program .
The trip demonstrated joint charity work the company has done with Friends of Conservation , an environmental organization that works with locals to develop sustainable ways of living in harmony with nature .
“ We did the safari thing , ” she said , “ but they also took you around to see what A & K and the F.O.C. had done to help the area . ”
On the trip , which cost about $ 10,800 a person , Ms. Stanley visited an orphanage for children whose parents had died of AIDS and spent time with a Masai village and learned about reforestation efforts in the region .
“ It made me feel good that we were able to plant trees or give in our name for somebody in the Masai Mara , ” she said .
“ It ’s much more rewarding than going and sitting on the beach . ”
Companies offering more affordable volunteer vacations report that bookings for do - good trips have n’t dropped as much this year as those for more traditional vacation packages .
Sierra Club Outings , which offers a series of “ service ” trips in which volunteers can help eradicate invasive plants in Channel Islands National Park in California ( $ 695 ) or maintain trails in the Red River Gorge in Kentucky ( $ 375 ) , said its domestic trips were down by 16 percent for the first three months of the year overall , compared with the same period last year .
But service - trip bookings were down just 9 percent .
In some cases , volunteer vacations have even been growing .
Projects Abroad , which runs volunteer programs overseas , said bookings were up 20 percent this February from February 2008 , with some of the travelers recently laid off but others simply looking for vacations that involve service .
Options range from teaching soccer in Moldova for two weeks ( $ 1,795 ) to teaching English in Nepal for three months ( $ 3,295 ) .
The personal rantings of Seraphina Brennan on life , MMOs , and games
But why can't we leave them to it , and focus on the so - called creative and service industries ?
Because they cannot bring the prosperity we need .
Nine of the world 's 10 biggest corporations make tangible goods , whether they are cars , turbines , computers or consumer electronics .
Of the world 's 20 most profitable companies , three are in services .
Although British firms increased research and development spending by 7 per cent in 2007 , the increase was largely in oil and gas production , software and computer services , pharmaceuticals and banking .
We need more research that results in exportable , patented goods .

His new book , " Arsenal of Democracy : The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism , " will be published this fall by Basic Books .
Zelizer writes widely on current events .
Julian Zelizer says Republicans talk small government in theory but do n't practice it in power .
PRINCETON , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
As the budget debate heats up , Republicans are warning of socialism in the White House and claiming that Democrats are rushing back to their dangerous tonic of big government .
Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference , Rush Limbaugh warned that " the future is not Big Government .
Self - serving politicians .
Powerful bureaucrats .
This has been tried , tested throughout history .
The result has always been disaster . "
On CNN , former Vice President Dick Cheney said he is worried that the administration is using the current economic conditions to " justify " a " massive expansion " in the government .
After the past eight years in American politics , it is impossible to reconcile current promises by conservatives for small government with the historical record of President Bush 's administration .
Most experts on the left and right can find one issue upon which to agree :
The federal government expanded significantly after 2001 when George W. Bush was in the White House .
The growth did not just take place with national security spending but with domestic programs as well .
Even as the administration fought to reduce the cost of certain programs by preventing cost - of - living increases in benefits , in many other areas of policy -- such as Medicare prescription drug benefits , federal education standards and agricultural subsidies -- the federal government expanded by leaps and bounds .
And then there are the costs of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Federal spending stood at about $ 1.9 trillion in 2000 , when Democrat Bill Clinton ended his presidency .
In his final year in office , Bush proposed to spend $ 3.1 trillion for fiscal year 2009 .
President Obama 's budget proposal for fiscal 2010 is $ 3.6 trillion .
Nor can Republicans blame a Democratic Congress for being responsible for these trends .
Much of the expansion took place between 2002 and 2006 , when Republicans controlled both Congress and the White House .
The Weekly Standard 's Fred Barnes was writing about " big government conservatism " back in 2003 .
Two years later , the right - wing CATO Institute published a report noting that total government spending had grown by 33 percent in President Bush 's first term , lamenting that " President Bush has presided over the largest overall increase in inflation - adjusted federal spending since Lyndon B. Johnson . "
There were some areas where Bush backed off government cuts because programs were too popular , like Social Security .
In other areas , like federal education policy and prescription drug benefits , the president seemed enthusiastic about bigger government .
Bush and Cheney also embraced a vision of presidential power that revolved around a largely unregulated and centralized executive branch with massive authority over the citizenry .
This was a far cry from the days of Ohio Sen .
Robert Taft , a Republican who constantly warned about the dangers of presidential power to America 's liberties .
After the 2008 election , Cheney was not apologetic .
He explained that " the president believes , I believe very deeply , in a strong executive , and I think that 's essential in this day and age .
And I think the Obama administration is not likely to cede that authority back to the Congress .
I think they 'll find that given a challenge they face , they 'll need all the authority they can muster . "
Importantly , the marriage between conservatism and a robust federal government was not unique to the Bush presidency .
The roots of Bush 's comfort with government can be traced to the Republican Right in the 1950s , members of Congress who called for an aggressive response to domestic and international communism .
Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon were two Republicans who pragmatically accepted that Americans had come to expect that the federal government would protect against certain risks and that trying to reverse politics to the pre-New Deal period would be politically suicidal .
" Should any political party , " Eisenhower said , " attempt to abolish Social Security , unemployment insurance , and eliminate labor laws and farm programs , you would not hear of that party again in our political history . "
When Nixon and congressional Republicans battled with Democrats over Social Security between 1970 and 1972 , the debate revolved over how much to expand the program .
Congressional Democrats wanted to increase benefits through the legislative process , while Nixon wanted to index benefits so they automatically increased with inflation .
Nixon and Congress did both .
President Reagan backed off his most ambitious efforts to cut government , most dramatically when he abandoned his proposal to curtail Social Security after facing a fierce backlash , while the military budget boomed .
President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities
Act in 1990 , which was one of the boldest regulatory expansions of government since the civil rights laws of the 1960s .
All of these presidents , particularly Nixon and Reagan , likewise promoted a muscular vision of presidential power that strengthened the authority of government and introduced concepts , such as the unitary executive , which would become the intellectual underpinning of the Bush administration .
" When the president does it , that means that it is not illegal , " Nixon told David Frost in 1977 .
Like it or not , strengthening the presidency is one of the most important ways in which the role of government has grown since the nation 's founding .
Fifty years of American history have shown that even the party that traditionally advocates small government on the campaign trail opts for big government when it gets into power .
The rhetoric of small government has helped Republicans attract some support in the past , but it is hard to take such rhetoric seriously given the historical record -- and it is a now a question whether this rhetoric is even appealing since many Americans want government to help them cope with the current crisis .

Suit : Torture began before Bush administration sanctioned it RAW STORY

Print This Email This Detainee 's lawyer claims U.S. interrogators applied pepper spray to prisoner 's hemorrhoids
A man imprisoned after Sept. 11 , 2001 , as a suspected terrorist was tortured in numerous secret CIA prisons before Bush administration memos allowing the practice had even been written , according to a lawsuit filed in a Newark federal court on Thursday .
" Beginning in December 2001 , [ Rafiq ] Alhami was tortured repeatedly , the lawsuit claims , " reported the Associated Press .
" The methods were varied :
At different times Alhami was stripped naked , threatened with dogs , shackled in painful ' stress ' positions for hours , punched , kicked and exposed to extremes of heat and cold .
The suit also alleges Alhami 's interrogators sprayed pepper spray on his hemorrhoids , causing extreme pain . "
The torture continued after Alhami was transferred to the U.S. Naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in January 2003 , where he currently is held , according to the suit .
" His lawyer , Joshua Denbeaux , said he believed Alhami is the first person to accuse U.S. officials of torture before the Justice Department issued a 2002 memo approving controversial interrogation tactics , " reported the New Jersey Star - Ledger .
" The suit names the Defense Department and more than 20 current and former military officials , including former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
It seeks $ 10 million in damages . "
The suit also names former CIA Director George Tenet and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates .
" ' Rafiq was tortured before the memos authorizing torture were written , ' Denbeaux said , " according to the Ledger .
" Alhami has denied being a member of a terrorist group , and claims he was arrested based on information provided to the Iranian government by an Iranian citizen seeking a bounty , " reported CBS .
" According to the lawsuit , sometime within the last 18 months Alhami was convicted in absentia in Tunisia for violating that country 's Patriot Act , despite the act being passed in 2003 , two years after he was detained by the U.S. "

Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
Few eyebrows would have been raised at the sight of Sir Victor Blank , the larger - than - life chairman of the Lloyds Banking Group , deep in convivial conversation with the prime minister at an exclusive City dinner in London 's St James's .
But that meeting between the two men last September has become infamous as the moment when the deal was sealed for Lloyds to buy the troubled HBOS , a merger that suited both sides at the time - allowing Blank to complete a deal he had been trying to set up for two years and Gordon Brown to avert the looming collapse of a high street bank which could have wrecked confidence in the British financial system .
Six months later , there is a private acceptance even within government that the deal may have been an enormously expensive mistake and that the billions of pounds worth of bad assets against which Lloyds finally insured itself yesterday appear increasingly toxic - not just to the City , but to Brown himself .
Government insiders insist it is nonsense to suggest , as one put it , that the deal was cooked up in a panic during a " cocktail party conversation " .
The two banks had been circling each other for months before the crisis gave Lloyds a chance to pounce , and Blank and Brown had discussed the merger at least once before in July on a flight back from a trade delegation trip to Tel Aviv .
But it was the government that made the deal possible last September , by waiving competition rules .
At the time , Downing Street seemed keen to highlight its involvement in saving a major bank from ruin .
Now , as it emerges that more than four in every five pounds worth of bad loans put into the insurance scheme by the new Lloyds superbank came from HBOS , there will be calls for a more detailed inquiry into how closely Brown was involved in a deal that may have hobbled the black horse .
Stephen Timms , the treasury minister , yesterday admitted that the government was n't " passive , in the sense that we were very anxious to ensure that HBOS did n't collapse " , although he insisted that the prime minister had not pushed the Lloyds board into anything .
" We took the view at the time , given the difficulties that HBOS was heading into , that it was right to waive the competition rules and allow the merger to go ahead , " he told BBC Radio Four 's Today programme .
The scale of the toxic loans covered under the scheme has , however , shocked City insiders , particularly the £ 151bn of commercial and leveraged loans - much of it issued by former HBOS executive Peter Cummings .
Under Cummings , HBOS became the UK's biggest commercial real estate lender , backing deals fronted by the likes of Sir Tom Hunter - the Scottish tycoon who snapped up some of the country 's biggest housebuilders at the peak of the market .
Many of these loans have become worthless as land and house prices have shrivelled .
The £ 74bn of residential mortgages injected also reflects the number made at high loan - to - value ratios , raising fresh questions over HBOS 's lending policy .
Treasury insiders say the reason why yesterday 's deal took a week longer than expected to negotiate was because Lloyds chief executive Eric Daniels was determined to keep the government 's shareholding below 50 % .
That he could not may be a signal that he could quit .
The more pressing question , however , for ordinary homeowners and employees needing loans will be the degree of operational independence that the newly insured Lloyds Banking Group - and any other bank helped through the toxic assets insurance scheme - will enjoy .
Can a bank that is 65 % owned by the taxpayer really operate at arm 's length , or will politicians inevitably pull the strings now so much taxpayers ' money is at risk ?
Treasury sources insisted yesterday that the bank would be run as a commercial concern and that ministers would not get involved in who should be on the board , despite widespread expectations in the City that either or both Daniels and Blank will go .
John Redwood , the Tory MP and former merchant banker , said the government now had a clear responsibility to intervene .
" If you are the owner of something that large and that risky , then you hire the people who run it and you tell them what you want them to do . "
He was backed by Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman , who said it " must be right that when so much taxpayers ' money is being used to save this bank that there is effective public control . "
Although the Treasury insisted on Lloyds agreeing to issue £ 28bn of lending over two years as a condition of getting help , the bank will make its own lending decisions .
However , ministers now risk being dragged directly into controversial lending decisions and held accountable for any resulting job losses , with casualties of the recession likely to lobby politicians directly for help from taxpayer - controlled banks .
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , called for a full parliamentary statement on the deal and last Thursday 's historic decision to begin so - called quantitative easing - creating more money to be injected into the economy .
" It is shocking that the government has not been prepared to subject either of these huge decisions to proper parliamentary scrutiny , " he said .
Today the Malaysian government ordered prominent webhosting provider Shinjiru to close down BitTorrent site LeechersLair.com .
The order came from the Content , Consumer and Network Security Division of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission .
It has n’t been a very good week for BitTorrent trackers , and all the signs are it ’s going to get worse .
We all know what happened last Friday and yesterday only brought more bad news , as many more trackers in Sweden decided to close .
This morning TorrentFreak was informed of the closure of another long - standing BitTorrent tracker .
Although it does n’t have the profile of sites like The Pirate Bay , LeechersLair ( LL ) is a well - established tracker .
Launched in 2006 , LL has around 18,000 members who enjoy all the usual content .
Until today the site was hosted in Malaysia – not any more .
This morning the Content , Consumer and Network Security Division of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission ( SKMM ) ordered Shinjiru , LeechersLair ’s host , to close down the site , citing a breach of Section 41 of the Copyright Act 1987 .
SKMM is a government body which enforces the communications and multimedia laws in Malaysia .
It informed Shinjiru by faxed letter that if it failed to close LeechersLair , it would be breaking the law .
Shinjiru immediately complied and took the site offline .
The government of Malaysia has moved against torrent sites hosted by Shinjiru before , as we reported back in June 2008 , but most of them returned elsewhere .
However , there was a worrying development when one of the sysops of another torrent site , tbkresources.org – also hosted at Shinjiru , told Torrent Freak that a hard drive had been attached to their server and it was copying data for use in a copyright infringement case against them .
Shinjiru confirmed the report .
At this stage it is unclear if LeechersLair will return , but we will update this post when we have more information .
In the meantime other trackers hosted by Shinjiru continue to operate but whether or not they are being monitored is anyone ’s guess .
Both Shinjiru and the Malaysian government were given the opportunity to comment , but as yet we ’ve received no response .
CHICAGO - A striking new study says almost one in five American 4 - year - olds is obese , and the rate is alarmingly higher among American Indian children , with nearly one - third of them obese .
Researchers were surprised to see differences by race at such an early age .
Overall , more than 500,000 4 - year - olds are obese , the study suggests .
Obesity is more common in Hispanic and black youngsters , too , but the disparity is most startling in American Indians , whose rate is almost double that of whites .
The lead author said rate is worrisome among children so young , even in a population at higher risk for obesity because of other health problems and economic disadvantages .
" The magnitude of these differences was larger than we expected , and it is surprising to see differences by racial groups present so early in childhood , " said Sarah Anderson , an Ohio State University public health researcher .
She conducted the research with Temple University 's Dr. Robert Whitaker .
Dr. Glenn Flores , a professor of pediatrics and public health at University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas , said " the cumulative evidence is alarming . "
Without intervention , the next generation " will be at very high risk " for heart disease , high blood pressure , cancers , joint diseases , and other problems connected with obesity , said Flores , who was not involved in the new research .
The study analyzed nationally representative height and weight data on 8,550 preschoolers born in 2001 .
Children were measured in their homes and were part of a study conducted by the government 's National Center on Education Statistics .
The results appear in yesterday 's edition of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine .
Almost 13 percent of Asian children were obese , along with 16 percent of whites , almost 21 percent of blacks , 22 percent of Hispanics , and 31 percent of American Indians .
Children were considered obese if their body - mass index , a height - weight ratio , was in the 95th percentile or higher based on government BMI growth charts .
For 4 - year - olds , that would be a BMI of about 18 .
For example , a girl who is 4 1 / 2 years old , 40 inches tall , and 42 pounds would have a BMI of about 18 , weighing 4 pounds more than the government 's upper limit for that age , height , and gender .
The researchers did not examine reasons for the disparities , but others offered several theories .
Flores cited higher rates of diabetes in American Indians and also in Hispanicswhich scientists believe may be due to genetic differences .
Other factors that can increase obesity risk tend to be more common among minorities , including poverty , less educated parents , and diets high in fat and calories , Flores said .

The one thing you saw most plainly in the Plame affair is how obsessed Dick Cheney is with public image , the chattering classes and spinning stories that might reflect poorly on him .
The act is the elder statesman , authoritatively reviewing the world scene , soberly making judgments , calmly explaining it later to those pesky people who are required to elect you every four years .
The reality is a man who lost it on 9/11 , leapt immediately to apocalyptic conclusions , and then , as the dust cleared , was unable to go back on the war crimes he had authorized and so dug in ever more deeply to justify them .
I do n't think anyone begrudges that kind of misjudgment at the beginning , although one would have hoped for calmer heads in a crisis , but the attempt to institutionalize the torture of first resort into an entire program of black sites , torture manuals , Orwellian euphemisms , and legal fantasy was bound , like the institutionalization of Gitmo , to collapse under any successor who actually wanted to return the US to the rule of law and the world of civilized nations .
Did Cheney believe he could hide all this for ever ?
Did he believe that hundreds of randomly seized human beings could be consigned to the black hole of Gitmo for ever ?
And was he really going to launch this kind of appalling attacks on his successors whenever they tried to move past this stuff or be forced , by the law itself and the Geneva Conventions , to investigate and prosecute violations of core human rights ?
Sydney funnel - web spider ( Atrax robustus )
Funnel - webs are one of the three most dangerous spiders in the world and are regarded by some to be the most dangerous .
Wandering males are thought to be responsible for the majority of fatal bites to humans , however this has not been proven .
Males are aggressive and tend to wander looking for receptive females of their kind for mating .
Goliath bird eating spider ( Theraphosa blondi )
The goliath bird eating spider is an arachnid belonging to the tarantula family and is the largest spider in the world .
The spider was named by explorers from the Victorian era , who reported the sighting to the Western world after witnessing the spider devouring a hummingbird .
Redback spider ( Latrodectus hasselti )
Resembling the black widow spider , the redback is a member of the genus Latrodectus ( widow family ) found throughout the world .
Females measure about a centimetre in length while the male is only 3 to 4 milimetres long .
The redback spider is one of few animals which display sexual cannibalism while mating .
Crab spider ( Ozyptila praticola )
Most often found on flowers , lying in ambush for prey , crab spiders do not build webs to trap prey but are active hunters much like jumping spiders .
Like crabs , these spiders move sideways and backwards more easily than forwards .
Camel spiders ( Solifugae )
These terrifying creatures became infamous when American soldiers who had returned home from Iraq told of cat size spiders that could bite chunks out of human flesh .
Solifugae are not actually true spiders but belong to a distinct arachnid order .
Black Widow ( Latrodectus )
This sinister creature posseses venom 15 times more potent than that of a rattlesnake .
Due to the great geographical range of the black widow , the highest number of deaths world - wide are caused by members of their genus .
Brown recluse spider ( Loxosceles reclusa )
Brown recluse bites produce severe dermonecrotic lesions and severe systemic symptoms , including organ damage and even fatalities .
Bites have been known to form a necrotizing ulcer that destroys soft tissue and may take months to heal , leaving deep scars .
The damaged tissue will become gangrenous and eventually slough away .
Argiope aetherea
This large orb - web is often referred to as the St Andrew ’s Cross spider due to it ’s characteristic cross - shaped web .
This species displays sexual size dimorphism , with females being many times larger than males .
Nephila clavata ( Joro spider )
This colorful arachnid is a golden orb - web spider .
Researchers in Japan have created a silk thread that is stronger , softer and more durable than conventional silk by genetically modifying silkworms with Nephilia drag line genes .
Spider socks , stockings and fishing lines are expected to appear on the market within years .
Chilean rose tarantula ( Grammostola rosea )
Although they look fightening , these tarantulas make brilliant pets .
Females have been known to live as long as 20 years with the possibility that they may live considerably longer .
Wolf spider ( Hogna helluo )
So called due to their ability to run down their prey , wolf spiders depend on their eyesight to hunt .
Their sense of touch is acute .
A bite may cause some itching to a human , but nothing deadly or major .
Goldenrod crab spider ( Misumena vatia )
Goldenrod spiders are mainly found in North America and have the ability to change colour from white to yellow and back again .
The colour change is made possible by the spider secreting a liquid yellow pigment into the outer cell layer of the body .
Zebra spider ( Salticus scenicus )
Zebra spiders are often noted for their ‘ curiosity ’ when observed , many seem aware of their audience and seem to respond by raising their head and looking back at the person .
This spider uses its four pairs of large eyes to locate prey and it ’s jumping ability to pounce and capture it .
Huntsman spider ( Sparassidae )
Huntsman spiders can grow up to a legspan of 12 inches and will bite if provoked .
Huntsman spiders are not deadly to humans though , the victim will suffer only minor swelling and localised pain , recovering in a day or two .
Mexican redknee tarantula ( Brachypelma Smithi )
In the wild , the redknee will consume almost any kind of arthropod , small lizard , or small rodent that they can overpower and immobilize with their venom .
After moulting , it will emerge from its exoskeleton leaving the old skin behind , looking like a second spider .
Barn spider ( Araneus cavaticus )
This spider was made famous by the book , Charlotte ’s Web .
The book ’s spider was called Charlotte A. Cavatica , and the barn spider ’s scientific name is Araneus cavaticus .
Coppi and Bartali grated against each other , creating an explosive relationship that still captivates Italians .
Newspaper articles from the 1940s are reprinted in today ’s editions .
Books are still being written about them , including one published just in time for this year ’s Giro .
“ They are part of the history books , ” Pinotti said .
“ You learn about them at home , at school .
They are more famous than almost everyone in Italian history because they gave the country hope . ”
Before World War II , Bartali won the Giro twice , in 1936 and 1937 .
He also won the Tour de France in 1938 , when it was unheard of for foreign cyclists to wear the yellow jersey .
He then headed off to fight for the Italian resistance .
After the war , he won the Giro again in 1946 , creating a thrill for a depressed nation .
But he is best known for his victory at the 1948 Tour de France .
It occurred around the time that Palmiro Togliatti , the leader of the Italian Communist party , was shot and wounded .
Bartali ’s victory was said to have eased tensions in the country as it appeared headed toward civil war and a possible insurrection by the Italian Communists .
Bartali and Coppi became teammates in 1940 , before their rivalry became a national obsession .
Coppi was hired to help Bartali win .
While Bartali prayed for divine help as he raced , Coppi insisted that he was simply a machine , riding the roads alone .
Coppi had admitted to using performance - enhancing drugs , including amphetamines .
He said he took them only when it was necessary  which was , he once said in a television interview , “ almost all the time . ”
Although drug use was not yet banned in cycling , the doping infuriated Bartali .
He told reporters he would often pick up bottles left behind by Coppi to taste what special concoction was inside .
He would scour Coppi ’s hotel room to find remnants of the substances Coppi had taken .
Ok , So YOU were right , We DID have enough cat hair on the couch to make a whole ' nuther cat .

A tiny , " midget " frog that can fit on the tip of a finger — and previously only known by its croaking — has finally been found by researchers .
The frog , dubbed Noble ’s Pygmy frog ( Noblella pygmaea ) , is the smallest ever found in the Andes and one of the tiniest amphibians in the world .
The amphibian , with an average length of about 0.45 inches ( 11.4 millimeters ) and an unusually long forefinger , was discovered during field work in the highlands of Peru's Manu National Park .
The frog was n't hard to spot solely because of its small size — its brown color keeps it well camouflaged .
But locals helped a team of German and Peruvian herpetologists catch their first glimpse of the creature
Noblella pygmaea inhabits the cloud forest , the montane scrub and the high - elevation grasslands at an altitude from about 9,900 to 10,500 feet ( 3025 to 3190 meters ) above sea level in and around the park .
The females of the species lay only two eggs that are about 4 millimeters in diameter .
Unlike the eggs of most amphibian species , these are laid in moist , terrestrial microhabitats , such as in moss or leaf litter , and are protected from insect predators by the mother frog .
Also unusual is that the embryos do n't change into tadpoles , but instead lead a fully terrestrial life immediately after hatching .
Because Manu National
Park is a well known biological “ hotspot , " the scientists that conducted the study , Edgar Lehr of the Senckenberg Natural History Collection Dresden in Germany and Alessandro Catenazzi of the University of California at Berkeley , think that Noblella pygmaea is only one of many undiscovered amphibians in the Andes mountain area .
The discovery of Noblella was detailed in the February 2009 issue of the journal Copeia .
Despite living in a nominally protected area , global warming , other human - caused changes to the habitat and the virulent , epidemic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , threaten amphibians of the Andean region .
Fortunately , the fungus has not been noticed on Noblella so far .
Its terrestrial lifestyle may mean the frog is less exposed to the fungus than stream - dwelling frogs .
The year was 1973 .
Real programmers were still using punch - cards and Pascal .
C had barely been invented , and object - oriented programming was hardly a twinkle even in the eyes of top computer scientists .
Whether or not to use goto was the hot topic of the day .
Knuth
It was then that Donald Knuth wrote his famous essay Structured Programming with go to Statements .
And some essay it is : he covers everything from the current trends on structured programming to premature optimization being the root of all evil .
( I read it in Literate Programming , but it ’s also available as a scanned PDF here . )
He ’s responding to Edsger Dijkstra ’s well - known letter Go To Statement Considered Harmful , but ( in typical Knuth fashion ) he covers so much related ground it ’s not funny .
What was striking to me is the context of his discussion .
It ’s clear that structured programming — which we use every day and think is “ common sense ” — had to be invented , discussed , and refined .
Like most inventions , it ’s obvious … 36 years later .
goto
It ’s also obvious that goto ( or “ go to ” as Knuth calls it ) was much more widely used and abused than it is today .
This is probably partly because assembly language was so much more common , but also because “ they ” had to learn that goto is n’t usually the right abstraction — in fact , it is n’t much of an abstraction at all .
Now it ’s 2009 , and goto is pretty rare .
It ’s still used , of course , but I ’ve usually seen it only in the cases Knuth is talking about : for efficiency , error exits , and for breaking out of certain kinds of loops .
In C you still occassionally need it for cleaning up before error exits , or for breaking out of efficient nested loops , or in generated code , but these days we also have other constructs and other languages that solve 1973 ’s problems most of the time .
In C , you have the invaluable break as well as the ability to return early .
Knuth advocated the equivalent of C’s break , implying also that most languages at the time did n’t have it .
Compilers are also somewhat better at producing optimized code from non- goto ed source : for example , I can program my virtual machine ’s opcode dispatcher as a bunch of case statements , knowing the compiler will probably optimize it into a jump table .
And in most modern high - level languages ( C++ and up ) you have exceptions , which eliminate the need for error - exit goto s , as well as solve several other problems in a really tidy way .
Python
Python is important in this discussion not only because Knuth is keen on beautiful code , but because Knuth “ predicted ” its arrival in several different ways .
Here ’s a quote from the last section of his essay :
It seems clear that languages somewhat different from those in existence today would enhance the preparation of structured programs .
We will perhaps eventually be writing only small modules which are identified by name as they are used to build larger ones , so that devices like indentation , rather than delimiters , might become feasible for expressing local structure in the source language .
Of course , many languages now have “ small modules which are identified by name as they are used to build larger ones ” , but Python really took Knuth seriously about using indentation as a delimiter .
What ’s more , you can always add goto to Python if you really need it . :-)
OOP
And it gets even more interesting when he goes on to say :
Although our examples do n’t indicate this , it turns out that a given level of abstraction often involves several related routines and data definitions ; for example , when we decide to represent a table in a certain way , we simultaneously want to specify the routines for storing and fetching information from that table .
The next generation of languages will probably take into account such related routines .
Correct me if I ’m wrong , but does n’t that sound awfully like OOP ?
So in a single essay apparently about goto statements , Knuth predicted modules , Python ’s use of indentation as delimiters , and object - oriented programming . :-)

Andrea Wachner sent an erotic dancer , named Cricket , to impersonate her at her ten year high school reunion .
The dancer wore a hidden ear piece to stay in communication with Wachner .
A film crew was on the scene pretending to film a documentary about artists , including Wachner .
Of course , they were really documenting Wachner 's brilliant prank .
When she posted clips to YouTube , some of her classmates were n't too happy they 'd been duped .
Now Wachner has a manager shopping her story as a reality show or feature film .
From ABC
News :
Cricket told the reunion attendees that she'd had reconstructive surgery and also suffered from amnesia .
It was n't completely unbelievable , because some had already heard that the real - life Wachner was in an accident after high school — her car was totaled and she had been injured , but she had never suffered from amnesia .
Most of them had not seen or talked to Wachner since high school , but many found her new profession suspect : Cricket as Andrea said she was working as a stripper to help pay her graduate school tuition .
Daniel Wolowicz , 32 , who had been an acquaintance of Wachner 's in high school , said he was immediately suspicious .
" She was just so different .
You have to understand the community we had come from , " he said .
" Everyone was questioning who this person was .
" I had asked her a very specific question about seeing her at a bat mitzvah when I was 15 years old , " he said .
When Cricket answered his question correctly , Wolowicz said he assumed it was Andrea or " someone else who had been given a lot of information . "
It would be awhile , however , before he learned the full truth .
As the night progressed the drinks flowed , and Cricket , always outgoing , was getting ready for the climax of the evening : a striptease performed to what Cricket described as " one of the worst songs of the ' 90s , " Lisa Loeb 's " Stay . "
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Some Internet companies are abusing consumers ’ personal data and this cannot be allowed to continue , a top European Union official will warn the industry on Tuesday .
A man browses web at an Internet cafe in Madrid May 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Andrea Comas
Consumer Affairs Commissioner Meglena Kuneva , in a speech whose text was obtained by Reuters in advance , will threaten EU intervention to set tougher rules on how Internet users ’ personal data is collected , analyzed and shared by search engines and service providers .
“ The current situation with regard to privacy , profiling and targeting is not satisfactory .
Basic consumer rights in terms of transparency , control and risk are being violated and this cannot continue , ” she will say in the speech .
Internet search giants and service providers have come under pressure from European data protection officials to do more to protect the privacy of Internet users .
Google , Yahoo , Microsoft and others have announced measures to protect users ’ data , cut the time they store personal data gathered from surfing habits and allow users to opt out of being targeted with Internet ads .
Internet advertising has grown rapidly in recent years , and brands hope to develop it further by providing consumers with more relevant advertisements based on their browsing habits .
Bill Echikson , a spokesman for Google , which recently launched an interest - based advertising service , said the search giant was taking action to protect users ’ data and allow them to opt out of targeted ads .
However , Kuneva will say such measures are not enough .
“ The current opt - out systems are partial , sometimes nowhere to be found , they are difficult or cumbersome and most of all , they are unstable , ” she will say , adding that “ avoiding tracking is currently technically difficult , if not impossible . ”
Kuneva warns that if the industry fails to offer adequate responses on data collection and profiling , the European Commission will not hesitate to intervene .
“ We must establish the principles of transparency , clear language , opt - in or opt - out options that are meaningful and easy to use , ” she will say .
President Obama pledged Thursday that the U.S. would become a better partner in curbing the flow of arms that have aggravated a bloody drug war in Mexico , but acknowledged that political realities make it tough for him to ban some of the most potent weapons in the arsenals of drug cartels .
Emerging from a meeting with Mexican President Felipe Calderon , Obama said he favored a ban on assault weapons but would not push to reimpose a U.S. prohibition that lapsed in 2004 .
“ None of us is under any illusion that reinstating that ban would be easy , ” Obama said at a news conference after talks that dealt in part with the violence that has swept sections of Mexico .
Instead , he announced plans to increase the number of U.S. law enforcement personnel at the border to search for smuggled shipments of guns , even in southbound trains .
He also said he would push the Senate to ratify a decade - old treaty on arms trafficking as part of a concerted U.S. - Mexican effort to defeat drug gangs .
But despite Obama ’s high approval ratings and solid Democratic majorities in the House and Senate , his comments indicated that the political clout of gun rights advocates , including many Republicans as well as conservative Democrats , made it doubtful he could resurrect an assault gun ban .
Congress enacted such a ban in 1994 , but it expired after 10 years .
In 2004 , when Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif . ) proposed an extension , it was voted down , 90 to 8 .
Mexican officials have made it clear they want the ban reenacted .
But Obama , as he stood beside Calderon , said other measures would have to suffice .
When it was his turn to answer the assault weapons question , Calderon struck a patient tone and said he grasped the nuances involved .
His government has seized 16,000 assault weapons since he took office in December 2006 .
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives says 90 % of weapons seized in Mexico and reported to the agency can be traced to the United States .
“ We understand that this is politically very sensitive because we know the great esteem Americans have for their constitutional rights , especially those contained in the 2nd Amendment , ” Calderon said .
But he cautioned that the widespread violence plaguing Mexico may spill into the U.S .
“ These weapons today are aimed at Mexican authorities and Mexican citizens , but organized crime is not only present here in Mexico .
It ’s also in the United States , ” he said .
“ I hope to God these weapons that today are sold in the U.S. and used in Mexico are not one day also used against U.S. society and U.S. authorities the way they are here in our country . ”
Illustrating the dangers , a gun battle on the eve of Obama ’s arrival left one soldier and 14 alleged drug traffickers dead in the Pacific coast state of Guerrero , officials said .
About 30 gunmen attacked troops who were patrolling a remote mountain ridge .
A second soldier was critically wounded .
Increasingly brazen traffickers have started attacking army patrols head - on .
Authorities said the Mexican military , after the battle , confiscated a small arsenal , including two .50 - caliber Barrett rifles , 17 other rifles , grenades and ammunition and eight vehicles .
Obama ’s stop in Mexico was scheduled to last less than 24 hours and was made en route to a summit in Trinidad and Tobago of 34 Western Hemisphere nations .
There , Obama is likely to face criticism for the long - standing U.S. trade embargo against Cuba .
Calderon said the embargo was “ not very useful ” in promoting change .
“ It was implemented before President Obama and I were born , ” he said .
“ And things in Cuba have not changed much . ”
Obama has lifted restrictions on Cuban Americans who want to travel to Cuba .
But he opposes lifting the trade embargo , calling it useful leverage in getting Cuba ’s rulers to adopt democratic reforms .
The summit will be attended by many staunch U.S. critics , given that Latin American nations have leaned leftward in recent years .
The White House said Obama was not likely to have a one - on - one meeting with one of America ’s harshest critics , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
A purpose of Obama ’s visit Thursday was to show support for Calderon after warnings from U.S. military and intelligence officials that drug cartels pose a mortal threat to the Mexican government .
Mexico objected to such alarm , and the Obama administration has been working to make amends .
As the first U.S. president to visit Mexico ’s capital in 12 years , Obama is delivering a message that he appreciates the courage shown by Calderon in combating drug lords , White House officials said .
At a welcoming ceremony at Los Pinos , the Mexican equivalent of the White House , Obama said , “ At a time when the Mexican government has so courageously taken on the drug cartels that have plagued both sides of the border , it is absolutely critical that the United States joins as a full partner in dealing with this issue . ”
Calderon ’s government has deployed 45,000 soldiers to parts of the country beset by drug violence .
For its part , the Obama administration has pledged to intensify border patrols and speed up shipments of military aircraft to help Mexico suppress drug gangs .
Not all Mexicans share Obama ’s opinion of Calderon .
The Mexican leader has been criticized for underestimating how deeply drug gangs have corrupted local governments and police forces .
Critics also contend that Calderon is relying too heavily on military force while neglecting politically sensitive areas that should also be addressed , such as money laundering , judicial reform and high - level corruption .
Calderon ’s use of military force also has led to accusations of human rights abuses .
Mexico ’s National Human Rights Commission has said citizens ’ complaints of killings , rape and other abuses have grown sixfold since Calderon assigned the army to the drug war shortly after he took office .
Even if Mexico was left disappointed on assault weapons , the two leaders stressed that they had found common ground on other topics .
Before they met , the White House announced the countries had agreed to work jointly to curb global warming and develop clean energy alternatives .

APRIL 8-- In what we promise will be the final installment of the ShamWow Chronicles , on the following pages you will find a selection of police evidence photos memorializing the recent bloody battle between TV pitchman Vince Shlomi and a Miami hooker .
As you 've likely heard , the ShamWow chieftain , 44 , paid Sasha Harris $ 1000 for " straight sex , " which was to occur in Shlomi's $ 750 - a- night room at the lavish Setai hotel .
But things went sideways when , according to an account Shlomi gave cops , he kissed the 26 - year - old Harris , who responded by biting his tongue and not letting go .
Shlomi then punched Harris several times until she released his tongue .
He then went to the hotel 's lobby , where security called cops .
A Miami Beach Police Department Crime Scene unit also arrived at the Setai to photograph the aftermath of the February 7 brawl , which left blood on the hotel room 's walls , floor , door , phone , bed , and towels .
Cops were also dispatched to the Mount Sinai Medical Center to photograph Shlomi and Harris , who were being treated for their injuries ( both were handcuffed to hospital beds since they had been arrested for felony battery ) .
Prosecutors subsequently decided not to pursue charges against either combatant .

For many consumers , their only hope for solvency is to get their balances down to a manageable level .
But the card companies — concerned for their own solvency — are not inclined to let them off the hook .
Debt settlement companies claim they help both creditor and consumer by bridging the abyss between them .
“ There is overwhelming demand for this service , ” said Robby H. Birnbaum , a lawyer who is a board member of the Association of Settlement Companies , a trade group .
“ People want to avoid bankruptcy , and this is their last resort . ”
In practice , however , the debt settlement firms frequently manage to please no one .
An executive of the American Bankers Association , representing the credit card industry at a recent forum , labeled debt settlement companies “ very harmful ” to both creditor and consumer .
Even debt collectors are upset , saying the settlement companies prevent them from collecting .
The premise of debt settlement is simple : A consumer stops trying to pay even the minimum on his cards .
Instead , he accumulates money in an account that the settlement company promises to use to strike a bargain with creditors .
Confronted with the certainty of some money now versus the possibility of no money later , the card company settles for 40 cents on the dollar or less .
Even if the goal makes sense , achieving it can be difficult .
Once the consumer stops paying the minimums , the card companies increase efforts to collect .
Their fees and interest charges do not stop .
They may sue .
The consumer ’s credit score falls through the floor .
Long before making any attempt at a deal with creditors , the settlement companies take a fee .
Credit Solutions deducted $ 233 from the Carters ’ checking account for three months , and then $ 116 a month for the next 27 months — a total of about $ 3,825 by early this year .

Advertisement Colombian authorities have arrested the country 's most wanted drug lord , the government has said .
Daniel Rendon Herrera , known as " Don Mario " , was captured early on Wednesday near Necocli in north - western Colombia , officials said .
The government had offered a bounty of up to $ 2 m ( £ 1.3 m ) for information leading to his arrest .
Colombia is the world 's leading cocaine producer .
Drug trafficking has fuelled the country 's decades - long conflict .
Daniel Rendon is accused of smuggling hundreds of tonnes of cocaine from an area on the Caribbean coast controlled in the 1990s by his brother - a paramilitary leader who is now in prison .
Earlier this year he offered his gunmen almost $ 1,000 for each police officer they murdered , as security forces closed in on his network .
It does n't matter what they do or where they are , eventually they will fall
Juan Manuel Santos
Colombian Defence Minister Defence Minster Juan Manuel Santos said Daniel Rendon could be responsible for huge number of deaths .
" He could be charged with over 3,000 homicides in the course of gaining control over territory to be used in the illicit drug trade , " he said .
The minister said Daniel Rendon had been found cowering under a palm tree and had " practically looked like a dog " .
It was not immediately clear whether the bounty money had been claimed .
' Bolsters democracy '
Once a paramilitary in a branch of the now - demobilised United Self - Defence Forces of Colombia ( AUC ) , Daniel Rendon had refused to surrender as part of a peace deal .
DANIEL RENDON HERRERA
Former AUC paramilitary group leader Brother of jailed paramilitary leader Freddy Herrera Led up to 1,000 heavily armed men Operated in northern fiefdom in Antioquia province Instead he used paramilitary networks to build up a personal army of up to 1,000 heavily - armed fighters , also striking a deal with left - wing Farc rebels , the BBC's Jeremy McDermott reports from the capital , Bogota .
Authorities had been tracking the 43 - year - old for months , but he had always managed to stay one step ahead of them until now , he says .
More than 300 anti-narcotics police commandos were reportedly involved in the operation to arrest him , which was led by police chief Gen Oscar Naranjo .
Mr Santos said the arrest sent a message to other drug barons .
" It does n't matter what they do or where they are , eventually they will fall , " he said .
A spokesman for President Alvaro Uribe described it as " good news for the security of all Colombians and bolsters democracy " .
Wanted in US
However , our correspondent adds that when authorities have cut off the head of drugs cartels in the past , several more heads have grown , and there could now be a period of bloodletting as other people try to take over .
Illegal armed groups are heavily involved in the drugs trade in Colombia , using the profits to fund their activities .
Much of the cocaine produced in Colombia is smuggled into the US through Mexico , where there has been a sharp rise in drug - related violence .
Colombian cocaine is also trafficked to Europe , often through West Africa .
The US is the primary funder of Colombia 's anti-drugs programme , Plan Colombia , which began in 2000 .
The UN reported a reduction in the amount of coca grown during the early years of the plan , but said coca cultivation rose by 27 % in 2007 .
In Washington , a senior official told the Associated Press news agency that Daniel Rendon was wanted there on drug trafficking charges and the US would seek his extradition .

Structural realism is considered by many realists and antirealists alike as the most defensible form of scientific realism .
There are now many forms of structural realism and an extensive literature about them .
There are interesting connections with debates in metaphysics , philosophy of physics and philosophy of mathematics .
This entry is intended to be a comprehensive survey of the field .
Scientific realism is the view that we ought to believe in the unobservable entities posited by our most successful scientific theories .
It is widely held that the most powerful argument in favour of scientific realism is the no-miracles argument , according to which the success of science would be miraculous if scientific theories were not at least approximately true descriptions of the world .
While the underdetermination argument is often cited as giving grounds for scepticism about theories of unobservable entities , arguably the most powerful arguments against scientific realism are based on the history of radical theory change in science .
The best - known of these arguments , although not necessarily the most compelling of them , is the notorious pessimistic meta-induction , according to which reflection on the abandonment of theories in the history of science motivates the expectation that our best current scientific theories will themselves be abandoned , and hence that we ought not to assent to them .
Structural realism was introduced into contemporary philosophy of science by John Worrall in 1989 as a way to break the impasse that results from taking both arguments seriously , and have “ the best of both worlds ” in the debate about scientific realism .
With respect to the case of the transition in nineteenth - century optics from Fresnel 's elastic solid ether theory to Maxwell 's theory of the electromagnetic field , Worrall argues that :
There was an important element of continuity in the shift from Fresnel to Maxwell — and this was much more than a simple question of carrying over the successful empirical content into the new theory .
At the same time it was rather less than a carrying over of the full theoretical content or full theoretical mechanisms ( even in “ approximate ” form ) …
There was continuity or accumulation in the shift , but the continuity is one of form or structure , not of content .
( 1989 , 117 )
According to Worrall , we should not accept standard scientific realism , which asserts that the nature of the unobservable objects that cause the phenomena we observe is correctly described by our best theories .
However , neither should we be antirealists about science .
Rather , we should adopt structural realism and epistemically commit ourselves only to the mathematical or structural content of our theories .
Since there is ( says Worrall ) retention of structure across theory change , structural realism both ( a ) avoids the force of the pessimistic meta-induction ( by not committing us to belief in the theory 's description of the furniture of the world ) and ( b ) does not make the success of science ( especially the novel predictions of mature physical theories ) seem miraculous ( by committing us to the claim that the theory 's structure , over and above its empirical content , describes the world ) .
Worrall 's paper has been widely cited and has spawned an extensive literature in which various varieties of structural realism are advocated .
These contemporary debates recapitulate the work of some of the greatest philosophers of science .
Worrall says he found his structural realism in Henri Poincaré ( 1905 , 1906 ) whose structuralism was combined with neo-Kantian views about the nature of arithmetic and group theory , and with conventionalism about the geometry of space and time .
( The prevalence of Kantian themes in the literature on structural realism is discussed further below ; for more on Poincaré see Giedymin 1982 , Gower 2000 and Zahar 1994 , 2001 . )
Ernan McMullin ( 1990 ) argues that Pierre Duhem was a realist about the relations found in laws but not about explanations in terms of an ontology .
According to Worrall ( 1989 ) , Barry Gower ( 2000 ) and Elie Zahar ( 2001 ) , Duhem too was a kind of structural realist , though there are passages in Duhem that more readily lend themselves to an instrumentalist interpretation .
Gower 's ( 2000 ) historical survey of structural realism also discusses how structuralism figures in the thought of Ernst Cassirer , Moritz Schlick , Rudolf Carnap and Bertrand Russell .
Stathis Psillos ( 1999 ) has explored the connections between structuralism and the Ramsey - sentence approach to scientific theory as it figured in the development of Carnap 's philosophy from logical positivism to ontologically relativist empiricism .
Other important pioneers of structuralism about science include Arthur Eddington ( see French 2003 ) , Grover Maxwell ( see Ladyman 1998 and 3.1 below ) and Hermann Weyl ( see Ryckman 2005 ) .
Ladyman ( 1998 ) distinguished epistemic and ontic forms of structural realism , and many of those who have taken up structural realism have been philosophers of physics who have developed the latter .
Others have made it clear that their structural realism is a purely epistemological refinement of scientific realism .
On the other hand , Bas van Fraassen ( 1997 , 2006 , 2008 ) defends an empiricist and non-realist form of structuralism about science , motivated by an illuminating reconstruction of the origins of structuralism in the debate about the epistemology of physical geometry in the nineteenth century , and more generally in the progressive mathematisation of science .
Yet more kinds of structuralism now abound in contemporary analytic philosophy .
These include causal structuralism concerning the individuation of properties , mathematical structuralism concerning the nature of mathematical objects , and structuralism about laws and dispositions .
The relationship between structural realism and these views is a matter for further work .
While many realists and antirealists alike are agreed that the most viable form of scientific realism is structural realism , many others continue to defend other forms of scientific realism .
This article reviews the issues and provides a guide for further reading .
Scientific realism became dominant in philosophy of science after the demise of the forms of antirealism about science associated with the logical positivists , namely semantic instrumentalism , according to which theoretical terms are not to be interpreted as referring to anything , and theoretical reductionism , according to which theoretical terms are disguised ways of referring to observable phenomena .
These forms of antirealism rely upon discredited doctrines about scientific language , such as that it can be divided into theoretical and observational parts , and that much of it should not be taken literally .
Bas van Fraassen ( 1980 ) revitalised the debate about scientific realism by proposing his constructive empiricism as an alternative .
His antirealism is sceptical rather than dogmatic , and does not depend on the distinction between theoretical and observational terms .
He allows that terms such as ‘ sub- atomic particle ’ and ‘ particle too small to see ’ are perfectly meaningful and should be taken literally ( note that the former term is theoretical and the latter term is not but both purportedly refer to unobservable entities ) .
On the other hand , he holds that it is perfectly rational to remain agnostic about whether there are any such particles because he argues that to accept the best scientific theories we have only requires believing that they are empirically adequate , in the sense of correctly describing the observable world , rather than believing that they are true simpliciter .
( For more on constructive empiricism see Monton 2007 . )
How then are we to decide whether to believe in the full theoretical truth of scientific theories , including what they say about unobservable entities such as electrons and black holes , or whether to believe instead merely that our best scientific theories are empirically adequate ?
Van Fraassen argues that since the latter belief is logically weaker and yet as empirically contentful as the former belief it is natural for an empiricist to go only as far as belief in empirical adequacy .
On the other hand , many philosophers are moved by the fact that belief in only the empirical adequacy of our best scientific theories leaves us unable to explain the phenomena that they describe .
Inference to the best explanation is widely believed to be an important form of reasoning in science , and the production of explanations of the world is often supposed to be one of the main successes of science .
When the target of explanation becomes science itself and its history of empirical success as a whole , we arrive at the no-miracles argument famously presented by Hilary Putnam as follows :
“ The positive argument for realism is that it is the only philosophy that does n't make the success of science a miracle ” ( 1975 , 73 ) .
The no-miracles argument is elaborated in terms of specific features of scientific methodology and practice .
Richard Boyd ( 1985 , for example ) argues that in explaining the success of science , we need to explain the overall instrumental success of scientific methods across the history of science .
Alan Musgrave ( 1988 ) says that the only version of the no-miracles argument that might work is one appealing to the novel predictive success of theories .
Some realists , such as Psillos ( 1999 ) , have gone so far as to argue that only theories which have enjoyed novel predictive success ought to be considered as falling within the scope of arguments for scientific realism .
Colin Howson ( 2000 ) , P.D. Magnus and Craig Callender ( 2004 ) , and Peter Lipton ( 2004 ) have recently argued that the no-miracles argument is flawed because in order to evaluate the claim that it is probable that theories enjoying empirical success are approximately true we have to know what the relevant base rate is , and there is no way we can know this .
Magnus and Callender argue that “ wholesale ” arguments that are intended to support realism ( or antirealism ) about science as a whole ( rather than “ retail ” arguments that are applied to a specific theory ) are only taken seriously because of our propensity to engage in the ‘ base rate fallacy ’ of evaluating probabilities without knowing all the relevant information .
They think we ought to abandon the attempt to defend scientific realism in general rather than on a case - by - case basis .
When it comes to wholesale arguments against scientific realism , perhaps the most influential until recently was the underdetermination argument , according to which the existence of empirical equivalents to our best scientific theories implies that we should withhold epistemic commitment to them .
This is often dismissed by realists as generating doubt about unobservables that is no more worrying than doubting other minds or the external world .
They argue that since scientists find ways of choosing between empirically equivalent rivals , philosophers ought not to make too much of merely in - principle possibilities that are irrelevant to scientific practice ( see Laudan and Leplin 1991 , 1993 , and Kukla 1998 ) .
( Kyle Stanford ( 2006 ) defends an underdetermination argument called ‘ the problem of unconceived alternatives ’ with reference to the history of science , so perhaps not all underdetermination arguments are a priori and theoretical . )
The power of the arguments against scientific realism from theory change is that , rather than being a priori and theoretical , they are empirically based and their premises are based on data obtained by examining the practice and history of science .
Ontological discontinuity in theory change seems to give us grounds not for mere agnosticism but for the positive belief that many central theoretical terms of our best contemporary science will be regarded as non-referring by future science .
So - called ‘ pessimistic meta-inductions ’ about theoretical knowledge take many forms and are probably almost as ancient as scepticism itself .
They have the basic form :
Proposition p is widely believed by most contemporary experts , but p is like many other hypotheses that were widely believed by experts in the past and are disbelieved by most contemporary experts .
We have as much reason to expect p to befall their fate as not , therefore we should at least suspend judgement about p if not actively disbelieve it .
More precisely , Larry Laudan ( 1981 ) gave a very influential argument with the following structure :
There have been many empirically successful theories in the history of science which have subsequently been rejected and whose theoretical terms do not refer according to our best current theories .
Our best current theories are no different in kind from those discarded theories and so we have no reason to think they will not ultimately be replaced as well .
So , by induction we have positive reason to expect that our best current theories will be replaced by new theories according to which some of the central theoretical terms of our best current theories do not refer , and hence we should not believe in the approximate truth or the successful reference of the theoretical terms of our best current theories .
The most common realist response to this argument is to restrict realism to theories with some further properties ( usually , maturity , and novel predictive success ) so as to cut down the inductive base employed in ( i ) ( see Psillos 1996 ) .
Moreover Peter Lewis ( 2001 ) , Marc Lange ( 2002 ) and Magnus and Callender ( 2004 ) regard the pessimistic meta-induction as a fallacy of probabilistic reasoning .
However , there are arguments from theory change that are not probabilistic .
Note first that there are several cases of mature theories which enjoyed novel predictive success , notably the ether theory of light and the caloric theory of heat .
If their central theoretical terms do not refer , the realist 's claim that approximate truth explains empirical success will no longer be enough to establish realism , because we will need some other explanation for the success of the caloric and ether theories .
If this will do for these theories then it ought to do for others where we happened to have retained the central theoretical terms , and then we do not need the realist 's preferred explanation that such theories are true and successfully refer to unobservable entities .
Laudan 's paper was also intended to show that the successful reference of its theoretical terms is not a necessary condition for the novel predictive success of a theory ( 1981 , 45 ) , and there are counter - examples to the no-miracles argument .
Successful reference of its central theoretical terms is a necessary condition for the approximate truth of a theory .
There are examples of theories that were mature and had novel predictive success but whose central theoretical terms do not refer .
So there are examples of theories that were mature and had novel predictive success but which are not approximately true .
Approximate truth and successful reference of central theoretical terms is not a necessary condition for the novel - predictive success of scientific theories
So , the no-miracles argument is undermined since , if approximate truth and successful reference are not available to be part of the explanation of some theories ' novel predictive success , there is no reason to think that the novel predictive success of other theories has to be explained by realism .
There are two common ( not necessarily exclusive ) responses to this :
( I) Develop an account of reference according to which the abandoned theoretical terms are regarded as successfully referring after all .
Realists developed causal theories of reference to account for continuity of reference for terms like ‘ atom ’ or ‘ electron ’ , even though the theories about atoms and electrons have undergone significant changes .
The difference with the terms ‘ ether ’ and ‘ caloric ’ is that they are no longer used in modern science .
However , as C.L. Hardin and Alexander Rosenberg ( 1982 ) argue , the causal theory of reference may be used to defend the claim that terms like ‘ ether ’ referred to whatever causes the phenomena responsible for the terms ' introduction .
This is criticized by Laudan ( 1984 ) as making the reference of theoretical terms a trivial matter , since as long as some phenomena prompt the introduction of a term it will automatically successfully refer to whatever is the relevant cause ( or causes ) .
Furthermore , this theory radically disconnects what a theorist is talking about from what she thinks she is talking about .
For example , Aristotle or Newton could be said to be referring to geodesic motion in a curved spacetime when , respectively , they talked about the natural motion of material objects , and the fall of a body under the effect of the gravitational force .
( II ) Restrict realism to those parts of theories that play an essential role in the derivation of subsequently observed ( novel ) predictions , and then argue that the terms of past theories which are now regarded as non-referring were non-essential and hence that there is no reason to deny that the essential terms in current theories will be retained .
Philip Kitcher says that : “ [ n ] o sensible realist should ever want to assert that the idle parts of an individual practice , past or present , are justified by the success of the whole ” ( 1993 , 142 ) .
The most detailed and influential response to the argument from theory change is due to Psillos ( 1999 ) , who combines strategies ( I ) and ( II ) .
Hasok Chang ( 2002 ) , Kyle Stanford ( 2002 and 2003 ) , Mohammed Elsamahi ( 2005 ) and Timothy Lyons ( 2006 ) criticize Psillos 's account .
Other responses include Kitcher 's ( 1993 ) model of reference according to which some tokens of theoretical terms refer and others do not .
Christina McLeish ( 2005 ) criticizes Kitcher 's theory by arguing that there are no satisfactory grounds for making the distinction between referring and non-referring tokens .
McLeish ( 2006 ) argues that abandoned theoretical terms like ‘ ether ’ partially refer and partially fail to refer .
Juha Saatsi ( 2005 ) denies premise ( a ) and claims that there can be approximate truth of the causal roles postulated by a scientific theory without its central terms necessarily successfully referring ( see also Chakravartty , 1998 ) .
There is no consensus among those defending standard realism in the face of theory change .
The argument from theory change threatens scientific realism because if what science now says is correct , then the ontologies of past scientific theories are far from accurate accounts of the furniture of the world .
If that is so even though they were predictively successful , then the success of our best current theories does not mean they have got the nature of the world right either .
The structuralist solution to this problem is to give up the attempt to learn about the nature of unobservable entities from science .
The metaphysical import of successful scientific theories consists in their giving correct descriptions of the structure of the world .
Theories can be very different and yet share all kinds of structure .
The task of providing an adequate theory of approximate truth that fits the history of science and directly addresses the problem of ontological continuity has hitherto defeated realists , but a much more tractable problem is to display the structural commonalities between different theories .
Hence , a form of realism that is committed only to the structure of theories might not be undermined by theory change .
Gerhard Schurz ( 2009 ) proves a structural correspondence theorem showing that successive theories that share empirical content also share theoretical content .
( McArthur ( 2011 ) argues that structural realism eliminates both theory change in science and scientific discovery . )
There are numerous examples of continuity in the mathematical structure of successive scientific theories .
Indeed Niels Bohr and others explicitly applied the methodological principle known as the ‘ correspondence principle ’ , according to which quantum - mechanical models ought to mathematically reduce to classical models in the limit of large numbers of particles , or the limit of Planck 's constant becoming arbitrarily small .
There are many cases in quantum mechanics where the Hamiltonian functions that represent the total energy of mechanical systems imitate those of classical mechanics , but with variables like those that stand for position and momentum replaced by Hermitian operators .
Simon Saunders ( 1993a ) discusses the structural continuities between classical and quantum mechanics and also shows how much structure Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy have in common .
Harvey Brown ( 1993 ) explains the correspondence between Special Relativity and classical mechanics .
Jonathan Bain and John Norton ( 2001 ) discuss the structural continuity in descriptions of the electron , as does Angelo Cei ( 2004 ) .
Votsis ( 2011 ) considers examples of continuity and discontinuity in physics .
Robert Batterman ( 2002 ) discusses many examples of limiting relationships between theories , notably the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena , and the relationship between wave and ray optics .
Holger Lyre ( 2004 ) extends Worrall 's original example of the continuity between wave optics and electromagnetism by considering the relationship between Maxwellian electrodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics .
Saunders ( 2003c and d ) also criticises Tian Cao ( 1997 ) for underestimating the difficulties with a non-structuralist form of realism in the light of the history of quantum field theory .
The most minimal form of structuralism focuses on empirical structure , and as such is best thought of as a defence of the cumulative nature of science in the face of Kuhnian worries about revolutions ( following Post 1971 ) .
See Katherine Brading 's and Elaine Landry's ( 2006 ) ‘ minimal structuralism ’ , and Otavio Bueno's ( 1999 , 2000 ) and van Fraassen 's ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) structural empiricism ( Ryckman 2005 calls the latter “ instrumental structuralism ” ) .
Structural realism is often characterised as the view that scientific theories tell us only about the form or structure of the unobservable world and not about its nature .
This leaves open the question as to whether the natures of things are posited to be unknowable for some reason or eliminated altogether .
Hence , Ladyman ( 1998 ) raised the question as to whether Worrall 's structural realism is intended as a metaphysical or epistemological modification of standard scientific realism .
Worrall 's paper is ambiguous in this respect .
That he has in mind only an epistemic constraint on realism — commitment to the structure of our best scientific theories but agnosticism about the rest of the content — is suggested by his citation of Poincaré who talks of the redundant theories of the past capturing the “ true relations ” between the “ real objects which Nature will hide forever from our eyes ” ( 1905 , 161 ) .
So one way of thinking about structural realism is as an epistemological modification of scientific realism to the effect that we only believe what scientific theories tell us about the relations entered into by unobservable objects , and suspend judgement as to the nature of the latter .
( ESR is called ‘ restrictive structural realism ’ by Psillos 2001 . )
There are various forms this might take .
( See French and Ladyman 2011 . )
We cannot know the individuals that instantiate the structure of the world but we can know their properties and relations .
We cannot know the individuals or their intrinsic / non- relational properties but we can know their first - order relational properties .
We cannot know the individuals , their first - order properties or relations , but we can know the second - order structure of their relational properties .
Russell ( 1927 ) and Carnap ( 1928 ) took this extreme view and argued that science only tells us about purely logical features of the world .
Psillos ( 2001 ) refers to the “ upward path ” to structural realism as beginning with empiricist epistemological principles and arriving at structural knowledge of the external world .
The “ downward ” path is to arrive at structural realism by weakening standard scientific realism as suggested by Worrall .
Both paths are criticized by Psillos .
Russell ( 1927 ) was led along the upward path by three epistemological principles : firstly , the claim that we only have direct access to our percepts ( Ayer 's ‘ egocentric predicament ’ ) ; secondly , the principle that different effects have different causes ( which is called the Helmholtz - Weyl Principle by Psillos ) ; and thirdly , that the relations between percepts have the same logico - mathematical structure as the relations between their causes .
This led him to the claim that science can only describe the world up to isomorphism , and hence to ( 3 ) above since according to him we know only the ( second - order ) isomorphism class of the structure of the world and not the ( first - order ) structure itself .
Russell 's upward path is defended by Votsis ( 2005 ) .
Mauro Dorato argues for ESR on the grounds that structural realism needs entity realism to be plausible ( 1999 , 4 ) .
Most defenders of ESR assume that there must be individual objects and properties that are ontologically prior to relational structure .
Matteo Morganti differs from other epistemic structural realists by arguing for agnosticism about whether there is a domain of individuals over and above relational structure .
As mentioned above , Poincaré 's structuralism had a Kantian flavour .
In particular , he thought that the unobservable entities postulated by scientific theories were Kant 's noumena or things in themselves .
He revised Kant 's view by arguing that the latter can be known indirectly rather than not at all because it is possible to know the relations into which they enter .
Poincaré followed the upward path to structural realism , beginning with the neo-Kantian goal of recovering the objective or intersubjective world from the world from the subjective world of private sense impressions : “ what we call objective reality is … what is common to many thinking beings and could be common to all ; … the harmony of mathematical laws ” ( 1906 , 14 ) .
However , he also followed the downward path to structural realism arguing that the history of science can be seen as cumulative at the level of relations rather than objects .
For example , between Carnot 's and Clausius ' thermodynamics the ontology changes but the Second Law of Thermodynamics is preserved .
While Worrall never directly endorses the Kantian aspect of Poincaré 's thought , Zahar 's structural realism is explicitly a form of Kantian transcendental idealism according to which science can never tell us more than the structure of the noumenal world ; the nature of the entities and properties of which it consists are epistemically inaccessible to us ( as in ( 2 ) above ) .
Michaela Massimi ( 2011 ) develops a neo-Kantian perspective on structural realism .
Frank Jackson ( 1998 ) , Rae Langton ( 1998 ) and David Lewis ( 2009 ) also advocate views similar to ESR .
Jackson refers to ‘ Kantian physicalism ’ ( 1998 : 23–24 ) , Langton to ‘ Kantian Humility ’ , and Lewis to ‘ Ramseyan Humility ’ .
Peter Unger ( 2001 ) also argues that our knowledge of the world is purely structural and that qualia are the non-structural components of reality .
Jackson argues that science only reveals the causal / relational properties of physical objects , and that “ we know next to nothing about the intrinsic nature of the world .
We know only its causal cum relational nature ” ( 1998 : 24 ) .
Langton argues that science only reveals the extrinsic properties of physical objects , and both then argue that their intrinsic natures , and hence the intrinsic nature of the world , are epistemically inaccessible .
Jackson points out that this inference can be blocked if the natures of objects and their intrinsic properties are identified with their relational or extrinsic properties , but argues that this makes a mystery of what it is that stands in the causal relations .
Lewis ' structuralism is based on the centrality he gives to the Ramsey sentence reconstruction of scientific theories that is the subject of the next section .
A position called structural realism , that amounts to an epistemological gloss on traditional scientific realism , was advocated by Grover Maxwell ( 1962 , 1970a , 1970b , 1972 ) .
Maxwell wanted to make scientific realism compatible with “ concept empiricism ” about the meaning of theoretical terms , and he also wanted to explain how we can have epistemic access to unobservable entities .
The problem as Maxwell saw it was that theories talk about all sorts of entities and processes with which we are not ‘ acquainted ’ .
How , he wondered , can we then know about and refer to them and their properties ?
The answer that he gave , following Russell , was that we can know about them by description , that is we can know them via their structural properties .
In fact , he argues , this is the limit of our knowledge of them , and the meanings of theoretical terms are to be understood purely structurally .
The way that Maxwell explicates the idea that the structure of the theory exhausts the cognitive content of its theoretical terms , is to consider the Ramsey sentence of the theory ( Ramsey 1929 ) .
Ramsey 's method allows the elimination of theoretical terms from a theory by replacing them with existentially quantified predicate variables ( or names in the case of the influential Lewis 1970 ) .
If one replaces the conjunction of assertions of a first - order theory with its Ramsey sentence , the observational consequences of the theory are carried over , but direct reference to unobservables is eliminated .
If we formalise a theory in a first - order language : ∏( O 1 , … , O n ; T 1 , … , T m ) , where the Os are the observational terms and the Ts are the theoretical terms , then the corresponding Ramsey sentence is ∃t 1 , … , t m ∏ ( O 1 , … , O n ;t 1 , … , t m ) .
Thus the Ramsey sentence only asserts that there are some objects , properties and relations that have certain logical features , satisfying certain implicit definitions .
It is a higher - order description , but ultimately connects the theoretical content of the theory with observable behaviour .
However , it is a mistake to think that the Ramsey sentence allows us to eliminate theoretical entities , for it still states that these exist .
It is just that they are referred to not directly , by means of theoretical terms , but by description , that is via variables , connectives , quantifiers and predicate terms whose direct referents are ( allegedly ) known by acquaintance .
Thus Maxwell ( and Russell ) claimed that knowledge of the unobservable realm is limited to knowledge of its structural rather than intrinsic properties , or , as is sometimes said , limited to knowledge of its higher - order properties .
It is arguable that this is the purest structuralism possible , for the notion of structure employed refers to the higher - order properties of a theory , those that are only expressible in purely formal terms .
This is an epistemological structural realism meant to vindicate and not to revise the ontological commitments of scientific realism .
On this view the objective world is composed of unobservable objects between which certain properties and relations obtain ; but we can only know the properties and relations of these properties and relations , that is , the structure of the objective world .
However , there are serious difficulties with this view which were originally raised by Newman in 1928 and which have been recently discussed by Demopoulos and Friedman ( 1989 ) .
The basic problem is that structure is not sufficient to uniquely pick out any relations in the world .
Suppose that the world consists of a set of objects whose structure is W with respect to some relation R , about which nothing else is known .
Any collection of things can be regarded as having structure W provided there is the right number of them .
This is because according to the extensional characterisation of relations defined on a domain of individuals , every relation is identified with some set of subsets of the domain .
The power set axiom entails the existence of every such subset and hence every such relation .
As Demopoulos and Friedman point out , if ∏ is consistent , and if all its purely observational consequences are true , then the truth of the corresponding Ramsey sentence follows as a theorem of second - order logic or set theory ( provided the initial domain has the right cardinality — and if it does not then consistency implies that there exists one that does ) .
The formal structure of a relation can easily be obtained with any collection of objects provided there are enough of them , so having the formal structure cannot single out a unique referent for this relation ; in order to do so we must stipulate that we are talking about the intended relation , which is to go beyond the structural description .
“ Thus on this view , only cardinality questions are open to discovery ! ” ( 1989 , 188 ) ; everything else will be known a priori .
This leads Demopoulos and Friedman to conclude that reducing a theory to its Ramsey sentence is equivalent to reducing it to its empirical consequences , and thus that : “ Russell 's realism collapses into a version of phenomenalism or strict empiricism after all : all theories with the same observational consequences will be equally true ” ( 1985 , 635 ) .
Similarly , Jane English ( 1973 ) argued , though on the basis of different considerations , that any two Ramsey sentences that are incompatible with one another cannot have all their observational consequences in common .
Hence it seems that if we treat a theory just as its Ramsey sentence then the notion of theoretical equivalence collapses onto that of empirical equivalence .
( Demopoulos 2003 argues that similar considerations show that structural empiricism also collapses truth to empirical adequacy ; he also discusses the relationship between Newman 's problem and Putnam 's Paradox .
Votsis 2003 argues that the conclusion of the Newman argument does n't undermine ESR after all .
Gordon Solomon 1989 defends Richard Braithwaite 's claim that Eddington 's structuralism ( see 4.1 below ) is vulnerable to Newman 's argument . )
Jeffery Ketland ( 2004 ) argues in detail that the Newman objection trivialises the Ramsey sentence formulation of ESR .
Worrall and Zahar ( 2001 ) argue that the cognitive content of a theory is exhausted by its Ramsey sentences but that , while the Ramsey sentence only expresses the empirical content of the theory , the notion of empirical content in play here is sufficient for a form of realism .
In his 2007 paper , Worrall sets out an account and defense of epistemic structural realism and responds to objections that have been raised to it , including the Newman problem .
Cruse ( 2005 ) and Melia and Saatsi ( 2006 ) defend the Ramsey sentence approach against model - theoretic arguments by questioning the assumption that all predicates which apply to unobservables must be eliminated in favour of bound variables .
Mixed predicates such as ‘ extended ’ are those that apply to both observable and unobservable objects .
The Newman objection does not go through if mixed predicates are not Ramsified , because a model of the Ramsey sentence will not necessarily be one in which what is claimed regarding the mixed properties and relations holds .
In response , Demopoulos ( 2008 ) points out that the Ramsey sentence of a theory with mixed predicates where the latter are not Ramsified will be true provided the original theory is satisfied — hence the claim that the content of the Ramsey sentence is merely the observational content of the original theory plus a cardinality claim is still true when mixed predicates are considered .
Melia and Saatsi ( 2006 ) also argue that intensional notions , such as naturalness and causal significance , may be applied to properties to save the Ramsey sentence formulation of ESR from triviality .
( This recalls the defence of Russell 's structuralism against Newman discussed in Hochberg 1994 . )
Demopoulos also raises two problems with this strategy : firstly , even non-natural relations can have significant claims made about them in a theory , and secondly , the cognitive significance of unramsified theories is independent of a commitment to ‘ real ’ or ‘ natural ’ relations .
Hence , Demopoulos insists that the Ramsey sentence of a theory and the theory itself are importantly different ( see also Psillos 2006 b ) .
Peter Ainsworth ( 2009 ) gives a clear and accessible account of the Newman problem and the responses that have been given to it .
In his ( 2011 ) Demopoulos argues that there are three very different views in the work of Russell , Ramsey , and Carnap respectively , which have in common versions of a core structuralist thesis that he identifies .
All the accounts he considers make use of Ramsey sentences ; Demopoulos investigates the logical properties of the Ramsey sentence and arrives at an argument against the structuralist thesis .
Friedman ( 2011 ) argues that Carnap ’s account of theoretical terms involving the Ramsey sentence approach is not vulnerable to the Newman problem .
The relationship between Friedman 's views on the relativized a priori and structural realism is interrogated in Ivanova ( 2011 ) .
Versions of ESR that employ the Ramsey sentence of a theory and the distinction between observational and theoretical terms are embedded in the so - called syntactic view of theories that adopts first - order quantificational logic as the appropriate form for the representation of physical theories .
According to Zahar ( 1994 , 14 ) the continuity in science is in the intension rather than the extension of its concepts .
He argues that if we believe that the mathematical structure of theories is fundamentally important for ontology , then we need a semantics for theories that addresses the representative role of mathematics directly .
Such an account of scientific representation is allegedly found in the so - called ‘ semantic ’ or ‘ model - theoretic ’ approach associated primarily with Patrick Suppes , Fred Suppe , Ron Giere and Bas van Fraassen ( see da Costa and French 2003 ) .
The relationship between structuralism and the semantic view is discussed by van Fraassen ( 1997 , 2008 ) , and Thomson - Jones ( 2011 ) .
Chris Pincock ( 2011 ) criticises structural realism on the basis of an analysis of the role of mathematics in scientific representation .
Ladyman ( 1998 ) , and Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) argue that the Newman problem does not arise for ontic structural realism since it eschews an extensional understanding of relations .
Ladyman ( 1998 ) argues that in general epistemological forms of structural realism do not significantly improve the prospects of standard scientific realism and that hence structural realism should be thought of as metaphysically rather than merely epistemically revisionary .
Structural realism is supposed to help with the problem of theory change .
As Maxwell himself pointed out , his structural realism is a purely semantic and epistemological theory .
The Ramsey sentence picks out exactly the same entities as the original theory .
It does not dispense with reference , but it makes that reference a function of the ( place of the theoretical terms in the ) overall structure of the theory , as manifested in the Ramsey sentence .
The problem of ontological discontinuity is left untouched by simply adopting Ramsification .
In fact , it seems even worse if contextualism about the meaning of theoretical terms is adopted .
Cei and French ( 2006 ) and Cruse ( 2005 ) also argue , on different grounds , that Ramsification is of no help to the structural realist .
Worrall 's position in his 1989 paper is not explicitly an epistemic one , and other comments suggest a different view : “ On the structural realist view what Newton really discovered are the relationships between phenomena expressed in the mathematical equations of his theory ” ( 1989 , 122 ) .
If the continuity in scientific change is of “ form or structure ” , then perhaps we should abandon commitment to even the putative reference of theories to objects and properties , and account for the success of science in other terms .
Others who have contributed to structural realism have more explicitly signalled a significant departure from traditional realist metaphysics .
For example , Howard Stein :
[ O ] ur science comes closest to comprehending ‘ the real ’ , not in its account of ‘ substances ’ and their kinds , but in its account of the ‘ Forms ’ which phenomena ‘ imitate ’ ( for ‘ Forms ’ read ‘ theoretical structures ’ , for ‘ imitate ’ , ‘ are represented by ’ ) .
( 1989 , 57 ) .
A crude statement of ESR is the claim that all we know is the structure of the relations between things and not the things themselves , and a corresponding crude statement of OSR is the claim that there are no ‘ things ’ and that structure is all there is ( this is called ‘ radical structuralism ’ by van Fraassen 2006 ) .
OSR has attracted most sympathy among some philosophers of physics and physicists .
This is natural since , while Worrall 's motivation for introducing structural realism was solely the need for a realist response to the pessimistic meta-induction , French and Ladyman introduced OSR to describe a form of structural realism motivated by two further problems :
identity and individuality of quantum particles and spacetime points , and entanglement ; scientific representation , in particular the role of models and idealisations in physics .
Their concern with ( a ) followed that of many of the pioneers of structuralism in twentieth - century philosophy of science including Cassirer , Eddington and Weyl .
( Russell 's and Carnap 's versions of structuralism were more directly motivated by epistemological and semantic problems than by ontological issues arising from physics . )
French did seminal work on the identity and individuality of quantum particles with Michael Redhead ( who also wrote a classic paper on theories and models ( 1980 ) and later endorsed structural realism as a way of interpreting quantum field theory ( 1999 ) ) .
More recently it has become more widespread to advocate OSR as a response to contemporary physics as a whole ( for example , see Tegmark 2007 ) .
Among others who have defended versions of OSR are Jonathan Bain ( 2003 and 2004 ) , Michael Esfeld ( 2004 ) and Esfeld and Lam ( 2008 ) , Aharon Kantorovich ( 2003 ) , Holgar Lyre ( 2004 ) , Gordon McCabe ( 2007 ) and John Stachel ( 2002 and 2006 ) .
Saunders and David Wallace have deployed structuralism to solve the problem of how macroscopic objects with more or less determinate properties can be recovered from the Everett interpretation of quantum states ( the so - called preferred basis problem ) ( Saunders 1993 b , 1995 , and Wallace 2003 ) .
OSR is also further elaborated in Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) and defended against various criticisms in French and Ladyman ( 2011 ) .
Quantum gravity and structuralism is discussed by an outstanding collection of philosophers and physicists in Rickles , French and Saatsi ( 2006 ) .
Ontic structural realists argue that what we have learned from contemporary physics is that the nature of space , time and matter are not compatible with standard metaphysical views about the ontological relationship between individuals , intrinsic properties and relations .
On the broadest construal OSR is any form of structural realism based on an ontological or metaphysical thesis that inflates the ontological priority of structure and relations .
The attempt to make this precise splinters OSR into different forms ( three of these are discussed in Ainsworth ( 2010 ) and he argues against two of them ) , and all of the following claims have been advocated by some defenders of OSR at some time :
(1) Eliminativism : there are no individuals ( but there is relational structure )
This view is associated with French and Ladyman .
The term ‘ eliminative structural realism ’ comes from Psillos ( 2001 ) .
It is criticised on the grounds that there cannot be relations without relata .
This objection has been made by various philosophers including Cao ( 2003 b ) , Dorato ( 1999 ) , Psillos ( 2001 , 2006 ) , Busch ( 2003 ) , Morganti ( 2004 ) and Chakravartty ( 1998 , 2003 ) who says : “ one cannot intelligibly subscribe to the reality of relations unless one is also committed to the fact that some things are related ” ( 1998 , 399 ) .
In other words , the question is , how can you have structure without individuals , or , in particular , how can we talk about a group without talking about the elements of a group ?
Even many of those sympathetic to the OSR of French and Ladyman have objected that they cannot make sense of the idea of relations without relata ( see 2004 , Esfeld and Lam 2008 , Lyre 2004 , and Stachel 2006 ) .
However , there are at least two ways to make sense of the idea of a relation without relata :
( I) The idea of a universal .
For example , when we refer to the relation referred to by ‘ larger than ’ , it is because we have an interest in its formal properties that are independent of the contingencies of its instantiation .
To say that all that there is are relations and no relata , is perhaps to follow Plato and say that the world of appearances is not properly thought of as part of the content of knowledge .
( See Esfeld and Lam 2008 : 5 , and the opening epigram in Psillos 2006 . )
This Platonic version of OSR is perhaps what Howard Stein has in mind :
… if one examines carefully how phenomena are ‘ represented ’ by the quantum theory … then … interpretation in terms of ‘ entities ’ and ‘ attributes ’ can be seen to be highly dubious …
I think the live problems concern the relation of the Forms … to phenomena , rather than the relation of ( putative ) attributes to ( putative ) entities … ( Stein 1989 , 59 ) .
( II ) The relata of a given relation always turn out to be relational structures themselves on further analysis .
As Stachel puts it , “ it 's relations all the way down ” ( although he denies the claim , 2006 ) .
See , Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) and Saunders ( 2003d , 129 ) .
The idea that there may be no fundamental level to reality is discussed in Schaffer ( 2003 ) .
In any case , eliminativism does not require that there be relations without relata , just that the relata not be individuals .
French and Krause ( 2006 ) argue that quantum particles and spacetime points are not individuals but that they are objects in a minimal sense , and they develop a non-classical logic according to which such non-individual objects can be the values of first - order variables , but ones for which the law of identity , ‘ for all x , x is identical to x ’ , does not hold ( but neither does ‘x is not identical to x ’ ) .
There is no unanimity about the difference between individuals , objects and entities among philosophers but one neutral way of putting the issue is to ask whether there are only individual objects in the logical sense of object as the value of a first - order variable , or whether there are individuals in some more substantive sense ( for example , being subject to laws of identity , or being substances ) .
Jonathan Bain ( 2013 ) argues that critics of radical ontic structural realism have implicitly relied on a set - theoretic notion of structure and that a category theoretic formulation of ontic structural realism is useful in explicating the structure of physical theories , in particular , general relativity .
(2) There are relations ( or relational facts ) that do not supervene on the intrinsic and spatio - temporal properties of their relata .
The interpretation of entangled states in quantum mechanics in terms of strongly non-supervenient relations goes back to Cleland ( 1984 ) .
However , the idea that there could be relations which do not supervene on the non-relational properties of their relata runs counter to a deeply entrenched way of thinking among some philosophers .
The standard conception of structure is either set theoretic or logical .
Either way it is often assumed that a structure is fundamentally composed of individuals and their intrinsic properties , on which all relational structure supervenes .
The view that this conceptual structure reflects the structure of the world is called “ particularism ” by Paul Teller ( 1989 ) and “ exclusive monadism ” by Dipert ( 1997 ) .
It has been and is endorsed by many philosophers , including , for example , Aristotle and Leibniz .
Spatio - temporal relations are often exempted from this prescription since the idea that the position of an object is intrinsic to it is associated with a very strong form of substantivalism .
Hence , the standard view is that the relations between individuals other than their spatio- temporal relations supervene on the intrinsic properties of the relata and their spatio - temporal relations .
This is David Lewis 's Humean supervenience :
[ A]ll there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact , just one little thing and then another …
We have geometry : a system of external relations of spatio temporal distance between points ( of spacetime , point matter , aether or fields or both ) .
And at these points we have local qualities : perfectly natural intrinsic properties which need nothing bigger than a point at which to be instantiated …
All else supervenes on that ( 1986 , x ) .
Tim Maudlin argues against Lewis's Humean Supervenience on the basis of quantum entanglement and argues that this means the end of ontological reductionism , and abandoning the combinatorial conception of reality that comes from thinking of the world as made of building blocks , each of which exists independently of the others ( 1998 , 59 ) and : “ The world is not just a set of separately existing localized objects , externally related only by space and time ” ( 60 ) .
Similarly , advocates of OSR such as Esfeld , French and Ladyman emphasise that the non-supervenient relations implied by quantum entanglement undermine the ontological priority conferred on individuals in most traditional metaphysics .
Some relations are at least ontologically on a par with individuals so that either relations are ontologically primary or neither is ontologically primary or secondary .
( Esfeld 2004 and Oliver Pooley 2006 hold the latter view but Esfeld goes further and claims that if there are intrinsic properties they are ontologically secondary and derivative of relational properties ( see below ) . )
(3) Individual objects have no intrinsic natures .
On this view , individual objects of a particular kind are qualitatively identical .
They are not individuated by an haecceity or primitive thisness .
Classical particles can be and often are so regarded .
Classical particles could be so regarded because if a principle of impenetrability is adhered to , no two such particles ever have all the same spatio - temporal properties .
The bundle theory of individuation was developed by empiricists to account for the individuation of physical objects while only quantifying over properties that are within the reach of natural science .
This is a standard metaphysical position that implies nothing so radical as any version of OSR .
Its interest lies in the fact that on this view it would seem that the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles ( PII ) , restricted so that identity involving properties are not in its scope , must be true .
If so there are some properties ( perhaps including spatio - temporal properties ) that distinguish each thing from every other thing , and the identity and individuality of physical objects can be reduced to other facts about them .
The problem is with Quantum Mechanics for it seems there are entangled quantum states of many particles that attribute exactly the same intrinsic and relational properties to each of them .
For example , the famous singlet state of two fermions , such as electrons , attributes to the pair the relation that their spins in any given direction are opposite to each other , but does not attribute a definite spin in any direction to either particle alone .
Given that they may also be attributed exactly the same spatial wavefunction , as when they are both in the first orbit of an atom , for example , then such particles would seem to violate PII .
This leads to a dilemma that was articulated by Steven French and Michael Redhead ( 1988 ) ; either quantum particles are not individuals , or they are individuals but the principle of individuation that applies to them must make reference to some kind of empirically transcendent haecceity , bare particularity or the like .
Katherine Brading and Alexander Skyles ( 2012 ) consider the plausibility of arguing for structural realism on the basis of this underdetermination .
Saunders argues that there is no underdetermination ( see ( 5 ) below ) .
The appeal to this metaphysical underdetermination is criticised by Chakravartty 2003 , who argues that it cannot be significant since it also obtains in the case of everyday objects .
Morganti ( 2004 ) argues in favour of transcendental individuation , and also points out that if quantum mechanics is not complete and there are hidden variables as in Bohm theory , the quantum particles may be individuated by their intrinsic and spatio - temporal properties after all .
(4) There are individual entities but they do n't have any irreducible intrinsic properties .
Michael Esfeld ( 2004 ) rejects ( 1 ) and claims that :
( a ) relations require relata
but denies that :
( b ) these things must have intrinsic properties over and above the relations in which they stand .
As mentioned above Esfeld holds that there are things and relations but neither is ontologically primary or secondary .
On this view , all the properties of individual objects are relations to other objects .
This view is called ‘ moderate structural realism ’ by Esfeld ( and Esfeld and Lam 2008 , 2010 and see also their 2012 ) .
It avoids the problems with ( 1 ) above , and incorporates ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .
Any version of ( 4 ) that is combined with ( 3 ) arguably makes individual entities ontologically dependent on relational structure ( see ( 6 ) below ) .
Benacerraf ( 1965 ) argues that there cannot be objects possessing only structural properties .
The idea of such objects is denounced as ‘ mysticism ’ by Dummett ( 1991 ) , and criticised in the context of structural realism by Busch ( 2003 ) .
These objections go back to Russell :
… it is impossible that the ordinals should be , as Dedekind suggests , nothing but the terms of such relations as constitute a progression .
If they are to be anything at all , they must be intrinsically something ; they must differ from other entities as points from instants , or colours from sounds .
What Dedekind intended to indicate was probably a definition by means of the principle of abstraction …
But a definition so made always indicates some class of entities having … a genuine nature of their own ( 1903 , p. 249 ) .
On the other hand , D.W. Mertz ( 1996 ) defends ‘ network instance realism ’ and rejects the ‘ tyranny of the monadic ’ arguing that individuated relation instances are ontologically fundamental .
(5) Facts about the identity and diversity of objects are ontologically dependent on the relational structures of which they are part .
Saunders ( 2003a , 2003 b and 2006 ) argues that there is a weakened form of PII ( discussed by Quine 1976 ) that is satisfied even by electrons in the singlet state described above .
The notion of ‘ weak discernibility ’ applies to objects that satisfy some irreflexive relation ( a relation such that xRx does not obtain for every x ) .
The relation of having opposite spin that is had by electrons in the singlet state is clearly such an irreflexive relation and Saunders argues that , since by Leibniz 's law , the holding of an irreflexive relation aRb entails the existence of distinct relata a and b , then the electrons are individuals , even though in so far as they are individuals it is the relations among them that account for this .
This runs counter to the usual way of thinking according to which there are individuals in spacetime whose existence is independent of each other and that facts about the identity and diversity of these individuals are determined independently of their relations to each other ( Stachel 2006 calls this ‘ intrinsic individuality ’ ) .
It is widely held that relations between individuals cannot individuate those same individuals : “ relations presuppose numerical diversity and so cannot account for it ” .
The argument is that without distinct individuals that are metaphysically prior to the relations , there is nothing to stand in the irreflexive relations that are supposed to confer individuality on the relata .
The issue was famously discussed by Russell ( 1911 ) , and see also MacBride ( 2006 ) .
Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) , Saunders ( 2006 ) and Stachel ( 2006 ) argue that facts about the identity and diversity of fermions are not intrinsic obtain only in virtue of the relations into which they enter .
On this view the individuality of quantum particles is ontologically on a par with , or secondary to the relational structure of which they are parts .
Stachel ( 2006 ) calls this ‘ contextual individuality ’ and he extends this to spacetime points ( see 4.3 below ) .
Leitgeb and Ladyman ( 2008 ) note that in the case of mathematical structures there is nothing to rule out the possibility that the identity and diversity of objects in a structure is a primitive feature of the structure as a whole that is not accounted for by any other facts about it .
Ladyman ( 2007 ) also discusses such primitive contextual individuality .
One important question so far not discussed is whether on the contextualist view the identity and diversity of the objects depends on the whole structure or just part of it .
The relationship between OSR and PII is assessed in Ainsworth ( 2011 ) .
Ladyman , Linnebo , and Richard Pettigrew ( 2013 ) present some relevant results in philosophical logic .
(6) There are no subsistent objects and relational structure is ontologically subsistent .
This claim is associated with quantum holism and holism more generally ( see Horgan and Potrc 2000 and 2002 ) .
As mentioned above this is arguably implied by the conjunction of ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and also by ( 5 ) .
The basic idea of ontological subsistence is that of being able to exist without anything else existing .
The notions of ontological dependence and ontological subsistence are often employed in discussions of structuralism but are in need of clarification ( see Linnebo 2008 ) .
Kerry McKenzie ( forthcoming ) uses
Fine 's recent analyses of ontological dependence to argue against eliminativist OSR and in favour of moderate structural realism based on a case study from particle physics .
(7) Individual objects are constructs
French ( 1999 ) and French and Ladyman ( 2003a ) maintain that individuals have only a heuristic role .
Poincaré similarly argued that “ the gross matter which is furnished us by our sensations was but a crutch for our infirmity ” ( 1898 , 41 ) .
Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) argue that objects are pragmatic devices used by agents to orient themselves in regions of spacetime , and to construct approximate representations of the world .
Anyone who defends eliminativism as in ( 1 ) above must similarly offer a non-ad hoc account of the point and value of reference to and generalization over objects in science .
For example , cognitive science may show that we are not able to think about certain domains without hypostatising individuals as the bearers of structure .
This is as yet mere speculation and a subject for further study .
The articles in Landry and Rickles ( eds. ) ( 2012 ) explore some of the above issues .
See McKenzie's ( 2013 ) review of the collection .
See also the collection Bokulich and Bokulich ( eds. ) ( 2011 ) .
Joanna Wolff ( 2012 ) considers the relationship between objects and structures , arguing that the former are not reducible to the latter and suggesting that a form of ontic structural realism may be defended in terms of the claim that objects are ontologically dependent on structures .
Group theory was first developed to describe symmetry .
A symmetry is a transformation of some structure or object which leaves it unchanged in some respect .
A group of symmetry transformations is a mathematical object which consists of the set of transformations , including the identity transformation and the inverse of each transformation , and the operation of composing them , where the result of two composed transformations is itself in the original set .
Mathematical objects can be characterised in terms of which symmetry transformations leave them unchanged or invariant .
The founders of structuralism shared an appreciation of the importance of group theory in the ontology of physics .
Cassirer held that the possibility of talking of ‘ objects ’ in a context is the possibility of individuating invariants ( 1944 ) .
Similarly , Max Born says : “ Invariants are the concepts of which science speaks in the same way as ordinary language speaks of ‘ things ’ , and which it provides with names as if they were ordinary things ” ( 1953 , 149 ) , and : “ The feature which suggests reality is always some kind of invariance of a structure independent of the aspect , the projection ” ( 149 ) .
He goes so far as to say : “ I think the idea of invariant is the clue to a relational concept of reality , not only in physics but in every aspect of the world . ” ( 144 ) .
Eddington says : “ What sort of thing is it that I know ?
The answer is structure .
To be quite precise it is structure of the kind defined and investigated in the mathematical theory of groups ” ( 1939 , 147 ) .
Poincaré understands group structure in Kantian terms as a pure form of the understanding .
The idea then is that we have various representations of some physical structure which may be transformed or translated into one another , and then we have an invariant state under such transformations which represents the objective state of affairs .
The group structure is primary and the group representations constructed from this structure have a derivative status .
Representations are extraneous to physical states but they allow our empirical knowledge of them .
Objects are picked out by the identification of invariants with respect to the transformations relevant to the context .
Thus , on this view , elementary particles are hypostatisations of sets of quantities that are invariant under the symmetry groups of particle physics .
For example , one of the most fundamental distinctions between kinds of particles is that between fermions and bosons .
This was described group theoretically by Weyl and Wigner in terms of the group of permutations , and the former 's approach to relativity theory was similarly group - theoretic .
In the case of quantum mechanics Weyl asserts that : “ All quantum numbers , with the exception of the so - called principal quantum number , are indices characterising representations of groups . ” ( 1931 , xxi )
The central point of philosophical relevance here is that the mathematical idea of invariance is taken by Weyl to characterise the notion of objectivity .
It is this that liberates physics from the parochial confines of a particular coordinate system .
For Weyl appearances are open only to intuition ( in the Kantian sense of subjective perception ) and therefore agreement is obtained by giving objective status only to those relations that are invariant under particular transformations .
Weyl 's views have recently been revived by Sunny Auyang ( 1995 ) in an explicitly neo-Kantian project which attempts to solve the problem of objectivity in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .
Auyang seeks to extract the “ primitive conceptual structure ” in physical theories and she too finds it in what she calls the “ representation - transformation - invariant structure ” .
This is essentially group - theoretic structure .
Auyang , like Born and Weyl , thinks that such invariant structure under transformations is what separates an objective state of affairs from its various representations , or manifestations to observers under different perceptual conditions .
According to her events are individuated structurally .
Ryckman ( 2005 ) describes the history of relativity theory and Weyl 's role in it .
Ryckman argues that the work of Eddington and Weyl was profoundly influenced by the phenomenology of Husserl .
The latter also seems to have understood objectivity in terms of invariance .
( Ryckman calls Kantian structural realism “ transcendental structuralism ” .
OSR is what he calls ‘ transcendent structuralism ’. )
Group theory in the development of structuralism deserves further historical analysis .
It played a crucial role in epistemological reflections on geometry in relation to Klein 's Erlanger programme ( Birkhoff and Bennett 1988 ) .
French ( 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ) and Castellani ( 1998 ) have explored the ontological representation of the fundamental objects of physics in terms of sets of group - theoretic invariants by Cassirer , Eddington , Schrödinger , Weyl , Wigner , Piron , Jauch and others .
On the other hand , Roberts ( 2011 ) criticizes the idea that structure can be understood as group structure in the context of quantum physics .
Cassirer rejected the Aristotelian idea of individual substances on the basis of physics , and argued that the metaphysical view of the ‘ material point ’ as an individual object cannot be sustained in the context of field theory .
He offers a structuralist conception of the field :
The field is not a ‘ thing ’ , it is a system of effects ( Wirkungen ) , and from this system no individual element can be isolated and retained as permanent , as being ‘ identical with itself ’ through the course of time .
The individual electron no longer has any substantiality in the sense that it per se est et per se concipitur ; it ‘ exists ’ only in its relation to the field , as a ‘ singular location ’ in it ( 1936 , 178 ) .
In gauge quantum field theories , which are our best contemporary physical theories of all the forces other than gravity , each theory is associated with a different symmetry group , and the unification of theories was achieved by looking for theoretical structures with the relevant combined symmetry .
( For example , the unitary group U ( 1 ) for quantum electrodynamics , U ( 2 ) for the unified electroweak theory and SU ( 3 ) / Z( 3 ) for the strong interaction . )
Lyre argues for OSR in the interpretation of quantum field theory .
He argues that “ the traditional picture of spatiotemporally fixed object - like entities is undermined by the ontology of gauge theories in various ways and that main problems with traditional scientific realism …can be softened by a commitment to the structural content of gauge theories , in particular to gauge symmetry groups ” ( 2004 , 666 ) .
He goes on to note that his favoured interpretation of gauge theories ( in terms of non-separable holonomies ) is one according to which the fundamental objects are ontologically secondary to structure because the objects of a theory are members of equivalence classes under symmetry transformations and no further individuation of objects is possible .
Similarly , Kantorovich ( 2003 ) argues that the symmetries of the strong force are ontologically prior to the particles that feel that force , namely the hadrons , and likewise for the symmetries of the so - called ‘ grand unification ’ of particle physics in the standard model .
Cao in his book on quantum field theory sometimes sounds like an ontic structural realist , because he denies that the structures postulated by field theories must be “ ontologically supported by unobservable entities ” ( Cao 1997 , 5 ) .
However , in his ( 2003a ) he explicitly criticises OSR and argues for a version of ESR in the context of a discussion of quantum field theory .
Critics of OSR may argue that the claim of metaphysical underdetermination in the case of non-relativistic many particle quantum mechanics is resolved by the shift to quantum field theory .
This is especially plausible when it comes to quantum field theory in a curved spacetime since in that context , “ a useful particle interpretation of states does not , in general , exist ” ( Wald 1984 , 47 , quoted in Stachel 2006 , 58 ) .
See also Malament ( 1996 ) and Clifton and Halvorson ( 2002 ) , who show that there is a fundamental conflict between relativistic quantum field theory and the existence of localisable particles .
There are so called unitarily inequivalent representations of quantum field theories and Howard ( 2001 ) argues that this poses a problem for structural realism , and French ( 2012 ) replies .
Field quantities are usually attributed to space - time points or regions .
The problem of individuality now concerns whether fields themselves are individuals , or whether they are the properties of spacetime points .
In the latter case the problem becomes whether the spacetime points are individuals .
This last question is bound up with the debate about substantivalism in the foundations of General Relativity .
There has been much dispute about whether General Relativity supports relationism or substantivalism about spacetime .
The main problem for the latter is the general covariance of the field equations of General Relativity : any spacetime model and its image under a diffeomorphism ( a infinitely differentiable , one - one and onto mapping of the model to itself ) are in all observable respects equivalent to one another ; all physical properties are expressed in terms of generally covariant relationships between geometrical objects .
In other words , since the points of spacetime are entirely indiscernible one from another , it makes no difference if we swap their properties around so long as the overall structure remains the same .
This is made more apparent by the so - called ‘ hole argument ’ which shows that if diffeomorphic models are regarded as physically distinct then there is a breakdown of determinism .
Substantivalists cannot just bite the bullet and accept this since , as John Earman and John Norton ( 1987 ) argue , the question of determinism ought to be settled on empirical / physical grounds and not a priori ones .
There have been a variety of responses to this problem .
Lewis ( 1986 ) and Carol Brighouse ( 1994 ) suggest accepting haecceitism about spacetime points , but argue that it should not worry us that haecceitistic determinism , that is determinism with respect to which points end up with which metrical properties , fails .
Melia ( 1999 ) also criticises the notion of determinism employed by Earman and Norton .
Nonetheless most philosophers of physics seem to have concluded that if spacetime points do have primitive identity then the substantivalist who is committed to them must regard the failure of haecceitistic determinism as a genuine failure of determinism .
Hence , others have sought to modify the substantivalism .
Robert DiSalle ( 1994 ) suggests that the correct response to the hole argument is that the structure of spacetime be accepted as existent despite its failure to supervene on the reality of spacetime points .
A similar view has been proposed by Carl Hoefer , who argues that the problems for spacetime substantivalism turn on the “ ascription of primitive identity to space - time points ” ( 1996 , 11 ) .
Hence , it seems that the insistence on interpreting spacetime in terms of an ontology of underlying entities and their properties is what causes the problems for realism about spacetime .
This is a restatement of the position developed by Stein ( 1968 ) in his famous exchange with Grünbaum , according to which spacetime is neither a substance , not a set of relations between substances , but a structure in its own right .
Similarly , Oliver Pooley ( 2007 ) argues that eliminativism about individual spacetime points can be avoided without any tension with General Relativity , if it is accepted that the facts about their identity and diversity is grounded in relations they bear to each other .
His sophisticated substantivalism allows that spacetime points be individuated relationally and not independently of the metric field .
This means embracing contextual individuality grounded in relational structure .
See also Cassirer who says : “ To such a [ spacetime ] point also no being in itself can be ascribed ; it is constituted by a definite aggregate of relations and consists in this aggregate . ” ( 1936 , 195 )
The analogy between the debate about substantivalism , and the debate about whether quantum particles are individuals was first explicitly made by Ladyman ( 1998 ) , but others such as Stachel ( 2002 ) and Saunders ( 2003a and 2003 b ) have elaborated it .
However , Pooley ( 2006 ) argues that there is no such analogy , or at least not a very deep one , in part because he thinks that there is no metaphysical underdetermination in GR .
According to him the standard formulations of the theory are ontologically committed to the metric field , and the latter is most naturally interpreted as representing “ spacetime structure ” ( 8 ) .
Others who have discussed structural realism and spacetime include , Dorato ( 2000 ) who discusses spacetime and structural realism but rejects OSR , Esfeld and Lam ( 2008 and 2012 ) who argue for moderate ontic structural realism about spacetime , and Bain ( 2003 ) , who says that : “ Conformal structure , for instance , can be realised on many different types of ‘ individuals ’ : manifold points , twisters or multivectors … What is real , the spacetime structuralist will claim , is the structure itself and not the manner in which alternative formalisms instantiate it ” ( 25 ) .
As explained above , there are many different forms of structural realism and correspondingly , many different objections have been leveled against it .
Obviously , ESR and OSR attract very different kinds of objections .
Different forms of structural realism and different forms of objections to it are also reviewed in Frigg and Votsis ( 2011 ) .
( 1 ) Structural realism collapses into standard realism .
Psillos ( 1995 ) argues that any form of structural realism must presuppose a distinction between the form and content of a theory , and / or a distinction between our ability to know the structure and our ability to know the nature of the world .
Both these distinctions are illusory according to Psillos because the scientific revolution banished mysterious forms and substances that might not be fully describable in structural terms .
For Psillos , properties in mature science are defined by the laws in which they feature , and “ the nature and the structure of a physical entity form a continuum ” ( 1995 ) .
Hence , for Psillos , structural realism is either false or collapses into traditional realism .
( This is the response of Richard Braithwaite ( 1940 , 463 ) to Eddington 's structuralism . )
Similarly , David Papineau argues that “ restriction of belief to structural claims is in fact no restriction at all ” ( Papineau 1996 , 12 ) , hence structural realism gains no advantage over traditional realism with the problem of theory change because it fails to make any distinction between parts of theories that should and should not enjoy our ontological commitment .
Kyle Stanford ( 2003 , 570 ) also argues that we cannot distinguish the structural claims of theories from their claims about content or natures .
(2) Is n't structure also lost in theory change ?
Many people 's first response to structural realism is to point out that mathematical structure is often lost in theory change too ( see , for example , Chakravartty 2004 , 164 , Stanford 2003 , 570 –572 ) .
The realist is claiming that we ought to believe what our best scientific theories say about the furniture of the world in the face of the fact that we have inductive grounds for believing this will be radically revised , whereas the structural realist is only claiming that theories represent the relations among , or structure of , the phenomena and in most scientific revolutions the empirical content of the old theory is recovered as a limiting case of the new theory .
As Post claimed , there simply are no ‘ Kuhn - losses ’ , in the sense of successor theories losing all or part of the well confirmed empirical structures of their predecessors ( 1971 , 229 ) .
In sum , we know that well - confirmed relations among phenomena must be retained by future theories .
This goes beyond mere belief in the empirical adequacy of our theories if we suppose that the relations in question are genuine modal relations rather than extensional generalizations about concrete actual phenomena .
However , Newman ( 2010 ) argues that structuralism cannot deal with the pessimistic meta-induction .
(3) Structural realism is too metaphysically revisionary .
The considerations from physics do not logically compel us to abandon the idea of a world of distinct ontologically subsistent individuals with intrinsic properties .
The identity and individuality of quantum particles could be grounded in each having a primitive thisness , and the same could be true of spacetime points .
Physics does seem to tell us that certain aspects of such a world would be unknowable .
The epistemic structural realist thinks that all we can know is structure , but it is the structure of an unknowable realm of individuals .
An epistemic structural realist may insist in a Kantian spirit that there being such objects is a necessary condition for our empirical knowledge of the world .
It may be argued that it is impossible to conceive of relational structures without making models of them in terms of domains of individuals .
Certainly , the structuralist faces a challenge in articulating her views to contemporary philosophers schooled in modern logic and set theory , which retains the classical framework of individual objects , and where a structure is just a particular set , namely a set of objects , and a set of relations , where the latter are thought of extensionally as just sets of ordered pairs ( or more generally n- tuples in the case of n- place relations ) .
Psillos ( 2001 ) argues that OSR is not ‘ worked out ’ as a metaphysics , and that a strong burden of proof is on those who would abandon traditional metaphysics ( see also Chakravartty ( 2004 ) and Morganti ( 2011 ) .
However , it is far from clear that OSR 's rivals are ‘ worked out ’ in any sense that OSR is n't .
There in no general agreement among philosophers that any of the metaphysical theories of , say , universals is adequate , and arguably metaphysical categories inherited from the ancient Greeks are not appropriate for contemporary science .
Naturalists argue that we should reject metaphysical doctrines if they are not supported by science .
Michael Esfeld ( 2004 , 614–616 ) argues against any gap between epistemology and metaphysics .
Similarly Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) argue for a kind of verificationism in metaphysics .
In sum , structuralists may agree with what Ernan McMullin says :
[ I ] maginability must not be made the test for ontology .
The realist claim is that the scientist is discovering the structures of the world ; it is not required in addition that these structures be imaginable in the categories of the macroworld .
( 1984 , 14 )
(4) Structuralists can't account for causation .
Busch ( 2003 ) , Psillos ( 2006a ) and Chakravartty ( 2003 ) all argue that individual objects are central to productive rather than Humean conceptions of causation and hence to any genuine explanation of change .
Objects it is alleged provide the ‘ active principle ’ of change and causation .
French ( 2006 ) replies to this charge invoking the idea of Ladyman ( 1998 and 2004 ) and French and Ladyman ( 2003 ) of modal structure , by which is meant the relationships among phenomena that pertain to necessity , possibility , potentiality , and probability .
Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) defend a version of OSR according to which science describes the objective modal structure of the world , where the latter is ontologically fundamental , in the sense of not supervening on the intrinsic properties of a set of individuals .
They argue that causal structure is the pragmatically essential proxy for it in the special sciences ( but not necessarily in fundamental physics ) .
( Ladyman ( 2008 ) considers the causal exclusion argument in this context . )
Nora Berenstain and Ladyman ( 2012 ) argue that a commitment to natural necessity is implicit in arguments for scientific realism and that realists including structural realists should be anti-Humean and believe in objective modal structure .
See also Esfeld ( 2009 ) and for a Humean take on structural realism , Lyre ( 2010 ) .
The structure of dispositions described by Mumford ( 2004 ) and Psillos 's ( 2003 ) idea of nomological structure are cognate to the idea of modal structure .
Giere ( 1986 ) first suggested that a form of structural realism was the result of conjoining modal realism with constructive empiricism .
There is a forthcoming special issue of Synthese dedicated to examining the relationship between structuralism and causation .
See also the ' final section ' of articles on single modality and causality in structural realism in Landry and Rickles ( 2012 ) .
(5) Without positing knowledge of individual objects we cannot explain why certain properties and relations tend to cohere .
This objection is due to Chakravartty ( 2003 ) who points out that certain properties tend to be found together , for example , negative charge and a certain rest mass , and then asks ‘ coincidence or object ?’.
French ( 2006 ) replies arguing that for a structuralist objects just are literally coincidences and nothing more .
Once again the challenge for the critic of structuralism is to show that more than the minimal logical notion of an object is required .
(6) Structural realism only applies to physics .
Gower ( 2000 ) argues that structural realism seems less natural a position when applied to theories from outside of physics .
Mark Newman ( 2005 ) argues that structural realism only applies to the mathematical sciences in therefore cannot account for retention of theoretical commitments across theory change in , for example , biology .
On the other hand , Harold Kincaid ( 2008 ) and Ross ( 2008 ) defend structural realist approaches to the social sciences , as do Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) .
French ( 2011 ) considers the implications of ontic structural realism for the ontology of biology .
(7) Structural Realism collapses the distinction between the mathematical and the physical .
Many structuralists are motivated by the thought that if mathematics describes its domain only up to isomorphism , if in other words , it only describes the structure of the domain , once the scientific description of the world becomes largely mathematical , then scientific knowledge too becomes structural knowledge .
However , it may then be argued that if only the structure of mathematical theories is relevant to ontology in mathematics , and only structural aspects of the mathematical formalism of physical theories are relevant to ontology in physics , then there is nothing to distinguish physical and mathematical structure .
Van Fraassen argues that the heart of the problem with OSR is this :
It must imply : what has looked like the structure of something with unknown qualitative features is actually all there is to nature .
But with this , the contrast between structure and what is not structure has disappeared .
Thus , from the point of view of one who adopts this position , any difference between it and ‘ ordinary ’ scientific realism also disappears .
It seems then that , once adopted , it is not be called structuralism at all !
For if there is no non-structure , there is no structure either .
But for those who do not adopt the view , it remains startling : from an external or prior point of view , it seems to tell us that nature needs to be entirely re-conceived .
( 2006 , pp. 292-293 )
The essence of van Fraassen 's objection here is that the difference between mathematical ( uninstantiated / abstract ) structure , and physical ( instantiated / concrete ) structure cannot itself be explained in purely structural terms .
There is an analogy here with the theory of universals and the problem of exemplification .
A similar complaint is made by Cao ( 2003a and 2003 b ) .
Esfeld ( 2013 ) uses this objection in the context of the interpretation of quantum mechanics to pose a dilemma for ontic structural realism .
Saunders ( 2003d ) points out that there is no reason to think that ontic structural realists are committed to the idea that the structure of the world is mathematical .
Ladyman and Ross ( 2007 ) argue that no account can be given of what makes the world - structure physical and not mathematical .
On the other hand , Tegmark ( 2007 ) explicitly embraces a Pythagorean form of OSR .
There are two versions of mathematical structuralism : a realist view according to which mathematical structures exist independently of their concrete instantiations ; and an eliminativist position according to which statements about mathematical structures are disguised generalisations about their instantiations that exemplify them ( see Shapiro 1997 , 149–50 . )
For an excellent survey see Reck and Price ( 2000 ) .
The most well known advocates of realist structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics are Parsons ( 1990 ) , Resnik ( 1997 ) and Shapiro ( 1997 ) .
Recent critiques include Hellman ( 2005 ) and MacBride ( 2005 ) .
The relationship between ontic structural realism and ante rem structuralism has been explored by Psillos ( 2006a ) , Busch ( 2003 ) , French ( 2006 ) , Pooley ( 2006a ) , Leitgeb and Ladyman ( 2008 ) , Ladyman ( 2007 )
Informational structural realism in the context of the foundations of computer science is defended by Floridi ( 2008 ) .
Structuralism has also become popular in metaphysics recently in the form of causal essentialism .
This is the doctrine that the causal relations that properties bear to other properties exhaust their natures .
See Shoemaker ( 1980 ) and Hawthorne ( 2001 ) .
Steven Mumford ( 2004 ) adopts a structuralist theory of properties .
Alexander Bird's ( 2007 ) theory of dispositions is in some ways structuralist .
Anjan Chakravartty 's ( 2007 ) deploys dispositional essentialism in the defence of scientific realism .
Michael Esfeld ( 2011 ) discusses structuralism about powers .
Finally , Verity Harte ( 2002 ) discusses an interesting Platonic form of structuralism .
Alistair Isaac ( forthcoming ) argues for structural realism for secondary qualities .

( CNN ) -- Edo Berger got an alert early last Thursday morning when a satellite detected a 10 - second blast of energy known as a gamma ray burst coming from outer space .
The exploding star was up to 100 times larger than our own sun , pictured above .
Telescopes around the world swiveled to focus on the explosion , soon picking up infrared radiation , which is produced after gamma rays in this kind of event .
Berger was ready to view the visible light , which should have followed .
It never arrived .
" We were kind of blown away .
We immediately knew what that meant , " Berger said .
What it meant was that he was looking at the oldest thing ever spotted -- an enormous star exploding 13 billion years ago .
" At that point the age of the universe was only 600 million years , " he said .
In other words , Berger said , he was looking " 95 percent of the way back to the beginning of time . "
The star which exploded was 30 to 100 times larger than our own sun , and when it died , it gave off " about million times the amount of energy the sun will release in its entire lifetime , " Berger told CNN by phone from Harvard University , where he is an assistant professor of astronomy .
Its death throes produced so much energy that " momentarily , we can essentially see it anywhere in the universe , " Berger said .
The object , known as GRB 090423 , is about 200 million years older than the previous record - holder for oldest object ever seen .
Berger is n't just interested in the record books , though -- the gamma ray burst extended the frontiers of human knowledge about the history of the universe .
" We learn that already massive stars were around 600 million years after the universe formed , " Berger said .
" We suspected that , but now we have proof .
Now that we know these objects are so bright , in the next few years we should be able to pinpoint exactly at what stage in the evolution of the universe stars and galaxies formed . "
" There are theories " about when that happened , Berger said , " But they are all over the place .
People let their imaginations run wild . "
Given the discovery last week -- which was announced Tuesday -- Berger thinks it is possible that he will soon have a clear answer .
" If we talk in a few years , hopefully I would be able to tell you exactly when that happened , " he said .
The gamma radiation from GRB 090423 , which took 13 billion years to reach earth , was detected by a NASA satellite called Swift .
The infrared radiation was detected by the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii .
Fernseher und Farbfernseher aus der Anfangzeit des Fernsehens und des Farbfernsehens - Homepage Eckhard Etzold
Those which live with everyday television today can't image how television began in the 1920s and 1930s .
But believe it or not , television was earlier invented than the electric light bulb .
Paul Nipkow was born in 1860 .
The idea to scan a picture ith the spiral scanning disk came in his mind on christmas eve 1883 .
The scanning disk divided the picture into lines which were scanned from the top to the bottom of the frame .
The disk had to spin so fast that the human eye did n't notice the single line and frame writing , but only see the whole picture .
But Nipkow was not the father of television like many Germans claimed .
Before him , the Scottish clockmaker Alexander Bain invented the facsimile ( fax ) .
He used a kind of detector , installed on a pendulum , to scan a picture on a paper point by point , line by line .
The pendulum was synchronized by a metronome .
The first attemps for transmitting a moving picture used one transmitting wire for one selenic cell , connected with a lamp in the receiver .
For a panel of 100 cells per line and 100 lines , 10,000 whires were necessary .
The french inventor Constantin Senlecq had the idea three years before Nipkow invented the television scanning disk , to transmit the video signal seriell with one wire .
Therefore the picture was scanned in lines .
Behind a panel of photosensitive cells a rotating switch scanned the picture line for line .
In the receiver the same rotating switch connected lamps line for line .
While Senlecq described the theoretical basics of scanning and transmitting a television picture , Nipkow found a practical way to scan moving pictures with a high frame rate .
But he had to wait until the photoelectric cell and electronic amplifying was invented until the first working televisors were realized .
This kind of television is called mechanical television because the frame scanning was done with a mechanical disk instead of iconoscopes and kinescopes .
The first condition for mechanical television is a scanning disk .
I have got it from Peter F. Yanczer , together with a D.C. motor and a hub .
The scanning disk has a diameter of 12 inches and has a row of 32 holes in an inner circle for synchronisation .
This format is similar to that what was introduced by John Logie Baird in 1928 in Great Britain .
Those which want to built a scanning disk for themselfes can download here a zipped Excel - file .
( For creating a simple scanning disk copy the diagram into a vector graphic program and print it on a black piece of paper ( with yellow ink ) .
Then sting the holes with a needle .
Be careful with the center hole , this had to be very exact , otherwise the lines will overwrite each other .
For the first attemps I took a piece of wood with two corner tins , which hold the Nipkow disk .
Beneath the corner tins , the motor was fixed .
Behind the disk on the right side six LEDs were placed , every LED with a 47 Ohm resistor in series .
The motor was driven by a controlled D.C. - output transformer for model trains .
The LEDs were connected over a 20 Ohm resistor directly with the audio output of a stereo amplifier .
Parallel to the LEDs a 4.5 volts battery together with a 10 Ohm resistor was applied for generation the break - though voltage of the LEDs .
With this very simple construction it was possible to generate the first television pictures on the Nipkow disk .
The room was dimmed .
But only som white slopes and lines were visible .
I had to turn the polarity of the audio output .
The motor synchronisation must be done manually with the D.C. control .
It is very difficult to take a photo of a movie while synchronising the disk with the other hand and keep the vertical hold .
Better than the photos here are the impression of the MPEG videos .
Click MPEG a and MPEG b.
The empty housing of the monitor only with the loudspeaker and the power supply .
The mechanics of the motor were very simple .
The disk is driven by a belt .
The ball bearing which hold the disk was fixed with two corner tins on a wooden plate .
The motor was fixed too with a piece of tin and some rubber .
The disk will be driven with a belt .
For protection a glas door before the scanning disk was installed .
For operating the motor in the first attempts I used an adjustable D.C. source for the model railway of my son .
Later the motor was driven by an automatic speed control circuit .
The schematics I got from the website of the Narrow - bandwidth Television Association .
The electronic board is pushed into the housing , but the scanning disk was n't still installed .
On the right and left side beneath the board some screws fixed the board into position to prevent removing of the board from the back side .
TRhis could damage the scanning disk .
The height of electronic board from the bottom of the housing is 11.7 cm .
The automatic speed control circuit is feed with the sync pulses from the video board and a pulse which is generated in an optical fork , which registrates the exact position of the Nipkow disk .
The automatic speed control circuit compares both pulses and regulates the motor speed for best steady picture .
Left : back view of the televisor , right : front view of the televisor .
See the set from the back and frontside with all units and mechanics .
For the front side I will to install a glas .
In the past scanning disk sets were closed with only a small window for the picture .
But I think it is so interesting to watch a scanning disk set working so I decided not to put it into a closed housing .
In the 1920s and 1930s neon lamps usually were used for the light source .
The light of a neon bulb is easily to modulate with the video signal .
Today I used white LEDs instead .
Six LEDs were installed parallel , each together with a 47 Ohm resistor .
The LED cluster was connected with a video amplifier .
But do n't forget that this amplifier needs only the bandwidth of an audio amplifier .
The LED video driver unit also provides the 400 Hz sync pulses for the automatic speed control circuit .
Today computer software exist with which one can convert AVI videos and MPEG videos into NBTV 32 line standard video .
Listen to an example or display it on you NBTV monitor .
A clear sync pulse ( see photo on the left side ) is absolutely necessary for synchronising the scanning disk .
The sync pulse will be compared in the 4046 with the reference pulse from the optical fork ( see photo on the right side ) .
In the first attempts the drive voltage for the motor was so high that no synchronisation was possible .
But after increasing the d.c. current control the line synchronisation worked .
The power supply provides two D.C. voltages , separated for the LED driver and the motor control .
A special problem is the light beam of the LEDs .
This light is focussed .
Instead of this a diffuse light is necessary which illuminates equally the frame window of the disk .
The diffuser here was taken from an old slide viewer .
With computer software an AVI file was converted into a 32 line WAV file which contain the video signal .
Listen to such a video signal here .
After testing the video unit the motor was tested .
The picture is scanned vertical according to the video standard of the British Narrow - bandwidth Television Association ( NBTV ) .
The lines will be written from the right to the left .
The disk 's revolution is counterclockwise .
After darken the room some fuzzy lines were visible on the disk , but no picture .
Bright bold lines .
I noticed that I have to change the polarity of the audio output .
Because there is no automatic synchronisation in the first attemps , the disk has to be synchronised manually .
With the automatic speed control circuit is was possible to get an automatic synchronised picture , see MPEG c and MPEG d .
For a better video playback select toggle repeat .
One should remember that tv watchers at the end of the 1920s have to synchronise the disk manually , usually with a wired remote control .
And they were happy when they got a steady picture for some seconds .
When the first draft of the monitor was working , it was time to create a more professional housing and mechanic for it .
Our master of the city here , the physicist Dr. Ulrich Barkow , is profund in woodworking .
He disassembled the whole set and created a new wooden housing .
The space inside was enlarged .
A wooden board with the mechanics was inserted in such a way that one can pull it out to adjust the controls and mechanics .
The opto fork was placed on a wooden block which is fixed with screws .
Motor and hub were also placed into wooden blocks for a more reliable operating of the disk .
The electronics were placed on the rear side of the wooden board .
Now the monitor is easy to operate by the possibility to pull the wooden board without disassembling the glass door .
The controls were placed at the right side .
These are potentiometers for motor servo , synchron impulse level , contrast , white peak and black level adjustment and loudness .
One switch is for interupting the synchron impulse to set the frame synchronisation into the correct phase .
Examples for the video performance of the Nipkow scanning disk are online at Youtube : Mechanical Television I , Mechanical Television II , Mechanical Television III .
Update :
In January , 2010 , the set was upgraded to colour with the world converter of Darry Hock .
The World Converter generates a 32 - line NBTV - signal with an RGB output to drive a RGB LED - array .
A daughter - board for the world converter is available which has three optimised RGB drivers .
For every colour channel , level and gain can be adjusted individually .
The RGB LED - array has 32 powerful LEDs .
I have compared the colors of the RGB LED array picture on the Nipkow disk with the colors on a screen of a PAL color tv set , both feed with the same test patterns .
Green of the LEDs seems to be much " deeper " and saturated than the green on the CRT screen , and also red of the LEDs seems to be much " deeper " and saturated than the red on the CRT screen .
The LEDs seems to provide a wider gamut than the colors of the CRT .
This obeservation was confirmed by the actual values for the wavelengths of the RGB LEDs of mechanical television :
632nm ( red )
523nm ( green )
465nm ( blue )
This seems to be more similar to the wavelengths of the early NTSC color picture tubes than with PAL ( except of blue ) :
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Scientist and author Stephen Hawking is " very ill " and has been hospitalized , according to Cambridge University , where he is a professor .
Stephen Hawking in Pasadena , California , in March .
Cambridge University said the 67 - year - old is " comfortable " and will stay overnight at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge .
Hawking , one of the world 's most famous physicists , is also a cosmologist , astronomer , and mathematician .
Wheelchair - bound Hawking is perhaps most famous for " A Brief History of Time , " which explored the origins of the universe in layman 's terms .
The book is considered a modern classic .
Hawking has Lou Gehrig 's Disease ( Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis , or ALS ) , which is usually fatal after three years .
Hawking has survived for more than 40 years since his diagnosis .
On his Web site , Hawking has written about living with ALS .
" I try to lead as normal a life as possible , and not think about my condition , or regret the things it prevents me from doing , which are not that many , " he wrote .
He added : " I have been lucky , that my condition has progressed more slowly than is often the case .
But it shows that one need not lose hope . "
The disease has left him paralyzed -- he is able to move only a few fingers on one hand .
Hawking is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything -- bathing , dressing , eating , even speech .
He uses a speech synthesizer with an American accent .
Hawking has been married and divorced twice .
In 2004 , police completed an investigation into accusations by Hawking 's daughter that his second wife was abusing him .
Authorities said they found no proof .
His Web site says he has three children and one grandchild .
Hawking was born in Oxford , England , on what turned out to be an auspicious date : January 8 , 1942 -- the 300th anniversary of the death of astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei .
A Cambridge University spokesman told CNN : " Professor Hawking is very ill and has been taken by ambulance to Addenbrookes Hospital , Cambridge . "
Professor Peter Haynes , head of the university 's department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics , said : " Professor Hawking is a remarkable colleague , we all hope he will be amongst us again soon . "
At Cambridge , he holds the position of Lucasian Professor Mathematics -- the prestigious post held from 1669 to 1702 by Sir Isaac Newton .
Hawking has guest - starred , as himself , on Star Trek : The Next Generation and The Simpsons .
He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe , his choice would be Marilyn .
In October , CNN's Becky Anderson interviewed Hawking .
The following are some quotes from that interview :
" Over the last twenty years , observations have to a large extent confirmed the picture I painted in ' A Brief History of Time . '
The one major development that was not anticipated was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating now , rather than slowing down ...
We live in the most probable of all possible worlds . "
CNN 's Jennifer Pifer contributed to this report

At Ruehl , which is Abercrombie ’s more upscale store for slightly older consumers ( and even darker inside ) , there were no customers at all .
But at Hollister , where the prices average 12 to 15 percent lower , the line at the register was seven deep .
To maintain its prestigious image , Abercrombie has stood alone among mall retailers in not blaring its sales  a strategy that Wall Street analysts have blamed for its current decline .
The company reported a 34 percent drop in sales for March at stores open at least a year , the worst performance of mall retailers that month .
Abercrombie executives did not respond to written questions about whether the brand  as some business columnists suggest  has lost its cool .
In the past , the chain has said it does n’t want to tarnish its image with big discounts , but the risk is that consumers may retain the habit of thriftiness even after the recession ends .

“ I ’m not sure customers are going to ever go back to shopping the way they once did , ” said Betsy McLaughlin , the chief executive of Hot Topic , a competitor for the teen market , which posted a gain of 7.1 percent in March , largely on the strength of licensed products tied to the “ Twilight ” vampire series .
“ There ’s just so much retail out there .
I think the people who will win are the ones who provide something different .
It ’s not just a price war . ”
The styles at Abercrombie & Fitch , which have changed little in the last decade , are similar to those at the company ’s Hollister or Ruehl stores , except for the prices and logos .
In the same mall , there are plenty of retailers that specialize in Abercrombie - esque casual - collegiate - cum - surfer - dude styles for even less .
A new store , WHO.A.U. , sells frayed cargo shorts and appliquéd T - shirts that are displayed next to black - and - white portraits of hunky shirtless models , ahem .
And behind the register at the Aéropostale store in Paramus is a poster showing a frolicking group of teenagers , like a tamer version of Abercrombie .
Even the clearance items at Abercrombie do not exude the promotional fervor that can be found at American Eagle , which has a sign up front noting its shorts are under $ 25 ; or Aéropostale , where banners announce two - for - one bargains .
Aéropostale also reported a sales increase last month , up 3 percent , a success that Mindy Meads , the company ’s president , attributed to the right combination of product and value .

Hi we just added two new architectures to the Debian archive .
Everybody please welcome kfreebsd - i386 AKA GNU / kFreeBSD i386 kfreebsd-amd64 AKA GNU / kFreeBSD amd64
Note that this enables porter NMUs for those two .
In case you have a bug with a patch waiting for your package that has to do with one of them , please either fix it soon or expect a porter NMU to be done soon .
The two new architectures ( well , better named OS i think , as they use a different kernel ) are available in unstable and experimental .
We do start out empty , importing only what is needed to get a buildd running .
For this reason you will not be able to directly use it immediately .
Please wait until they catched up , which I expect to happen soon .
-- bye , Joerg However , given my track record WRT editorial changes to foundation documents , people ought to be examining this draft _before_ the vote rather than afterwards :) < 87d5byftj1.fsf@glaurung.internal.golden-gryphon.com >

According to an Aon Survey of 8,000 employees of various public and private employers , both salaried and hourly workers are finding ways to use Web 2.0 ( social ) media at work , for work purposes .
The survey bypassed employers to ask employees directly if they are accessing social networks ( Facebook , Linked In , etc. ) , using instant messaging and text messaging to communicate with each other , setting up wikis and reading blogs at work .
Why is this good news for employers ?
The answer is because corporate communicators and HR can use these tools for employee engagement and education to accelerate the communication process .
Since Web 2.0 media is electronic , it can provide access to your intranet or HR portal to create a more integrated and cost - efficient way to communicate with employees – including benefits enrollment and wellness education campaigns .
What Works at Home Will Apply at Work
The survey asked respondents what Web 2.0 tools they use at home to find information important to them .
If they are comfortable with Web 2.0 media at home , they are ready and will find these tools used in a communication campaign at work .
As expected , the survey found higher usage of this media by those under age 29 ( Generation Y or millennials ) compared to older respondents .
If these younger employees , who will soon be the largest generation in the workforce , are comfortable using this media at home , then they will find a way to use these communication tools at work – employers should begin using them as part of their employee communication strategies .
The better you can align your communications to your employees ’ media preferences , the easier and faster you can achieve results .
All Generations Are Using Web 2.0 Media at Work
The survey found higher usage of Web 2.0 media at work than at home among employees over age 28 .
This finding shows that employees of all generations are learning how to use these tools – whether to instant message team members about a project they are working on or to research information through a discussion group on Linked In or Facebook .
Some employee groups set up their own blogs while work teams are using wikis to assist in project management .
Virtual Workforce and Web 2.0 Media
As more employers encourage employees to work remotely , they will find it more difficult to communicate with them and to maintain consistency in the culture .
Web 2.0 media can help virtual workers stay connected to team members and remain updated about their employer .
Saving Money with Web 2.0 Media
With most employers looking for ways to save money , using Web 2.0 media and other electronic resources can help you reduce print and postage costs .
In addition , these new media tools can be used to supplement traditional communication materials to help speed learning and employee engagement , which enables you to achieve your goals faster .

Dr. Charlie Miller , famous Mac hacker , announced at this year 's CanSecWest hacking contest that he would no longer be releasing exploits for free , to the vendor or anyone else .
Further , Charlie and a few friends have started a " No More Free Bugs " campaign , which even has its own logo .
I 've met and very much respect Charlie Miller , and I believe his intentions are good .
He just wants to make a living doing what he is good at .
The services he provides are valuable , to the software vendor and to us all .
Still , I 'm bothered by one nagging question :
Will or wo n't Charlie sell his bug findings to parties with malicious intentions ?
He has n't yet made a clear , definitive statement on that .
I suspect he wo n't , but for now , I do n't know for sure .
( It took Charlie Miller only 10 seconds to crack the Mac at CanSecWest .
Now he says he 's found a way to trick the iPhone into enabling shell code . )
I feel for Charlie and other truly elite , well - intentioned hackers like him .
I 've met many of them over the last 20 years , and I know that discovering vulnerabilities is n't the easiest way to make a living .
I 've known talented hackers who provided independently found exploits to the vendor and were offended when the vendor did n't want to pay them for their hard work .
I 've seen these initially well - intentioned hackers begin multiyear vendettas against the vendor , who they purportedly wanted to work for , by announcing bug after bug in retaliation .
I 've seen scorned hackers sell bugs to competitors and beat up the vendor in the press .
Penny in a haystack
Selling exploits is a money - making opportunity like never before , especially if you 're a black hat .
A hacker that does n't care who gets his exploit can sell a decent vulnerability finding for a widely distributed software program for $ 5,000 or more .
Prices on the black market are hard to find , but I 've seen offers for up to $ 100,000 for a remote buffer overflow exploit against Windows Server 2003 .
Considering that multiple crimeware syndicates are making tens of millions of dollars , or more , a price of tens of thousands of dollars for a well - coded exploit is pretty cheap in the grand scheme of things .
Even in the white hat world , many legitimate parties are paying for bugs and exploits .
First , many vendors ( including my full - time employer , Microsoft ) pay millions to internal and external bug finders , although they are almost always ( if not always ) contracted before the bugs are found .
CanSecWest and other hacking contests pay for new zero - day vulnerabilities .
Several other organizations , like the Zero Day Initiative , pay for new vulnerability findings .
They make their money on the back end by selling protection products to their clients .
Lastly , it 's a poorly kept secret that our government has huge teams of people working on finding exploits for offense and defense purposes .
There have even been attempts at open - air vulnerability auctions .
Black and white
The sad fact is that a found exploit does n't earn the white hat hacker nearly as much money as the same exploit would bring in the black hat market .
That 's because white hat hacking is about fixing the product and protecting people , while black hat hacking is about separating people from their money .
A friend of mine at a large software company did an analysis of the company 's spending for internal and externally hired vulnerability finders , and he said the money paid often worked out to less than $ 25 per found bug .
It 's hard for any legitimate hacker to make a decent living at those wages .
But they do .
I guess that 's it in a nutshell .
There are lots of ways to make money in this world .
My computer books would sell a lot more if they contained porn , or I could supplement my income with tax - free money by selling illegal drugs , but I 've got to be able to look at myself in the mirror in the morning and be proud of what I 'm doing .
I get paid to hack , but I 've never done it without permission or with ill will toward anyone .
Whatever personality trait takes to be involved with something malicious , it 's missing from my DNA .
Many companies make a decent if not robust living finding bugs for vendors .
Maybe they are n't making $ 5,000 or more per bug , but they 've built successful -- sometimes highly successful -- businesses doing it the right way .
They 've become industry names and created individual stars .
Their owners have grown the company , created long - term careers for their employees , and are able to hold their heads up high without a moment of second - guessing .
For every infamous black hat hacker , I can name two infamous white hat hackers and their companies -- names such as @ Stake , ZDI , iDefense , David Litchfield , Foundstone , Dave Aitel , Immunity , and so many more .
Charlie and other " No More Free Bugs " advocates deserve to make a living doing what they do best .
But I hope they consider the types of people and companies they will be selling their bugs to .
We need them to assure us that they are on our side every time .

Indian police have not found any evidence to support allegations that the father of a child star in the Oscar - winning film Slumdog Millionaire tried to sell his daughter , a senior officer in Mumbai said today .
Rubina Ali Qureshi's father , Rafiq Qureshi , and other slum dwellers were questioned by police following an undercover investigation by a British tabloid , which alleged that Mr Qureshi tried to sell the nine - year - old for £ 200,000 to a reporter posing as a representative of an Arab princess from Dubai .
" So far there is no evidence of any offence , hence there is no registration of complaint and no arrest , " Nisar Tamboli , a senior police officer , said .
Rubina 's mother demanded an investigation following publication of the newspaper 's sting operation , in which Qureshi took his daughter and her uncle to the Leela Kempinski hotel in Mumbai to meet the undercover reporter posing as an intermediary for the Arab royals .
The News of the World said it investigated following a tip - off that the family was considering allowing a genuine Middle Eastern family to adopt their daughter in exchange for help in getting them out of the slum in which they live .
Rubina , who starred as the youngest incarnation of the film 's heroine , Latika , lives with her father and stepmother .
It was at the Mumbai hotel that Rajan , Rubina 's uncle , allegedly said the price for his niece would be £ 200,000 .
Rubina 's father later denied he was trying to sell her , but the sting made headlines in India and abroad .
Slumdog Millionaire , a rags - to - riches romance about a slum boy competing on a television game show , won eight Academy Awards this year .
Initially , the film 's success was overshadowed by objections in India to its name , its depiction of the lives of impoverished Indians , and the treatment of the cast .
Since the film 's success at the Oscars India 's media have been caught in a patriotic frenzy and politicians have praised the film .
This week a charitable trust from Qatar offered to pay for Rubina 's education , which is already being overseen by the producers of the film .
The lessons of Thailand ’s political upheaval
15 April 2009
The elemental eruption of anger on the streets of Bangkok on Monday has highlighted the political impasse facing the Thai working class .
Frustrated at the ruling elite ’s contempt for democracy , anti-government protestors , many of them from Bangkok ’s poor , fought pitched street battles with heavily armed soldiers , only to be dispersed by their own leaders , who were fearful that the movement was slipping out of their control .
For three years
Thai politics has been convulsed by a bitter fight within ruling circles between supporters and opponents of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra .
That struggle is now intersecting with the economic and social impact of the worst global recession since the 1930s .
Yet , as the events have demonstrated , neither of the competing factions is capable of meeting the aspirations of working people .
The present government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva depends on the conservative elites — the military , state bureaucracy and the monarchy — that ousted Thaksin in an army coup in 2006 , then removed two pro-Thaksin governments last year .
The military , which helped install Abhisit in December , treated last year ’s anti-Thaksin protests with kid gloves but had no such compunction on Monday .
Troops surrounded the remaining protestors and threatened a bloodbath on Tuesday .
The police and judiciary , which took no action as demonstrators occupied Bangkok ’s airports last year , are now preferring charges of illegal assembly and creating public disturbance against the leaders of Monday ’s protests .
The government ’s actions expose the character of Abhisit ’s Democrat Party , which for decades has postured as an opponent of the country ’s military juntas .
In 1992 , the Democrats were the beneficiaries of large protests in Bangkok that forced an end to military rule .
In the aftermath of the 1997 - 98 Asian financial crisis , the party imposed the IMF ’s austerity program and confronted growing public anger over declining living standards .
In the course of the bitter infighting against Thaksin , the Democrats have not hesitated to support anti-democratic methods , including the 2006 coup .
On Sunday , Abhisit had no reservations in imposing emergency rule and authorising the army to send troops and tanks into Bangkok .
The billionaire Thaksin and his supporters , however , are neither “ pro-poor ” nor defenders of democratic rights .
Capitalising on the widespread opposition to the Democrats , Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai ( Thais Love Thai ) party took power in 2001 on the basis of populist promises and pledges to defend Thai businesses .
His ability to make limited handouts to the urban and rural poor depended on the recovery of the Thai economy , which , far from being a product of inspired “ Thaksinomics , ” rested heavily on rising exports , particularly to the US .
However , his economic policies and nepotism alienated Thailand ’s traditional elites by cutting across their own corrupt system of patronage .
To bolster his standing , Thaksin launched a reactionary “ law - and - order ” campaign in 2003 , in which the police murdered hundreds of alleged drug dealers .
From 2005 , he deliberately whipped up anti-Muslim sentiment among the country ’s Buddhist majority and ordered a military crackdown on Muslim separatists in the southern provinces .
As opposition emerged , Thaksin threatened critics and tightened his grip over the media .
Anger over his autocratic methods was one factor fuelling large , anti-government protests in 2006 .
Both factions of the ruling elite have manipulated popular concern over democratic rights in their struggle for political power in order to determine economic policy in their own interests .
For weeks , the leaders of the pro-Thaksin United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship ( UDD ) were quite content to exploit popular outrage to exert pressure on the military - backed government .
But they were aghast on Monday as sections of the urban poor began to take matters into their own hands .
Having egged on the demonstrators with calls for a “ people ’s revolution , ” Thaksin and the UDD quickly shut down the protests .
What happened was a textbook case , at least in miniature , of the role played by bourgeois leaders in countries like Thailand .
The twentieth century was littered with political figures who appealed to the masses on the basis of democratic , even socialistic - sounding slogans , only to disperse or attack the movement when it began to slip out of their control and threaten the capitalist system .
The anti-democratic character of the Thai ruling elites confirms one of the basic tenets of Leon Trotsky ’s Theory of Permanent Revolution — the organic incapacity of the national bourgeoisie in countries with a belated capitalist development to satisfy the democratic aspirations and social needs of working people .
Only the proletariat is capable of championing genuine democratic rights and agrarian reform , through the struggle to mobilise the rural masses and establish a workers ’ and farmers ’ government based on socialist policies .
The latest political turmoil in Bangkok has demonstrated graphically that the working class has no independent political voice .
Insofar as workers have been involved , they have been used as pawns in the factional manoeuvres of the ruling class .
The lack of any genuine socialist party is part of the terrible legacy of Stalinism in Thailand and throughout the region .
The Maoists of the Communist Party of Thailand ( CPT ) based themselves not on the working class , but on an armed guerrilla struggle by layers of the peasantry .
Guided by the Stalinist two - stage theory , the CPT insisted that the immediate aim was not socialism , but a democratic government that included “ progressive ” sections of the national bourgeoisie .
During the student radicalisation of the 1970s , hundreds of activists fled to the jungles and joined the CPT after the brutal massacre of students at Thammasat University in 1976 by the military , police and associated right - wing militias .
Most drifted back to Bangkok disillusioned with the CPT , taking advantage of the periodic amnesties offered by the army amid its systematic repression .
Some of those activists are now found in the pro- and anti-Thaksin camps , dressing up the right - wing agendas with leftist phrase - mongering .
Ex-radicals Phumtham Vejjauyachai , Praphat Panyachatrak and Surapong Seubwonglee , for instance , became key figures in Thaksin ’s TRT and helped to formulate its social policies .
The frightened response to the Thai protests by leaders gathered for last week ’s ASEAN summit is a clear recognition on their part that they face similar upheavals at home and need to prepare accordingly .
The working class needs to make its own preparations .
Above all , this means drawing the necessary political balance sheet of its previous defeats .
Throughout the region , workers are confronting the results of decades of misleadership and betrayal by Stalinist parties , particularly of the Maoist type .
This is epitomised most starkly by the transformation of China into the capitalist sweatshop of the world by its misnamed Communist Party leaders .
The way out of the current political impasse requires the development of a program and perspective that represents the historic interests of the working class .
That is to be found in the protracted struggle waged by the Trotskyist movement — the International Committee of the Fourth International ( ICFI ) — for the program of Permanent Revolution against Stalinism and all forms of political opportunism .
We urge workers and young people in Thailand and throughout the region to turn to this history and begin to absorb the critical political lessons necessary to forge sections of the ICFI .

And some military analysts reacted to Mr. Gates ’s promise of budget revolution with skepticism .
Andrew H. Krepinevich Jr. , a military expert at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , said that it was hard to tell how much Mr. Gates was reducing spending over all because he was increasing spending in unspecified amounts in some areas and had not put a net dollar amount on his entire proposal .
Mr. Krepinevich said he anticipated that Mr. Gates ’s reductions would not close the $ 25 billion to $ 50 billion Bush - era gap between military programs and the spending for them , and that future cuts would most likely be needed .
He noted that some of Mr. Gates ’s cuts were less than draconian .
While the secretary chose to emphasize smaller , speedy ships for close - in waters , the slower shipbuilding he proposed for the deep - water Navy would not reduce the number of aircraft - carrier battle groups at sea to 10 from 11 until after 2040 .
While he capped the number of the $ 150 million combat plane , the Air Force ’s F - 22 , at 187 , he promised to speed the testing of another fighter , the F - 35 , and maintain plans to eventually buy 2,443 of the planes .
While he canceled the purchases of eight Army vehicles to allow for more study and a rebidding , he said he would also speed the development of costly electronic sensors for troops .
And while he promised to fix the flawed procurement processes that allow weapons prices to soar , he said he wanted to hire tens of thousands of civil servants to do the work , since contracting that out to the private sector has not proven efficient .
“ The perennial procurement and contracting cycle , going back many decades , of adding layer and layer of cost and complexity onto fewer and fewer platforms that take longer and longer to build , must come to an end , ” he said .
“ There is broad agreement on the need for acquisition and contracting reform in the Department of Defense .
There have been enough studies , enough hand - wringing , enough rhetoric .
Now is the time for action . ”
The changes will mean fewer big ships , and a reduction in the number of Army brigades , but with the same number of troops so that the combat forces are not hollowed out , and bolstering the Army ’s helicopter forces , Mr. Gates said .
He added that he wanted to add 2,800 to the ranks of special forces troops and more cybersecurity experts .
" Police footage obtained by the Guardian has revealed the crude monitoring methods deployed across the country against protesters , thousands of whom have their personal details stored on criminal intelligence systems for up to seven years .
( Video : Shocking footage shot by police , accompanied by their own critical commentary , shows how their officers monitored campaigners and the media – and demanded personal information – at last August 's climate camp demonstration in Kent )
At 11:37 am on August 8 last year , two police surveillance officers sat in a patrol car in Kent and switched on their Sony digital video camera .
When the tape started to roll , they stated they were " evidence gatherer " surveillance officers and explained the purpose of the operation .
A lead surveillance officer and his assistant , they were on duty to help police the Climate Camp demonstration , an environmental protest against the nearby Kingsnorth coal - fired power station .
What the pair did not know when , 20 minutes later , they stood on a grass verge at the entrance to the camp and started work , was that their surveillance footage would be obtained by the Guardian .
It would provide evidence of the crude monitoring methods used to glean information about campaigners and would prove that journalists are being targeted by police surveillance units .
This was no rogue operation .
An investigation by the Guardian has established that surveillance footage such as that shot by the Kent officers is routinely uploaded onto a police database .
In fact it seems that thousands of activists – from campaigners against Heathrow 's third runway to anti-racism marchers – have their personal details stored on criminal intelligence systems for as long as seven years .
file not found ( Audio : Videographer Jason Parkinson and photographer Jess Hurd describe to Paul Lewis how they have been followed by police while covering protests )
The Metropolitan police 's Forward Intelligence Teams ( FITs ) and Evidence Gatherers ( EGs ) have over the last decade pioneered the controversial use of " overt surveillance " , a technique now widely used by forces across the country at political demonstrations .
It is designed to " record identifiable details " of protesters who may commit crime or anti-social behaviour and gather intelligence that could help police a public order event .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) recently commissioned the National Police Improvements Agency ( NPIA ) to establish a " national standard " for overt surveillance , to which all forces in England and Wales have signed up .
Surveillance officers receive briefings before protests about key targets and are handed " spotter cards " containing the images of individuals police want to monitor .
The operations are normally carried out by regular police officers who have received additional training in surveillance .
The human rights watchdog Liberty – which did not know about the database – is challenging police surveillance tactics in a judicial review at the court of appeal .
Privacy rights
However police appear not to have disclosed to the court they were transferring the private details of campaigners to a database .
Lawyers believe the transfer makes it more likely the technique is in violation of privacy rights under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act .
" The time is now 11.57 hours , " said the lead officer .
" We 're up at point three , the front entrance to the climate camp site . "
The camera panned to show officers from West Yorkshire police , among thousands drafted into Kent from across the country in the £ 5.9 m policing operation , searching activists as they entered the camp .
Kent police , which was in command of the operation , had activated an order under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 , authorising officers to search anyone in the area for dangerous weapons .
The film shows how police zoomed in on virtually any protesters in the area , noting down items of clothing or other distinctive features .
They also appeared to have knowledge of some activists ' past political activity , on one occasion noting that a protester had " spent a lot of time " at a different part of the camp .
Others seemed to have been targeted for standing beside , or near , prominent environmental campaigners .
But whenever journalists were in the area , the lens was almost exclusively pointed at them .
In total 10 journalists were monitored emerging from the camp , where they had been interviewing protesters .
The officers zoomed in to pick out the logo on the back of a Sky News cameraman 's jacket , monitored several photographers and followed an ITV Meridian news crew , including the anchor of the evening show , Ian Axton .
" A lot of press officers are n't there .
Just think they can bloody wander in and out of the field .
It 's wrong , I think , " the lead officer remarked when the ITV crew was in shot .
" I trust them less than the protesters .
" Later , referring to ITV cameraman Pete Lloyd Williams , he said : " The time is now 13:19 hours .
Same date .
Same location .
Press cameraman here .
Being awkward a little .
Being asked to stand back by officers on at least two occasions and then asked to stand by the inspector .
Or asked by the inspector to stand out of the road .
Coming out with witty comments .
" After spotting a videographer and photographer across the road , the assistant officer said : " Inquisitive , ai n't they – these two , by the pole .
" The lead added : " He do n't like having his photograph taken – that one there with the bald head .
"
The surveillance lens returned to the ITV crew after the pair overheard a discussion between an officer and Lloyd Williams .
" He 's giving him a ticket if you want to record any of that ?
As to whether or not he wants to give his details , " the assistant officer said .
The officers walked closer , to within earshot .
" Did he give details ? " asked the assistant officer .
" Do n't know if he did or not , " replied the lead .
" Think he just said he was from ITV Meridian .
Do n't know if he gave personal details . "
This was not a one - off event ; the National Union of Journalists ( NUJ ) has documented eight occasions over the last year when , it says , police surveillance officers photographed and filmed journalists .
In May the general secretary of the NUJ , Jeremy Dear , alerted the Home Office that journalists – particularly photographers – were " routinely and deliberately " watched by police surveillance teams .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , replied that the government " greatly values " the free press , but " decisions may be made [ by police ] locally to restrict or monitor photography in reasonable circumstances " .
Senior police officers in turn also assured the NUJ that journalists were " not being targeted unfairly " .
Moments after the camera stopped rolling at the Climate Camp , a group of journalists , including some of those caught on the surveillance footage , were followed by a team of surveillance officers to a McDonald 's restaurant several miles from the camp .
Police filmed the journalists , who were using wireless computer networks to file their material , through the restaurant window .
Kent police later apologised after complaints about the McDonald 's surveillance incident and the use of the Section 60 order to subject journalists in the area to intensive searches .
Heavy - handed Assistant chief constable Allyn Thomas , Kent police 's commander of the operation , said in November his officers had not been properly briefed about actions they could " reasonably take when engaging with members of the press " .
The forces 's heavy - handed approach to the Climate Camp demonstration received widespread criticism , including in parliament .
Home Office minister Vernon Coaker , who initially claimed Kent police 's approach had been " proportionate and appropriate " , was forced to apologise to MPs after the Guardian revealed the 70 police officers he claimed had been injured in clashes with protesters had actually suffered from unrelated ailments such as bee stings and toothache .
Many of those captured in police surveillance footage – which is filmed at all types of political demonstrations – will want to know what their images are being used for .
The raw data gleaned through police surveillance material is stored on marked CD - Roms in a warehouse , and is not searchable by the names of activists .
However , disclosures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the law firm Hickman and Rose , representing the NUJ , document how in the case of the Metropolitan police the surveillance material is " added to a corporate intelligence database " .
They continue : " If names are known , they will be included " and : " generally , records are retained for seven years " .
Superintendent David Hartshorn , a senior officer from the Metropolitan police public order branch , told the Guardian the database in question was CrimInt , a general intelligence system used to catalogue details about criminal activity .
"
In relation to what we can keep on databases , we are governed quite strictly on that , " he said .
" Obviously you 've got the Data Protection Act but also , in terms of intelligence , we have to justify what we are able to keep on our systems .
" So for example , if we 've got someone who is a known activist for a particular group , and we keep their images live on that intelligence database , along the side of that intelligence there will be a report justifying why that image is being kept . "
He added : " We ca n't just randomly take your photograph and hold it on a database .
There has to be a reason for it .
" Reasons , Hartshorn said , include if a person has a criminal record for activity relating to a demonstration or is an outstanding suspect for an offence .
He added a third category .
" There are people we have seen on a regular basis involved but may not have been charged or arrested – but believed to be on the periphery . "
That might include people " bordering on civil disobedience " or " doing something more than attending a rally " .
He said the data was reviewed annually to ensure it remains " valid " .
" Just because someone did something 10 years ago and they might , off chance , do it again in the future , that is unlikely to justify keeping them on the database .
" Asked why law abiding citizens should be held on a database because of their political activity , he replied : " We have to be able to say : this person has been seen at this event .
They 've been dealing with a person who was arrested at this event .
It 's not just : we 've seen them floating around , do n't know who they are , we 'll keep them .
" Hartshorn conceded that police can use the database to search which political events an individual may have attended .
Although surveillance teams attend hundreds of events each year , Hartshorn claimed not to know how many political activists have their details stored on CrimInt .
However lower rank surveillance officers have indicated in open court testimony that officers can search the database for " thousands " of protesters .
In trials of Jeff Parks , an activist from London twice convicted for blocking police cameras at protests , surveillance officers revealed , according to solicitors ' notes of proceedings , that one reason they were monitoring him was to gather information for the database .
In December PC Dan Collins told the City of Westminster magistrates court that his material was uploaded onto a central " intelligence system " which enabled police to search the political history of Parks , as well as " thousands " of other protesters .
Last month at Tower Bridge magistrates PC Hall and PC Pritchard accepted that there was a general police database that would include records of surveillance material relating to Parks .
" From the evidence of police officers in these cases , it is becoming clear that the police are maintaining a systematic record , including photographs , of those who attend demonstrations or even political meetings , " said Parks 's solicitor Raj Chada , who is appealing against his client 's convictions .
" Our cases suggest if you attend an anti-war meeting or other political meetings , your photograph will end up stored on some database .

Although Tómasson does not identify himself as an Austrian , the interview is wonderful and comes down on the right side of almost every issue .
He names names and blames both Paul Samuelson and Milton Friedman for the positivist and mathematical orientation of mainstream economic theory , which he argues is the underlying cause of the current breakdown of the global monetary and financial order .
This transcript is a translation of the first part of Egill Helgason 's interview of Gunnar Tómasson , a former IMF economist , on Icelandic state television 's " Silfur Egils " on February 1 , 2009 .
( The video is available on YouTube . )
Egill :
Economist Gunnar Tómasson has come here from Washington .
He was employed for a long time by the International Monetary Fund and now works as an independent economist .
Welcome Gunnar .
It is a pleasure to have you come across the Atlantic to appear on the program .
You have been writing articles in the newspapers and on the Internet .
One thing which has attracted attention is that you have been critical of world monetary policies for a very long time , and it seems that you are one of those who saw what was coming .
But we should perhaps go over this somewhat systematically .
And I begin by asking you about the collapse of the Icelandic banking system .
Was it the result of domestic policies or due to external factors ?
Gunnar :
Well , both domestic and external factors were involved .
For several years there had been excessive credit expansion within the banking system , which drew an emphatic warning from the International Monetary Fund in May 2006 .
I remember having written an article in Morgunblaðið at the time endorsing the IMF 's words of caution .
The timing of the banking system 's actual collapse was determined by external circumstances .
That is the foreign aspect in this , but the underlying domestic conditions were in place long before things went awry abroad .
Egill :
I remember that you have mentioned in your writings both leverage and currency speculation , the lack of supervision and other things in that connection .
Gunnar :
The things we are now witnessing in world financial markets have in fact been ongoing and evolving ever since the fall in the early 1970s of the Bretton Woods system , which was established by the victors at the end of World War II to prevent recurrence of monetary problems associated with the Great Depression .
The fall of the Bretton Woods system ushered in anarchy in the international monetary system .
At the time both Paul Samuelson and Milton Friedman were columnists for Newsweek and both applauded the new world monetary order .
I wrote to both of them at the time and expressed a different view .
But there is no point taking on founding fathers of so - called schools where people simply take it on faith that their gurus know what they are talking about .
Paul Samuelson is the one who laid the theoretical foundation for this systemic anarchy .
Milton Friedman then provided the emperor 's new clothes , dressing it in the garb of neoliberalism .
That is how these two leading figures in American economic thought were united in unleashing on the world community the system that has now collapsed .
Egill :
That is this monetary system in which it seems that credit creation is somehow no longer in sync with the world community 's real wealth creation .
Gunnar :
Yes , I remember that while visiting Iceland in 1982 I was invited by someone in the know to present ideas to the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce .
The key to successful economic management , I suggested , was to maintain some appropriate balance between paper wealth and real wealth , the production generated by the economy .
I likened this to a ship 's superstructure , where the ship is production and the superstructure is paper — if the superstructure 's growth is excessive , there comes a point in time — and circumstances that cannot be specified in advance — at which the superstructure will overturn the ship .
That is what is happening now and has been going on since 2007 .
In this connection , I noted in an article the other day some remarkable comments by Alan Greenspan , former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board .
He said that for a period of more than 40 years he had believed himself to have solid grounds for trusting that this anarchy that succeeded the Bretton Woods system was stable — that it could be sustained thanks to automatic market forces which would restore the anarchic system to its equilibrium path in the event that its equilibrium conditions were about to be displaced .
This is nonsense ; it can not be called anything else .
The idea apes Newtonian ideology , which is concerned with the physical universe where human decisions do not enter the picture .
To equate the world 's monetary system , a man -made structure , with the laws of physics , an aspect of nature , is such nonsense that future economics students will not be able to comprehend how it could have become a basic premise of modern thought .
Egill :
Does this mean that generations of students have been brought up on nonsense ideology ?
For this is ideology , of course .
Gunnar :
Yes , nonsensical ideology .
The root of the problem goes back to a point made in the mid-19th century by John Stuart Mill , one of the sharpest minds of all time , in an overview article on unresolved methodological aspects of economics .
Mill viewed economics as a branch of logic and noted that the least error in the premises of any logical argument would infect with like error the whole superstructure built thereon .
A seemingly small error is embedded in the premises of modern monetary economics .
Paul Samuelson noted it very briefly in his Ph.D. thesis in 1942 and said it did n't matter .
Today , this small error is destroying the world 's monetary system .
Egill :
And what is this logical error ?
Gunnar :
Joseph A. Schumpeter , who is one of the two greatest economists of the 20th century — the other is John Maynard Keynes — Schumpeter noted in 1935 that the source of interest and profit in the production process was unclear .
That issue has never been satisfactorily resolved .
Keynes had sought to clarify this in Treatise on Money in 1930 .
He then moved on to write his major work , General Theory published in 1936 , in which he bypassed the issue because his principal concern was to argue for a new approach to getting the world economy out of the Great Depression and the point was not germane in that respect .
Paul Samuelson , the godfather of modern monetary thought , addressed the source of interest in the production process in a 1939 paper entitled " The Rate of Interest Under Ideal Conditions . "
He did not succeed in resolving the matter .
Then , in his Ph.D. thesis at Harvard three years later , he said that interest and profit were the product of " something " and it did n't matter what we called it .
And that is how a tiny logical error slipped into the foundations of modern economic analysis , without which what is happening now would not be happening .
And thirty some years ago I realized that this was nonsense .
Egill :
You have argued for a very long time that this system , the world monetary system , was fatally flawed .
Gunnar :
Yes , absolutely .
But in this business there is something else that one discovers early on ; namely , that if you are in a position of responsibility in the world monetary system and management , in the world 's central banks , the International Monetary Fund etc. , then you must always go with the stream if you plan on continuing in that position .
This has completely destroyed all professionalism in central - bank management here in Iceland and elsewhere .
You must go with the stream and never go against it .
I had come across this so often that I decided at the end of 1996 to document that , at the highest levels , both in the United States and Britain , there was knowing malfeasance in the field of monetary management .
In the first instance I sent a letter to Laurence Meyer who was a member of the US Federal Reserve Board .
At the time , a certain problem had surfaced in Mexico , much like the domestic aspects of Iceland 's current problems .
I wrote to Mr. Meyer that it was fair to surmise that as long as the Fed continued to use the macroeconomic models of modern monetary economics to forecast the future , it would be setting itself up for what I termed " nasty surprises . "
Egill :
Is the system not salvageable ?
Gunnar :
It is not salvageable .
Egill :
And must then a new world monetary system be created ?
Gunnar :
That 's where the British party , Professor Patrick Minford , who was an economic advisor to Margaret Thatcher , comes into the picture .
I wrote to him in January 1997 and that 's where you have the answer to your question .
The last sentence of my letter to him was as follows : " This [ post - Bretton Woods ] system is certain to come crashing down . "
You can not put it any more clearly .
I just wanted to have it documented .
Egill :
And there is this enormous production of …
Gunnar :
… money and paper wealth .
Money and paper wealth out of all proportion to the national economy 's output or that of the world economy .
Egill :
And now we are facing this problem in the world , having to unwind this devilish mess … and people are completely at a loss about what to do .
Gunnar :
The system has collapsed and it cannot be rebuilt on the foundations that were put in place with Paul Samuelson 's ideology in 1942 .
It is very difficult to change something like this .
I have collaborated for many years with colleagues in an economics group known as Gang8 .
Icelanders can look it up on the Internet .
The group includes economists from Europe and the United States , a total of ten or so .
I said to them , There is no point debating these issues with those whose livelihood depends on them being sound .
We must wait until everything goes to hell in a handbasket , if you excuse the language , and then we will give them our telephone number .
It is awfully arrogant to put it like this , but that is the situation we face today .
There is talk here in Iceland of calling on foreign experts to give advice on how to reconstruct the economy or the monetary system .
And , lo and behold , they come with these same ideas .
In the United States we see how George Bush responded to the unfolding US economic crisis .
Barack Obama is taking the same approach .
One must realize that this system cannot be salvaged .
Egill :
Among things that you have criticized in writing on Iceland are loan indexation and interest - rate policy .
Gunnar :
Feb. 23 , 2009 --
A walk in the sun may be better than popping a vitamin C tablet for boosting your chances of preventing the common cold or flu .
A new study adds to mounting evidence that vitamin C may have been stealing the spotlight all these years from the real cold fighter , vitamin D .
The study , the largest to date on the link between vitamin D and common respiratory infections , shows that people with the lowest vitamin D levels report having significantly more cases of cold and flu than those with higher levels .
Vitamin D is produced by the body in response to sunlight and is also found in fortified foods such as milk .
Researchers say that although vitamin C has been used for the prevention of common colds and other respiratory infections for decades , there is little scientific evidence to support its effectiveness .
However , several recent studies have suggested that vitamin D , better known for its role in building strong bones , may also play a critical role in immune system function .
" The findings of our study support an important role for vitamin D in prevention of common respiratory infections , such as colds and the flu , " says researcher Adit Ginde , MD , MPH , of the University of Colorado , Denver , Division of Emergency Medicine , in a news release .
" Individuals with common lung diseases , such as asthma or emphysema , may be particularly susceptible to respiratory infections from vitamin D deficiency . "
" This is a time for reflection , not retribution .
I respect the strong views and emotions that these issues evoke .
We have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history .
But at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past .
Our national greatness is embedded in America ’s ability to right its course in concert with our core values , and to move forward with confidence .
That is why we must resist the forces that divide us , and instead come together on behalf of our common future .
" The United States is a nation of laws .
My administration will always act in accordance with those laws , and with an unshakable commitment to our ideals .
That is why we have released these memos , and that is why we have taken steps to ensure that the actions described within them never take place again . "
– President Barack Obama
The above quote is from President Obama ’s recent statement explaining why he has decided not to have the federal government prosecute Bernard Madoff .
President Obama saw clearly that what Bernard Madoff did , however illegal , was in the past .
For that reason , he said , " Nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . "
The key , he said , is " to move forward with confidence " that there will be no Bernard Madoffs in our future .
Moreover , emphasized Obama , the " United States is a nation of laws . "
Because it ’s a nation of laws , it should be obvious to anyone that the way to keep it a nation of laws is … not to enforce the law .
If you ca n’t see that , then you ’re someone who has " strong views and emotions " and , perhaps worse , you might even be a member of the far Left .
As I ’m sure you ’ve figured out by now , the above is a parody .
And by " the above , " I mean not the quote from President Obama , although he comes unwittingly close , but my first two paragraphs .
President Obama was not talking about the Bernard Madoff scandal , but about the torture condoned by some policymakers in the Bush administration , including President Bush , and conducted by various government employees .
I think we can have a reasonable discussion about whether CIA officials who were " just following orders " should be held accountable for law - breaking .
But what do we say of the people who gave the orders ?
Even they might be able to make a case that what they were doing was not illegal , but then let ’s have them make that case – in front of a federal judge .
I do n’t automatically assume that some Bush administration officials were breaking the law by giving the go - ahead to torture .
I think they were breaking the law , but I ’m not sure .
But when there ’s a fair amount of evidence to suggest that someone might have broken the law , the usual next step ( I ’m not a lawyer , so forgive me if I ’ve missed a step ) is to put the case before a grand jury to decide whether or not to go forward and prosecute .
Even if the grand jury , true to form , has very low standards for deciding whether to prosecute , why should politicians be exempt from living in the same legal world that the rest of us inhabit ?
They ’ll still be able to make their case before a judge and , I ’m sure , will have no trouble raising millions of dollars from misguided ( in my opinion ) patriots who will generously contribute to a legal defense .
Why does virtually everyone take it for granted that someone like Bernard Madoff deserves to be prosecuted , while a large percent of people assume that former President Bush should n’t be ?
There ’s not just one reason .
Each group has its own reasons .
First , consider the media .
Various people in the media enabled the torturers by not exposing them in the past few years .
If the facts come out , they will look bad .
Second , as Glenn Greenwald has pointed out , some prominent major Democratic politicians are in the same boat as the media .
It appears that Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi , for example , was briefed about torture .
But she did nothing to stop it or even to object .
If the facts come out even more , these Democratic politicians will look bad .
Third , President Obama is , as the quote above suggests , looking forward .
But not in the way he made it sound .
I think he understands that if he breaks the " gentlemen ’s agreement " by prosecuting Bush administration officials , he will make it more likely that he will be prosecuted by a future administration if he breaks the law .
Top politicians in the Democratic and Republican parties all understand this .
That , by the way , is the problem with a government - run legal system .
We depend on the good will and judgment of government officials .
But many of these officials have their own strategic calculus in deciding whom to prosecute , a calculus that has little to do with our interests .
Fourth , and finally , many of us have a lower standard for government officials .
This is because many of us still think there ’s something special , in a good way , about government .
Economist Dan Klein called Americans ’ view of government " the people ’s romance " [ .pdf ] .
When most people find out that government is doing something , anything , they typically assume good rather than self - interested motives on the part of government .
Self - interested motives in the private sector usually are good motives because , as Adam Smith pointed out , self - interest leads us to serve others .
But the government sector has no such check .
It ’s common , for example , for policemen , after they ’ve shot an innocent victim , to be put on paid leave while their own colleagues , some of whom might even be their friends , investigate .
The government sector ’s version of Adam Smith ’s invisible hand is – take your pick – the visible fist or the middle finger .
Fortunately , we can try to change this , at least on the margin .
And the way to do so is to call for some Bush administration officials to be prosecuted .

Chris Mullin 's diaries , A View from the Foothills , were serialised extensively in the Mail on Sunday and you can read lengthy extracts here , here and here .
But the book is 590 pages long and even the Associated Newspapers story - extraction machine could not squeeze out all the good material .
I 've just finished it and I discovered plenty more good anecdotes .
Here are 12 of them :
1. John Major wanted to ban Rupert Murdoch from owning British papers : " A quiet chat with John Major , who confirmed that he had contemplated banning foreign ownership of British media .
He said he had been provoked by the continual attacks on him in the Murdoch press and in the Telegraph , which is owned by Conrad Black , a Canadian .
I asked if he had commissioned any work on the subject and he said he had , but it was buried with the papers of the last government . "
( 5/12/00 )
2. Gordon Brown originally opposed the Iraq war : " [ Nick Brown — a key ally of Brown 's ] says Gordon is against an attack on Iraq and that he —
Nick — would have to consider his position if we became involved in a war . "
( 6/9/02 ) We thought this was the case , but there 's not much on - the - record evidence .
Brown said very little about Iraq at the time of the war , but endorsed it strongly during the 2005 election campaign .
3 . But later he changed his mind : " ' However ' , said Hilary [ Armstrong - chief whip at the time ] , ' [ Brown ] has been brilliant during the war . '
Apparently , she put it to Gordon that [ Tony Blair ] was more likely to anoint him if he cooperated than if he did n't and once that point had been grasped Gordon played his part to perfection . "
( 8/5/03 )
4. Britain spies on most of her allies : Mullin recounts a conversation with a security official who tells him that the UK spies on some " very civilised people " , as well as the uncivilised ones .
" The only people we do n't spy on are the Americans , the New Zealanders , Australians and Canadians , who are all part of a little club that has agreed to share the products of their bugging , burgling and bribery . "
( 6/8/99 )
5 . There were doubts about Michael Martin 's ability before he was elected Speaker : " There is unease on our side as to whether Michael is up to it .
' The word from the clerks is that he is n't , ' according to Donald Anderson [ a Labour MP at the time ] . "
( 23/10/00 ) Mullin voted for Martin anyway .
6. Chris Mullin 's advice for politicians : " It 's true I turn down just about all my invitations to socialise with vested interests , in keeping with my First Iron Law of Politics : avoid pointless activity . "
( 19/4/00 )
7 . And John Gilbert 's advice for politicians : " [ Gilbert , a Labour peer ] is full of shrewd insights and useful advice for a budding minister .
' Avoid publicity .
If it 's bad , it will only upset your superiors .
If it 's good , they will be jealous . ' "
( 20/4/00 )
8. Some Labour MPs did not believe Brown had ended boom and bust : " Bruce [ Grocott — Blair 's pps ] went on : ' I do n't believe New Labour has abolished the economic cycle either .
Sooner or later there is going to be an economic crisis . "
( 14/11/00 )
9 . And they seem to have included John Prescott : Mullin quotes Prescott telling ministers that the government could not afford the £ 5bn it would cost to renationalise Railtrack .
" Did we really want to pay that ?
' Do n't forget , if the economy goes down , our reserves would disappear overnight . ' "
( 21/3/01 )
10 . David Blunkett was willing to consider legalising heroin : " Despite his reputation for illiberalism , David is keen to get cannabis downgraded and is even prepared to contemplate legalising and regulating the sale of heroin , ' although I do n't accept that it 's benign ' . "
( 19/6/01 )
11 . And the head of M15 seemed to favour drug legalisation too : " [ Eliza Manningham - Buller , then head of MI5 ] hinted , but did n't quite say , that she might favour legalising and regulating drugs , but would n't be drawn when I pressed her , except to say that a lot of chief constables were privately sympathetic to legalising . "
( 25/2/03 )
12 . Mullin thought David Cameron was a libertarian : " We have an impressive new Tory on the [ home affairs ] committee — David Cameron , a young , bright libertarian who can be relied upon to follow his own instincts rather than the party line . "
( 15/11/01 ) Either Mullin was wrong , or Cameron has changed , because in his conference speech last year the Tory leader said : " Freedom can too easily turn into the idea that we all have the right to do whatever we want , regardless of the effect on others .
That is libertarian , not Conservative — and it is certainly not me . "
If you are the kind of person who has got this far into a Guardian politics blog , you would almost certainly enjoy A View from the Foothills and I recommend it without reservation .
They are probably not quite as colourful as Gyles Brandreth 's diaries ( for my money , the best in recent years ) .
That 's probably because Mullin is more serious about his politics .
But as a picture of how tedious ministerial life can be , they are outstanding .
Digby Jones recently said that being a junior minister is " one of the most dehumanising and de-personalising experiences a human being can have " .
Mullin appeared to enjoy some aspects of his ministerial career , but he has also written many passages that bear out what Jones was saying .

With the revelations that Jay Bybee was in the middle of trying to legalize torture for the Bush administration , particularly with the evidence that he penned the disgusting torture memo in 2002 , I fully support all efforts to have this man impeached .
The OLC is supposed to give sound legal opinions to the executive branch , not bend the law to fit their sick world view which makes this all the more egregious .
As Jeffery Toobin writes in the New Yorker :
The first , and very chilling memo in the group is an analysis of the various techniques that were used by C.I.A. interrogators on Abu Zubaydah .
The author of the memo , which is dated August 1 , 2002 , is Jay S. Bybee , who was the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel .
Bybee concludes that all of these various techniques , including waterboarding , do not constitute torture under American or international law .
Bybee is generally the forgotten man in torture studies of the Bush era .
The best known of the legal architects of the torture regime is John Yoo , who was a deputy to Bybee .
For better or worse , Yoo has been a vocal defender of the various torture policies , and he remains outspoken on these issues .
But whatever happened to his boss ?
Today , Bybee is a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit .
He was confirmed by the Senate on March 13 , 2003 — some time before any of the “ torture memos ” became public .
He has never answered questions about them , has never had to defend his conduct , has never endured anywhere near the amount of public scrutiny ( and abuse ) as Yoo .
It is an understatement to say that he has kept a low profile since becoming a judge .
He certainly slipped under my radar .
When you study men like Cheney , Yoo and David Addington --- it 's very easy for a man like Bybee to slip through the torture cracks .
Now he's on the 9th circuit and for a man to be involved in one of the most revolting moral and ethical violations in American history , he has forfeited the right to be on the 9th circuit .
The only thing left to figure out is how to do it .
The NY Times is also asking of Bybee to be impeached "
That investigation should start with the lawyers who wrote these sickening memos , including John Yoo , who now teaches law in California ; Steven Bradbury , who was job - hunting when we last heard ; and Mr. Bybee , who holds the lifetime seat on the federal appeals court that Mr. Bush rewarded him with .
These memos make it clear that Mr. Bybee is unfit for a job that requires legal judgment and a respect for the Constitution .
Congress should impeach him .
And if the administration will not conduct a thorough investigation of these issues , then Congress has a constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable .
If that means putting Donald Rumsfeld and Alberto Gonzales on the stand , even Dick Cheney , we are sure Americans can handle it .
After eight years without transparency or accountability , Mr. Obama promised the American people both .
His decision to release these memos was another sign of his commitment to transparency .
We are waiting to see an equal commitment to accountability .
Well , not surprising -- it 's up to us to do it and to push the tools we have at our disposal .
d - day has more :
Saying Los Angeles ’ financial troubles are grave and expected to grow far worse in the years ahead , the City Council on Monday approved widespread layoffs and furloughs for city workers but set aside enough money to back away from a proposal to freeze police hiring .
The severity of the cuts remains in flux , however , as city officials and public employee unions continue to negotiate possible salary and benefit concessions that could save the city more than $ 230 million .
But with no agreement in place and a June 1 deadline to pass a balanced budget , the council approved a $ 7.05 - billion spending plan that will force cuts at practically every city agency .
To make up for the city ’s expected $ 530 - million shortfall in 2009 - 2010 , public library and swimming pool hours likely will be reduced , sidewalks wo n’t be repaired and left - turn signals will be installed at fewer intersections .
Advertisement
The budget also imposes 800 city worker layoffs , on top of 400 layoffs approved by the council earlier this month .
It also requires many of the remaining civilian employees to take 26 unpaid furlough days .
The entire city workforce numbers about 50,000 .
The council was able to find more than $ 26 million to avoid imposing a hiring freeze at the Los Angeles Police Department .
The council ’s budget committee last week recommended halting Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ’s police hiring program , a move that would have prevented the LAPD from replacing the roughly 520 officers who leave through normal attrition during a typical year .
Council President Eric Garcetti said 480 replacement officers would be paid for by an unexpected $ 22 - million increase in property tax revenue and a $ 4 - million reimbursement to the city from the U.S. Department of Justice .
Garcetti , a Navy Reserve officer who returned from a training mission to help address the police hiring issue , also took a not - too - subtle swipe at Police Chief William J. Bratton , who last week threatened to pull officers out of Councilman Bill Rosendahl ’s district after his budget committee vote to freeze police hiring .

“ There is no room or space for that . . . in this city , ” Garcetti said .
“ No mayor , no council member , no chief , nobody , has a monopoly on fiscal prudence . ”
The mayor had proposed expanding the LAPD to 10,000 officers by the end of summer , and that goal now appears unlikely to be met , although that could change by year ’s end if the city receives federal stimulus money for police hiring .
But the mayor praised the council ’s efforts to find funding to keep the department near its current staffing level .
“ Public safety is the first responsibility of city government and the core service we provide .
It is fundamental to our success as a city , ” Villaraigosa said in a statement released Monday evening .
“ Over the past four years , we have made remarkable gains -- marked by falling crime rates , gang violence on the retreat and safer neighborhoods -- and we cannot afford to take a step back on public safety . ”
Villaraigosa suffered a setback on his proposal to auction off the city ’s parking meters and six garages to private investors , a plan modeled after long - term leases in Chicago that raised more than $ 1.7 billion .
Advertisement
Villaraigosa ’s proposed budget included $ 80 million from the deal , and his advisors predicted L.A. could pocket a windfall more in the neighborhood of $ 1 billion .
Council members said they were uncertain the plan could generate revenue in time to include it in next year ’s budget .
But members approved $ 500,000 to hire financial advisors to study and possibly structure those proposed transactions in the months ahead .
Scores of unionized city employees crammed into the council chambers when the budget hearing began at 10 a.m. , most pleading with the council to find alternatives to layoffs .
“ You ’re not just laying people off , you ’re shattering lives , ” city traffic Officer Gordon McCullough , 53 , told the council .
With the rising price of gasoline , food and other everyday expenses , it ’s getting tougher and tougher for many employees to get by , McCullough said .
Advertisement
“ There are people who are one paycheck away from landing on the streets , ” McCullough said .
“ It ’s easy to say , ‘ Let ’s lay people off . ’
It ’s hard to work to make government more efficient . ”
Councilwoman Wendy Greuel said the cuts approved by the council were difficult because they would affect families and neighborhoods throughout the city , but they were necessary : “ If we did n’t make these difficult decisions now , it would be even worse next year . ”
Villaraigosa has said he may be forced to lay off up to 3,000 workers if the unions do not agree to major concessions , including a possible salary freeze , buyouts , furloughs or paying higher costs for health and pension benefits .
The L.A. Coalition of Unions , which represents 22,000 city employees , is pushing for an early retirement package that would be offered to workers who are within five years of retirement .
Aides to the mayor , however , said that would overburden the city ’s underfunded pension systems .
Advertisement
The city ’s top budget analyst predicts that L.A. could face a $ 1 - billion budget shortfall in 2010 - 2011 , and one even larger the year after , because of investment losses in the pension systems .
By law , the city is obligated to keep the pension systems solvent .
The Los Angeles City Employees ’ Retirement System and the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pensions are expected to suffer combined investment losses of 25 % in the current budget year and to have flat returns in the next year .
By 2014 , the city ’s annual contributions to the two pension funds could grow to $ 2 billion .

Spam , that annoying but ignorable scourge of the Web , has finally recovered from the jolt it received last November , when Internet backbone providers cut off McColo Corporation , a California Web - hosting service that spammers were using to coordinate e-mail attacks .
The average seven - day spam volume during the latter half of March is now at roughly the same levels as October of last year — around 94 percent of all e-mail — according to the antispam company Postini , a division of Google .
At first , the McColo takedown cut global spam traffic by about 70 percent , according to Postini , which provides e-mail security for more than 50,000 businesses and 15 million business users .
“ By far , it was the most dramatic event we have ever seen , ” said Adam Swidler , product marketing manager for Postini Services .
But this year , average spam volumes have increased about 1.2 percent each day .
And there is evidence that spammers are now building more decentralized , peer - to - peer spamming botnets that no longer rely on the visible and vulnerable control nodes that they were using at McColo to guide their spam e-mail campaigns .
“ What the spammers have been using to rebuild is more technically advanced than what got taken out and is itself a more resilient technology , ” Mr. Swidler said .
“ It ’s unlikely we are going to see another event like McColo where taking out an I.S.P. has that kind of dramatic impact on global spam volumes . ”
Postini is also reporting Tuesday on a new kind of spam called location - based spam .
When gullible users click on a link in a spam message , they are directed to a Web page that contains a fake news headline and a purported video describing a nearby crisis , using the user ’s I.P. address to identify the nearest major city .
When the now curious and gullible users click on the video , their computer is infected with a virus .

The New York - based bank said it earned $ 3.39 per share , easily surpassing analysts ’ forecasts for profit of $ 1.64 per share .
This compares with earnings of $ 1.47 billion , or $ 3.23 per share , in the quarter ended Feb. 29 of last year , and is a huge improvement over the $ 2.29 billion Goldman lost in the fourth quarter .
Goldman Sachs , in another sign that banks may be turning around , beat Wall Street ’s earnings expectations as it reported a profit of $ 1.66 billion for the first three months of this year .
The bank also said it planned to raise $ 5 billion in stock to help it pay back government bailout funds .
Hey , who knew that having all of your executives involved in the Obama administration could be so …
PROFITABLE :
One has to love the sequence of events here .
Back in 2004 , Goldman chief Hank Paulson goes to SEC chief William Donaldson and petitions to have lending restrictions relaxed for the top five investment banks .
Donaldson rolls over , the restrictions are relaxed , and it ’s a disaster , as the top five banks immediately overleverage themselves — two of the five , Bear Stearns and Lehman , would actually collapse , at least partially as a result of being insanely overleveraged .
In the midst of this disaster , Paulson is named Treasury secretary .
He does nothing about the worsening financial crisis until it is far too late , then allows one of Goldman ’s biggest competitors , Lehman , to fail while at the same time intervening on a huge scale to save AIG , which just happens to owe Goldman a ton of money .
When AIG is bailed out , its government regulator is not in the room , but the new chief of Goldman , Lloyd Blankfein , is .
In fact , Goldman Sachs ultimately receives about $ 13 billion of the money paid to AIG by the government in the bailout , reportedly getting paid 100 cents on the dollar for its AIG exposure , despite the fact that the bank claimed it was n’t going to suffer severe losses if AIG collapsed .
Two Saudis released from Guantanamo have resurfaced in Yemen
Saudi Arabia has issued a list of 83 wanted militants living overseas , calling on them to return to their home country and resume normal life .
All the suspects are Saudis , except for two men from neighbouring Yemen .
The kingdom has put many militants returning from the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay or from Iraq through rehabilitation programmes .
But officials have acknowledged recently that some of these have rejoined armed groups .
Last month al - Qaeda 's wing in neighbouring Yemen named two Saudis released from Guantanamo as commanders .
Fear of backlash
Since 2003 Saudi Arabia has cracked down on those suspected of militant activity within the country , saying in October that it had charged 991 al - Qaeda suspects over attacks .
Most militants on wanted lists have been killed by security forces or arrested .
But correspondents say Saudi Arabia has been more cautious in pursuing people suspected of attacks outside the country , fearing a backlash from domestic sympathisers .
Interior ministry spokesman Brig Gen Mansour al - Turki told the Associated Press news agency that the men should turn themselves in to Saudi embassies .
" They will help them return to Saudi Arabia and unite with their families , " he said .
" Reuniting with their families may not happen instantly .
There may be a process that might include rehabilitation . "
The Saudi - owned Al - Arabiya satellite news channel identified one of the 83 wanted as Saleh al - Qaraawi , leader of al - Qaeda in Saudi Arabia .
Saudi TV cited an interior ministry official as saying 15 other men had gone back to their families , and " been helped to return to a normal life " .
It said the men had " adopted the straying ideology " , a reference to al - Qaeda .
( CNN ) --
Two people were shot and killed Friday at a community college in Dearborn , Michigan , in what police believe was a murder - suicide , an official said .
The Henry Ford Community College campus in Dearborn , Michigan , was locked down after the shooting .
A man and woman were found dead in a classroom building on the campus of Henry Ford Community College , Dearborn Deputy Chief Gregg Brighton said .
Investigators believe the man shot the woman but would not provide further information , Brighton said .
A shotgun was involved in the incident , which occurred in a classroom that was not being used , he said .
" We 're in the very preliminary stages , " Brighton said .
" We 've just made the scene safe .
The crime lab is on the scene with detectives . "
Watch Brighton describe the scene »
Police responding to a report of gunfire at the school had entered the south hallway of the Fine Arts Building when they heard another gunshot , Brighton said .
" We were in the building when we heard the shotgun blast , and when we finally got to that room , we had two deceased parties , " he said at a news conference .

Hi guys , I 'm trying to get back into the RPG thing again , but since I 've been out of it for quite awhile , my favorite game systems have evolved into new editions , and I do n't have the resources to upgrade right now .
My questions is are there some good , free games out there that I can take a look at ?
My first choice would be something like Shadworun .
I really like the world and game mechanics .
I 've also played D&D for most of my gaming career , and I like what they have done with 4th Edition , but is beyond my means at the moment .
Also , free would be good since it seems like most of the visible gaming scene here is D&D , and it might be easier to get people to try a " non-standard " game if new players do n't have to lay down a bunch of cash for a new game .
I thought I saw some links to a free game listing , but I can't seem to find it now , and my work firewall wo n't let me use the search function .
Thanks ,
Argentis
RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - A video made with the help of U.S. missionaries and depicting Amazon Indians burying children alive is “ faked ” and inciting racial hatred , a group campaigning for tribal rights said Thursday .
The short video , “ Hakani , ” has been watched more than 350,000 times on the YouTube video - sharing website .
It depicts scenes of Indians in an isolated forest village digging graves and burying several live children in them .
The “ Hakani ” campaign also has a website and a group on networking site Facebook with more than 13,000 members .
London - based Survival International said in a statement the film is “ faked , that the earth covering the children ’s faces is actually chocolate cake , and that the film ’s claim that infanticide among Brazilian Indians is widespread is false . ”
“ People are being taught to hate Indians , even wish them dead , ” said Survival ’s director , Stephen Corry .
The video was made by the son of the founder of an American missionary organization called Youth with a Mission , which has a branch in Brazil known as Jocum .
Youth with a Mission is an interdenominational Christian group based in Hawaii which focuses on involving young people in evangelism in 149 countries , its website says .
Enock Freire , one of the makers of the film , said Youth With a Mission helped in the production of the film , which he acknowledged was fictional and aimed at drawing attention to what he said was a serious problem .
“ It ( infanticide ) is common , ” he said from Hawaii .
“ This distortion that we are trying to incite hate is untrue . ”
Infanticide is practiced by some tribes in the Amazon region , sometimes on disabled children , often based on the belief that children who take their last breath above land will come back to haunt a community .
But Survival says it is rare and becoming rarer as healthcare access improves .
Brazil ’s Indian affairs department has tried to bar the film , which it says was financed by Jocum , saying it denigrates the image of the more than 220 ethnicities that live in Brazil .
‘ POWERFUL DOCUDRAMA ’
Neither the video , the “ Hakani ” campaign website nor the Facebook group include any mention of the missionary group or any contact details .
Corry said the group was trying to play down its role in the film .
The website says the girl “ Hakani ” was rescued from her tribe , and that she was among what it says are hundreds of children targeted for death each year among Brazil ’s tribes .
It says the video is a “ powerful docudrama ” and urges people to donate money and write letters in support of a proposed Brazilian law , known as Muwaji ’s Law , which would abolish infanticide by indigenous groups .
“ The only thing we are trying to do is save lives , ” said Freire .
Survival says the law , by requiring Brazilians to report to authorities anything seen as a “ harmful traditional ” practice , would foster “ witch hunts ” against indigenous people .
“ I think the missionaries are stirring up hatred against the Indians , who they profess to be concerned about , ” said Fiona Watson , a Brazil campaigner for Survival .
“ The infanticide is not being explained ; it ’s being taken out of context . ”
Mafia Law Used Against Environmentalists for Tree Sits , Civil Disobedience , Blog Post
Two environmental activists in Bloomington , Ind. , have been charged with racketeering –charges originally intended to target the mob–for allegedly “ conspiring ” to engage in tree sits , participate in non-violent civil disobedience , and make an inflammatory blog post .
Hugh Farrell and Gina “ Tiga ” Wertz are organizers in the campaign to halt expansion of the I - 69 NAFTA superhighway .
They were arrested on Friday , April 24th , and they ’re each facing five charges that carry a maximum of eight years in prison .
Four of the charges are misdemeanors for “ intimidation ” and “ conversion ” ( treating someone else ’s property as your own ) .
All four misdemeanors are related to a civil disobedience stunt where some activists removed the furniture from an I - 69 project office , occupied the space , and posted an eviction notice .
The government says the civil disobedience stunt was intended to place Ronnie Wilson in fear , and subject him to “ contempt or ridicule . ”
The felony charge is for corrupt business influence , or racketeering .
The government is n’t arguing that these activists were actually engaged in racketeering , but that they are part of Roadblock EarthFirst ( described as a criminal enterprise ) and “ conspired ” to do so .
According to their arrest warrants , Farrell and Wertz :
“ Conspired ” to remove office furniture from I - 69 project offices as part of eviction notice stunts .
“ Conspired ” to post an “ internet blog on two publicly accessed website stating ‘ you will suffer the consequences ’ and ‘ perhaps we ’ll go to your homes , children ’s daycare , churches or wherever else you happen to turn your back . ”
The blog posts were made after the violent removal of activists from a tree sit .
“ Conspired ” to commit “ theft ” when six individuals blocked the entrance to Gohmann Asphalt and Construction Company using non-violent civil disobedience and caused a loss of profits .
“ Conspired ” to commit “ theft ” by “ taking unauthorized control of trees ” and “ depriving lawful owners of use and / or value of the said trees . ”
( Note : the last two bullets are only in Wertz ’s arrest warrant . )
Racketeering laws are intended to combat organized crime , such as the mafia , and include crimes like extortion , bribery and money laundering .
Although ambitious prosecutors have tried to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) to target anti-abortion activists , animal rights activists , and the Hells Angels , the purpose of the law has always been to go after illegal business activity .
But these activists , and others like them , are not protesting this superhighway to make money .
They ’re not doing it for personal gain .
Halting this environmental destruction will not financially benefit them in any way .
Then why use mob laws against them ?
Because of their beliefs .
Tree sits , office takeovers and road blockades are against the law , and the government has the tools and resources to prosecute those crimes .
But because of the politics of the alleged crimes , prosecutors are reaching for more .
Civil disobedience has become “ theft . ”
Tree sits have become “ unauthorized control of trees . ”
These trumped - up charges are a way to take what are , at the very worst , misdemeanor crimes and turn them into federal crimes .
It ’s an attack on individuals perceived as being leaders in the movement for the sole purpose of stamping out dissent .
A support website for Hugh Farrell and Gina “ Tiga ” Wertz has been set up at http://mostlyeverything.net.

Maine Bear Monitoring 2009
Spent the morning of Feb 20 with state biologist doing their annual bear monitoring , I was with them for only one of many dens they 'll examine in the next few weeks , in this pic you see the biologist holding up tracking equipment , the bears wear a collar that sends out a signal .
a few hundred yards away they 've located what they think is a den .
doing some digging around .
one of the technicians inadvertently steps thru and into a hole some 7 - 8 ' away , they 've found the den ..
a jab stick is prepared , this injection will sedate the bear so she can be removed from the den and given an examination .
in this picture you see the biologist entering the den to inject the bear .
on the way out he picks up the cub that was closest to the entrance and hands it off to Randy Cross ( group leader ) .
he carefully examines the male cub
cub is weighed and measured by another biologist ... 2.8 lbs .
All data is entered into the bear 's chart .
now they wait 10 minutes for the sedative to take effect on the mother bear ... then she can be pulled out of the den .
ten minutes have gone by and it's time to pull the mother bear out of the den .
she 's almost all out .
checking her teeth .
she 's completely examined and a new collar is being prepared to replaced the old one , note the white patches on her chest .
the exams complete , a family portrait is taken just before they are returned to the den , thanks to Chuck Johnston ( holding the 2 cubs ) for making the arrangements that enabled me to get these pictures ..
the rest of these pictures show the cubs and some of the people involved that morning .
their eyes are n't open yet
cute !!
taking a snooze !
go to here to see last March 's bear monitoring
about 6 weeks old .
The use of torture by the US has proved so counter - productive that it may have led to the death of as many US soldiers as civilians killed in 9/11 , says the leader of a crack US interrogation team in Iraq .
" The reason why foreign fighters joined al - Qa'ida in Iraq was overwhelmingly because of abuses at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and not Islamic ideology , " says Major Matthew Alexander , who personally conducted 300 interrogations of prisoners in Iraq .
It was the team led by Major Alexander [ a named assumed for security reasons ] that obtained the information that led to the US military being able to locate Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the head of al - Qa'ida in Iraq .
Zarqawi was then killed by bombs dropped by two US aircraft on the farm where he was hiding outside Baghdad on 7 June 2006 .
Major Alexander said that he learnt where Zarqawi was during a six - hour interrogation of a prisoner with whom he established relations of trust .
Major Alexander 's attitude to torture by the US is a combination of moral outrage and professional contempt .
" It plays into the hands of al - Qa'ida in Iraq because it shows us up as hypocrites when we talk about human rights , " he says .
An eloquent and highly intelligent man with experience as a criminal investigator within the US military , he says that torture is ineffective , as well as counter - productive .
" People will only tell you the minimum to make the pain stop , " he says .
" They might tell you the location of a house used by insurgents but not that it is booby - trapped . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In his compelling book How to Break a Terrorist , Major Alexander explains that prisoners subjected to abuse usually clam up , say nothing , or provide misleading information .
In an interview he was particularly dismissive of the " ticking bomb " argument often used in the justification of torture .
This supposes that there is a bomb timed to explode on a bus or in the street which will kill many civilians .
The authorities hold a prisoner who knows where the bomb is .
Should they not torture him to find out in time where the bomb is before it explodes ?
Major Alexander says he faced the " ticking time bomb " every day in Iraq because " we held people who knew about future suicide bombings " .
Leaving aside the moral arguments , he says torture simply does not work .
" It hardens their resolve .
They shut up . "
He points out that the FBI uses normal methods of interrogation to build up trust even when they are investigating a kidnapping and time is of the essence .
He would do the same , he says , " even if my mother was on a bus " with a hypothetical ticking bomb on board .
It is quite untrue to imagine that torture is the fastest way of obtaining information , he says .
A career officer , Major Alexander spent 14 years in the US air force , beginning by flying helicopters for special operations .
He saw combat in Bosnia and Kosovo , was an air force counter - intelligence agent and criminal interrogator , and was stationed in Saudi Arabia , with an anti-terrorist role , during the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Some years later , the US army was short of interrogators .
He wanted to help shape developments in Iraq and volunteered .
Arriving in Iraq in early 2006 he found that the team he was working with were mostly dedicated , but young , men between 18 and 24 .
" Many of them had never been out of the States before , " he recalls .
" When they sat down to interrogate somebody it was often the first time they had met a Muslim . "
In addition to these inexperienced officers , Major Alexander says there was " an old guard " of interrogators using the methods employed at Guantanamo .
He could not say exactly what they had been doing for legal reasons , though in the rest of the interview he left little doubt that prisoners were being tortured and abused .
The " old guard 's " methods , he says , were based on instilling " fear and control " in a prisoner .
He refused to take part in torture and abuse , and forbade the team he commanded to use such methods .
Instead , he says , he used normal US police interrogation techniques which are " based on relationship building and a degree of deception " .
He adds that the deception was often of a simple kind such as saying untruthfully that another prisoner has already told all .
Before he started interrogating insurgent prisoners in Iraq , he had been told that they were highly ideological and committed to establishing an Islamic caliphate in Iraq , Major Alexander says .
In the course of the hundreds of interrogations carried out by himself , as well as more than 1,000 that he supervised , he found that the motives of both foreign fighters joining al - Qa'ida in Iraq and Iraqi - born members were very different from the official stereotype .
In the case of foreign fighters – recruited mostly from Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Syria , Yemen and North Africa – the reason cited by the great majority for coming to Iraq was what they had heard of the torture in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib .
These abuses , not fundamentalist Islam , had provoked so many of the foreign fighters volunteering to become suicide bombers .
For Iraqi Sunni Arabs joining al - Qa'ida , the abuses played a role , but more often the reason for their recruitment was political rather than religious .
They had taken up arms because the Shia Arabs were taking power ; de-Baathification marginalised the Sunni and took away their jobs ; they feared an Iranian takeover .
Above all , al - Qa'ida was able to provide money and arms to the insurgents .
Once , Major Alexander recalls , the top US commander in Iraq , General George Casey , came to visit the prison where he was working .
Asking about what motivated the suspected al - Qa'ida prisoners , he was at first given the official story that they were Islamic Jihadi full of religious zeal .
Major Alexander intervened to say that this really was not true and there was a much more complicated series of motivations at work .
General Casey did not respond .
The objective of Major Alexander 's team was to find Zarqawi , the Jordanian born leader of al - Qa'ida who built it into a fearsome organisation .
Attempts by US military intelligence to locate him had failed despite three years of trying .
Major Alexander was finally able to persuade one of Zarqawi's associates to give away his location because the associate had come to reject his methods , such as the mass slaughter of civilians .
What the major discovered was that many of the Sunni fighters were members of , or allied to , al - Qa'ida through necessity .
They did not share its extreme , puritanical Sunni beliefs or hatred of the Shia majority .
He says that General Casey had ignored his findings but he was pleased when General David Petraeus became commander in Iraq and began to take account of the real motives of the Sunni fighters .
" He peeled back those Sunnis from al - Qa'ida , " he says .
In the aftermath of his experience in Iraq , which he left at the end of 2006 , Major Alexander came to believe that the battle against the US using torture was more important than the war in Iraq .
He sees President Obama 's declaration against torture as " a historic victory " , though he is concerned about loopholes remaining and the lack of accountability of senior officers .
Reflecting on his own interrogations , he says he always monitored his actions by asking himself , " If the enemy was doing this to one of my troops , would I consider it torture ? "
His overall message is that the American people do not have to make a choice between torture and terror .

The US interrogators who used brains , not brutality , to take down the deadliest man in Iraq , by Matthew Alexander and John R Bruning ( The Free Press )
If you google “ I hate Twitter ” you ’ll find a bunch of results with “ I hate Twitter ” in the title .
However , if you actually go and read any of these articles they are all liars !
These people do n’t really hate Twitter .
Most say stuff like this …
“ I hate Twitter because I ’m so addicted to it ! ” “ I hate Twitter because I have no time to vlog anymore ” “ I hate Twitter because it ’s down all the time ”
That ’s lame .
If you willingly use Twitter then you ca n’t really hate it because if you really hated it you would n’t use it in the first place .
Here ’s an example .
I hate Broccoli ( I feel like I ’m eating trees and I hate the taste ) .
However , you ’ll never see me eating broccoli and hear me say “ I hate Broccoli because it ’s so addictive . ”
I stay the hell away from broccoli .
If Broccoli enters a room , I would walk up to Broccoli and punch it in it ’s green healthy face .
That ’s how much I hate Broccoli .
That ’s hatred .
I was looking to find people who really hate Twitter , but instead I found a bunch of posers .
So before I go any further , let me make this clear .
I TRULY hate Twitter …no if ’s , and ’s , or but’s .
Why I hate Twitter
The natural question to ask is , “ Why do you hate Twitter ? ”
It ’s simple , Twitter murdered my family .
Ok , so maybe not , but to explain my hatred of Twitter it helps to understand my irrational hatred of things .
Here ’s a random list of things I hate in no particular order and why I hate them :
Miley Cyrus :
That song where she sings “ I ’m just being Miley ” drives me up the wall … and I do n’t like the fact that she sounds too manly ( maybe this is related to my insecurity issues )
That song where she sings “ I ’m just being Miley ” drives me up the wall … and I do n’t like the fact that she sounds too manly ( maybe this is related to my insecurity issues ) Disney Channel :
Have you tried watching any of their shows ?
Hannah Montana , some other show about some rich twins who own a hotel , etc …
They are all crap .
If my kids ever watch that , I ’ll punch them in their face …
Have you tried watching any of their shows ?
Hannah Montana , some other show about some rich twins who own a hotel , etc …
They are all crap .
If my kids ever watch that , I ’ll punch them in their face …
Pocahontas :
When I watched the trailer for this movie I saw a talking tree ( aka Grandmother Willow ) , and was like , “ What a talking tree ??
That ’s ridiculous ! ”
Since then I ’ve refused to watch the movie .
When I watched the trailer for this movie I saw a talking tree ( aka Grandmother Willow ) , and was like , “ What a talking tree ??
That ’s ridiculous ! ”
Since then I ’ve refused to watch the movie .
Broccoli ( already mentioned above )
If you watch South Park .
I ’m kind of like Cartman .
Cartman hates all kinds of random things from Jews to hippies to prostitutes .
Do n’t get me wrong , I like Jews , hippies , and even prostitutes ( everyone ’s got to make a living , right ? ) , but what amuses me so much about Cartman is that he just loves to hate .
In the same way once I latch onto hating something … I do n’t want to let go ( just like Rose did n’t want to Jack to let go in Titanic ) .
However , after a little more thought on the subject I ’ve been able to break down the main reason I hate Twitter .
I hate hearing about Twitter everyday .
In one day I ’ll normally hear Twitter mentioned like a thousand times .
Here are all the places that I normally get Twitter drilled into my skull :
On the TV : CNBC ( a financial stock reporting tv station ) – “ You can check out all the great stock tips on our Twitter page at blah blah blah ”
CNBC ( a financial stock reporting tv station ) – “ You can check out all the great stock tips on our Twitter page at blah blah blah ” On the Radio : 102.7 Kiss FM ( local LA top 40 radio station ) – “ Ryan Seacrest here , you can check out all my awesome celebrity dirt by following my Twitter … ”
102.7 Kiss FM ( local LA top 40 radio station ) – “ Ryan Seacrest here , you can check out all my awesome celebrity dirt by following my Twitter … ”
On the Toilet : Businessweek Magazine lying around– “ Twenty Ways to Boost Your Business with Twitter ”
Businessweek Magazine lying around– “ Twenty Ways to Boost Your Business with Twitter ” At Home : My Mom– “ Ben , do you have a Twitter page ? ”
It ’s like that screeching sound you hear when people drag their nails across the chalkboard … that ’s what it ’s like every time I hear people mention Twitter .
Something is definitely wrong when even my parent ’s know about Twitter !
So part of my hatred for Twitter is because I hear about it all the time , but the bigger picture is that I just hate things that become extremely popular seemingly overnight .
It ’s like a phobia of mine .
To better illustrate this i created this graph of My Hatred of Twitter :
The graph is pretty simple .
The more I hear about Twitter the more I hate it .
When Twitter first came out , I was cool with it because no one was talking about it .
About six months ago , I started noticing a few more people talking about it , mildly annoying , but bearable .
Now complete strangers come up to me and say “ You need to be on Twitter , ” it has passed from Annoying to Full on Hatred .
Here ’s the funny thing , I ’ve known about Twitter since they first came out .
I thought it was a very interesting product / idea when they first came out .
I thought it was cool that you could send updates from you cell phone to your Twitter account all for free .
I even went out of my way to learn all I could about Twitter .
I read interviewers with the founders , read about their software architecture , and even told other people how I thought it was a cool product .
But I never thought it would be as popular as it is today .
And it ’s because it ’s become so popular that I ’ve developed my hatred for it .
Things always worry me when people act super crazy about them .
I take a very cynical view of mankind .
I think once everyone starts doing something there is cause to worry .
It ’s like how Spider Man has Spidey Senses when danger is around , when everyone starts doing something or talking about it alarms go off in my head … to stay away .
I ’ll call this power Lemmy Senses ( named in honor of those adorable Lemmings ) .
Here are examples where my Lemmy Senses went off and I stayed away until it was safe :
The Macarena Dance :
The younger Millenial generation might not have been old enough to experience this “ phenomenon , ” but I remember how it was all the rage .
That ludicrous dance and music .
Once the music came on it was like moths to a flame … everyone to the dance floor .
I steered clear .

The Atkins Diet :
It seemed at one point everyone was talking about the Atkins diet …
Oprah was even on it and even Fast Food restaurants had Atkins friendly menu items .
It was the thing to be on if you wanted to lose weight .
I saw people lose a ton of weight fast … only to gain back just as fast .
But then out of nowhere it just died .

Nazis and Hitler :
This before my time ( and country ) but if you think about it Hitler managed to convince people that it was OK to exterminate Jewish people .
It was the “ in ” thing to do .
Ok , so comparing Twitter to Nazis and Hitler is a little extreme , but the point of all this is that the reason I get weirded - out by Twitter is I feel most super popular things do n’t last and sometimes people die because of them .
But I ’m starting to digress , let me continue back on some other reasons why I hate Twitter .
Other Reasons for Hating Twitter
This post is starting to get a little long … so I ’ll rapid fire the rest of my reasons for hating Twitter .
I hate Twitter because …
People talk about it like it ’s the next greatest thing … like it ’s the Second coming of Jesus great .
“ Twitter is so awesome like I can get so much feedback from all of my followers blah blah blah ” Will Twitter wash my car for me ?
Will it wipe my butt ?
If Twitter did that I might like it better .
It ’s a waste of time .
People talk about how great Twitter is because they only allow you to put in 140 characters for each “ Tweet ” which makes people be more concise and only say things that are “ valuable . ”
Sure that might be true , but if you are spending a lot of time responding and updating then it eats up just as much time as it would if it was n’t 140 characters .
People will also argue that it ’s valuable to get feedback and discover new things before anyone else does , but is that really more valuable than the loss in productivity ?
Actually you know what would be faster ?
Just stick electrodes in my head and stream all my thoughts to Twitter … that way it would n’t take up any time .
Twitter should look into that feature .
The Lingo and Jargon .
Like all “ cool ” things Twitter has to have it ’s own language : Tweets , Fail Whale , Twittering , Twitwits , Twatted , Twitterfic , Tweetarded , etc …
To an outsider it ’s pretty overwhelming to look at something like this :
I mean what the hell is that ?
I see “ RT ” is that Real Time ?
When I see an @ sign I think of email address , so @pinkheels must be someone ’s email addresses ?
“ 14 Tips to Deal with Conflict ” I understand because it ’s English .
Then there is some link to a website called “ Tiny Url ” following it which I can only assume must be a link to these 14 Tips .
Later on it says this is from some user called TweetDeck .
Putting this all togther I can only assume that TweetDeck is telling me that he / she will be real time emailing to someone at the email address @pinkheels about 14 Tips to Deal with Conflict .
Awesome to know !
Thanks !
I did n’t come up with the idea myself !
Yeah , I ’m just plain jealous I did n’t come up with Twitter .
Conclusion
So there you have it .
I have said my piece .
I really hate Twitter .
*** UPDATE 4/3/09 ****
I ’m happy to report that if you google “ I hate twitter ” now my post now appear on the first page of google search results .
As of now I ’m the 5th result .
Finally someone who hates twitter is on the first page !
I wonder if it can get to number 1 ?
I also wanted to point out some other guys I found ( after a little more digging ) who actually hate twitter like I hate twitter :
*** UPDATE 4/14/09 ***
I ’m sad to report that I ’m no longer on the first page of google for searching “ I hate twitter . ”
I think my last update screwed up my chances … after I posted that I no longer appeared on any search result .
So my guess is that google punished me for talking poorly about their beloved Twitter .
Yes , I know technically they have n’t bought twitter yet , but it ’s only a matter of time .
In better news if you do google the phrase “ I hate twitter so much ” I once again show up on the first page of the google search .
*** UPDATE 8/18/09 ***
It ’s been an interesting past 4 months in Twitter Hateland .
At my last update I was not even on the first page for “ i hate twitter , ” but as many of the commenters have let me known , I moved up to the number 2 spot just behind Grayson Davis at OpenSalon.com .
However , on a whim today I decided to search today and was pleasantly surprised by this google search result :
That ’s right folks .
I ’ve made it to the top and can now claim the title of Number 1 Twitter Hater in the World ( at least the world according to google ) .
Thank you all for your twitter hate support .
Without all of you searching , linking , and commenting I could have never gotten to where I am today .
Thank you again !
( Hopefully my reign at number 1 will be long and glorious ) .
Time Warner Cable plans to test its controversial , new scheme to have users pay by the gigabyte in Rochester , New York , but the area 's freshman congressman calls usage caps greedy and plans to introduce legislation to stop it .
New York Democratic Rep. Eric Massa called TWC 's proposal to switch its 8.4 million cable broadband customers to metered internet billing an " outrageous plan to tax the American people . "
Massa , a longtime blogger at the liberal site DailyKos , says he will be joined by a " legion of activists " and called the fight against usage caps a " national issue of generational consequences . "
However , Massa 's fight will not get far without support from powerful House members , including Virginia Democrat Rick Boucher who now controls a key committee on telecoms and the internet .
Critics say usage caps will cost users more and hurt innovation on the net — especially in new video services , as subscribers begin to calorie - count their internet usage .
TWC 's new tiered pricing structure for its Roadrunner internet service starts at $ 15 for a plan that allows 1 GB a month with an overage charge of $ 2 per GB .
( A GB of data equals about three hours of online video from Hulu.com and about half of a rented standard definition movie . )
The company says bandwidth hogs need to pay their fair share and maintain that if the company does n't get enough money to build new infrastructure , " internet brownouts " will be inevitable .
In a conference call with reporters Tuesday , Massa dismissed those arguments , describing TWC as a greedy , unregulated monopoly providing a utility service .
His yet - to - be - introduced bill would seek to increase competition among broadband providers and regulate monopolies , he said , though he declined to give specifics .
" They are providing a utility and frankly you should not be able to impose cascading rate increases without justifying them , " Massa said .
" What Time Warner is saying is not true and their own SEC filings show that .
This is AIG - style greed . "
Company spokesman Alex Dudley said the company cannot comment on the proposed legislation since it has not seen it , but emphasized the company is trying to test whether this is the right pricing model , or not .
As Wired.com first pointed out , Time Warner Cable 's 2008 annual report shows its high - speed data costs actually declined by 12 percent to $ 146
million .
Meanwhile its subscriber count increased by more than 10 percent to 8.4
million , and high - speed data revenues climbed to more than $ 4 billion .
But TWC's Dudley says that the $ 146 million it paid in 2008 was simply the cost to transport traffic across the internet backbone .
The company is warning that net traffic rose " exponentially " at 30 percent a year — putting the net in danger , but its cost to transfer that data across the net 's backbone fell from $ 164 million in 2007 .
Still , according to Dudley , the company has other costs ( labor , vans and hardware ) that also go up with increased usage .
Those are typically considered fixed costs that do n't vary much whether a customer uses the net some or a lot , though Dudley disagrees .
" That $ 146 million is a small part of the variable costs , " Dudley said .
" Demands placed on network are a factor , such as ' Do we have to split a node to accommodate heavy use ? '
Those are capital costs that are directly related to use . "
TWC first tested the plans in Beaumont , Texas , and is now collecting usage data in Rochester , New York and the Texas cities San Antonio and
Austin , in preparation for an expanded metered billing test later this summer .
The plan has faced intense criticism since the company announced the changes at the beginning of the month .
Hoping to mollify its critics , the company modified its tiers last Thursday , increasing the usage caps for each tier and adding a $ 150 all - you - can download plan .
Nearly all U.S. residential broadband providers sell their services based on bandwidth speeds , with no mention of a usage cap .
Experts say that 's in part because there 's little data for the companies to base their pricing on , and because if one company offers unlimited data , the others do as well , at least in markets where there is broadband competition .
Broadband usage continues to grow , most recently thanks to an explosion in online video services , but the cost of moving those bits also continues to fall .
Time Warner is n't alone in its campaign to crack down on heavy net users .
AT&T announced last November that it would test monthly bandwidth caps and overage fees .
Comcast installed a 250 - GB cap last
August ; Canada 's Rogers enforces a 60 GB limit ; and New York - based DSL
provider Frontier has a miserly 5 - GB limit ( though public pressure forced the company not to enforce it ) .
Timothy Karr , a campaign director at the consumer advocate group
FreePress , argues that TWC is unfairly trying to protect its lucrative cable television business from customers switching over to online video .
" Charging consumers penalty fees on top of what they are already paying to download a movie or show will cripple online video , " Karr said last week .
" This is a win -win situation for Time Warner .
Congress must investigate these anti-competitive practices before they become a nationwide problem . "
A Massa spokesman said the text of the bill would be ready late in the week .
This story has been updated with comments from Time Warner Cable .

What happened to gut the housing market so dramatically ?
Throughout the nation , financial decline in industry has destroyed housing prices in geographic centers of those industries .
You can credit the big three automakers — or “ small three ” — with the most dramatic and largest geographic area of decline .
The Rust Belt , once home to steel mills and plants associated with MoTown , has plummeted in population .
As the automaking and steel industries declined , the Rust Belt paid the price .
Other industries across the nation are also feeling the pinch .
When the industries decline , jobs dry up and homeowners either move away or lose their homes to foreclosure .
The empty homes can be good deals for savvy buyers who know exactly what they ’re getting into .
But there ’s usually some kind of catch to these deals , so buyer beware .
Out of more than 6,000 Detroit residential listings at Realtor.com , just 3 percent cost more than $ 20,000 .
Crime problems and the collapse of the American automakers has left many parts of Detroit a wasteland and sent the housing market plummeting .
A Detroit real estate agent called parts of Detroit “ urban prairie . ”
Aside from the dangerous neighborhoods and dilapidated conditions of most of these houses , there ’s another catch : any buyer must bring the property up to compliance with the Detroit housing code or face enormous fines from the city .
If you ’ve got deep pockets , are prepared to renovate the property and no fear of violent crime , Detroit properties could be for you .
Like most states in the Rust Belt , Cleveland was hard - hit by the devastation of the U.S. auto industry .
The City of Cleveland estimates that 10,000 houses in the city , or 1 in 13 houses , are vacant .
The city ’s population has fallen off steadily since the 1960s and the decline of American steel mills .
The Cleveland city government demolishes 1,000 houses a year to prevent blight from setting in .
If you ’re really tough , look for bargains in the Industrial Valley , Youngstown and Kinsman neighboorhoods .
Although the steel industry in Pennsylvania has been hurting for decades and the population has begun to move on , the housing market has n’t fully bounced back .
Any Rust Belt town with heavy losses due to steel or automotive manufacturing is a good place to look for deals .
The former home city of President Obama and its neighbor in Indiana are both suffering from high crime and Big Three - related blight .
Neither have fallen below $ 1,000 , but may in the near future if local industry continues to drop and crime to increase .
Indiana is another Rust Belt state in decline .
In Marion County , Indiana , the county containing the state capitol of Indianapolis , one in every 254 homes was in foreclosure as of February 2009 .
The Indianapolis Business Journal advises buying and holding rather than hoping to make a quick profit with “ house flipping , ” as many potential renters or buyers still ca n’t afford market prices .
Nevada has the most foreclosures of any state in the U.S.
The hot housing market of the past few years led to unsustainable growth , overstocking builders and overstretched buyers .
If you ’re a gambling type who knows when to fold ‘em , you might be able to get a deal near Las Vegas .
All of Michigan has taken huge hits from the auto industry ’s demise .
University - centered Ann Arbor is not exempt .
Houses with huge square footage have reached incredible lows as overstocked builders scramble to empty their inventories .
This could be one spot where there ’s no catch involved .
If you are like me , you are insanely sick and tired of those damn telemarketing calls informing you that your " car warranty is about to expire . "
My phone number gets flooded with these ; even when I block them , add to the " reject call " list , follow their instructions to remove me from their list , etc .
So imagine the frustration added to the whole shebang when I learned about Darain Atkinson , owner of the Christian " faith - based " U.S. Fidelis company , complete with a halo logo and all .
U.S. Fidelis is being investigated by at least 40 states to see if they have violated consumer protection laws .
According to the Better Business Bureau , more than 1,000 people have filed complaints against U.S. Fidelis and affiliated companies for deceptive practices .
It seems that many people actually sign up for these warranties , make down payments for the service , plus pay monthly fees .
U.S. Fidelis sales representatives are notorious for lying about the coverage provided , luring customers with bogus offers , and refusing to provide contracts after the warranties are purchased .
To add salt to the wound , Darain Atkinson , the owner of U.S. Fidelis ( and a convicted theif , burglar , check - forger , and counterfeiter who served time in federal prison nineteen years ago ) is currently building a $ 17 million dollar mansion ( images in video below ) and owns a slew of boats , vacation homes , and luxury cars .

The White House has apologised after a low - level flight by a presidential jet and a fighter plane sparked panic among New York City office workers .
The half - hour flight triggered the evacuation of a number of office buildings in the city .
Pentagon officials said the fly past - a photographic exercise not involving President Obama - had been co-ordinated with city and state authorities .
No general public notification was issued in advance .
" While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey , it 's clear that the mission created confusion and disruption , " Louis Caldera , director of the White House military office , said in a statement .
" I apologise and take responsibility for any distress that flight caused . "
New Yorkers were startled as the planes flew over the city 's harbour
Correspondents say many New York residents are still scarred by the September 2001 attacks when airliners ploughed into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington DC .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he was " furious " about the incident , criticising those responsible for failing to warn the public .
" The good news is it was nothing more than an inconsiderate , badly conceived and insensitive photo op with the taxpayers ' money , " said Mr Bloomberg .
The Boeing 747 jet is one of two planes known as Air Force One when the US president is aboard .
Technology.am ( Apr. 18 , 2009 ) — Google has launched yet another feature in Gmail Labs .
This is the “ Suggest more recipients ” feature , and you ’ll get suggested recipients while composing messages .
So , if you ’ve had a group of people , it will recommend some of those once you ’ve added at least two addresses in the recipients ’ field .
Best part is that they do n’t even have to be in a group of contacts you ’ve created in Gmail ’s contacts manager .
It handles things like family members without a hitch , but where it gets useful is in pulling up people you ’ve recently been corresponding with and giving you a one - click link that adds them to the message .
Short of organizing these people to a group , or doing a reply - all on an old message , this is a really fast way to get another thread started with the same group .

ReporterLocal scientists have created a genetically modified pig whose organs can be used for transplanting into human patients .
The cloned piglet was born by a surrogate mother on April 3 and remains healthy at a lab at the National Institution of Animal Science in Suwon , Gyeonggi Province .
The researchers have predicted the mass production of these hybrid pigs capable of producing humanized organs and organ parts , including pancreatic islets of Langerhans , heart valves and entire hearts .
But they have yet to prove the organs can be transplanted into human patients without risk to life .
The piglet is part of the ``mini - pig '' species that grow up to just around 80 kilograms .
The study was part of a comprehensive project financed by the Ministry of Education , Science and Technology to develop new technologies for drug development and genetically modified organs for use in human transplants .
The piglet was born after trial and error tests for the past six years with a budget of $ 3.38 million .
Scientists worldwide have gone all - out to create organ farms in animals , which they believe could help solve one of medicine 's fastest growing problems ― the shortage of organs for transplant surgeries .
However , creating animal organs that are compatible with the human immune system has proved to be a difficult challenge .
Although drugs can stop the body from rejecting a human transplant , the immune system wo n't accept animal organs for an extended period of time .
This is because that the antibodies in human blood are directed to attack alpha 1 , 3 - galactose , or ``alpha gal , '' which is found in the tissues of all non-primate mammals .
The transplanted animal organs often fail to survive for less than a few hours .
The Korean researchers were to produce a ``GAL - knockout '' pig , which is genetically removed of alpha gal that triggers the immune rejections .
They first removed one of the two genes ( a1 , 3 - Galactosyltransferase ) from a somatic cell of a mini-pig and then inserted the cell to an egg removed of its nucleus to create a clone .
The produced piglet could eventually be used to breed genetically modified pigs born without alpha gal , which may have a better chance of producing compatible human organs , the scientists said .
Lee Kyung - kwang , the leader of the team , died on March 1 .
Other members include Seoul National University 's Jeong Jun-ho , Dankook University 's Shim Ho-sup , Konkuk University 's Kim Jin-hoi , Animal Science Institute 's Park Su-bong and Chonnam National University 's Kang Man-jong .
A number of breakthroughs have been reported on the research for GAL - knockout pigs .
In 2005 , a Harvard University team transplanted the heart of a one to a baboon , and the animal lived on for another six months .
It could be argued that the track record for xeno - transplantation ― using animal organs to replace human ones ― has been disastrous .
In 1984 , a newborn baby , called by the media as ``Baby Fae , '' received a baboon heart in California , but managed to live for just 20 days .
In 1999 , Jeff Getty , an American AIDS patient , received bone marrow from a baboon .
Doctors had hopes that the immune cells in the baboon 's marrow would replace those Getty had lost to AIDS , as baboon cells are naturally resistant to HIV .
However , the cells functioned for only a brief time and Getty died 11 years later from heart failure .
In 1999 , a 35 - year - old American HIV patient received a baboon liver , but died just two months after the transplantation after contracting a virus that is known to only affect the animal .
MOSCOW , April 22 ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s statistics office will make monthly jobless reports secret , a newspaper reported on Wednesday days after data showed unemployment was soaring fast and experts said it was the biggest threat to social stability .
On Monday , Rosstat reported that some 1.8 million Russians lost their jobs in the first three months of 2009 , taking the jobless rate to an 8 year - high .
[ ID :nLK123156 ]
But it was the first time it did not reveal monthly figures and Kommersant business daily quoted unnamed sources as saying reports would now be made public only on a quarterly basis .
Rosstat declined to comment .
According to Reuters calculations , unemployment hit 11.9 percent in March from 8.5 percent in February , assuming previous data was unrevised .
Some 500,000 Russians lost jobs in January , some 300,000 in February and the latest data suggested a record 700,000 became unemployed in March .
Officials had been saying that the worst of the crisis may be over for Russia , taking heart from higher global oil prices , a stabilisation of the rouble and a recovery in domestic stocks .
But international financial organisations , such as the World Bank , have said the economic slump could be much deeper than the government ’s predictions and urged Russia to boost spending to stave off social unrest .
“ The shift ( in jobless data reporting ) could imply a huge leap in March that Rosstat is seeking to smooth over with this new reporting method , ” said Rory MacFarquhar from Goldman Sachs .
“ A more sympathetic - and optimistic - explanation would be that the statistical authorities have simply decided to stop interpolating monthly figures from less frequent household employment surveys to avoid distortions that have arisen during the current turmoil on the labour market , ” he added .
The government expects an economic contraction of just 2.2 percent in 2009 , but international organisations and think tanks have said the slowdown could be at least twice as sharp .
Steering Russia through the financial crisis after years of oil - fuelled economic boom poses a key challenge for President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
At 7.1 million [ ID : nMOS005419 ] , the number of unemployed is already over a million higher than the Economy Ministry forecasts for 2009 as a whole [ ID : nLI604919 ] as companies slash jobs in the face of falling global and domestic demand and the inability to attract fresh financing .
Rosstat uses international methods to calculate jobless rates and its figures come in sharp contrast with official jobless rates of the state employment office , which says there are only 2 million jobless in Russia .

Who does n’t love a good legend ?
They are obviously extremely popular owing to the millions of spam emails that fly around the internet every day filled with the latest urban legend waiting for snopes to debunk it .
This list looks at some more historical legends which , believe it or not , some people still believe to this day .
It seems that no amount of snopesing can debunk them ; perhaps listverse will fare better .
10 Incubus and Sucubus
An incubus is a demon in male form supposed to lie upon sleepers , especially women , in order to have sexual intercourse with them , according to a number of mythological and legendary traditions .
Its female counterpart is the succubus .
An incubus may pursue sexual relations with a woman in order to father a child , as in the legend of Merlin , and some sources indicate that it may be identified by its unnaturally cold penis .
Religious tradition holds that repeated intercourse with an incubus or succubus may result in the deterioration of health , or even death .
A number of secular explanations have been offered for the origin of the incubus legends .
They involve the medieval preoccupation with sin , especially sexual sins of women .
Victims may have been experiencing waking dreams or sleep paralysis .
9 The Lost Tribes
The Ten Lost Tribes of Israel refers to the ancient Tribes of Israel that disappeared from the Biblical account after the Kingdom of Israel was destroyed , enslaved and exiled by ancient Assyria .
Many groups of Jews have doctrines concerning the continued hidden existence or future public return of these tribes .
This is a subject that is partially based upon authenticated and documented historical fact , partially upon written religious tradition and partially upon speculation .
There is a vast amount of literature on the Lost Tribes and no specific source can be relied upon for a complete answer .
Some scientists have researched the topic , and at various times some have made claims of empirical evidence of the Ten Lost Tribes .
However , religious and scriptural sources remain the main sources of the belief that the Ten Lost Tribes have some continuing , though hidden , identity somewhere .
It should be noted that the Book of Mormon suggests that the Native Americans are from two of the lost tribes .
8 Fountain of Youth
The Fountain of Youth is a legendary spring that reputedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks of its waters .
Florida ( ironically ) is often said to be its location , and stories of the fountain are some of the most persistent associated with the state .
Eternal youth is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend , and stories of things such as the philosopher ’s stone , universal panaceas , and the elixir of life are common throughout Eurasia and elsewhere .
Unfortunately , earlier native versions of the legend ( from before the Old World became old ) are not known outside of what snippets Spanish chroniclers managed to preserve of what is sure to have been a rich tradition .
7 The Wandering Jew
The Wandering Jew is a figure from medieval Christian folklore whose legend began to spread in Europe in the thirteenth century and became a fixture of Christian mythology , and , later , of Romanticism .
The legend concerns a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion and was then cursed to walk the earth until the Second Coming .
The exact nature of the wanderer ’s indiscretion varies in different versions of the tale , as do aspects of his character ; sometimes he is said to be a shoemaker or other tradesman , sometimes he is the doorman at Pontius Pilate ’s estate .
The origins of the legend are debatable ; perhaps one element is the story in Genesis of Cain , who is issued with a similar punishment — to wander over the earth , never reaping a harvest again , but scavenging .
6 Pope Joan
Pope Joan ( also called La Papessa ) is the name of a legendary female pope who supposedly reigned for less than three years in the 850s , between the papacies of Leo IV and Benedict III ( though there were only two months between the two reigns ) .
She is known primarily from a legend that circulated in the Middle Ages .
Pope Joan is regarded by most modern historians and religious scholars as fictitious , possibly originating as an anti-papal satire .
The story of Pope Joan is known mainly from the 13th century chronicler Martin of Opava – writing 500 years after the alleged Popess .
Most scholars dismiss Pope Joan as a medieval legend .
The Oxford Dictionary of Popes acknowledges that this legend was widely believed for centuries , even among Catholic circles , but declares that there is “ no contemporary evidence for a female pope at any of the dates suggested for her reign , ” and goes on to say that “ the known facts of the respective periods make it impossible to fit [ a female pope ] in ” .
For those who are wondering what would happen if this were true ( or were to ever be true ) : nothing ; a female is not able to be a priest and a Pope can not be crowned unless he is a priest first .
5 Robin Hood
Robin Hood is an archetypal figure in English folklore , whose story originates from medieval times , but who remains significant in popular culture where he is known for “ stealing from the rich and giving to the poor ” and fighting against injustice and tyranny .
His band includes a “ three score ” group of fellow outlawed yeomen – called his “ Merry Men . ”
The origin of the legend is claimed by some to have stemmed from actual outlaws , or from tales of outlaws , such as Hereward the Wake , Eustace the Monk , Fulk FitzWarin , and William Wallace .
There are a number of theories that attempt to identify a historical Robin Hood , but for various reasons ( such as the popularity of the name in the Middle Ages ) , it is unlikely to ever come up with any evidence that suggests he is not just a legend .
4 The Holy Grail
According to Christian mythology , the Holy Grail was the dish , plate , or cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper , said to possess miraculous powers .
The connection of Joseph of Arimathea with the Grail legend dates from Robert de Boron ’s Joseph d’Arimathie ( late 12th century ) in which Joseph receives the Grail from an apparition of Jesus and sends it with his followers to Great Britain .
The development of the Grail legend has been traced in detail by cultural historians :
It is a legend which first came together in the form of written romances , deriving perhaps from some pre-Christian folklore hints , in the later 12th and early 13th centuries .
The early Grail romances centered on Percival and were woven into the more general Arthurian fabric .
Some of the Grail legend is interwoven with legends of the Holy Chalice .
3 King Arthur
King Arthur is a legendary British leader who , according to medieval histories and romances , led the defence of Britain against the Saxon invaders in the early 6th century .
The details of Arthur ’s story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention , and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians .
The historical basis for the King Arthur legend has long been debated by scholars .
One school of thought , citing entries in the Historia Brittonum ( History of the Britons ) and Annales Cambriae ( Welsh Annals ) , sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure , a Romano - British leader who fought against the invading Anglo - Saxons sometime in the late 5th to early 6th century , but the lack of convincing early evidence is the reason many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of post - Roman Britain .
2 The Children ’s Crusade
The Children ’s Crusade is the name given to a variety of fictional and factual events which happened in 1212 that combine some or all of these elements : visions by a French or German boy ; an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to Christianity ; bands of children marching to Italy ; and children being sold into slavery .
A study published in 1977 cast doubt on the existence of these events and many historians now believe that they were not ( or not primarily ) children but multiple bands of “ wandering poor ” in Germany and France , some of whom tried to reach the Holy Land and others who never intended to do so .
Early versions of events , of which there are many variations told over the centuries , are largely apocryphal .
Recent research suggests the participants were not children , at least not the very young .
The confusion started because later chroniclers , who were not witness to the events of 1212 and who were writing 30 years or more later , began to translate the original accounts and misunderstood the Latin word pueri , meaning “ boys ” , to mean literally “ children ” .
The original accounts did use the term pueri but it had a slang meaning , similar to how the term “ country bumpkins ” is used as a derogatory term in the rural United States .
1 Prester John
The legends of Prester John , popular in Europe from the 12th through the 17th centuries , told of a Christian patriarch and king said to rule over a Christian nation lost amidst the Muslims and pagans in the Orient .
Written accounts of this kingdom are variegated collections of medieval popular fantasy .
Reportedly a descendant of one of the Three Magi , Prester John was said to be a generous ruler and a virtuous man , presiding over a realm full of riches and strange creatures , in which the Patriarch of the Saint Thomas Christians resided .
His kingdom contained such marvels as the Gates of Alexander and the Fountain of Youth , and even bordered the Earthly Paradise .
Among his treasures was a mirror through which every province could be seen , the fabled original from which derived the “ speculum literature ” of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance , in which the prince ’s realms were surveyed and his duties laid out .
Despite the non-existence of Prester John , the medieval belief in the legend affected several hundred years of European and world history , directly and indirectly , by encouraging Europe ’s explorers , missionaries , scholars and treasure hunters .

Seriously , this is amazing :
The new evidence -- including satellite data showing that the average multiyear wintertime sea ice cover in the Arctic in 2005 and 2006 was nine feet thick , a significant decline from the 1980s -- contradicts data cited in widely circulated reports by Washington Post columnist George F .
Will that sea ice in the Arctic has not significantly declined since 1979 .
That was written by two Washington Post reporters .
And they are n't alone .
I think it 's truly weak that Will 's editors stood by his efforts to misrepresent climate change data .
In the face of such weakness , Will , of course , did n't back down but was emboldened .
It 's great to see reporters not just avoiding on - the - other - handism , but actually challenging someone in their midst .
But I have a deeper question .
Why is Will even fighting this one ?
Why can't the " sensible " right let this go ?
The other day I watched David Frum and my colleague Reihan Salam argue on Bill Maher about climate change .
They were n't backing denialism , but Frum kept arguing that liberals are alarmists , and Al Gore 's overstated the data .
But I kept thinking , why would anyone ever listen to anything David Frum has to say about climate change ?
That 's not fair -- which is really my point .
Will 's denialism tarnishes the conservative brand .
It also makes it hard to take lectures about " liberal alarmism " on climate change seriously .
There 's a basic credibility problem .
Any argument that sees Al Gore and George Will as two sides of the same problem is n't serious .
And taking advice from a guy who worked for George Bush on how to proceed on climate change will always be laughable .
Mr Medvedev vowed to fight under- performing officials in a TV interview
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev has replaced four of the country 's regional governors , a government statement said .
Correspondents say it is a sign of the Kremlin 's concern that the economic slump could lead to social unrest .
A senior aide to President Medvedev , Vladislav Surkov , said the global crisis had accentuated the evaluation of the governors ' performance .
President Medvedev had warned at the weekend that he would not tolerate slackers or slovenliness .
" We are n't going to close eyes on flaws in work and , simply speaking , ineptness , sloppiness and carelessness of some officials , " Mr Medvedev told state television .
Governors will be replaced in Pskov , Orel and Voronezh regions and the Nenets autonomous area .
Among those ousted is 71 - year - old Yegor Stroyev , the oldest of the governors .
The youngest of the replacements is 33 .
Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev has been asked to take up a regional post , a significant demotion after 10 years in the cabinet .
The changes are subject to approval by provincial legislatures , which is expected to happen soon .
Russia 's economy is reeling from the effect of a sharp fall in the price of oil .
The 2009 budget is expected to slip into deficit for the first time in about a decade .

Welcome to the first day of the Adapting in Place class – most of my posts this month will focus on the theme of how to get along where you are , with what you ’ve got .
I love this class , and enjoy doing it .
I would note that some of the registered participants have not yet subscribed to the discussion group – please do so , so you do n’t miss anything !
I thought I ’d start out with the question of who * should not* adapt in place .
The very first activity we do in both classes is to sit down and make a list of what your alternatives are if you have to leave your present place .
The reason we do it is because things like that could happen – people lose jobs and homes , they have fires , they are forced out by climate changes or environmental crises – sometimes you ca n’t stay where you are .
And as much as we ’re going to focus on staying in place , we should also make sure we never lose sight of the fact that we do have other choices , even if we do n’t much like them ,
And for some people , getting out of Dodge is the way to go .
That is , I think that some people should absolutely consider leaving where they are , and doing sooner , rather than later , because they have little or no hope of successfully remaining in place .
Now some of this comes down to long vs. short term issues – and there are balances to be struck .
For example , let ’s say you live in a place that may be underwater in a couple of decades .
You love it , you are in your 50s or 60s , your kids are here .
Do you have to leave ?
No , you do n’t have to , but you might want to think about your choices .
For example , do you want to have to evacuate your location regularly due to coastal storms in your 80s ?
Do you have a support network that will make that possible , that will help you ?
If you plan to move when things get more acute , how likely is it you will be able to sell your house , as areas look increasingly difficult to inhabit .
Do you need to sell it ?
If you have family inland who would take you in , maybe risking that you might have to walk away is ok – or maybe it is n’t .
Our homes are our homes , and our right to stay and choose them sometimes seems inviolable – but it is n’t .
In the next decades there are going to be a lot of migrants – and you may be one of them .
Migrating and settling in a reasonably liveable place might be better – or it might not , and you might want to wait and see .
But do n’t do it in ignorance – find out all you can .
The reality is that many people do more research on what movie to see than we do about our future , and the risks and benefits of the locations we choose .
So here ’s my list of when to think seriously about getting out .
There will be exceptions in every case – my claim is not “ you definitely must go ” but “ think hard about what you are choosing . ”
1 . If you have an ARM and ca n’t reset it , are already facing foreclosure or have no reason to believe you ’ll be able to pay for your house , or if your current house was bought near the market peak and you require two ful incomes to pay for it .
The odds are good you are n’t going to keep your house in those circumstances – and the worst possible scenario for you may well be that you go into debt frantically trying to keep your old way of life open , which closes off other options .
If you have a better choice , one that can provide some stability , or there is hope of selling and getting out from under , seriously consider it .
If you do end up in full foreclosure , remember the magic words – “ Produce the Note . ”
Rerquire that the company do full due diligence and stay in your house as long as you can – you might as well save up rent for the future .
And unless your loan is a recourse loan ( be very careful with state assisted refinances , since many of these turn no -recourse loans into recourse loans – you do not want to be paying for this forever )
But do me a favor , and do n’t trash the place on the way out – someone else , even you may eventually end up renting a foreclosure , so do n’t trash what assets we ’ve got indiscriminately .
2 . If you have young children or are elderly , have close ties somewhere but are living far away from them in a community that you are not invested in .
Not everyone has people ( family biological or chosen ) who will give you a place at the table , thin the soup to make it stretch , let you sleep on their couch and otherwise cover your back .
But if you do , recognize that these people are the beginnings of your tribe .
Not all of us have tribes in one place – and some of us have multiple tribes .
But if you are n’t rooted where you are in some deep way , if you live there primarily for a job , and you can get back to your people think about it seriously .
The people who will most need the support of their family are young families themselves struggling to make do and older people who may need some help .
Sometimes these peopel are related to one another .
Not all family is good , not every friendship can go this far , but if you have these ties , they matter , and they are essential .
3 . If you have children or parents you need to care for far away .
Again , this is ymmv , but if you are going to be dealing with your parents ’ decline , or if you do n’t have custody of your kids but want to spend time on them , you need to set it up in a way that does n’t make anyone rely on airline or other expensive long distance travel .
That means that if they do n’t come to you , you go to them .
It was once perfectly viable to live across the country from your kids , and say , have them spend summers with you – it may no longer be viable .
I realize this will be enormously painful and disruptive to families , but if you are the resource for people very far away over the longer term , you need to find a way to be closer to one another , or accept that you may not be able to take on that role .
4 . If you live in an extreme climate , likely to become more extreme with climate change , but you are not particularly and unusually well adapted to it .
That is , unless we check climate change , which at this point seems unlikely , if highly desirable , at some point , many places are going to be uninhabitable for many of the people who presently live there .
Some may become literally uninhabitable over time , but more likely , what we ’ll see is that small populations , extremely well adapted to their environment , and extremely attuned to it , become native to many places as long as they are even marginally inhabitable .
But the question is , are you one of them ?
That is , if you live in a very hot , dry place , and are an expert desert farmer , gifted at retaining and using every drop of water prudently , and comfortable living without lots of input or air conditioning , and happy to live on the diet that grows there well , great , you and your descendents will probably do very well there if anyone does .
But if you are fond of long showers , keep the a / c on six months a year and think that hamburgers are a right , you might want to think about somewhere else .
Moreover , if you need income from the sale of your house , you might want to think about it sooner , rather than later , because there will probably come a point at which the number of people who want to live there declines dramatically , and it will be even tougher to sell than it is now .
Now even if some places do become uninhabitable , they probably wo n’t do so immediately - you might well be able to live out your life where you are .
But remember that it will probably become gradually and increasingly hard – the summers will be worse , the storms will be stronger , the ice pack will be smaller .
Are you prepared to be that adaptable ?
5 . If you live among people with lousy values .
I ’m on the record saying that most of us can probably get along in most places with at least some people .
I do n’t think everyone in your town has to be like you , or that ecovillages are the only way to find community .
That said , however , there are exceptions .
And even if you can find some small community in a larger culture of rotten values , you may find that it wears you down .
Thus , if your neighborhood is chronically ridden with violence and crime , maybe it is a good idea to fight it – but maybe you ’d be better off somewhere else .
If you bought in a gated community full of self - centered rich assholes , and now you regret it because they are pissed about your garden , sometimes , if you can , living somewhere else might be nicer .
If you belong to a minority community , you might want to live where people like folks like you , or at least tolerate them , rather than a place that is hostile to them .
If you rely on a religious community , you might want to live where you feel that the cultural values reflect your own .
Personally , I ’ve always had a lot of luck finding allies where I went , even if we did n’t share faith or experience .
But there are root values we did have in common – integrity , kindness , a desire for community .
If those things do n’t exist , you might seriously have to consider another choice .
6 . If you do n’t think your children ( and by your children , I mean the children in your family , even if they are n’t your own ) have a future where you are .
Now this is somewhat speculative , and may partly contradict what I said above – you may , for example , simply not be ready to leave a place , even if you do n’t think it will be sustainable in the long term .
But it is worth thinking about the larger consequences of committing to a place that may not have a future .
If your children have to leave to get work , if your children have to leave because it is n’t safe or is underwater , are your prepared to part with them ?
Are you prepared for your family to be parted in circumstances that might not be conducive to cross-country travel ?
More importantly , if you have land or something you hope to pass down to your kids , are you prepared not to be able to do so ?
Is it an asset that they will be able to do without ?
Again , you ca n’t know all this for sure , but it is worth thinking about .
7 . If you plan to move anyway .
That is , if you have a family place or somewhere you have always planned to return to , if you can , now is probably the best time .
It takes time to build soil .
It takes time to get to know people .
It takes time to see fruit trees come to maturity .
If you were planning on going anyway after a few more years of earning , or something , now might be the right time .
That said , however , I ’d be awfully cautious about buying , and only recommend this * if you can * leave – either by selling your current place or if you ’ve been renting .
But building roots is important .
8 . If you are n’t prepared to live in the place you live as its culture demands .
That is , as we get poorer and travel and transit become bigger issues , living in the country is going to be a lot different than it is now – instead of living essentially a suburban life , commuting to activities not available and relying on trucked in supplies , you may have to shop occasionally and mostly stay home in the country , making your own entertainment .
Are you prepared to do that ?
Urban dwellers may have to make do in tougher conditions as infrastructure problems come up .
My own analogy is this – if you ’d be ok living in the worst neighborhood in your city as most of the people there live now , you ’ll probably be fine .
But if you ’ve been affluent and comfortable and might not be forever , be sure you can afford the city and like the life .
I believe strongly that city , suburb ( most of them ) and country all have a future – but the differences between them are likely to become more acute .
If you are n’t prepared to deal with those differences , you might consider moving .
9 . If you live in a outer suburban housing development , particularly a fairly new one .
This is the one exception I make to the question of whether the suburbs are viable .
Generally speaking , I think a lot of suburbs will do fine , others will adapt in different ways – some may become more like small cities , others may be more country like .
But the ones that I think the least hope are the larger developments that were built in the “ drive ’ til you buy ” model of the last few years , where lower income families have to move further and further away from urban or suburban job centers .
If your suburb was built on a cornfield forty miles from your job , think seriously about how you will get along either in an energy constrained world or one where energy is much more costly because of carbon limitations .
Do you really think anyone is going to run public transport out there ?
Is there topsoil ?
Is it a place worth maintaining and farming ?
Are there neighbors ?
Are there going to be ?
If you are already in a half - finished development , you really might want to get out .
10 .
If you are native to another place .
By native , I mean that many of us have a strong sense of place , and a strong sense of belonging to a place .
My husband once went on a job interview at UIL Champagne - Urbana .
He recalls looking across the land and seeing the horizon and thinking “ oh , there ’s the ocean . ”
But of course , there was no ocean there - his misperception lasted only a second , but revealed something about his ability to live in that place – he comes from people who live on hilly land around water , and know the flat horizon as the space of the sea .
It is possible that he could have adapted to the flat open land of the midwest and learned to love it – but it is also possible that one ’s sense of place should be respected if possible .
I know people who have never fully adapted to their place , in the sense of being truly native to it – desert born people who could never breathe comfortably in the humid air of the southeast , warm climate people who found the cold of northern winters unbearable , city folk who find the country abnormally empty and silent , water folk who ca n’t imagine life away from a boat .
Not everyone is tied to a place – some people can live anywhere , others in a wide range of places .
Some people can take their sense of place to wherever they go , and find a new home .
But some people can’t .
And it is simply the case that your body , and parts of your soul are shaped by your experience – a college friend of mine once spoke of people who grew up by the sea has sharing “ water thinking ” and noted that she who lived in Hawaii and I who lived in Coastal Massachusetts had that in common in our way of viewing the world .
More mundanely , people who grow up in hot climates develop more sweat glands , and a better ability to cool themselves than people who grow up in cold ones – our physiology is shaped by our place .
And our native knowledge of our place is valuable – in fact , it may be the most powerful tool we have .
Now some of us will have to leave our native places , to journey again as people so often have .
But if we can stay where we are , knowing our flora and fauna , knowing what grows where and how things smell when the seasons change and how to heal or feed or tend with what is native here is absolutely valuable – as is the ability to adapt that knowledge as our places change .
So if there is a place where you feel at home , and no other constraints bind you , perhaps you will want to go there , and be there , and help other people be there .
Again , all of these examples will have exceptions .
No one , especially me is saying “ move now ! ”
And some people who probably should leave will not be able to for reasons of family and obligation , underwater housing and job commitments .
But do think about all your choices .
Sharon
( This is part of the Feedback on ‘ WaSP Community CSS3 Feedback 2008 ’ series . )
Not surprisingly , there was a lot of community feedback asking for better layout mechanisms .
Actually , people were asking for any decent layout mechanism at all , which CSS has historically lacked .
Floats mostly work , but they ’re a hack and can be annoyingly fragile even when you ignore old - browser bugs .
Positioning works in limited cases , but does not handle web - oriented layout at all well .
Why do we use floats for layout , anyway ?
clear .
That ’s pretty much the whole answer .
The unique in - flow / out - of - flow nature of floats means they interact with each other and with the normal flow , which means they can be cleared , which makes them useful .
Because with clear , we can float layout blocks around and then push other non-floated blocks , like footers , below the floats .
Positioning , of course , permits total layout freedom in the sense that you can put a layout block anywhere with respect to its containing block .
The downfall is that absolutely positioned elements are entirely out of the normal flow , so they ca n’t stay out of each others ’ way like floats do , and you ca n’t clear anything with respect to a positioned element .
If there had been a position - clear or its equivalent from the outset , we ’d never have bothered with floats .
( And if we can just add position - clear to CSS , that would be completely awesome .
It ’s been done with JavaScript and it will most likely be done again and better .
It would n’t even be that hard to implement , at least for 99.5 % of cases . )
All this is why the old “ only use tables for layout ” argument keeps coming up over and over : strip away the overheated rhetoric and obvious link - baiting , and you find the core of a real need .
Because as powerful as CSS can be , table cells do certain things very easily that CSS makes very , very hard .
Cells stretch vertically , keeping equal heights as a matter of their intrinsic nature .
They stay out of each others ’ way , while still being allowed to sit next to each other and use any sizing dimensions .
They tie their layout to their parent elements , and vice versa .
There are no equivalents in CSS .
There have been various very clever attempts to replicate bits and pieces of those capabilities using CSS .
What CSS does , it does very well : if you do n’t need equal - height layout blocks , then no problem .
If you do , it ’s a massive pain .
Clever techniques provide substitutes , but ca n’t replace what tables already do .
And please , let ’s put the whole “ display : table - cell will grant those abilities through CSS ” to rest .
Saying that is just saying “ use tables for layout ” with different words .
Turning a bunch of div s or list items or whatever into table - role boxes is no better than just using table markup in the first place , and it ’s arguably worse .
Using element names other than table and td to create layout tables , and then claiming it ’s not using tables for layout , borders on self - deception .
Not to mention doing things that way means you ’re doing your layout in a highly source - order - dependent fashion , which was one of the things about table layout we were trying to get away from in the first place .
So how do we get really powerful source - order - independent layout ?
I wish I knew .
The Advanced Layout module has been sitting around for a while now , and even if you ’re a fan of defining layout as ASCII art — which I find repels and appeals in equal measure , but that ’s probably just me — there appears to be close to zero implementor interest .
So how do we get those abilities in a form that implementors will , y’know , implement ?
I do n’t know .
I do n’t care .
We just need it , and have needed it for a good decade or so .
Without it , CSS is a styling language but not a layout language .
We ’ve bent it into being something close to a layout language , which is nice but not really ideal .
Maybe CSS is n’t the place for this .
Maybe there needs to be a new layout language that can be defined and implemented without regard to the constraints of the existing CSS syntax rules , without worrying about backwards compatibility .
Maybe that way we can not only get strong layout but also arbitrary shapes , thus leaving behind the rectangular prison that ’s defined the web for almost two decades .
I do n’t have a concrete idea to propose here , because it ’s not up to us any more .
A solution was worked out over the course of several years and then found wanting by the implementors .
Really , it ’s up to the implementors to figure it out now .
I personally would like to just lock the browser teams from Microsoft , Mozilla , Opera , and Apple in a room and not let them out until they ’ve defined something that works and they ’ve all agreed to implement soonest .
I might even supply food and water .
And yes , I just advocated doing this outside the W3C process .
Why would n’t I ?
The process has , in the last decade , not produced anything even remotely resembling an answer to this problem .
Time to try another path and see if it gets any closer to the goal .
No doubt someone ’s going to spin this as “ See , even noted standards zealot Eric Meyer now says CSS is flawed ! ” — only they ’ll be wrong because this is n’t a now thing .
I ’ve been saying this for years in interviews , in person , and in general .
Any time someone asks me what CSS is missing or should do better , the answer has always been a variant on “ a strong layout system ” .
I ’ve been saying it for at least a decade .
So I ’m not saying it now .
I ’m saying it again .
And again and again and again and …
If I sound frustrated , it ’s because I am , and have been for a good long while .
I ’m not the only one .
It rankles to have CSS be , as Winston Churchill would have put it , the worst form of layout except for all the others that have been tried .
GAZA CITY ( CNN ) -- Israel launched airstrikes into Gaza on Saturday , responding to a series of rockets fired by Hamas the day before , the Israeli military said .
Hamas security forces also reported Saturday 's strikes .
There were no immediate reports of casualties .
The Israeli air force struck two " smuggling tunnels " on the southern Gaza border and one " weaponry storage site " in Gaza City , a military spokesman told CNN .
" In all strikes , a hit was identified , " the spokesman said , adding that the strikes were in response to six rockets targeting Israeli since Saturday morning .
According to the Israeli military , more than 100 rockets , mortar shells and missiles have been fired at Israel by Palestinian militants in Gaza since Hamas leaders announced a cease - fire on January 18 .
Israel also announced a cease - fire and pulled its troops out of Gaza in January , ending a three - week military campaign that the Israeli military said was aimed at halting the rocket fire .
Egypt has been trying to broker a broader cease - fire agreement between Hamas and Israel .
Israel is demanding that Hamas release kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit before it fully reopens the border crossings with Gaza .
Hamas has rejected discussing Shalit 's release as part of any cease - fire negotiation .

MONTGOMERY --
The Alabama House has approved a resolution that praises
Miss USA
contestant Carrie Prejean for speaking out against gay marriage .
The House approved the resolution Thursday by Republican Rep. Jay Love of Montgomery on a voice vote .
Prejean was competing as Miss California and finished second after answering a question from judge Perez Hilton concerning gay marriage during Sunday night 's televised pageant .
She said she felt marriage should be between a man and a woman .
Love said Prejean stuck to her convictions even if it meant losing the pageant .
Love said he has received a number of e-mails and phone calls from across the country since introducing the resolution .
He said more than half of those disagreed with the resolution .

The following excerpt was taken from an outline of a Government Project : The Wildlands Project . ... Humanity must drastically scale down its industrial activities on Earth , change its consumption lifestyles , stabilize and then reduce the size of the human population by humane means , and protect and restore wild ecosystems and the remaining wildlife on the planet . "
The Wildlands Project The Tartars had the idea of infecting the enemy by catapulting bodies infected with bubonic plague over the walls of the city of Kaffa .
Some historians believe that this event was the cause of the epidemic of plague that swept across medieval Europe killing 25 million .
1763 The British during the French - Indian War .
The Native Americans greatly outnumbered the British and were suspected of being on the side of the French .
As an " act of good will " the British give blankets to the Indians , but the blankets came from a hospital that was treating smallpox victims and consequently smallpox raged through the Native American community and devastated their numbers .
1814 Andrew Jackson , whose portrait appears on the U.S. $ 20 bill today , supervised the mutilation of 800 or more Creek Indian corpses , the bodies of men , women and children that his troops had massacred , cutting off their noses to count and preserve a record of the dead , slicing long strips of flesh from their bodies to tan and turn into bridle reins .

1911 Turkey established gun control .
From 1915 - 1917 , 1.5 million Armenians , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
1918 The modern history of Biological Warfare ( BW ) starts in 1918 with the Japanese formation of a special section of the Army ( Unit 731 ) dedicated to BW .
The thought at the time was " Science and Technology are the Key 's to Winning War and BW is the most cost effective . "
1918 - 1919
Flu pandemic that killed over 20 million worldwide and over 500,000 here in the US .
1920 's
Unlike the malignant twists of nature , ranging from bubonic plague through to potato blight , which have killed masses throughout the ages , both the beef and pituitary hormone CJD crises were manmade .
Scrapie , the sheep equivalent of BSE and CJD , has been around for more than two centuries .
Somewhat differently , human spongiform encephalopathy was unheard of before two German physicians , Creutzfeldt and Jakob , independently reported the initial cases in the 1920s .
BSE , too , was unheard of until a decade after cattle ( aka Mad Cow ) began to be fed the protein - rich remains of scrapie - infected sheep to accelerate their growth .
1929 The Soviet Union established gun control .
From 1929 to 1953 , approximately 20 million dissidents , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
1930 's Less known to the public is that fluoride also accumulates in bones .
" The teeth are windows to what 's happening in the bones , " explained Paul Connett , Professor of Chemistry at St Lawrence University , New York , to these reporters .
In recent years , pediatric bone specialists have expressed alarm about an increase in stress fractures among young people in the US .
Connett and other scientists are concerned that fluoride - linked to bone damage in studies since the 1930s - may be a contributing factor .
1931 Japan expanded its territory by taking over part of Manchuria and Unit 731 moved in to secure " an endless supply of human experiment materials . "
Essentially all prisoners of war were available for Biological Warfare ( BW ) experiments .
Japanese WWII Veteran Admits Unit 731 Germ Tests
1931 Dr. Cornelius Rhoads , under the auspices of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Investigations , infects human subjects with cancer cells .
He later goes on to establish the U.S. Army Biological Warfare facilities in Maryland , Utah , and Panama , and is named to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission .
While there , he begins a series of radiation exposure experiments on American soldiers and civilian hospital patients .
1932 The Infamous Tuskegee Study
In recent history , we have seen the influence of occult population control advocates here in America .
Nowhere is that influence better demonstrated than in the Tuskegee Study , a scientific research program in which 400 syphilis - infected black men were recruited by the U.S. Public Health Service back in 1932 .
The participants were all told that they would be treated for their infections , but instead of treating their illness , all medicines were withheld .
The black men were then actively prevented from obtaining treatment elsewhere as their bodies , and the bodies of their wives and children , were systematically ravaged by disease .
The evil men who conceived that Nazi - style study justified their atrocity by alleging that scientists needed to learn how untreated syphilis progressed in the human body .
For a period of forty years , between 1932 and 1972 , the genocidal Tuskegee Study continued .
It was not until 1972 , when one newspaper finally had the courage to break the story to the public , that the Tuskegee Study was finally terminated .
The Population Control Agenda
1934
The original lesson about the infectious nature of these brain diseases ( " mad cow disease " or bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) in cattle , and Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) in humans ) came from a 1934 vaccine catastrophe in the UK which brought scrapie , or " mad sheep disease " , to almost 5,000 out of 18,000 lambs within two years of their immunization against louping - ill virus infection .
Tracing back , scientists discovered that the vaccine serum was prepared from a number of lambs whose dams had subsequently developed scrapie , but the significance of scrapie passing vertically from ewes to their lambs , and horizontally from lamb to lamb by virtue of the vaccine injections , was kept from international eyes by a series of egotistical carry - ons which prevented the data from reaching the pages of the scientific literature for a further 15 years .
1935 The Pellagra Incident .
After millions of individuals die from Pellagra over a span of two decades , the U.S. Public Health Service finally acts to stem the disease .
The director of the agency admits it had known for at least 20 years that Pellagra is caused by a niacin deficiency but failed to act since most of the deaths occurred within poverty - stricken black populations .
1935 China established gun control .
From 1948 to 1952 , 20 million political dissidents , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
1938 Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945 , 6 to 7 million Jews , gypsies , homosexuals , the mentally ill , and 12 million Christians who were unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
1939 Margaret Sanger organized her " Negro project , " a program designed to eliminate members of what she believed to be an " inferior race . "
Margaret Sanger justified her proposal because she believed that : " The masses of Negroes ... particularly in the South , still breed carelessly and disastrously , with the result that the increase among Negroes , even more than among whites , is from that portion of the population least intelligent and fit ... "
1940 Four hundred prisoners in Chicago are infected with Malaria in order to study the effects of new and experimental drugs to combat the disease .
Nazi doctors later on trial at Nuremberg cite this American study to defend their own actions during the Holocaust .
1941 Japanese planes sprayed bubonic plague over parts of China .
At least 5 separate instances of this occurring have been documented .
In 1942 " bacterial bombs " were deployed on mainland China but these attacks were determined to be ineffective .
1942 The United States ( US ) becomes aware of the Japanese efforts in Biological Warfare ( BW ) and decided to start its own program .
These acts were not the only atrocities committed , however .
The Japanese released thousands of plague infested rats prior to their surrender , with unknown consequences .
They also tested on American POW 's during the war and the U.S. Government apparently knew about it , but did nothing ( perhaps a worse atrocity ) .
These people killed over 3000 POWs , including many Americans , in a variety of grisly experiments .
What they did instead was to offer immunity to would - be war criminals in exchange for the information the Japanese learned from these experiments !
1942 Chemical Warfare Services begins mustard gas experiments on approximately 4,000 servicemen .
The experiments continue until 1945 and made use of Seventh Day Adventists who chose to become human guinea pigs rather than serve on active duty .
1942 Great Britain was also developing a program in Biological Warfare ( BW ) .
The program focused on anthrax spores and their viability and " range of spread " when delivered with a conventional bomb .
The fateful Gruinard Island off the coast of Scotland was chosen as the site for this testing .
It was thought that it was far enough off the coast as too prevent any contamination of the mainland , which later turned out to be false .
The data gathered from these experiments was used by both Great Britain and the U.S. to develop bombs that were better able to effectively disperse spores .
1943 After an outbreak of anthrax in sheep and cattle in 1943 on the coast of Scotland that directly faced Gruinard , the British decided to stop testing .
A tragic consequence of this testing is that even today Gruinard Island is contaminated with Bacillus anthracis spores .
The original idea for decontamination was to start a brushfire that burned off the top of the soil and killed all traces of the organisms .
Unfortunately , the spores unexpectedly embedded themselves in the soil so total decontamination of the island was / is impossible .
As long as no ground is disturbed , we are supposedly safe , but birds that travel back and forth from mainland to island probably do n't know this !
1943 Planning began in 1943 with the appointment of a special New York State Health Department committee to study the advisability of adding fluoride to Newburgh 's drinking water .
The chairman of the committee was , again , Dr Harold C. Hodge , then chief of fluoride toxicity studies for the Manhattan Project .
Subsequent members of the committee included Henry L. Barnett , a captain in the Project 's Medical Section , and John W. Fertig , in 1944 with the Office of Scientific Research and Development - the super - secret Pentagon group which sired the Manhattan Project .
Their military affiliations were kept secret .
Hodge was described as a pharmacologist , Barnett as a pediatrician .
Placed in charge of the Newburgh project was David B. Ast , chief dental officer of the New York State Health Department .
Ast had participated in a key secret wartime conference on fluoride , held by the Manhattan Project in January 1944 , and later worked with Dr Hodge on the Project 's investigation of human injury in the New Jersey incident , according to once - secret memos .
1944 A Manhattan Project memorandum of 29 April 1944 states : " Clinical evidence suggests that uranium hexafluoride may have a rather marked central nervous system effect ...
It seems most likely that the F [ code for fluoride ] component rather than the T [ code for uranium ] is the causative factor . "
The memo , from a captain in the medical corps , is stamped SECRET and is addressed to Colonel Stafford Warren , head of the Manhattan Project 's Medical Section .
Colonel Warren is asked to approve a program of animal research on CNS effects .
" Since work with these compounds is essential , it will be necessary to know in advance what mental effects may occur after exposure ...
This is important not only to protect a given individual , but also to prevent a confused workman from injuring others by improperly performing his duties .
The author of the 1944 CNS research proposal attached to the 29 April memo was Dr Harold C. Hodge - at the time , chief of fluoride toxicology studies for the University of Rochester division of the Manhattan Project .
1944 When a severe pollution incident occurred downwind of the E.I. DuPont de Nemours Company chemical factory in Deepwater , New Jersey .
The factory was then producing millions of pounds of fluoride for the Manhattan Project whose scientists were racing to produce the world 's first atomic bomb .
The farms downwind in Gloucester and Salem counties were famous for their high - quality produce .
Their peaches went directly to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City ; their tomatoes were bought up by Campbell 's Soup .
But in the summer of 1944 the farmers began reporting that their crops were blighted : " Something is burning up the peach crops around here . "
They said that poultry died after an all - night thunderstorm , and that farm workers who ate produce they 'd picked would sometimes vomit all night and into the next day .
" I remember our horses looked sick and were too stiff to work , " Mildred Giordano , a teenager at the time , told these reporters .
Some cows were so crippled that they could not stand up ; they could only graze by crawling on their bellies .
The account was confirmed in taped interviews with Philip Sadtler ( shortly before he died ) , of Sadtler Laboratories of Philadelphia , one of the nation 's oldest chemical consulting firms .
Sadtler had personally conducted the initial investigation of the damage .
The farmers were stonewalled in their search for information about fluoride 's effects on their health , and their complaints have long since been forgotten .
But they unknowingly left their imprint on history : their complaints of injury to their health reverberated through the corridors of power in Washington and triggered intensive , secret , bomb program research on the health effects of fluoride .
1944 U.S. Navy uses human subjects to test gas masks and clothing .
Individuals were locked in a gas chamber and exposed to mustard gas and lewisite .
1945 May Newburgh 's water was fluoridated , and over the next 10 years its residents were studied by the New York State Health Department .
1945 -1955
Much of the original proof that fluoride is safe for humans in low doses was generated by A - bomb program scientists who had been secretly ordered to provide " evidence useful in litigation " against defense contractors for fluoride injury to citizens .
The first lawsuits against the American A - bomb program were not over radiation , but over fluoride damage , the documents show .
Human studies were required .
Bomb program researchers played a leading role in the design and implementation of the most extensive US study of the health effects of fluoridating public drinking water , conducted in Newburgh , New York , from 1945 to 1955 .
Then , in a classified operation code - named " Program F " , they secretly gathered and analyzed blood and tissue samples from Newburgh citizens with the cooperation of New York State Health Department personnel .
The original , secret version ( obtained by these reporters ) of a study published by Program F scientists in the August 1948 Journal of the American Dental Association shows that evidence of adverse health effects from fluoride was censored by the US Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) - considered the most powerful of Cold War agencies - for reasons of " national security " .
The bomb program 's fluoride safety studies were conducted at the University of Rochester - site of one of the most notorious human radiation experiments of the Cold War , in which unsuspecting hospital patients were injected with toxic doses of radioactive plutonium .
The fluoride studies were conducted with the same ethical mindset , in which " national security " was paramount .
Hitler claimed to have gotten his inspiration for the " final solution " from the extermination of Native Americans in the U.S .
1947 By then , as the 1950s dawned , mad sheep disease was shown in the United States to jump the species barrier when a scrapie - infected food supplement brought a similar brain illness to farm - raised mink in 1947 .
By this stage , the medico - scientific fraternity was intensely preoccupied with another incurable brain illness , kuru , which had reached epidemic proportions amongst the Fore people living in the highlands of New Guinea .
Anthropologists from the University of Adelaide unraveled a chain of events to trace the origin of kuru back to the reverent consumption of deceased tribal members ' bodies .
Kuru was essentially eradicated by New Guinean authorities acting in 1959 on the anthropological clue to outlaw the eating of human flesh .
1947 The CIA begins its study of LSD as a potential weapon for use by American intelligence .
Human subjects ( both civilian and military ) are used with and without their knowledge .
1949 U.S. Army begins 20 years of simulated germ warfare attacks against American cities , conducting at least 239 open air tests .

1950 Sept. 20 - 26
One of the biggest experiments involved the use of Serratia marcescens and bacillus globigi being sprayed over 117 square miles of the San Francisco area , causing pneumonia - like infections in many of the residents .
The family of one elderly man who died in the test sued the government , but lost .
To this day , syraceus is a leading cause of death among the elderly in the San Francisco area .
1950 Department of Defense begins plans to detonate nuclear weapons in desert areas and monitor downwind residents for medical problems and mortality rates
1953 U.S. military releases clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide gas over Winnipeg , St. Louis , Minneapolis , Fort Wayne , the Monocacy River Valley in Maryland , and Leesburg , Virginia .
Their intent is to determine how efficiently they could disperse chemical agents .
1953 CIA initiates Project MKULTRA .
This is an eleven year research program designed to produce and test drugs and biological agents that would be used for mind control and behavior modification .
Six of the subprojects involved testing the agents on unwitting human beings .
1955 Another case was the joint Army - CIA BW test in 1955 , still classified , in which an undisclosed bacteria was released in the Tampa Bay region of Florida , causing a dramatic increase in whooping cough infections , including twelve deaths .
1956 The Soviet Union accused the U.S. of using biological weapons in Korea , which lead them to threaten future use of Chemical and Biological weapons .
This changed the focus of the U.S. program to a more defensive one .
Before this , the bulk of the research was based at Ft. Detrick and used " surrogate biological agents " to model more deadly organisms .
Most of the offensive tests were based on " secret spraying " of organisms over populated areas .
This program was ( supposedly ) shut down in 1969 .
1956 Cambodia established gun control .
From 1975 to 1977 , one million " educated " people , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
1956 U.S. military releases mosquitoes infected with Yellow Fever over Savannah , Ga and Avon Park , Fl. Following each test , Army agents posing as public health officials test victims for effects .
1958 LSD is tested on 95 volunteers at the Army 's Chemical Warfare Laboratories for its effect on intelligence .
1960 The Army Assistant Chief - of - Staff for Intelligence ( ACSI ) authorizes field testing of LSD in Europe and the Far East .
Testing of the European population is code named Project THIRD CHANCE ; testing of the Asian population is code named Project DERBY HAT .
1963
The mass vaccination campaigns of the 1950s and '60s may be causing hundreds of deaths a year because of a cancer - causing virus that contaminated the first polio vaccine , according to scientists .
Known as SV40 , the virus came from dead monkeys whose kidney cells were used to culture the first Salk vaccines .
Doctors estimate that the virus was injected into tens of millions during the vaccination campaigns , including several million in Canada , before being detected and screened out in 1963 .
Those born between 1941 and 1961 are thought to be most at risk of having been infected .
1964 Guatemala established gun control .
From 1964 to 1981 , 100,000 Mayan Indians , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
1965 Aspartame is the technical name for the brand names , NutraSweet , Equal , Spoonful , and Equal - Measure .
Aspartame was discovered by accident in 1965 , when James Schlatter , a chemist of G.D. Searle Company was testing an anti-ulcer drug .
Aspartame was approved for dry goods in 1981 and for carbonated beverages in 1983 .
1965 CIA and Department of Defense begin Project MKSEARCH , a program to develop a capability to manipulate human behavior through the use of mind - altering drugs .
1965 Prisoners at the Holmesburg State Prison in Philadelphia are subjected to dioxin , the highly toxic chemical component of Agent Orange used in Viet Nam .
The men are later studied for development of cancer , which indicates that Agent Orange had been a suspected carcinogen all along .
1966 CIA initiates Project MKOFTEN , a program to test the toxicological effects of certain drugs on humans and animals .
1966 July 7 - 10
The virus Bacillus subtilis was released throughout the New York subway system , conducted by the U.S. Army 's Special Operations Division .
Due to the vast number of people exposed it would virtually impossible to identify , let alone prove , and specific health problems resulting directly from this test .
1967 CIA and Department of Defense implement Project MKNAOMI , successor to MKULTRA and designed to maintain , stockpile and test biological and chemical weapons .
1968 CIA experiments with the possibility of poisoning drinking water by injecting chemicals into the water supply of the FDA in Washington , D.C .
Often / Chickwit - 1967 or 1968 Project OFTEN / CHICKWIT was initiated by the Army Chemical Corps and the CIA 's Office of Research and Development to create new drug compounds " that could be used offensively . "
Hallucinogens were tested on inmates in Pennsylvania , but very little is known about the experiments .
" CIA documents mention ' several laboratory accidents ' in which a drug designated as EA - 3167 produced ' prolonged psychotic effects in laboratory personnel ' " U.S. Army dispenses Bacillus subtilis variant niger throughout the New York City subway system .
More than a million civilians are exposed when army scientists drop light bulbs filled with the bacteria onto ventilation grates .
It would appear that the CIA 's drug testing continued throughout the 1970s since , " A CIA memo dated March 8 , 1971 , indicates that a backlog of more than twenty - six thousand drugs had been acquired ' for future screening ' "
1968 - 69 The Hong Kong flu , which was influenza A type H3N2 , killed over 30,000 people in the U.S. alone .
That was a fortuitous learning event for some because it taught them that the flu could still conceivably be used to wipe out a population .
But at the same time , it pointed out the need to precondition the populace so that those who might normally be resistant could be rendered susceptible .
Hence the development of the vaccine program and the aerial spraying procedures to condition the population .
The purpose of the chemicals in the chemtrail 's is to help the viral envelope fuse with lung cells , permitting easier penetration and infection .
1969 At a House Appropriations hearing , the Defense Department 's Biological Warfare ( BW ) division requested funds to develop through gene - splicing a new disease that would both resist and break down a victim 's immune system .
" Within the next 5 to 10 years it would probably be possible to make a new infective micro-organism which could differ in certain important respects from any known disease - causing organisms .
Most important of these is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious diseases . "
The funds were approved .
AIDS appeared within the requested time frame , and has the exact characteristics specified .
1970 Uganda established gun control .
From 1971 to 1979 , 300,000 Christians , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
1972 The World Health Organization ( W.H.O. ) published a similar proposal : " An attempt should be made to ascertain whether viruses can in fact exert selective effects on immune function , e.g. , by ... affecting T cell function as opposed to B cell function .
The possibility should also be looked into that the immune response to the virus itself may be impaired if the infecting virus damages more or less selectively the cells responding to the viral antigens . "
( Bulletin of the W.H.O. , vol. 47 , p 257 - 274 . )
This is a clinical description of the function of the AIDS virus .
1972
It was discovered that black children as young as age five were having psychosurgery performed on them at the University of Mississippi in Jackson in order to control " hyperactive " and " aggressive " behavior .
Their brains were being implanted with electrodes that were heated up to melt areas of the brain that regulate emotion and intellect .
When we first opposed these experiments , and eventually stopped them , we did so despite resistance from organized psychiatry and the research community .
Mid-1970's
The incidence of AIDS infections in Africa coincides exactly with the locations of the W.H.O. smallpox vaccination program in the mid-1970's ( London Times , May 11 , 1987 ) .
Some 14,000 Haitians then on UN secondment to Central Africa were also vaccinated in this campaign .
Personnel actually conducting the vaccinations may have been completely unaware that the vaccine was anything other than what they were told .
1975 Two neuroscientists , Laura and ( the late ) Eli Manuelides , from Yale University in the US , went on to illustrate by 1975 that injections of human blood , like injections of brain taken from kuru and CJD victims , transmitted the disease across the species barrier to laboratory animals .
Their prophetic , but unheeded , message implied that blood was the vehicle that carried the agent of CJD around the body until it chanced upon an hospitable residence like the brain .
This meant that the blood route was the key to the transmission of CJD from a primary host to a secondary host .
1975 The virus section of Fort Detrick 's Center for Biological Warfare Research is renamed the Fredrick Cancer Research Facilities and placed under the supervision of the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) .
It is here that a special virus cancer program is initiated by the U.S. Navy , purportedly to develop cancer - causing viruses .
It is also here that retrovirologists isolate a virus to which no immunity exists .
It is later named HTLV ( Human T - cell Leukemia Virus ) .
On October 5 , 1976 ... just as the so - called " SWINE FLU " inoculation program was getting under way , news reports suddenly told us that we were experiencing fallout from an alleged Chinese atmospheric nuclear blast on September 26 .
Oddly enough , the initial reports about this came from the East Coast , especially Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Delaware , and Connecticut ; but certain areas of the Pacific Northwest were soon mentioned as being affected too .
We were told that radioactive iodine - 131 was showing up in milk at various locations ; but we were also assured , as we invariably are whenever any radioactive hazard appears , that there was really no danger .
In the days that followed we continued to hear about the supposed Chinese fallout , but other things probably seemed even more worrisome .
For example , elderly people began dying of heart attacks shortly after taking swine flu shots , causing widespread alarm at first .
But the Government quickly assured us that their deaths did n't really matter at all , that they would have died anyway ; and the swine flu inoculation program went right back into high gear .

1976 The joint KGB - CIA chemical warfare experimentation program began in Philadelphia at the American Legion Convention .
A convenient test group was assembled , and it was exploited .
Data was desired for the effects of a formulation of the new family of poisons on older men in particular , and the American Legion Convention was chosen as the perfect target .
Aerosol spray cans containing poisoned room freshener were used to selectively saturate the atmosphere of the Legionnaires .
Afterwards the special spray cans were taken from the hotel , leaving the city by airplane from a small airport on the northwest side of Philadelphia .
Two of the active ingredients in the poison that produced the Legionnaires Disease were plutonium and zirconium .
Dr. Peter Beter
August 1976
About a month after the Legionnaire episode , and had quite a different purpose ; and so a different poison formula was used .
Plutonium was again an ingredient , as it is in the entire line of chemical warfare agents now being tested ; but this time the formula was designed for very rapid effect with the victims receiving a massive dose .
On a day late in August two Air Force C - 141 Starlifter transport aircraft that were preparing to leave McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey on flights over the Atlantic were sabotaged by the placement in their cockpits of concealed canisters of poison gas , rigged so that the gas would be released in flights without being detected .
The two planes left McGuire at nearly the same time , and crashed within hours of one another when approaching separate destinations in Greenland and England .
The very next day , with the wreckage of the aircraft hardly cooled , a Pentagon spokesman said , quote : " Sabotage does not appear to be a factor .
It 's not even being considered as a factor . "
Officials also said there was no apparent connection between the crashes .
Apparently leaving the same Air Base at practically the same time and then crashing almost simultaneously without warning is not supposed to suggest the possibility of anything but coincidence .
No doubt it is also coincidence that McGuire Air Force Base , the origin of these two strange fatal flights , is right next door to Fort Dix where the whole swine flu cover - up scare originated !
Dr. Peter Beter
1976 Nobel Prize went to American scientist Carleton Gajdusek for his experiments demonstrating that injections of kuru brain ( 1967 ) and CJD brain ( 1969 ) reproduced similar illnesses in chimpanzees .
A striking feature of AIDS is that it 's ethno - selective .
The rate of infection is twice as high among Blacks , Latinos and Native Americans as among whites , with death coming two to three times as swiftly .
And over 80 % of the children with AIDS and 90 % of infants born with it are among these minorities .
" Ethnic weapons " that would strike certain racial groups more heavily than others have been a long - standing U.S. Army BW objective .
( Harris and Paxman , p 265 )
The " discovery " of the AIDS virus ( HTLV3 ) was announced by Dr. Robert Gallo at the National Cancer Institute , which is on the grounds of Fort Detrick , Maryland , a primary U.S. Army biological warfare research facility .
1977 Senate hearings on Health and Scientific Research confirm that 239 populated areas had been contaminated with biological agents between 1949 and 1969 .
Some of the areas included San Francisco , Washington , D.C. , Key West , Panama City , Minneapolis , and St. Louis .
1978 The Hepatitis B vaccine study appears to have been the initial means of planting the infection in New York City .
The test protocol specified non-monogamous males only , and homosexuals received a different vaccine from heterosexuals .
At least 25 - 50 % of the first reported New York AIDS cases in 1981 had received the Hepatitis B test vaccine in 1978 .
By 1984 , 64 % of the vaccine recipients had AIDS , and the figures on the current infection rate for the participants of that study are held by the U.S. Department of Justice , and " unavailable . "
1978 -1987
Even as the understanding of spongiform encephalopathy increased , various human pituitary hormone programs in countries such as Australia , France , New Zealand , the United Kingdom and United States were attracting hefty government sponsorships .
Few of the programs ' stalwarts caught on to the implications of the Manuelides ' experiments , and unsuccessful attempts between the years of 1978 and 1987 to filter the CJD agent out of the pituitary hormones being injected into unsuspecting short - statured children and infertile women were left to one of this era's rare visionaries , British scrapie expert Alan Dickinson .
At about the same time , a British Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in 1979 raised the possibility that the unregulated cycling of protein - rich sheep remains back into animal feed might spread scrapie to cattle , as it had done to farm mink in the US three decades beforehand , via the oral route .
1979
There was an explosion at a Soviet plant in Sverdlosk and an outbreak of anthrax followed .
At the time , all accusations of BW research were vigorously denied by Soviet officials , with the explanation that anthrax outbreaks can occur naturally and that the explosion was merely a coincidence .
1979 June A well - dressed , articulate stranger visited the office of the Elberton Granite Finishing Company and announced that he wanted to build an edifice to transmit a message to mankind .
He identified himself as R. C. Christian , but it soon became apparent that was not his real name .
He said that he represented a group of men who wanted to offer direction to humanity , but to date , almost two decades later , no one knows who R. C. Christian really was , or the names of those he represented .
Several things are apparent .
The messages engraved on the Georgia Guidestones deal with four major fields : ( 1 ) Governance and the establishment of a world government , ( 2 ) Population and reproduction control , ( 3 ) The environment and man 's relationship to nature , and ( 4 ) Spirituality .
In the public library in Elberton , I found a book written by the man who called himself R.C. Christian .
I discovered that the monument he commissioned had been erected in recognition of Thomas Paine and the occult philosophy he espoused .
Indeed , the Georgia Guidestones are used for occult ceremonies and mystic celebrations to this very day .
Tragically , only one religious leader in the area had the courage to speak out against the American Stonehenge , and he has recently relocated his ministry .
The Georgia Guidestones
1981 Aspartame was invented by the G D Searle Co. acquired by Monsanto in 1985 .
For 16 years FDA refused to approve it until 1981 when Commissioner Arthur Hayes overruled the objections of a Public Board of Inquiry and the protests of the American Soft Drink Association and blessed it .
The tests submitted by Searle were so bad the Department of Justice , initiated prosecution of Searle for fraud .
Then the defense lawyers hired the prosecutors , Sam Skinner and Wm. Conlon , and the case expired when the statute of limitations ran out .
Aspartame / Nutrasweet , a toxin that blinds , drops intelligence , eradicates memory , grows brain tumors and other cancers , brings fatigue .
Depression , ADD , panic , rage , paranoia , diabetes , seizures , suicide and death .
This toxin is supported by unlimited advertising and the manufacturers pay off the American Diatetics Association , the American Diabetics Association , the AMA , and whomever else , to convince us its safe as rain .
These lies are backed by a Federal Bureaucracy knowing it may kill your child , but the bureaucrat who approved the poison got a fat job as have many of his successors .
Suppose this government watchdog , ignoring thousands of consumer complaints , has become an Attack Dog protecting corporate corruption .
This is the bitter reality of Aspartame / Nutrasweet , Monsanto , the FDA , Coca Cola , Pepsi , and the hundreds of food , drink and drug makers who add to their products a known poison Conceived in Fraud and Dedicated to the Proposition that Profit is all that Matters !
( They 're Poisoning Our Kids - Aspartame Warning The Facts From Betty Martin Mission - Possible -USA@altavista.net )
Dr Miguel A. Baret of the Dominican Republic removed milk from 360 children 's diets , because cow 's milk has a specific protein that can cause diabetes , especially in children .
They drank juice laced with aspartame instead and many developed " abnormal restlessness , lack of concentration , irritability and depression . "
When Dr Baret removed it : " The results were astonishing .
Their symptoms disappeared in 4 - 6 days in ALL of them ! "
Thank you , Dr Baret , for this study showing what aspartame does to the brains of our kids !
1984 , July 4
The first detailed charges regarding AIDS as a BW weapon were published in the Patriot newspaper in New Delhi , India .
It is hard to say where the investigations of this story in the Indian press might have led , if they had not been sidetracked by two major domestic disasters shortly thereafter : the assassination of Indira Gandhi on Oct. 31 and the Bhopal Union Carbide plant " accident " that killed several thousand and injured over 200,000 on Dec. 3 .
1985
The first of the fatal legacies of this form of medical madness emerged with four cases of CJD in human pituitary growth hormone - treated children .
1986 According to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( 83:4007-4011 ) , HIV and VISNA are highly similar and share all structural elements , except for a small segment which is nearly identical to HTLV .
This leads to speculation that HTLV and VISNA may have been linked to produce a new retrovirus to which no natural immunity exists .
1987 Dr Louis Elsas , Professor of Pediatrics & Genetics at Emory University , testified before Congress ; " Aspartame is in fact a well known neurotoxin and teratogen [ triggers birth defects ] which in some undefined dose will irreversibly in the developing child or fetal brain , produce adverse effects I am particularly angry at this type of advertising that is promoting the sale of a neurotoxin in the childhood age group . "
[ Nov 2 , 1987 ]
Neurosurgeon Russell Blaylock , MD , declares Aspartame is a toxin like arsenic and cyanide that causes confusion , disorientation , seizures , cancer , pancreatic , uterine , ovarian and brain tumors and leads to Alzheimer's .

Courageous whistleblowers like these have spoken in three congressional hearings , but industry 's lobbying and political action keep the poison in the foods of the world .
Our recourse as consumers is personal communication since the media is paid by advertising to push Nutrasweet / Equal / Diet Coke , etc . .
1987 Department of Defense admits that , despite a treaty banning research and development of biological agents , it continues to operate research facilities at 127 facilities and universities around the nation .
1989 During which time the number of French children at risk of growth - hormone - related CJD had practically doubled , the first French children fulfilled that tragic legacy .
In 1993 , those responsible for this travesty were threatened with manslaughter charges .
By 1997 , France had half of the world 's 100 - plus cases of pituitary hormone - related CJD .
1990 More than 1500 six - month old black and Hispanic babies in Los Angeles are given an " experimental " measles vaccine that had never been licensed for use in the United States .
CDC later admits that parents were never informed that the vaccine being injected to their children was experimental .
1991 Although the general elitism of human- pituitary programs restricted this brand of medical madness to North America , Europe and Australasian , Third World children and women did not altogether escape the insanity of applying Frankenstein medicine to social conditions .
A medical report in 1991 linked the CJD death of a young Brazilian man , like those of five youthful New Zealand men and women , with a childhood treatment involving pituitary growth hormone obtained from the US .
Unfortunately , the fate of women in Mexico City whose breasts were injected with US pituitary hormones in an appalling experiment to increase the volume of milk in lactating mothers ( some already pregnant again ) will probably never be known .
1992
It was discovered the federal violence initiative - the federal government 's agency - wide plan to go into America 's inner cities to experiment on children in the hope of finding genetic and biological causes for violence .
We opposed this program as racist and abusive of children .
Our efforts led to the cancellation of this program .
It also led the chief sponsor of the program , psychiatrist Frederick Goodwin , to resign from his post as director of NIMH and to leave a career in the government .
The fenfluramine studies at Columbia and Queens College are part of the violence initiative .
They were created under its umbrella before it was cancelled .
They co nfirm our fears that while the public aspects of the violence initiative were withdrawn , the actual individual projects continue unabated .
1992 Boris Yeltsin confirmed that anthrax was being researched at Sverdlosk and vowed to stop all " Soviet " BW research .
Unfortunately , defectors have contradicted Yeltsin and there are rumors that although the ' official government ' statement and ideal may be an elimination of biological weapons , the military is still actively pursuing a BW program on its own .
1993
The FDA approved aspartame as an ingredient in numerous food items that would always be heated to above 86 °degrees F ( 30 °Degrees C ) .
An act that can only be described as " unconscionable "
1994
One has only to learn what really happened to the Christians in Rwanda between April and July of 1994 to imagine what may lie in store for Christians here in America at some time in the not - too - distant future .
After the Christian Tutsis had been disarmed by governmental decree in the early 1990s , Hutu - led military forces began to systematically massacre the defenseless Christians .
The massacre began in April 1994 and continued until July 1994 .
Using machetes rather than bullets , the Hutu forces were able to create a state of abject fear and terror within the helpless Christian population as they systematically butchered hundreds of thousands of them .
The United Nations immediately convened hearings on the genocide taking place in Rwanda , but Madeline Albright , the American Ambassador to the United Nations , argued strenuously that neighboring African nations should not be allowed to intervene until the " civil war had come to an end . "
In reality , of course , there was no civil war since those being slaughtered had no weapons with which to defend themselves ; it was simply a matter of mass murder .
In addition to blocking intervention by neighboring nations , Madeline Albright also insisted that the word " genocide " must not be used , and that the United Nations forces stationed in Rwanda were not to be allowed to intervene .
In the three months that followed , between one - half and three - quarters of a million Christians were systematically dismembered , hacked to death , and slaughtered in the bloody carnage that ensued .
Tens of thousands of Christians were murdered in their churches ; tens of thousands more were murdered in their hospitals and in their schools .
On several occasions , United Nations soldiers stationed in Rwanda actually handed over helpless Christians under their protection to members of the Hutu militia .
They then stood by as their screaming charges were unceremoniously hacked to pieces .
At the end of the carnage , in late July 1994 , the American government rewarded the Hutu murderers with millions of dollars in foreign aid .
Strangely , the American press has remained silent Subversion Of The Free Press By The CIA about the fact that almost all of those who were slaughtered were Christians , and it was the policies of our government that were primarily responsible for blocking efforts by neighboring African countries to intervene .
The Population Control Agenda
1994 With a technique called " gene tracking , " Dr. Garth Nicolson at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , TX discovers that many returning Desert Storm veterans are infected with an altered strain of Mycoplasma incognitus , a microbe commonly used in the production of biological weapons .
Incorporated into its molecular structure is 40 percent of the HIV protein coat , indicating that it had been man-made .

1995 Dr Phyllis Mullenix , former head of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston and now a critic of fluoridation .
Animal studies which Mullenix and co-workers conducted at Forsyth in the early 1990s indicated that fluoride was a powerful central nervous system ( CNS ) toxin and might adversely affect human brain functioning even at low doses .
( New epidemiological evidence from China adds support , showing a correlation between low - dose fluoride exposure and diminished IQ in children . )
Mullenix 's results were published in 1995 in a reputable peer - reviewed scientific journal .
1995 The University of Rochester 's classified fluoride studies , code - named " Program F " , were started during the war and continued up until the early 1950s .
They were conducted at its Atomic Energy Project ( AEP ) , a top - secret facility funded by the AEC and housed at Strong Memorial Hospital .
It was there that one of the most notorious human radiation experiments of the Cold War took place , in which unsuspecting hospital patients were injected with toxic doses of radioactive plutonium .
Revelation of this experiment - in a Pulitzer Prize winning account by Eileen Welsome - led to a 1995 US presidential investigation and a multimillion - dollar cash settlement for victims .
1995 U.S. Government admits that it had offered Japanese war criminals and scientists who had performed human medical experiments salaries and immunity from prosecution in exchange for data on biological warfare research .
1995 Dr. Garth Nicolson , uncovers evidence that the biological agents used during the Gulf War had been manufactured in Houston , TX and Boca Raton , Fl and tested on prisoners in the Texas Department of Corrections .
1996 , 27 June without public notice , the FDA removed all restrictions from aspartame allowing it to be used in everything , including all heated and baked goods .
The truth about aspartame 's toxicity is far different than what the NutraSweet Company would have you readers believe .
1996 A new scientific paper dealing with a meta- analysis of 23 different scientific studies on the relationship between first - trimester abortions and breast cancer was published in a British medical journal .
That study clearly demonstrated a higher incidence of breast cancer in women who had had first - trimester abortions .
In response to that publication , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) , and pro-abortion / population - control advocates joined together in an unholy alliance to attack the conclusions of the authors , and to block all efforts to disseminate that information to American physicians .
The Population Control Agenda
1997 October Speaking from Washington , DC , Nobel Prize winner for discovering the role of molecules known as " prions " in the invariably fatal brain illnesses such as " mad cow disease " or bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) in cattle , and Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) in humans , Dr Stanley Prusiner from the University of California predicted that the first drug therapy , which would not necessarily be a cure for BSE or CJD , was at least five years away .
At the same time , on the opposite side of the Atlantic , the post - mortem of Chris Warne , a 36 - year - old fitness fanatic from Derbyshire , England , revealed that he was the 21st victim of the new variant of CJD which had spread from BSE - infected cattle to humans via the food chain .
Only 18 months earlier , a British House of Commons admission that BSE - infected meat had probably caused the CJD deaths of 10 youthful Britons left the British meat industry in tatters .
Since then , the history of BSE has gradually unfolded to reveal a brain - dead imperialism , one which , while blinded by its own arrogant greed to inflate market profits , has treated public and , indeed , world health with gay abandon .
Formerly a rare disease which affected less than one per million in most countries , one worst - case scenario predicts that BSE - infected meat will push the incidence of CJD in humans to claim 10,000 British lives by the year 2000 , and a further 10 million by the year 2010 .
Another predicts that half the British people , some 30 million , will be left brain - dead by CJD .
As Chris Warne 's mother commented , her son was a health - conscious sportsman , but " after winning medals in March , by July he could n't stand on his feet , and by October he was gone " .
Researchers at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( or USAMRIID ) at Fort Detrick in Frederick MD have reconstructed and modified the H1N1 Spanish Flu virus , making it far more deadly than it ever was back when it was responsible for the 1918 - 1919 flu pandemic that killed over 20 million worldwide and over 500,000 here in the US .
FRANCE is facing a new health scandal following allegations that the prestigious Pasteur Institute willfully ignored warnings that up to 600 children were being injected with cancerous hormones .
The disclosures that children may have been put at risk emerged during a new investigation into the link between the growth hormones and Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) , which caused a major scandal when acknowledged in the Nineties .
So far , 74 children have died of CJD after being treated with growth hormones extracted from the bodies of victims of neurological illnesses in the Eighties .
That scandal and the contaminated blood affair in which 4,000 people were infected with HIV through unscreened blood transfusions - despite the availability of an American test for the virus - have contributed to France 's acute sensitivity on health issues .
When the contaminated blood affair came to trial in 1998 , it was alleged that authorization for the American test was withheld to give the institute time to develop a rival French test .
The latest claims suggest that in 1985 the institute sold a batch of growth hormone to French hospitals without waiting for safety checks which showed the batch to have cancer marker cells at five times the permitted limit for use .
The institute is further alleged to have made no efforts to withdraw the batch once it was aware of the risk .

The site long served as the vanguard of the UK's Web 2.0 activities Internet radio and social music site Last.fm is to start charging listeners outside the UK , US , and Germany .
Users outside those three countries will pay 3 euros per month to listen to Last . fm Radio , the site 's streaming music service .
The other content on the site , such as biographies , videos , charts , and " scrobbling " - the site 's musical profiling - will remain free for all .
Those subject to subscription will first be allowed a 30 - track free trial .
" Sure , this was a business decision , " said Last . fm 's Matthew Ogle , in response to a number of queries that users raised on the company 's blog .
" But after looking at our resources and opportunities we think it 's the best way to keep improving Last . fm radio ( and also support all the other free services on Last. fm ) . "
The company says that its existing sales force , in combination with that of CBS , which bought the firm in 2007 , could cover its licensing costs through advertisement revenue in the UK , US and Germany .
Elsewhere , it says , those costs will have to be covered by subscription .
" While we would like to provide the same service for users of all countries , " said Last. fm 's Owen , " the world is a huge place and it's not cheap to deliver music over the Internet . "
Reaction to the decision was largely negative on the blog post , with many users declaring that they would delete their accounts rather than pay up .
" A word of the wise : if this charge ever comes to the UK , I 'll be ditching my subscription immediately .
Right now , you 're just making Spotify look more and more attractive , " said blog poster StudleyUK .
Avinash Meetoo , a blog poster and Last. fm - contributing musician from Mauritius , suggested that the site should have introduced a quota - free for a certain number of hours per day , and charged thereafter .
" This would allow people like me ( who have been contributing to the Last. fm database for years now ) not to feel completely abandoned .
Do n't forget that last .fm is what it is because of us , " he said .

When asked today during his daily briefing if President Obama would reinstate the assault weapons ban , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs made it clear that Obama was looking at other strategies , such as hiring more police officers , instead of reinstating the ban on assault weapons .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
In answer to Helen Thomas ’s question about reinstating the ban , Gibbs said , “ Obviously , we , while we were overseas last week , were surprised and shocked at the news at what had happened in New York . …
That ’s one of the reasons that increased money to hire more police officers as in the Recovery Act .
I was asked specifically about assault weapons .
I think the president would — the president believes there are other strategies we can take to enforce the laws that are already on our books . ”

This new position is in direct contrast to an ABC News story in late February that Obama was seeking a new assault weapons ban .
Last night on CBS News Attorney General Eric Holder said that he looks forward to working with the NRA , and would not endorse bringing back the assault weapons ban .
Obama ’s new position is bound to upset many anti-gun Democrats , because then candidate Obama campaigned strongly on reinstituting the assault weapons ban during the 2008 Democratic primaries .
Even though the White House website still mentions reinstituting the ban , the administration seems close to abandoning the idea .
At a time when Obama should be focused on the economy , reviving the assault weapons ban issue would only serve as a distraction .
If Obama does decide not to revive the ban , it would be a major blow to his critics on the right , who have been spreading rumors that Obama is out to take everyone ’s guns away .
By reading between the lines , it is clear that , as much as it may anger those on the left , Obama has no intention of bringing back the ban .
It must be pointed out that none of the recent civilian shootings in states like New York and Alabama were carried out with an assault weapon .
The ban is more symbolic than it is effective in reducing violence .
I agree with the White House that there are better ways to reduce violence than banning assault weapons .
If disturbed people want to kill , they will find a way to kill whether assault weapons are legal or banned .

Fox News comedian Glenn Beck , with his fabulously hilarious fairy tales of doom and gloom is hitting the road for a comedy tour .
He ’s scheduled six live performances over six days in June .
Guess where I wo n’t be ?
BTW , if you ’re thinking about going , save your money and watch his joke of a show on FNC .
But , I would n’t mind watching video of him getting heckled .
Original Story
Share this article
If you 've heard of this thing called " The Internet , " then you 've inevitably seen thousands of first comments on blogs , news articles , etc. that simply say " First ! "
No point , nothing to say on the matter , nothing .
Just someone who feels immense pride in typing something in a box before anyone else .
People would n't do this in the real world .
You would n't see a guy go to McDonald 's at 5:30 in the morning before anyone else , get to the counter and when the cashier asks what he wants , he just says " First ! " and leaves .
And you would n't see a guy who only dates girls who are virgins , then when he has sex with the girl he penetrates her one time ( just one dip ) , says " First ! " and leaves .
Yet , on the internet , the epidemic continues .
So how can we stop this ?
A good start is to remind these people how incredibly lame they are .
Let them know that typing " First ! " will not suddenly fulfill their lifelong quest to have a girlfriend .
In fact , women think " First " commenters are even less sexy than a guy who writes a mildly amusing comedy blog for a website .
And believe me , that 's saying something .
However , more drastic measures are needed .
I 'm not computer - savvy , but I 'm sure someone can come up with a program that identifies whenever " first " is the only word in a comment .
So whenever that 's the case , the program should automatically add to the comment the words " of all , I 'm a huge douchebag .
Second of all , seriously , I 'm just a huge fucking douchebag without any real purpose in life .
Third of all , see items one and two . "
If that fails , there 's one final course of action .
I 'm not sure , but there 's probably a way to analyze the comment to figure out exactly what computer it was typed from , and then actually track down the person who made the comment .
Once you find the person , punch him in the testicles , shout " First ! " and then leave .
Then have someone else go up to the person , bite his nose off , shout " First ! " and then leave .
Continue inflicting physical pain or shoving objects into various orifices until you 're convinced he 's learned his lesson .
Only then can we make the internet an incredibly minuscule less annoying place .
[ Editors Note : or you can just implement a basic comment rating system like we have / Reddit / Digg has and it 'll get down voted to the bottom .
However , assault and potential murder seems a bit more fun . ]
In the Nepomuk project , scientists from the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence have given computers a humanlike capacity to remember , as was demonstrated at the world ’s biggest information and communication technology show , in Hanover , last month .
Some background to the new development : imagine that you hear an interesting lecture by a Mr Muller from company XY in which he talks about the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence .
The next time you meet Muller , you can probably still remember his talk well , even if you have , perhaps , forgotten his name .
This partial memory is possible , as humans think associatively and intuitively handle relationships between information .
The human brain connects individual elements that it perceives at the same time and is , thus , in a position to associate conference proceedings with speakers or dates , for example .

In the Nepomuk project , a procedure has now been developed that uses semantic technology to support personal information management .
The knowledge concealed in the folder structure and file contents of the personal computer is first transferred automatically to a ‘ personal information model ’ .
For example , emails are linked with contact data and images on the hard disk .
Users can adapt this model at any time to suit their personal preferences and ways of thinking .
The resulting associations created between information and concepts are used for storage and search operations – for storage , content analysis algorithms make proposals regarding how new documents are to be added to the existing personal folder system .
If documents are searched for later on but the image of the contact person is all that is remembered then the semantic network that has been developed can help find the correct documents again .
Master ‘ Off ’ Switch
Who does n’t recognise this scenario : as soon as the front door has closed behind you , the doubts begin to creep in – did I turn the iron off ?
Is the television still on , perhaps ?
And there must be similar cases in factories and office buildings .

This stress can be put to an end once and for all .
At CeBIT 2009 , Swiss company digitalSTROM.org presented a new technology that provides greater security and lower energy consumption .
A small chip , not even the size of a fingernail , makes it all possible .
The chip connects all the electrical devices through the existing electricity network and enables them to be controlled using traditional switches .
When leaving the house or the office a master ‘ off ’ switch , which can be placed on any number of power sockets , makes it possible for the whole house to be placed in standby mode .
In theory , each individual electrical device can be equipped with a digitalSTROM chip .
The system also measures energy consumption right down to individual appliance level .
Robust Computer for Rugged Work
Rugged cellphones may be completely out of fashion now , but robust computers on building sites , in various types of industries , are definitely in .
German company Andres Industries , of Berlin , presented its ‘ ruggedised ’ personal digital assistant .
This device can survive a fall into water or being dropped from a height of 1 m onto concrete .
In addition , it has a fingerprint scanner and a seven - inch touch display .
A global positioning system navigation system , the universal mobile telecommunication system , Edge , wireless local area networks and Bluetooth are , of course , also on board .
The device is intended for use in land surveying , georesearch and forestry – basically anywhere where work is conducted in tough environments .
The device also has serial ports for connecting special measuring instruments .
Perceptual Image Diff
Introduction
PerceptualDiff is an image comparison utility that makes use of a computational model of the human visual system to compare two images .

Why ?
I can look at the images myself
So why would I use a program to tell me if two images are similar if I can tell the difference myself by eyeballing it ?
Well the utility of this program really shines in the context of QA of rendering algorithms .
During regression testing of a renderer , hundreds of images are generated from an older version of the renderer and are compared
with a newer version of the renderer .
This program drastically reduces the number of false positives ( failures that are not actually failures )
caused by differences in random number generation , OS or machine architecture differences .
Also , you do not
want a human looking at hundreds of images when you can get the computer to do it for you nightly on a cron job .

A MECHANIC who tried to buy a 12 - year - old girl for sex was jailed for three years .
John Robson , 35 , pestered one of his regular prostitutes to find him a child .
He bombarded her with calls and text messages for three months but she was so sickened she told the police .
Anna Mann , 21 , saw Robson for “ business ” every week for three years as he toured Thornaby ’s red light area in a red pick - up truck or estate car .
The pregnant vice girl added : “ He asked me if I knew any young girls working as prostitutes .
I asked him what age and he said 12 or 13 .
I said ‘ I do not know any girls of that age that are working ’ .
“ He said if I found a child to ring him or text him , and he would ring me straight back . ”
Mann told Teesside Crown Court : “ I was disgusted .
I was so disgusted I went to the police . ”
He texted : “ Heard owt of 12 lass , let me know ” and on police instructions she texted back asking what he meant .
He phoned her a few days later asking : “ Have you sorted a 12 - year - old for me yet ? ” and she said “ No , and I ’ve reported you to the police ” .
Ian West , defending , said : “ It ’s a question for the jury of asking is that going past the preparatory stage ? ”
Robson of Thorpe Crescent , Horden , Peterlee , was found guilty of attempting to arrange the commission of a sexual offence with a girl under 13 between January 1 and March 20 , 2007 .
He was jailed for three years and ordered to register as a sex offender for life .
It was a retrial for Robson who was first convicted in January last year , and he later won an appeal .
He is due for release in July having already served 387 days .
Mr West said they were considering another appeal .
In spite of status updates on Facebook , sharing personal videos on Youtube , tweeting to your friends on Twitter , why are users today still so lonely ?
No matter how many friends one can have online , the average American has fewer intimate friends to actually confide in than they did a decade ago , according to one study published in SFGate .
Another study found that 20 percent of all individuals are , at any given time , unhappy because of social isolation , according to University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo .
People come into my office and say , ' I 'm depressed or obsessive . '
They do n't say , ' I 'm lonely , ' said Jacqueline Olds , a psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard Medical School and co-authored The Lonely American : Drifting Apart in the Twenty - First Century .
People are so embarrassed about being lonely that no one admits it .
Loneliness is stigmatized , even though everyone feels it at one time or another .
Olds wrote the book because she wanted to bring loneliness out of the closet .
In the study , people reported having fewer intimate friends in 2004 than they had in 1985 .
When asked how many people they could confide in , the average number dropped over that same time period from three to two .
Almost a quarter of those surveyed said in 2004 that they had no one to discuss important or personal issues with in the past six months compared to only 7 percent in 1985 who said they lacked confidants .
Loneliness has a terrible reputation in this country , Olds said .
It 's a problem not just with a few people without social skills .
It 's not synonymous with being a loser .
Psychologists and other researchers have debated whether the Internet has made us lonelier .
Some argue it keeps us connected while others believe sites like Facebook is not an alternative to real - life contact - and it creates a false sense of intimacy .
Loneliness , Cacioppo said , has more in common with hunger , thirst and pain than it does with mental illness .
It signals that something is wrong and needs to be corrected .

Welcome to Today in Palestine , a service of the International Middle East Media Center , www.imemc.org, for Thursday , October 28 , 2010 .
Wednesday Israeli soldiers and undercover units kidnapped seven children ages 11 to 15 in the town of Silwan , in occupied East Jerusalem .
They were ambushed as they came home from school .
No reason was given ; and the children were taken to a local Israeli police station for questioning .
One boy , 14 , was ordered to appear for his attack on Israeli soldiers while his was defending his mother and brother who were being beaten by soldiers on October 14th .
Arab member of the Israeli Knesset , Hanin Zo’by , was hit by two rubber - coated bullets fired by the Israeli police during clashes on Wednesday in the Arab city of Um Al Fahim , Police had violently attacked protesters who came into the streets to counter a march by fundamentalist settlers .
Reports say the Arab Knesset member was deliberately targeted by the police .
Dozens of residents were wounded and treated for gas inhalation .
Reports said police made deliberate attacks intending to hurt Arab residents .
Zo ’by said Arabs will continue to defend themselves and their lands , demand their legitimate rights .
The Prime Minister of the dissolved government in Gaza , stated the importance of holding direct talks with western governments and not relying on hearsay .
Ismail Haniyya welcomed a French team that included international human rights experts and called on delegates to help Palestinians achieve liberation and end the siege on Gaza which he referred to as an open - air prison .
On Thursday , Israeli soldiers arrested two Palestinians after throwing stun granades and invading and searching their houses .
The Israeli army also erected a blockade at the entrance north of Hebron .
Other invasions , searches and blockades were reported in the south and central Hebron regions .
On Wednesday , the Anglican Archbishop canceled a performance of the opera ‘ Porgy and Bess ’ that the Cape Town Opera Company was scheduled to perform in Israel next month .
Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu said that it would be ‘ unconscionable ’ for performance to take place in Israel while millions of Palestinians are denied access to culture and education .
The opera has a ‘ universal message of nondiscrimination , which contradicts the behavior of Israel toward Palestinians .
Tutu , who likened the Palestinian situation to South Africa under Apartheid , said luring artists to Tel Aviv advances a false claim that Israel is a civilized democracy .
The Minister of Religious Affairs and Chairman of Jerusalem Committee condemned the building of 750 housing units that had been approved by the Local Committee of Construction and Organization in the Israeli municipality in a settlement in occupied Jerusalem .
Taleb Abu Sha’ar considered the approval as a new step in continuing settlement construction and ‘ Judaizing ’ the city and he demanded international support condemning the Israeli practices against the Palestinians and their lands .
On Thursday afternoon , Israeli soldiers and the Israeli Intelligence Chief invaded many houses belonging to Hamas leaders in the neighborhood of Jenin and engaged him in conversation about the current political situation .
On Wednesday , Dr. Hanna Issa , an expert in international law , confirmed that among all the children of the world , Palestinian children are suffering the most due to the ongoing Israeli practices against them that began in 1948 families were displaced and became homeless .
Trauma , loss of home and family , and abuses suffered over decades leave the indelible scars of their suffering .
More than 3,000 children have been kidnapped by the Israeli army and face imprisonment , abuse and bad living conditions depriving them of basic human rights .
Dr. Issa demanded that the international community exert pressure on the Israeli government to abide by the international law to protect the internationally guaranteed rights of Palestinian children .
On Thursday , Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin met with French Senate president Gerard Larcher in Paris to discuss the peace talks .
Rivlin said that in his opinion , the settlements are merely an excuse for the Palestinians to end peace negotiations .
He said the Israeli people who live in the settlements are not an obstacle to peace .
Palestinian Prime Minister , Salaam Fayyad , claimed that the issue is not a mere excuse for the peace process but the settlements are considered illegal under international law and that Israel interprets UN resolutions as only recommendations .
Today more than 500,000 Israelis live in illegal settlements within the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
More than 600 Palestinians were displaced from East Jerusalem and the West Bank after their homes were demolished to construct Israeli settlements , With no alternative housing or compensation for the displaced left homeless and destitute .
On Thursday Israeli soldiers invaded several areas of Jenin and Bethlehem , breaking into and searching several homes and causing damage .
Soldiers interrogated several citizens while tanks and armored vehicles were stationed nearby .
Last Tuesday , Nigeria announced , that its secret service managed to intercept 13 containers reportedly loaded with weapons believed to be sent from Iran to the Hamas movement in Gaza .
The explosives were camouflaged as construction materials , and were seized at Lagos Port in Nigeria .
A Nigerian spokeswoman , stated that after opening the first container , grenades , rocket launchers , and different sorts of explosives were located concealed among crates of floor tiles .
Israel is currently holding talks with Nigeria in an attempt to acquire more information about the weapons , and have an investigation started .
And that is just some of our news for today .

Why Does NATO Still Exist ?
Even in the best of times , couples regularly argue about finances .
But at this juncture , when so many Americans are feeling stung and frustrated by a weak economy , a housing - price collapse , and a stock - market crash , it 's particularly critical that newlyweds -- and even long - time spouses -- are on the same page when it comes to money .
Of course , that 's not always the case , because not everyone is knowledgeable about money .
Sure , most people reflexively think they understand money , because just about everyone has been handling cash in some fashion since grade school .
More likely , though , they have a basic understanding of spending , which is why so many households are in such dire straits these days .
Too many people know too little about budgeting , saving , investing and spending wisely -- the basics of family finance .
And when it comes to marriage , that 's where problems arise .
In a relationship , each spouse should know if the other possesses basic money knowledge , since the wiser you each are financially , the smarter the decisions about money you 'll make together -- ultimately leading to a more fulfilling relationship .
Clearly , financial prowess does n't reside in everyone , nor does it appeal to everyone .
Moreover , success in marriage does n't rest on absolute mastery of the intricacies of personal finance .
Still , if neither of you -- or only one of you -- really understands the dollars and cents of daily life , you 're likely to spend your relationship continually insecure financially , or frustrated with each other , maybe even routinely fighting .
More worrying was the discovery that the cyberspies had left behind software tools that could be used to destroy infrastructure components , the senior intelligence official said .
He told the Wall Street Journal : " If we go to war with them , they will try to turn them on . "

Third of teens use marijauna for medical uses
A third of teens who smoke cannabis regularly use it as medication , rather than as a means of getting high , claims a new study .
Joan Bottorff worked with researchers from the University of British Columbia , funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , to conduct in - depth interviews with 63 cannabis - using adolescents .
Of these , 20 claimed that they used cannabis to relieve or manage health problems .
Bottorff said : “ Marijuana is perceived by some teens to be the only available alternative for those experiencing difficult health problems when legitimate medical treatments have failed or when they lack access to appropriate health care . ”
The most common complaints recorded were emotional problems ( including depression , anxiety and stress ) , sleep difficulties , problems with concentration and physical pain .
The teens ’ experiences with the medical system were uniformly negative .
The authors said : “ Youth who reported they had been prescribed drugs such as Ritalin , Prozac or sleeping pills , stopped using them because they did not like how these drugs made them feel or found them ineffective .
For these kids , the purpose of smoking marijuana was not specifically about getting high or stoned . ”
The authors emphasise that the unmet medical needs of these teens are of key importance in these findings .
In contrast to the unpleasant side effects of prescribed medications and long , ineffective legal therapies , cannabis provided these adolescents with immediate relief for a variety of health concerns , said a British Columbia release .

TOKYO / FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - Volkswagen AG may have overtaken Toyota Motor
Co to become the world ’s top - selling carmaker in the first quarter , thanks to government incentives that fueled demand in VW ’s major markets .
Although overall VW deliveries to customers fell 11 percent to around 1.39 million vehicles , the Wolfsburg - based group dramatically increased its share of the global passenger car market by 130 basis points to 11.0 percent .
“ To gain market share during a crisis is certainly remarkable , ” JATO Dynamics analyst Frank Brautlecht said .
Toyota has given no forecast for retail sales , but its latest estimate for shipments for the 2009 first quarter is 1.23 million vehicles , down 47 percent from a year earlier .
“ Volkswagen has the luck of being strong in the markets that are currently growing , while Toyota is exposed to those that are collapsing , ” said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer , head of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen , adding the quarter ’s results would be “ close . ”
Volkswagen -- with its nine brands including Audi , Skoda , Seat and truckmaker Scania -- aimed to surpass Toyota and General Motors Corp as the world ’s No.1 seller by 2018 -- a target that was met with heavy skepticism since VW sold just 6.3 million vehicles to Toyota ’s 9 million in 2008 .
But a deepening recession and credit crisis have crippled demand in Toyota ’s top markets , with U.S. sales falling 38 percent and Japan sliding 24 percent in January - March .
Market researcher R.L. Polk forecast VW -- majority owned by Porsche -- will exceed GM ’s volumes this year after passing Ford in 2008 .
Volkswagen is benefiting from government stimulus plans for the car industry that have boosted demand in Germany , China and Brazil , its three biggest markets that together accounted for half of all group sales in the first quarter .
In Germany , deliveries of Volkswagen group brands rose 4.5 percent to about 251,500 vehicles during the quarter .
More than 160,000 new orders were booked as owners collected generous subsidies to scrap old cars in exchange for purchasing new ones .
Toyota , which significantly outsold every other manufacturer in 2008 , has seen sales fall every month of this year in China , its third - biggest market .
By contrast , VW has seized greater control of weak markets like Russia .
Despite a 39 percent contraction in overall Russian demand , Volkswagen grew its volume by 14 percent , enshrining it as the fourth - largest manufacturer in the country .
“ Volkswagen is a big competitor for Toyota , ” said Koji Endo , auto analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo .
“ Audi is strong , Volkswagen is strong , and they ’re making good use of their small cars . ”

VW ’s liquid preferred shares rose 3.1 percent to 55.26 euros by 9:37 a.m. EDT , in line with gains in the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .
ALSO RAN
In the first quarter of last year , the German group delivered 1.57 million vehicles , a third less than Toyota ’s 2.41 million , which included sales at minivehicle and truck units Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd .
Toyota ’s first - quarter U.S. sales fell 36 percent , while sales in Japan for the core Toyota brand plummeted 31 percent .
The two markets account for just under half of its global sales .
Toyota , which is expected to disclose its worldwide first - quarter vehicle sales next week , could see competition heat up sooner than it expects with an eventual showdown in the United States -- the world ’s biggest car market where Volkswagen is now little more than an also - ran .
Toyota is counting on a third - generation Prius hybrid car due for roll - out next month to jump - start sales as more countries offer consumers incentives to buy energy - efficient cars .
It will launch 16 new models in Europe this year following a product drought last year .
Volkswagen will have in 2009 a full year of contribution from the sixth generation of its flagship Golf hatchback and the relaunch of its popular Polo subcompact .
VW has also moved up in stock value ranking , grabbing the No.2 spot behind Toyota , whose market capitalization of $ 133 billion still outstrips the German carmaker ’s $ 100 billion .
If they just abandon enough of their positions , everybody will like them .
Uh huh .
In all fairness , the gun control groups share the blame for this little fiasco .
Where have they been the past ten years ?
Every year or so we have a major gun crisis in the news – e.g. , Colombine , the DC sniper , the Virginia Tech massacre .
And where are the gun groups when this happens ?
Politely sitting back quietly so as not to be seen to be “ taking advantage ” of the situation .
But to some extent they ca n’t help themselves .
They ’re liberal .
And liberals do n’t fight back .
They do n’t seize opportunity .
They play nice with a firm belief that in the end justice will prevail .
Well , justice just bought herself a gun .
This is my larger concern about the health care reform debate , about gay rights , about every issue Democrats care about .
Our large non -profit advocacy groups , on the whole , do n’t have what it takes to win .
They do n’t know how to fight back .
Hell , they do n’t want to fight back .
They think fighting back is “ mean . ”
And cumbaya Democrats do n’t do mean .
So , we talk tough like we always do , all the while our enemies know that when push comes to shove , Democrats and their non-profits will be the first ones to blink , like they always are .
Where are the big campaigns on health care , guns , gay rights , women ’s issues ?
Oh sure , some of them , like health care , “ exist . ”
But are they making news ?
Are they taking advantage of the random blips in the news cycle ?
Are they fomenting , and influencing , a national debate ?
Are they going for the jugular and putting the fear of God into their opponents ?
Are they ?
Following yesterday 's verdict in The Pirate Bay trial , a Swedish political party advocating radical reforms to copyright and patent laws has seen a significant surge in its membership
Piratpartiet , also known as simple ' The Pirate Party ' , saw its membership rise by 3,000 in seven hours after the guilty verdict was announced in the Pirate Bay trial , taking their total membership up to around 18,000 , which is a decent size in Sweden and makes Piratpartiet larger than three of the seven parties that make up the Swedish parliament .
Speaking in a press release , Piratpartiet founder Rick Falk Vinge had this to say ( translated from Swedish ) :
" The ruling means that our political work must now be stepped up .
We want to ensure that the Pirate Bay 's activities - to link people and information - is clearly lawful .
And we want to do it for all people in Sweden , Europe and the world , " he said , " we want it to be open for ordinary people to disseminate and receive information without fear of imprisonment or astronomical damages . "
" We need our members .
Unlike the other parties , we are a true grass - roots party , where each member makes a big difference .
Of course , member search result that we are strengthened in the election campaign for European elections , " he continued .
Piratpartiet has stood for election on a platform of radical copyright law reforms , the right to privacy and the abolition of patents .
In the last general election , held in 2006 , Piratpartiet won 0.63 % of the vote , far short of the 4 % needed to be represented in parliament , but enough to make it the third largest non-parliamentary party .
Whether the influx of new members will change the party 's fortunes in the 2010 general election remains to be seen .

Imagine the power you ’d have .
You could be walking around with a Palm Phone Jammer in your , well , palm – all the while knowing you can wreak havoc on wireless callers around you on a whim .
The Palm Phone Jammer does just what the name implies – it ’s a $ 166 GSM signal ( 850/900/1800/1900 Mhz ) disrupter that fits in the palm of your hand .
Any wireless callers within a 30 foot radius will be left wondering why their mobile phones are suddenly useless .
Great , adding to the grief that obnoxious public - phone - talkers cause us , now we ’ll have to deal with the annoying wireless signal jammer too .
Thanks a lot , Palm Phone Jammer .

When news like the rampaging Conficker virus hits , Mac users often feel a certain sense of comfort — if not smug superiority — knowing it does n’t affect them .
Stuart Goldenberg
But just how relaxed ( or smug ) should Mac users be ?
It ’s true that very few viruses have been written for Macs — and none are spreading actively right now .
Similarly , hacker programs distributed by malicious Web sites typically run only on PCs .
Yet Macs ’ relative safety is primarily due to their still - slim market share .
They ’re simply a waste of time for today ’s attackers , who are trying to accomplish crime on a large scale by infiltrating millions of computers .
And there ’s nothing inherently more secure about a Mac .
Researchers found 26 vulnerabilities in OS X in 2008 , about the same as in Windows Vista ( 27 ) , according to the security software maker Symantec .
If its market share rises enough , the Mac will become a target and attacks will succeed .
So , what does this mean for Mac users ?
Should they buy security software just to be safe ?
Are there steps to take to minimize risk ?
I called up Rich Mogull , founder of the security consultancy Securosis and a contributor to the Mac news site TidBITS , to get some answers .
Here ’s the lowdown :
* For most , security software is n’t necessary .
“ The risk to Mac users at this time is too low , and the benefits provided by extra software are not worth the cost , ” Mogull says .
( Products from Symantec run from $ 50 a year to $ 90 , while Intego ’s sell for $ 40 to $ 100 .
See product reviews here . )
The exceptions : people whose employers require it and people who are into pornography , online gambling or file sharing .
On sketchy sites , you could stumble upon a Trojan horse for Macs , “ and they are pretty bad if you get one , ” he says .
* Use the built - in firewall , especially if you use a laptop in cafes , hotels or other public places .
Go to “ System Preferences , ” click “ Security ” and then “ Firewall . ”
Mogull recommends choosing “ Set access for specific services and applications , ” and then allow connections as you need them .
* Use e-mail services that provide virus and spam filtering , like Yahoo Mail , Hotmail , Gmail or Apple ’s own MobileMe .
These providers will quickly block any new viruses .
* For browsing the Web , consider using Firefox with the no-script plug - in .
Some users will find it annoyingly disruptive to have every JavaScript blocked , but it ’s a blessing “ for the really paranoid , like me , ” Mogull says .
Also consider using one browser just for banking , a tactic that will protect you from some Web - based attacks .
* Say yes to the software updates Apple sends your way .
Many are fixes for security vulnerabilities that could leave you open to attack .
* Keep in mind that many common scams exploit the vulnerabilities of humans , not machines .
You are not immune from “ phishing ” scams that aim to trick you into disclosing sensitive information that can be used in fraud schemes .
So be cool , just not too comfy .
SAN FRANCISCO -- A West Virginia woman who says her life has been threatened for her work fighting coal - mining problems in Appalachia is among this year 's winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize , the green world 's equivalent of the Oscars .
The Goldmans , now in their 20th year , are being presented to seven activists at a ceremony in San Francisco on Monday .
The prizes are sponsored by a foundation headed by San Francisco philanthropist Richard Goldman , who started the awards in 1990 with his late wife Rhoda as a way to honor ...
A spokesman said : " Although we noted the deceased Pope John Paul II was a well respected Polish figure we did not consider his nationality was the primary factor associated with his papacy , or that the ad had set out to denigrate Polish people . "
The custom - built PHP - based content management system suffered from the classic problem of too many cooks in the kitchen .
Every code file had conflicting naming conventions and coding styles , structures and duplicate methods all over the place ; a Big Ball of Mud .
And Dan S. was thrown head first into it .
Dan was trudging through the usual drudgery of low - to - medium priority tickets , when suddenly the heavens cracked open and a Very High priority ticket descended from the sky ; the first he 'd ever seen .
A Very High priority ticket was an all - hands - on - deck , drop everything ticket .
You could step in a bear trap , but still be on the hook for hobbling over to your workstation and fixing the ticket before you were allowed to gnaw your leg off .
The issue was as vague as it was alarming :
One of the clients that used the BBoM CMS system had all of their pages vanish .
Wonderful , Dan thought , our clients can't differentiate the difference between " edit " and " delete . "
Other developers joined him in researching the issue , and uncovered nothing .
Even the records from the database were gone .
After restoring from backup and poring over the code , it was resolved with a status of " not reproducible . "
Only one client had been affected by this so far , after all ; there were plenty more that had no issues whatsoever .
Still , Dan was troubled , so he took it upon himself to add a logging system to record whenever a " delete " was performed .
A few months went by , and the same thing happened .
This time , Dan could check the log to find out the exact user ID and record ID that was being deleted , but to his dismay the log file was completely empty ; no timestamps , no text , not even a newline .
Dan quickly created a page and deleted it , checked the log again , and found that the logging was working fine :
01/25/2009 11:32:43 [ Dan ]
Deleting page ID 108
The only way that a page could be deleted without it being logged is if something had direct database access ( for example , all of the other developers on his team ) , or if someone had bypassed security .
In reviewing his code , he noticed that it would only write to the log if there was a signed - in user carrying the action out .
Still , the page was built to be inaccessible altogether if the user was n't signed in , so that should n't have been the problem .
A Well - Intentioned Destructive Force
Cursing himself for not making the logging function record deletions in more detail or to log for non-signed in users , he went to the next logical place : the Apache logs .
He knew when it was first noticed that the pages were missing , so he was at least able to narrow it down a little .
And that 's when he saw something troubling .

ia_archiver is a bot that builds up data for Alexa 's archive.org site , which takes snapshots of web pages so that you could see , for example , what AOL.com looked like in 1996 .
And Dan 's company had been inadvertently hacked by Alexa 's archiver !
Or , perhaps , some brilliant and devious mastermind that was pretending to be the archiver .
Dan went to check the validation code , and found the following :
if(!isset($_SESSION [' usr_id ' ] ) || !isset ( $_SESSION [' usr_name ' ] ) ) { header ( ' Location : index.php ' ) ; }
... Which is all well and good if the client respects the Location header .
The crawler apparently does n't , because it does n't really have to .
The bad thing is that any crawler , bot , or browser that can ignore headers could bypass all security on their site .
Further , since deletions are performed via hyperlink and there 's a whole column of hyperlinks where deleting something is literally a click away , it takes seconds ( or less ) for everything to be deleted permanently .
Of course , this is n't the first time this has happened , and we 've reported on a similar incident before .
Keep that in mind when designing your systems ; use < input type =" button " value= " Delete Something " /> , not < a href = " delete.php?deleteWhat=everything&deleteMode=unrecoverable " >index me !</a>.
And maybe do n't use just the Location header to secure your site .
Google exposes US airbase in Pakistan used to launch drones John Byrne
Published : Thursday February 19 , 2009
Print This Email This Instead of blanket - wiretapping Americans , maybe the Bush Administration 's intelligence agencies should have spent a little more time with Google Earth .
Until recently , Google Earth prominently displayed an image of a clandestine US airbase that housed unmanned Predator drones in Pakistan .
An image appeared to show three drones outside a hangar at the end of a runway , which was then confirmed to be an airfield by a British newspaper .
The newspaper then cited intelligence sources as saying the CIA had been using the base to attack and observe al - Qaeda and Taliban militants along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
The photograph appears to confirm a seeming slip - of - the - tongue by Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee who said that the US was launching strikes on Pakistani territory from inside Pakistan ( " As I understand it , these [ drones ] are flown out of a Pakistani base , " she said ) .
Feinstein 's spokesman later asserted she was only repeating something she saw in The Washington Post , but intelligence sources used the opportunity to confirm that the US had indeed been using Pakistani bases .
American and Pakistani officials have repeatedly denied that the US has launched strikes from within Pakistan .
" The Google Earth image now suggests that the US began launching Predators from [ the Shamsi airbase ] -- built by Arab sheiks for falconry trips -- at least three years ago , " the Times of London 's Jeremy Page reported .
" The advantage of Shamsi is that it provides a discreet launchpad within minutes of Quetta -- a known Taleban staging post -- as well as Taliban infiltration routes into Afghanistan and potential militant targets farther afield . "
" Google Earth 's current image of Shamsi -- about 100 miles south of the Afghan border and 100 miles east of the Iranian one -- undoubtedly shows the same airstrip as the image from 2006 , " Page added .
" There are no visible drones , but it does show that several new buildings and other structures have been erected since 2006 , including what appears to be a hangar large enough to fit three drones .
Perimeter defenses -- apparently made from the same blast - proof barriers used at US and NATO bases in Afghanistan -- have also been set up around the hangar . "
A military spokesman at the US Embassy in Islamabad and Pakistan 's chief military spokesman declined or was unavailable to comment on the revelations .
Google compliant with censorship requests : report Despite the latest Google expose , the California - based company has becoming increasingly compliant to government requests to block purportedly sensitive information -- including images of Tibet , military installations and even a General Electric research plant -- according to a report prepared by the Open Source Center for the Bush Administration 's Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and reports circulated online about areas Google has blocked or blurred .
The research report was not approved for public release but was leaked to Secrecy News .
It is prepared entirely on public information -- so called " open source " intelligence .
But it paints a picture of an increasingly pliant global communications juggernaut , willing to do business with authoritarian regimes and US government agencies at the expense of transparency .
China , for instance , has an " online geographical information security management and coordination group " which regularly browses online mapping sites .
" When problems are discovered , they are either raised with Google 's China headquarters or through diplomatic channels , " the report says .
" Google has been very cooperative in the course of communications , " a Chinese spokesman remarked .
Among the areas Google blurs out in China includes , not surprisingly , Tibet / Xinjiang Province .
Other areas of Asia that have been clouded include northern areas of Pakistan -- it 's unknown why or who might have requested the omission .
Google also censors certain sites in India .
India may also be taking measures to hide their facilities from satellites .
According to the report , " India 's army announced that it had taken evasive measures against the ' intrusive photographs of strategic installations . ' "
Google sometimes uses older images to replace existing ones to erase , say , the movement of troops in Iraq .
After a January 2007 report that terrorists were attacking British bases based on Google Earth imagery , Google replaced images of these sites with photographs taken before the war .
The report also claims that al Qaeda militants used Google Earth to target oil facilities in Yemen .

Integrating Art +Science .
Founded in 2007 by James Balog , the Extreme Ice Survey ( EIS ) is an innovative , long - term photography program that integrates art and science to give a “ visual voice ” to the planet ’s changing ecosystems .
We believe that the creative integration of art and science can shape public perception and inspire action more effectively than either art or science can do alone .
EIS maintains an extensive portfolio of over one million single - frame photos celebrating the art and architecture of ice .
We have 27 Nikon cameras watching over glaciers in Antarctica , Greenland , Iceland , Alaska , Austria , and the Rocky Mountains .
Our cameras record changes in the glaciers every hour , year - round during daylight , and yield approximately 8,000 frames per camera per year .
We combine these images into stunning time - lapse videos that reveal how quickly climate change is transforming large regions of our planet .
Our pictorial archive serves as a visual legacy and provides a baseline — useful in years , decades and even centuries to come — for revealing how climate change and other human activity is dramatically impacting the planet .
EIS is a program of Earth Vision Institute ( EVI ) .
Visit the EVI Events page to track our traveling exhibition “ ICE : Portraits of Vanishing Glaciers ” and watch and share our videos with your community .
It is our work to share the ‘ voice ’ of the glaciers with you ; if you are moved and inspired by what the glaciers have to say , please use your voice and share it .
Multimedia Presentations and Exhibitions
James Balog has given multimedia presentations about the project at TED and at dozens of major institutions including the White House , the U.S. Congress , NASA , the Environmental Protection Agency , Apple , Qualcomm , Cornell University , and Duke University .

After spending most of 2008 predicting the success of political actors — also called politicians — it ’s only natural that Nate Silver ( FiveThirtyEight.com ) would turn his attention to the genuine article : the nominees in the major categories for the 81st Annual Academy Awards ( Feb. 22 at 8 p.m. on ABC ) .
Formally speaking , this required the use of statistical software and a process called logistic regression .
Informally , it involved building a huge database of the past 30 years of Oscar history .
Categories included genre , MPAA classification , the release date , opening - weekend box office ( adjusted for inflation ) , and whether the film won any other awards .
We also looked at whether being nominated in one category predicts success in another .
For example , is someone more likely to win Best Actress if her film has also been nominated for Best Picture ?
( Yes ! )
But the greatest predictor ( 80 percent of what you need to know ) is other awards earned that year , particularly from peers ( the Directors Guild Awards , for instance , reliably foretells Best Picture ) .
Genre matters a lot ( the Academy has an aversion to comedy ) ; MPAA and release date do n’t at all .
A film ’s average user rating on IMDb ( the Internet Movie Database ) is sometimes a predictor of success ; box grosses rarely are .
And , as in Washington , politics matter , in ways foreseeable and not .
Below , Silver ’s results , including one upset we never would have anticipated .

Supporting Actor
Heath Ledger ………………… … … 85.8 %
Josh Brolin ……………………… … … 5.0 %
Philip Seymour Hoffman ……..4.4 %
Michael Shannon ………………….3.6 %
Robert Downey Jr. …………… … … 1.2 %
Last year , Javier Bardem ’s sadistic killer in No Country for Old Men swept all the awards .
This year , it ’s The Dark Knight ’s Heath Ledger .
Usually we ’d need to account for a small chance of an upset ; the Academy does lean toward the lighthearted in this category ( think Alan Arkin in Little Miss Sunshine ) .
But given Ledger ’s untimely death , he ’s a lock .

Supporting Actress
Taraji P. Henson ………………….. 51.0 %
Penélope Cruz …………………….. 24.6 %
Viola Davis ………………………….. 11.6 %
Amy Adams …………………………. 11.6 %
Marisa Tomei ……………………….. 1.2 %
Most of the major awards in the Supporting Actress category have been won by Kate Winslet for The Reader — a role the Academy misguidedly considers a lead .
That ’s nice for Winslet , not so nice for our computer .
Penélope Cruz , who won the BAFTA for her role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona , would seem the logical default .
But computer sez : Benjamin Button ’s Taraji P. Henson !
Button , which looks like a shutout everywhere else , is the only Best Picture nominee with a Supporting Actress nod , and Best Pic nominees tend to have an edge in the other categories .

Lead Actor
Mickey Rourke …………………….71.1 %
Sean Penn ……………………… … … 19.0 %
Brad Pitt ………………………………. 5.9 %
Frank Langella …………………….. 3.4 %
Richard Jenkins ……………… … … 0.5 %
Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke have split the two awards that traditionally predict success in this category , with Penn winning Screen Actors Guild and Rourke the Golden Globe .
But Rourke has an additional advantage :
If an actor , like Penn , has been nominated several times without nabbing a statue , his odds of winning increase .
Once he does win , odds go way down .
Penn won Best Actor five years ago for Mystic River .

Lead Actress
Kate Winslet ……………………….. 67.6 %
Meryl Streep ……………………….. 32.4 %
Anne Hathaway …………… … … … 0.0 %
Melissa Leo……………………….. … 0.0 %
Angelina Jolie ………………… … … 0.0 %
While Streep has won both the sag Award and the Critics ’ Choice for Doubt , Winslet has amassed even more hardware for The Reader ( albeit as Supporting Actress — Silver resolved this dilemma by giving Winslet half - credit for awards she won as a Supporting Actress ) .
Equally important : Winslet is due .
She ’s sitting on her sixth nod without a win , while Streep has won both Best Actress ( Sophie ’s Choice ) and Best Supporting Actress ( Kramer vs. Kramer ) .
One thing ’s for sure : Anne Hathaway ’s going home empty - handed .

Best Director
Danny Boyle , Slumdog Millionaire ……………………… … … 99.7 %
Gus Van Sant , Milk .………… … … 0.1 %
David Fincher , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ………… … … 0.1 %
Ron Howard , Frost / Nixon … …0.0 %
Stephen Daldry , The Reader ..0.0 %
When the Academy wants to rebel , it does so with Best Director — this is where “ edgy ” films are rewarded when it ca n’t muster the courage to do so for Best Picture ( Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain , Steven Soderbergh for Traffic ) .
That means Danny Boyle — who has won all the top awards for Slumdog Millionaire — is a shoo -in .

Best Picture
Slumdog Millionaire ………….. 99.0 %
Milk …………………………………… … … 1.0 %
Frost / Nixon ………………………….….0.0 %
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ……………….. … 0.0 %
The Reader ………………………….… 0.0 %
Slumdog Millionaire won all three awards associated with Oscar success : the Directors Guild Award , the Golden Globe , and the BAFTA .
It ’s also a serious film , which the Academy favors .
If there ’s an upset ( which would be a shocker ) , it will be Milk ; guilt over Prop 8 and the Brokeback snub of ’06 could split the vote , with Boyle getting Director and Milk getting Picture .

Google launched their Google App Engine ( GAE ) a year ago .
The free hosting in App Engine is allocated 500 MB of persistent storage and enough CPU and bandwidth for about 5 million page views a month .
Also , if you really want more you can see pricing plans .
GAE will support Java going forward .
Unfortunately PHP support on the App Engine is still left as the top item in the wishlist .
So until Google announces their official PHP support we have a workaround to run PHP using Quercus .
Quercus is basically a 100 % Java implementation of the PHP language ( requires JDK 1.5 ) .
Since the App Engine now supports Java this means we can use Quercus to run PHP scripts on the App Engine .
So all you need to use the GAE and run PHP
1 ) Register a free account .
2 ) Download this file to your computer .
3 ) Edit application XML tag in the file war \WEB - INF \appengine - web.xml to the name of the application you have registered .
4 ) Finally upload your application .
I downloaded Google App Engine SDK for Java and use the following command in windows .
appcfg.cmd update C:\projects\phpwithjava\war
To see this in action just visit :

Strickland Roars Past Heartbroken Bustamante
2002 World Pool Championship .
July 1 , 2002 .
Cardiff , Wales
The final of the 2002 World Pool Championship ended with a scoreline that suggested a thriller : Earl Strickland 17 , Francisco Bustamante 15 .
But the magnificence of this battle between two 9 - ball greats lies in what each player dealt with when they approached the Gold Crown in the Cardiff International Arena in Wales .
( Click above to view the last rack of the match )
Video provided by
Strickland was well aware that this might just be his last chance at making a run deep in a world championship event .
The 41 - year - old South Carolinian recaptured the form that won him four previous World 9 - Ball titles and five U.S. Opens .
Winning one more title was vindication - a way for Strickland to show everyone that he was still capable of being a world champion .
" This is different than the tournament in '90 and ' 91 , " Strickland said , in comparison to his back - to - back titles .
" This is the greatest and toughest tournament on earth .
My career would n't have been complete without winning this event . "
After burying the clincher , Strickland jumped up on the table , pumped his fist and released all of the tension that had built up over the course of nine days .
" King of the world now , ai n't I ? " he screamed , dismounting the Gold Crown with a final bark , " Heart ! "
Heart is what allowed him to fight back and clip Bustamante at the wire , despite trailing throughout .
But what Strickland might as well have meant was the courage displayed by his opponent , who performed at the highest level while faced with the deepest sorrows .
Three days before the final , Bustamante received a phone call from his wife , Mila , in the Philippines .
The couple 's 7 - month - old daughter , Marielle , had died suddenly as a result of a viral blood infection .
Bustamante decided to play , though a sullen , distant figure took the place of the perpetually jovial Filipino .
" It will be difficult to play , " he said , just hours after hearing the tragic news .
" My sponsor and my wife said the decision is up to me , but they told me there is nothing I can do at home .
It 's over .
So I decided to stay here and play for my country and for my daughter .
" I can't believe she died , " he continued , pulling a photo of Marielle from his wallet .
" Look , she 's beautiful . "
Bustamante summoned the courage to not only play , but win .
Trailing 10 - 6 in the round of 16 , he cleared an open table left by countryman Antonio Lining and ran the next three racks to force a case game .
Lining scratched after a dry break , and Bustamante cleared the remaining balls for the win .
He beat good friend Efren Reyes in the quarterfinal , 11 - 8 , by running out from the break in the final three games .
Bustamante pushed through to the final with another dramatic comeback against Yang Ching - Shun .
Trailing 7 - 5 , Bustamante escaped a safety to get within a game , then strung together five consecutive runouts for an 11 - 7 win that left the crowd standing and cheering , " Django ! Django ! "
What was billed as a final between two power players exchanging big - time runs was in reality an abridged version , with each player taking a rack or two at a time .
Strickland held a brief 7 - 6 advantage , but he erred on the 2 ball , and his Filipino counterpart finally let his famously fluid stroke get loose .
Bustamante cleared that rack , then did the same with the next three to seize control of the match , 10 - 7 .
With a 15 - 13 lead , Bustamante scratched on the break and surrendered that game .
Missing a jumpshot on the 6 in the next game , the Filipino never saw the table again .
Strickland tied it up , then ran out from the break twice for the comeback 17 - 15 win .
" I tried to stay composed , " he said .
" That 's why I did n't watch the table when he was shooting .
It 's bad karma , because watching and wishing for a mistake only frustrates you . "
Brave Bustamante kept perspective on his unforgettably courageous performance .
" I 'm disappointed , but I 'm proud , " Bustamante said .
" I do n't care if I win or lose , just play well .
Finish does n't matter .
I dedicate this to my daughter . "
The final of the 2002 World Pool Championship ended with a scoreline that suggested a thriller : Earl Strickland 17 , Francisco Bustamante 15 .
But the magnificence of this battle between two 9 - ball greats lies in what each player dealt with when they approached the Gold Crown in the Cardiff International Arena in Wales .
Video provided by Matchroom Sport Strickland was well aware that this might just be his last chance at making a run deep in a world championship event .
The 41 - year - old South Carolinian recaptured the form that won him four previous World 9 - Ball titles and five U.S. Opens .
Winning one more title was vindication - a way for Strickland to show everyone that he was still capable of being a world champion .
" This is different than the tournament in '90 and ' 91 , " Strickland said , in comparison to his back - to - back titles .
" This is the greatest and toughest tournament on earth .
My career would n't have been complete without winning this event .
" After burying the clincher , Strickland jumped up on the table , pumped his fist and released all of the tension that had built up over the course of nine days .
" King of the world now , ai n't I ? " he screamed , dismounting the Gold Crown with a final bark , " Heart !
" Heart is what allowed him to fight back and clip Bustamante at the wire , despite trailing throughout .
But what Strickland might as well have meant was the courage displayed by his opponent , who performed at the highest level while faced with the deepest sorrows .
Three days before the final , Bustamante received a phone call from his wife , Mila , in the Philippines .
The couple 's 7 - month - old daughter , Marielle , had died suddenly as a result of a viral blood infection .
Bustamante decided to play , though a sullen , distant figure took the place of the perpetually jovial Filipino .
" It will be difficult to play , " he said , just hours after hearing the tragic news .
" My sponsor and my wife said the decision is up to me , but they told me there is nothing I can do at home .
It 's over .
So I decided to stay here and play for my country and for my daughter .
" I can't believe she died , " he continued , pulling a photo of Marielle from his wallet .
" Look , she 's beautiful .
" Bustamante summoned the courage to not only play , but win .
Trailing 10 - 6 in the round of 16 , he cleared an open table left by countryman Antonio Lining and ran the next three racks to force a case game .
Lining scratched after a dry break , and Bustamante cleared the remaining balls for the win .
He beat good friend Efren Reyes in the quarterfinal , 11 - 8 , by running out from the break in the final three games .
Bustamante pushed through to the final with another dramatic comeback against Yang Ching - Shun .
Trailing 7 - 5 , Bustamante escaped a safety to get within a game , then strung together five consecutive runouts for an 11 - 7 win that left the crowd standing and cheering , " Django ! Django !
" What was billed as a final between two power players exchanging big - time runs was in reality an abridged version , with each player taking a rack or two at a time .
Strickland held a brief 7 - 6 advantage , but he erred on the 2 ball , and his Filipino counterpart finally let his famously fluid stroke get loose .
Bustamante cleared that rack , then did the same with the next three to seize control of the match , 10 - 7 .
With a 15 - 13 lead , Bustamante scratched on the break and surrendered that game .
Missing a jumpshot on the 6 in the next game , the Filipino never saw the table again .
Strickland tied it up , then ran out from the break twice for the comeback 17 - 15 win .
" I tried to stay composed , " he said .
" That 's why I did n't watch the table when he was shooting .
It 's bad karma , because watching and wishing for a mistake only frustrates you .
" Brave Bustamante kept perspective on his unforgettably courageous performance .
" I 'm disappointed , but I 'm proud , " Bustamante said .
" I do n't care if I win or lose , just play well .
Finish does n't matter .
I dedicate this to my daughter . "
WaSP Interviews Vito Evola
On a course in Web standards offered at the University of Palermo , Italy
Interview Conducted for 5th July 2005
A College of Letters and Philosophy offering a course in Web standards ?
They might seem like strange bedfellows , but Vito Evola explains how focusing on the Web as an instrument of communication marries the two .
WaSP : Could you describe your program for us ?
Vito : Our School is in the College of Letters and Philosophy .
My course is mainly a workshop .
All of our students at LxWeb ( Lingue Moderne per il Web , Modern Languages for the Web ) take a lab course at their final year before graduating .
This course on Web Standards is an advanced course , which is optional .
At the completion of their curriculum , students present a final thesis with a multimedia project — more often than not blending teaching foreign languages with the Web , or dealing with issues concerning accessibility and usability , but often other subjects such as literature , philosophy , linguistics or whatever .
WaSP : How did this particular course come to be part of the program ?
Vito :
Web design is clearly a ‘ linguistic ’ problem on many levels .
My lab on Web Standards was born because of the immanent need to talk about the Web being an instrument of communication for all users , whether they speak Italian , English or Arabic , whether they have perfect eyesight or not , whether they have knowledge of computers or are just starting .
Web design is clearly a “ linguistic ” problem on many levels ( coding , accessibility , usability , marketing ) .
WaSP : And how did you become involved ?
Vito : I proposed teaching a course that would be Web design - oriented , but with a semiotic and communicational edge to it .
My superiors and colleagues were all aware of the need to teach such a course .
Here ’s how I personally got interested and involved with it all .
I started working with our university ’s and our school ’s Web sites .
One day , our main director says he wants a layout different from all the rest : all the content of the Web site in one screen , and the navigation at the bottom and to the left of the page .
How do we do that ?!
We started considering iframes , but then opted out because we knew frames were not all that accessible .
That ’s when we discovered the force of CSS - P .
There are a lot of templates out there now with two - or three - column layouts , but that ’s not quite what he wanted .
We spent many nights in front of our computer .
When we thought it was OK , we noticed it did n’t work in that browser , or using that resolution .
Back to the drawing board : Thank God for espresso !
We finally got a truly liquid layout , and it was well worth it .
After using CSS for the presentation , we thought it might be cool to use it for print also .
Our students especially appreciated the fact that they can print out their information on a single page or two rather than 2 - 3 pages with all the clutter they were used to .
The sites are n’t as “ neat ” as they were , but keep an eye out for our new sites this coming autumn , when we ’ll be incorporating other media style sheets .
That will be fun !
WaSP : What is your approach to teaching this course ?
Vito : I mainly try to concentrate on communicating through the Web , so it ’s not just “ How to create a layout ” or “ How to insert an image . ”
We talk about cognitive aspects of typography , colors , and Web space , on how to write effectively for the Web , and in primis how to keep the user at the center of the project ( whatever it may be ) .
WaSP : Where do Web standards fit in ?
Vito : Standards means nothing less than ‘ speaking correctly ’ with our target .
The first lessons deal with the “ need ” for XHTML and CSS , moving towards a more advanced knowledge of CSS1 and CSS2 , keeping in mind that standards means nothing less than “ speaking correctly ” with our target .
At the end of the lab , the students are required to present a Web site which is validated , uses at least 3 types of media style sheets , and is fully accessible .
Interestingly enough , presenting Web Standards as an advanced course , the students have already had some experience with the old - school of Web design .
They were able to realize the shortcomings of “ traditional ”
Web design ( clumsy mark - up language , heavier code and bandwidth expenses , problems concerning the usability of the Web site — both as a designer and at the user - end ) confronting it with this newer approach .
I like the fact they see the “ evolution ” of HTML first hand : what was originally just a means to rapidly share information was so easy to use and learn that most Web designers started to “ abuse ” tags such as tables and headers to suit their needs , and now we ’re trying to go back to the roots .
So the students themselves need to gain consciousness that there really is no other way if we want to use the Web to its fullest .
It ’s like a revelation to them when they apply their knowledge to redesigning even their own homepage , and they validate and read “ This page is XHTML Valid ! ” … it ’s like they ’ve won the lottery !
Plus , I personally am grateful for the guys at the W3C , because thanks to the Validator , I get to correct a lot less coding !
Finally , when our students see that their pages can only look better , that they have cleaner and lighter code , and that all - in - all it makes it easier to maintain even a small Web site , they say “ Why do the big guys do it any other way ? ”
That ’s when I tell them “ That ’s because they ’re waiting for you to enter the market ! ”
However , I also try to make them understand that just because they have a little W3C button on their site , does n’t necessarily mean it ’s completely accessible or usable – but it is halfway there .
After dealing with Web standards , I feel it ’s necessary for any serious course to deal with accessibility and usability issues .
For the former , the best way is showing the class how other people might use the Internet , and what problems they might have , and how we can make it a little easier just by adding a few things here and there or changing things around .
At the end , we all benefit from it .
When you put the user at the center of your design , you get a lot back for the time you put in .
As for the latter , good common sense is n’t always the best educator , which is why I think it ’s useful to spend some time talking about navigational systems , Web space and color , typography , the differences between users ’ reading and interaction with texts on paper and on the screen .
When you put the user at the center of your design , you get a lot back for the time you put in .
WaSP : When was the course introduced ?
Vito :
We started teaching concepts of Web standards last year , mainly focusing on accessibility and usability issues , but this is the first year our students are really geared towards Web standards .
WaSP : And the response has been …?
Vito :
The lab has been well received by our students ( over a hundred have signed up ) , and those who have n’t had the chance to participate have asked explicitly for it for next semester , which is overwhelming .
I think this is mainly because the way the subject matter has been presented is not too technical , underlining the communicative and social aspects , and bringing to life something that otherwise might seem a little too mathematical , a little to dry .
WaSP : What resources do you use to teach the course ?
Vito : Unfortunately there are n’t many books out in Italian , but we ’ve been using Zeldman ’s translated version of “ Designing With Web Standards ” ( “ Progettare il Web del futuro ” ed. Pearson Education Italia , 2003 ) , which has been a gem .
There are a lot of great resources on the Web too , including the W3C and WaSP Web sites .
I have found a great deal of wonderful Web sites with insightful articles .
I hope to see WaSP organize the more useful and accreditable on - line assets .
My teaching method is blended ( in class and on - line ) , which in many instances has proved to be very effective , and which I earnestly suggest .
Besides our lessons in class , we also have a blog , where anyone can post an article and comment off of it , and a discussion group , where usually they just ask questions , share info and what not .
This has been great : we consider our blog our classroom on - line and the discussion group our main hall !
I think it would be wonderful to create a network of educators in the field , a WaSP for higher - level education .
WaSP : Thank you for taking the time to respond in such detail , Vito .
Vito : I hope our educational experience might be of some help to others !
Bio : Dr. Vito Evola received his degree at the University of Palermo , Italy in Foreign Languages and Literatures and has taught Web- related courses at the School of Modern Languages for the Web ( Palermo ) since 2002 .
He also teaches Cognitive Sciences , and is particularly interested with users ’ cognition and the Web .
He confesses he also enjoys American coffee during his late - night projects !

THE terms “ left ” and “ right ” and right do n't mean much in politics anymore and in the ex-communist world they are particularly confusing .
Last week 's report in The Economist on Moldova described that country 's ruling Communists as a “ centre - right ” party , which attracted some sharp feedback .
At first sight the idea of centre - right communists sounds as odd as “ moderate Trotskyites ” or “ secular jihadists ” .
But most other conventional labels would fit the ruling crowd in Moldova worse .
The lamentably crude but sometimes convenient conventional political spectrum counts “ left ” ( or sometimes “ liberal ” ) as egalitarian , and thus sceptical of bankers and rich people , pro-social spending , pro-gay and dovish in foreign policy .
“ Right ” ( or sometimes “ conservative ” is pro-business , pro-family , and patriotically hawkish on defence and foreign affairs .
That misses out whole chunks of the political debate .
Are civil liberties a “ left ” or “ right ” issue ?
Cynics would say that it depends who 's in jail : Nelson Mandela drew most ( but not all ) of his support from one crowd , Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn from another .
AP
The extremes still hold .
It remains a safe assumption that ultra-leftists will sport the tattered remains of communist iconography ( hammers , sickles , stars , AK - 47s and the like ) .
They will have complicated but enthusiastic views about Marxism and will hate everything America stands for .
At the other extreme , ultra- rightists usually nurse sympathies for the Third Reich , hate Jews and most foreigners and want to restore their nation 's past glories .
Both lots of extremists are riddled with squabbles and attract loonies .
The problem comes as you get closer to the middle .
The political arguments in post - communist countries are not easily reducible into the classic left - right split .
What do you call a party such as Vladimir Putin 's United Russia ?
In one sense it is profoundly conservative , in that it reveres the Orthodox church , dislikes public protest and hits every patriotic button in sight .
But it has spawned a monstrous , predatory state bureaucracy and also shows a sweeping contempt for the rule of law .
That is reminiscent of previous Kremlin tenants , one of whom , the arch Bolshevik and priest - murderer Vladimir Lenin , remains unburied on Red Square .
Contemporary Russian history books even sanitise the Stalin legacy .
Similarly , the Moldovan Communists support business ( particularly bits that benefit them ) and have dumped Marx .
They are keen on a strong Moldovan national identity ( arguably another “ conservative ” point ) , and they certainly do n't want redistribution of wealth .
The ex-communist countries seem to need a different political grid , perhaps with multiple axes , rather than just the single one running from left to right .
One axis on this grid would show whether the party defends or wants to change the status quo .
Most Estonian political groupings are status - quo parties , for example .
The Moldovan parties that want reunion with Romania clearly are not .
A second would concern rejection or nostalgia about the communist past .
At one extreme would be , say Poland 's Law and Justice party , which affects to regard everything in and about the People 's Republic as a complete and utter sham ( though this does not , it seems , include the academic qualifications that its leading members gained under that regime ) .
Against that are parties that think that not everything that happened before 1989 was worthless .
Hungary 's Socialists are a moderate example of that , the ruling party in Belarus a more extreme one .
A third axis would show corruption at one end and public - spiritedness at the other .
Alina Mungiu - Pippidi , a Romanian scholar at the Hertie School in Berlin , compares parties in the eastern part of the region to medieval armies that “ support themselves by plunder ” by capturing state resources .
With five notches on each axis that makes 125 possible combinations .
One of them should fit the Moldovan Communists .
Hundreds of migrants are feared drowned in the Mediterranean Sea near Libya , migrant advocates and Italian officials said Tuesday , a grim result of a wave of desperate maritime human smuggling to Italy .
At least 200 migrants are missing after an overloaded boat sank about 30 miles off Libya ’s coast , where Libyan rescuers recovered at least 23 survivors and 20 corpses Monday , according to the International Organization for Migration in Geneva .
“ The rescue operation has ended , ” said Jemini Pandya , a spokeswoman for the organization .
“ It does n’t look good . ”
In another incident , an Italian oil freighter rescued 356 people crammed aboard a boat that was in distress in strong wind and choppy water , Italian officials said .

Other boats may be in trouble .
Libyan authorities lost radio contact Saturday night with two vessels , according to migrant advocates , who said it was not clear whether the two were fishing or smuggling boats .
The incidents were reported Tuesday morning .
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva said Tuesday that “ details were still sketchy ” and that “ at least ” one boat had sunk .
There were reports that a second boat packed with migrants had gone down , said a Red Cross official based in Lampedusa , the tiny Italian island near Tunisia that is a major illegal gateway to Europe .
“ We have heard that two boats sank and that the number of missing could be much higher , ” Laura Rizzello , a Red Cross nurse , said in a telephone interview .
“ It ’s a horrible humanitarian tragedy .
It sounds like they departed Libya with a rough sea hoping that the weather would improve .
The risk is always present that something like this could happen . ”
Advertisement
The missing and rescued included Egyptians , Tunisians and sub-Saharan Africans , advocates and officials said .
Numbers were difficult to pin down because the Libyan and Italian governments provided little information .
The calamity aggravated a furor over smuggling from Libya to southern Italy .
The number of illegal immigrants intercepted at sea by Italy doubled last year to about 34,000 , most of them arriving in Lampedusa .
Over the weekend , the Italian Coast Guard rescued 222 migrants , mostly Africans and 43 of them Nigerian women , on a boat near Lampedusa , while two vessels carrying about 350 people landed in Sicily .
Libya serves as a clandestine transit point for tens of thousands of Europe - bound migrants and refugees from Africa and the Arab world , a flow pushed toward Italy by tougher enforcement by Spain .
Citing accounts by detainees , human rights activists say that corrupt Libyan officials are abusing migrants and participating in or permitting the smuggling .

Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said Tuesday that a joint anti-smuggling plan with Libya , to be launched in May , will be effective .
But he indirectly criticized the Libyan government .
“ We control and manage those who arrive on vessels in Italian waters , ” Maroni told journalists , according to Italian news reports .
“ We provide rescue and support . . . .
We do all this , although we know that others , who should intervene , turn their heads the other way . ”
An official at the Libyan Embassy in Rome declined to comment .
The Libyan Coast Guard and an Italian oil supply vessel , the Asso22 , teamed up Sunday in the rescue of the 356 migrants near an oil platform , said an Italian Coast Guard official in Rome .
Smugglers pack as many as 300 migrants aboard dilapidated fishing boats .
They use smaller Zodiac launches , which are intended for 10 passengers , to carry about 50 .
The squalid , grueling journeys to Italy often take days .
Migrants suffer from exposure , dehydration and injuries .
Many have died , but the number of casualties in this case could be the highest , officials said .

“ This tragic incident illustrates , once again , the dangers faced by people caught in mixed irregular movements of migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean and elsewhere which every year cost thousands of lives , ” UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond told reporters on Tuesday .

A Muslim resident of Russia ’s St. Petersburg has hired killers to rid him of a daughter who disrespected Islamic laws by wearing short skirts .
The police detained Gafar Kerimov , 46 , after he reported that his daughter went missing , but blurted out that the girl was dead already , Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported Monday .
The family , ethnic Azerbaijanis , used to have frequent arguments about how the daughter should dress and behave .
Rashida Kirimova , 21 , studied medicine at a St. Petersburg school and waved away her father ’s criticism when he said her clothes were n't modest enough and were unfit for a Muslim girl .
During winter , Rashida wore high - necked sweaters and long trousers , causing no problems in the neighborhood , but when spring came , she put on a skirt that left her knees exposed .
The father ’s Muslim friends again started reproaching him for being negligent and allowing his daughter to walk around dressed like a fallen woman .
They said the insult could only be washed away by blood , and introduced Gafar to a killer , who agreed to help him for around $ 3000 .
The killer , Kadyr Suleymanov , seized the girl on April 8th as she was hurrying to classes .
He and two accomplices drove her out of the city to a suburban dump , shot her dead and covered her body with garbage .
The body was found by the police after the father confessed he had ordered the killing .
Two of three criminals have been detained .
For the last 20 years , UC Berkeley astronomer Geoff Marcy has been the world ’s leading planet finder .
Of the 260 - odd planets that have been discovered in other solar systems , Marcy and his team have found 150 .
His most recent discovery , announced last week , is a fifth planet orbiting a star called 55 Cancri , about 41 light - years from Earth .
Marcy , 53 , sat down in his office to talk about the friendly and not - so - friendly competition to find the first Earth - like planet that could harbor life .
Describe your latest discovery .
This is one of the nearest stars to our sun .
It has nearly the same mass as our sun , the same temperature as our sun and the same age .
Frankly , what ’s delightful about it is that we now have five major planets orbiting it .
The planets around 55 Cancri have a range of masses , from around 10 Earth masses at the smallest , to the largest , which is around four times as large as Jupiter .
It ’s certainly the largest complement of planets ever found around another star .
Are any of these planets habitable ?
Advertisement
This newest planet , No. 5 , resides in the habitable zone , about 0.8 Earth - sun distances from its star .
So this new planet we ’ve found would be warmed up -- like a face to a campfire -- to lukewarm temperatures , making the water , if any , liquid .
Having said that , we suspect that this new planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium gas .
Its mass is about 55 times the mass of Earth .
So it probably is n’t just a solid rock , like our Earth .
Such a big planet with a rocky core and a fluffy gaseous envelope probably can’t support life as we know it .
How many planets have you discovered ?
My team has discovered 150 .
The Swiss team is a strong second .
In fact , I just got an e-mail from the leader of the team congratulating me on the five planets around 55 Cancri .
So the competition is friendly ?
Advertisement
It ’s a touchy friendship .
We laugh about it .
But in the true spirit of science we appreciate the competition because we know if we snooze , we will lose the next precious planets that are the next exciting batch to find .
What ’s the allure of an Earth - like planet ?
To find the first Earth was a dream of Aristotle .
Even in the religious realm , people have wondered , and still do , whether Earth was uniquely put here .
Not to delve into touchy issues , but there ’s still a large -- how shall I put it -- spiritual question .
Is the Earth the center of creation ?
And we ’re about to find out whether there are any other Earths out there .
The Vatican will be interested .
It ’s no joke .
I ’ve gotten two calls from them .
What are the prospects for finding planets farther out ?

There are three very exciting missions NASA is planning right now that would advance the search .
The first one is called Kepler .
It ’s a space - borne telescope that will be able to measure the tiniest dimming ( caused by a planet crossing in front of the host star ) , to one part in 100,000 , allowing us to detect Earth - like planets .
The goal is to image a huge chunk of the sky around the constellation Cygnus , monitoring 150,000 stars continuously for four years . . .
It ’s scheduled to launch in 2009 .
What about the other missions ?
Advertisement
The next one NASA is pushing is the Space Interferometry Mission , which is being designed and built at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California .
What SIM will do is find Earth - like planets in the habitable zone around the nearest stars .
SIM is going to find the nearest Earth twin a few light - years away .
And the third mission ?
The Terrestrial Planet Finder .
I listed it third because it ’s further technologically down the line .
We had hopes of launching in 2016 , but I think that ’s not likely .
. . .
It would take the first pictures of Earth - like planets .
Look at our own solar system .
Which of the planets is blue ?
Earth .
So if you found another star with a pale - blue dot tooling around that yellow star , that blue color and chemical analysis of the planet might give us a strong suggestion of life .
When do you think we ’ll see the first Earth - like planet ?
Advertisement
I would say within three years we will have the first suggestion of rocky , lukewarm planets .
We wo n’t have the spectra .
We wo n’t know if there ’s oxygen .
But we will know there ’s a rocky planet warmed up by its proximity to a campfire , if you will , where water could be liquid .
Say we find an Earth twin , what do we do then ?
I know exactly what we do .
UC Berkeley , in conjunction with the SETI [ Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ]
Institute , is building a new radio telescope north of Mt. Lassen in Hat Creek designed to search for radio and television signals from an advanced technological civilization .
It ’s called the Allen Telescope Array .
If the array picks up radio waves , then what do we do ?
Advertisement
There is a written protocol for this .
Step A is to communicate broadly and uniformly to the world what you think you have found , so that everybody can follow up and double and triple and quadruple check your work .
. . .
I would recommend that Step Two be a . . . conference , where all of the nations are represented and we talk about it .
The immediate question is what message , if any , to send back .
Remember , any such dialogue will not be lively repartee , because a star 50 light - years away means it takes 50 years to get back to them and 50 years to get back to you , so the jokes will not have quite the timing that they have when Seinfeld is on stage .

Up to one million Russians are estimated by financial analysts to have lost their jobs over the past two months , and the economy is expected to shrink by up to three per cent this year .
Meanwhile the Russian rouble has been falling steadily against other currencies for months , making it the world 's third worst performing currency this year , and industry is disintegrating .
by Mary W. Walters
Dear Senior Editor , Any Major Publishing House , Anywhere :
I am a member of a growing company of writers of literary fiction whose works you have never seen and probably never will .
It ’s not that we are lacking in the talent and credentials that might attract your interest : indeed , we have already published one or two or three books with respectable literary presses , attracting not only critical acclaim but even awards for writing excellence .
Our work has been hailed as distinctive , thoughtful , darkly comic .
As fresh .
Even as important !
Reviewers have compared us to Atwood , Boyle and Seth .
To Tyler , Winton , Le Carre .
That you have never heard of us nor read a single paragraph we ’ve written is not — as you might think — a side effect of the cutbacks , mergers and downsizings that have devastated the book - publishing industry in recent months .
Nor is it yet more evidence of the impact of electronic media on the printed word .
No .
The substantial and nearly unassailable wall that separates you from us has been under construction for decades .
You can find the names of its architects and gatekeepers on your telephone - callers list , and in your email in - box .
They are the literary agents — that league of intellectual - property purveyors who bring you every new manuscript you ever see , those men and women who are so anxious to gain access to the caverns of treasure they believe you sit upon like some great golden goose that they would likely hack one another ’s heads off were they not united by one self - serving mission : to ensure that quality fiction never hits your desk .
*
I am sure that this news comes as a surprise to you , Dear Editor .
I am certain that you were drawn to your career — and by “ career ” I mean “ vocation , ” including the spectrum of responsibilities that ranges from new - book acquisition to the kind of excellent substantive editing that makes great novels outstanding — because of your love of literature .
You probably started with an education in the literary classics which you have since enriched by reading the very best writing being published in the world today .
In your few spare moments , you may wonder why it is that aside from an occasional new voice that may become great in another twenty years , the only authors of literary value have been around for decades .
I can answer that question for you .
I can tell you why your desk is piling up with flimsy bits of vampire literature , fantasy , romance , detective stories and the kind of first - draft bubble gum that used to be called chick - lit but is now shuffled in with other women ’s writing in order to give it heft — although as far as you can see , neither the quality nor the subject matter has improved — which you are required to somehow turn into publishable books .
It is because the vast majority of literary agents do not , in fact , have any interest in literature .
They are only interested in jackpots .
*
As you know — better than anyone , perhaps , since you are the one who needs to negotiate with them — agents ’ incomes come off the top of royalties that publishers pay their writers .
The agent ’s cut is generally 10 percent of the writer ’s portion , which is in turn about 10 percent of the book ’s cover price .
Ten percent of 10 percent is not a lot .
( Correction : I have been advised that the industry standard is 15 % . )
In order to create a decent cash flow , literary agents can only afford to represent writers who are going to sell truckloads of books ( or millions of megabytes in the case of e-books ) and therefore merit significant advances .
The bigger the better : a substantial advance is money in the bank .
As you also know , publishing is a business , which means that publishing houses can only afford to offer advances they are likely to recoup — which means that advances only go to established writers with massive followings , and to particularly brilliant ( or particularly sleazy ) first - time novelists .
They are generally reserved for what ’s known as “ commercial ” fiction .
( Of course , an advance is no guarantee that a book will sell .
But that does n’t matter to the agents .
By the time the book ’s not selling , they already have their cuts .
They simply abandon writers whose books did not hit their projected sales numbers and move on to the newest shiny thing — indifferent to the fact that they ’ve turned those abandoned authors into the pariahs of the slush pile . )
Clearly it is not in the best interests of literary agents to represent writers whose book sales are likely to build only gradually — perhaps after a well - thought , positive review appears in The New York Times , The Guardian , The Globe and Mail or on a high - quality books blog , inspiring a few people to buy the book , read it , and then recommend it to other readers who will also recommend it .
It can be years before a literary agent can start sucking a living out of a writer with a book like that .
Frankly , who has time ?
*
There is no room for gourmet tastes or discerning palates in this system .
Agents ’ websites may trumpet their dedication to literary fiction , but what they really want is books that sell .
These purveyors of literary costume jewelry seek out the kind of quirky but unsubstantial mental junk food that is as similar as possible to last season ’s bestsellers — fiction that will sell quickly and widely by association with the almost - identical books that have preceded it .
See last week ’s best - seller list for an eloquent guide to this fad - based publishing system .
Since they know what they are looking for , literary agents are able to post tips and pointers on their websites and blog posts for the benefit of would - be clients : they want books that are going to get their immediate attention , impress them within the first five pages — books that are going to sell .
( If you click through the links I have provided here , Dear Editor , you will become aware of a certain tone of disdain toward the target audience .
This tone is very common among literary agents , who are doing their best to undermine the confidence of writers as a group .
Please also note the fawning tone of the comments by the authors responding to these blogs .
We have lost our self respect , I am afraid .
We have learned to see ourselves as unworthy , stupid , and probably unclean .
We ’ve forgotten we ’re the talent . )
Having set out what they do and do not want from writers , the agents then demand that we , their would - be clients , condense our novels into 300 - word “ pitches ” that will convince them of the marketability of our books .
( One might think that this would be the agent ’s job — to develop pitches for the manuscripts by the writers they represent which they will then present to publishers .
But no .
That is not the way this system works . )
Next the agents engage “ interns ” — usually selected from among the wannabe writers enrolled in one of the creative - writing courses that proliferate at our universities and colleges — to read the queries that we , the writers , have written about our books .
The interns measure our pitches against the criteria the agents have devised , find the disconnects , then write us our rejection letters .
These interns do n’t get paid , of course : they get credit for “ work experience . ”
The upshot is that fine fiction writers who are crappy copy - writers attempt to write fast - paced pitches about their own serious novels that will make those novels sound as much as possible like commercial drivel .
Most of us are n’t very good at that ( how do you describe The Road in 300 words and make it sound like a piquant coming - of - age story ?
Or A Confederacy of Dunces a sweet novel of redemption ? ) but we have no choice but to try .
We submit our pitches in good faith by email or snail mail ( depending on the dictates of the individual agent - god .
They tell us how they want us to submit right on their websites ! ) where they are read by interns with little experience of literature or life , and are rejected .
Some of us have had our query letters rejected more than 50 times .
No one has asked to see our manuscripts .
Read any good Kafka lately ?
*
What , you may well wonder , do these agents do with all of the spare time they have carved out of their lives by creating query - letter formulae and “ hiring ” unpaid minions to reject the pitches that do n’t meet their gutter - level standards ?
Well I can answer that question for you , too .
They sit on their high horses and concoct blog posts , listing all the things that would - be clients have done to offend them in the past ( such as describing their books as belonging to a genre that the agent does not believe exists , or writing a bigger paragraph than the agent is able to read : see http://www.queryshark.blogspot.com/
# 84 and # 97 respectively ) .
Occasionally , especially in groups , these snakes slither off their horses and coil up together in the grass , pour themselves a scotch , and forget to even attempt to conceal their contempt for writers .
Several of them had a fine old time on Twitter one morning recently , mocking the efforts of inexperienced would - be- published authors to attempt to get their attention in a query letter .
( Writer : “ Keep in mind that this novel is a bit of my imagination … ” Agent : “ I ’m just glad its [ sic ] not ALL of your imagination .
# queryfail ” ; Writer : “ Imagine a world where Camelot had never existed . ”
Agent : “ Wow .
You ’re blowing my mind .
# queryfail ” ; Agent : “ Seriously ?
Your last name is ‘ [ insert unusual but real name ] ’?
Oh , that will look awesome on a book jacket .
# queryfail ” ; Writer : “ I have designed a unique cover for my book . ”
Agent : “ Unrealistic expectations # queryfail ” ; Writer : “ How do I submit queries to you ? ” Agent : “ Um , meta # queryfail . ” )
Quite aside from the public ridicule , we have been belittled by agents personally , by phone ( “ Tell me about that other book you mentioned in your query .
Keep in mind that I do n’t want to hear your life story ” ) and by e-mail ( Agent , March : “ Love your book .
Cut out 20,000 words and change this to that , and I ’ll have another look at it . ”
Same agent , December : “ I ’m sorry .
We did receive your revised manuscript in August , and we appreciate how much work you must have done .
Unfortunately I ’ve been sick and had to go to Frankfurt for the Book Fair , and I just have n’t had time to look at it again .
In fact , I ’m so busy at the moment , I think I ’m just going to have to say No .
I ca n’t take on any more clients at the moment . ” )
When we asked how to improve our pitches , they have told us not to mention the two or three books we have previously published because that makes us sound like “ has - beens . ”
( For further reading on this subject , check out this interview with “ four young literary agents ” , where you can learn among other things that submitting letters on pink paper is a clear indication of lack of literary talent . )
Amanda Urban is one of North America ’s leading literary agents and one of those who does command respect for the quality of her clientele .
( The few that are of her caliber , unfortunately , have “ stables ” already full of well respected , established writers , and they respond to query letters with an automated reply that says : “ We are unable to take on any new clients at this time . ” )
Urban told an audience in Israel last year that in future , “ Fewer books will be published , and those whom we call mid-list writers will no longer get published .
The major writers will keep publishing , debut books will always be published , and the ones in the middle will have a problem . ”
We ’re losing at least one generation of writers here , Dear Editor .
*
While it is true that there are a lot of very poor and / or inexperienced writers out there who can turn into real pests , the agents ’ automated system is specifically set up to protect you from not only them , but us .
The “ mid - list ” writers of which I am a part may be very poor at summing up manuscripts to make them sound like fluff , but we can sure as hell write fiction .
We ’ve been doing it for years .
Malcolm Gladwell wrote about this phenomenon just a few months ago in The New Yorker , in an article that explored the relationship between genius and precocity .
He pointed out that many of the world ’s most significant artists ( among writers he mentions Elizabeth Bishop and MarkTwain ) did not create their most important works until they had been practicing their art for many years .
It is not that the agents do n’t know that we can write : they do .
It ’s just that they also know we wo n’t make any real money for them up front .
They suspect we are more interested in finding audiences and writing books than we are in helping them pay their bills — that we might accept ridiculously reasonable advances rather than participating in extortion .
They want us to go away .
*
You , Dear Editor , are unknowingly complicit in this debacle .
By refusing to accept direct submissions ( just check your website !
It says you will never accept a manuscript that is not submitted through an agent .
It warns us that you will return our manuscripts unread if we try to foist them off on you !
It even offers us helpful suggestions on how to find an agent — as though Google were n’t able to throw a hundred of them at us at a time ! ) you have become an unwitting accomplice to the devastation of the literary arts .
The agents have convinced you that the gated wall they built around you , to which they gave themselves the only key , allows them to protect you from hordes of grasping , pesky writers , a loathesome group they are willing to handle on your behalf in exchange for the opportunity to find the occasional wonderful new writing talent among them , which they promise to bring to you .
In fact the wall has made you a prisoner to their commercial tastes .
*
There is a simple way around this .
All you and your colleagues at the world ’s leading publishing houses need to do is to acknowledge that there are nearly as many literary agents squirming around out there these days as there are writers , and that the agents add no value to the book - production process .
They have the writers doing their sale pitches for them , and the interns doing the rest of their work .
Their role consists entirely of driving up the cost to you of acquiring the few manuscripts that fit their formulae , and therefore padding the cost of each and every book .
When it comes to pestering you , they have become as irritating as an unfiltered mass of writers .
In this economic climate particularly , they are a luxury that neither you , the readers , nor the writers want — or can afford .
Publishing companies can “ hire ” unpaid interns too .
You can tell those interns what you are looking for —real writers who are passionate about what they do , who have been working at their art for years and know the business , who understand that audiences take time to grow and that books are expensive to produce , who appreciate the value of discerning editors , are looking to attract positive reviews from intelligent reviewers , and maybe snag some more awards , and to gradually build the appreciative critical mass of readers who will complete and affirm the value of their art .
By eliminating the agents , you will be able to reduce advances ( including those you will still need to pay to the commercial writers ) to sane and reasonable amounts , and you will get to publish some exciting new books while you are at it .
The accounting department will thank you .
Your own literature - loving heart will thank you .
The writers , of course , will also thank you .
But the real winners will be the thousands of intelligent and discerning readers who will be permitted to discover a whole range of literary voices that , under the current system , they are never going to hear .

By Eric Toussaint and Damien Millet , translated by Christine Pagnoulle in collaboration with Elisabeth Anne
April 1 , 2009 --
The G20 summit meeting in London from April 1 onward was loudly announced and publicised .
Those 20 industrialised and emergent countries ( G20 ) are meeting to find solutions to the economic crisis .
But long before the end of the summit , it is clear that they will not rise to the challenge .
The G20 was not created in order to provide genuine solutions ; it was hastily summoned for the first time in November 2008 to salvage the powers that be and try and to plug the breaches in capitalism .
It is therefore impossible for this body to opt for measures that are sufficiently radical to save the day .
Public opinion will be told to look in the two directions that are expected to focus aggravation : tax havens and the CEOs ' incomes .
Tax havens have to be abolished , that goes without saying .
To achieve this it should be easy enough to make it illegal for companies and residents to have any assets in , or relationships with partners located in , tax havens .
The EU countries that function like tax havens ( Austria , Belgium , the UK , Luxembourg … ) as well as Switzerland must do away with bank secrecy and put an end to their outrageous practices .
Yet such is not at all the orientation chosen by the G20 : a couple of emblematic cases will be cracked down on , minimal measures will be required from those countries , and a black list of non-cooperative territories that will be eventually made public will have been carefully vetted ( Luxembourg or Austria have already been promised they will not be on it ) .
On the other hand CEOs ' incomes , including golden parachutes and other bonuses , are indeed outrageous .
In times of growth the employers claim that those who brought such benefits to their companies had to be rewarded to prevent them from moving to another .
Now that we live in a time of crisis and those companies have to admit to increasing losses , the same executives still claim similar rewards .
The G20 will try to regulate their incomes for a limited duration .
The logic of the system is not questioned .
Apart from tax havens and CEOs ' superbonuses , which will not be hit by any specific penalties anyway , the G20 countries will further bail - out their banks .
Though globally discredited and delegitimised , the IMF will be put back at the hub of the political and economic game thanks to a new provision of funds that will have been made available by 2010 .
Popular mobilisation needed
The G20 strategy is to put a fresh coat of paint on a world that is collapsing .
Only a strong popular mobilisation will make it possible to lay solid foundations to build another world in which finance is at the service of people , and not the other way round .
The March 28 and 30 demos were big : 40,000 people in London , thousands and thousands in Vienna , Berlin , Stuttgart , Madrid , Brasilia , Rome , etc. with the common motto “ Let the rich pay the crisis ! ”
The week of global action called for by the social movements from all over the world at the World Social Forum at Belém in January thus had a gigantic echo .
Those who had announced the end of the movement for another globalisation were wrong .
It has proved that it is able to bring large crowds together , and this is only the beginning .
The success of the mobilisations in France on January 29 and March 19 ( 3 million demonstrators were in the streets ) is evidence that the workers , the unemployed and young people all want other solutions to the crisis than those which consist in bailing out bankers and imposing restrictions on the lower classes .
As a counterpoint to the G20 summit , the president of the UN General Assembly Miguel d'Escot , has called a general meeting of heads of states and governments in June and asked the economist Joseph Stiglitz to chair a commission that will draft proposals to meet the global crisis .
The suggested solutions are inadequate because they are too timid , but they will at least be discussed at the the UN General Assembly .
New debt crisis
A new debt crisis is looming in the South , it is a consequence of the real estate private debt bubble bursting in the North .
The recession that now affects the real economy of all countries in the North has led to prices of raw material plummeting , which considerably has reduced the strong currency revenues with which governments of countries of the South repay their external public debts .
Moreover , the current credit crunch has induced a rise in borrowing rates for countries of the South .
The combination of these two factors has already resulted in suspension in debt repayments by those governments that are most exposed to the crisis ( starting with Ecuador ) .
Others will follow suit within one or two years .
The situation is absurd : countries of the South are net creditors to the North , starting with the US whose external debt is over US $ 6000 billion ( twice the total external debt of all the countries of the South ) .
Central banks in countries of the South buy US treasury bonds instead of setting up a democratic bank of the South to finance human development projects .
They should leave the World Bank and the IMF , which are tools of domination , and develop South - South relations of solidarity such as those that exist between countries that are members of ALBA ( Venezuela , Cuba , Bolivia , Nicaragua , Honduras and Dominica ) .
They ought to audit the debts they are asked to repay and put an end to the payment of illegitimate debts .
The G20 will see to it that the core of neoliberal logic is left untouched .
Its principles are asserted again and again , even though they have blatantly failed : the G20 maintains its attachment to a global economy based on an open market .
Its support to the god of free market is non-negotiable .
Everything else is hocus pocus .

Facebook has been involved in a number of workplace controversies A Swiss woman has lost her job after her employers spotted she was using the Facebook website when she had claimed to be too ill to use a computer .
The unnamed woman was suffering a migraine and had told her employer , Nationale Suisse , she needed to lie in a darkened room .
The company said its discovery that she was also using Facebook destroyed its trust in her and prompted her sacking .
But the woman told a Swiss newspaper she was innocent .
The woman , who is from Basle , said she had been accessing the internet on her iPhone while in bed .
She said she did not believe the company 's assertion that a colleague had inadvertently noticed her using Facebook , accusing it instead of spying on her .
She said the company had created a fictitious Facebook persona which become " friends " with her , allowing the company to monitor her online activity .
Her suspicions were raised when the " friend " suddenly disappeared after she was fired , the woman told 20 Minuten daily .
But the company says it followed a simple logic : that those who are well enough to use Facebook with a migraine are well enough to work with a migraine .
It is not the first time Facebook has been involved in a workplace controversy .
Some companies have banned it altogether , while others have fired employees over statements they make about work while online .

Debido a la escasez de enfermeras en la República Checa , los hospitales privados del país han suscrito las cirugías plásticas estéticas gratuitas como prestaciones laborales
La escasez de enfermeras en la República Checa , debido al éxodo a otros países de la Unión Europea donde la profesión está mejor remunerada , ha aguzado el ingenio de algunas críticas privadas , que atraen personal con operaciones de cirugía plástica gratuitas , informa hoy la prensa local .
Es el caso de la clínica Iscare de Praga , que ofrece caras operaciones de liposucción y de levantamiento de pechos a sus empleadas , a cambio de un contrato de al menos tres años .
Una operación de ese tipo asciende a unos 2 mil euros , lo que resulta inasequible para un trabajador sanitario , y en el caso de rescindir el contrato se estipula que debe devolver el importe .
La portavoz de la Asociación Checa de Enfermeras , Irena Pejznochova , ha declarado que no ve ningún problema en esa forma de captación de personal .
" No decimos que ofrecer una operación de cirugía plástica es lo más feliz , pero es la decisión de la empresa , a lo que tiene derecho .
No se puede decir nada contra ello " , señala Pejznochova .
El director general de Iscare , Jirí Schweitzer , declinó hacer una valoración sobre esta política , que ha mejorado en un 10 % las solicitudes de trabajo , según los medios .
Hasta ahora , son nueve las enfermeras que se han sometido a una de esas operaciones de cirugía en los senos .
" No vamos a conceder ninguna entrevista al respecto " , dijo Schweitzer .
El diario " Lidove Novin " señala que entre las ventajas que los agentes del sector se ven obligados a dar a sus potenciales empleados figuran también las ayudas a la vivienda y la oferta de jardines de infancia para sus hijos .

Obama Lifts Some Restrictions on Cuba
A man rides his bicycle along the Malecon in Havana on April 9 , 2009 .
( Javier Galeano / Associated Press )
Updated 5:55 p.m.
By Michael D. Shear
President Obama is lifting some restrictions on Cuban Americans ' contact with Cuba and allowing U.S. telecom companies to operate there , opening up the communist island nation to more cellular and satellite service , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced at his regular news briefing today .
The decision does not lift the trade embargo on Cuba but eases the prohibitions that have restricted Cuban Americans from visiting their relatives and has limited what they can send back home .
It also allows companies to establish fiber - optic and satellite links between the United States and Cuba and will permit U.S. companies to be licensed for roaming agreements in Cuba .
Communications of those kinds have been prohibited under tough rules put in place by George W. Bush 's administration to pressure for democratic change in the island nation .
But under the new policy promoted by Obama , satellite radio companies and television providers will also be able to enter into transactions necessary to provide service to Cuban citizens .
It will also provide an exception to the trade embargo to allow personal cell phones , computes and satellite receivers to be sent to Cuba .
" All who embrace core democratic values long for a Cuba that respects the basic human , political and economic rights of all of its citizens , " Gibbs said .
" President Obama believes the measure he has taken today , will help make that goal a reality . "
As a candidate , Obama promised to seek closer relations with Cuba , and courted Cuban voters in the key state of Florida .
As president , he has signaled that he intends to move toward a greater openness .
Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee , praised the move .
" President Obama has made the right call .
. . , " he said in a statement this afternoon .
" These changes are both compassionate and responsive to reality . "
A White House aide said the president believes that democratic change will come to the Cuban nation more quickly if the United States reaches out to the people of Cuba and their relatives in the United States .
But the move is highly controversial , especially among those who supported Bush 's hardline policy and view the restrictions as a way of spurring political change .
The news drew quick criticism from Rep. Lincoln Diaz - Balart ( R - Fla . ) and his brother , Rep. Mario Diaz - Balart ( R - Fla . ) , who called it a " serious mistake . "
In a statement posted online , they said , " Unilateral concessions to the dictatorship embolden it to further isolate , imprison and brutalize pro-democracy activists , to continue to dictate which Cubans and Cuban - Americans are able to enter the island , and this unilateral concession provides the dictatorship with critical financial support . "
Obama 's administration takes a somewhat different view than the Bush administration , but has resisted a wholesale elimination of the trade embargo and travel ban , which has been pushed for by some in Congress .
The announcement comes as the president prepares to leave Thursday for the Summit of the America 's in Trinidad , and a stop in Mexico .

The comments to this entry are closed .
The girl ’s voice in the videotape is tiny and tentative .
She is talking to a nursing aide in a Planned Parenthood clinic in Bloomington , Ind .
The girl wants an abortion .
The aide explains that the girl will need a parent ’s consent because she is only 13 .
The girl balks ; she does not want to name the father .
“ Cause , I mean , he would be in really big trouble , ” says the girl .
Her boyfriend , she explains , is 31 .

The aide drops her head into her hands .
“ In the state of Indiana , ” says the aide , “ when anyone has had intercourse and they are age 13 or younger . . . it has to be reported to Child Protective Services . ”
There is a 60 - second gap in the tape , according to the running timer on the video .
What happens next is meant to be explosive .
“ OK , ” says the aide , “ I did n’t hear the age .
I do n’t want to know the age .
It could be reported as rape .
And that ’s child abuse . ”

“ So if I just say I do n’t know who the father was , but he ’s one of the guys at school or something ? ” asks the girl .
“ Right , ” says the aide , who has just stepped into a carefully laid trap .
As it happens , the boyfriend does not exist .
The girl is not pregnant .
Nor is she 13 .
She is Lila Rose , a 20 - year - old UCLA history major with a little voice and a bold plan to expose what she and many abortion foes see as Planned Parenthood ’s wrongdoings .

Since 2006 , Rose has orchestrated undercover “ stings ” at Planned Parenthood clinics in Los Angeles , Indianapolis , Bloomington , Tucson , Phoenix and Memphis .
Surreptitiously videotaping their interactions , she and a friend have posed as abortion - seeking teens impregnated by older men .
The videos -- boiled down to five minutes , with portentous music and fast cuts to heighten the drama -- are posted on Rose ’s website , LiveAction.org , and YouTube .
Rose ’s strategy -- accusing Planned Parenthood of failing to report suspected statutory rapes -- is not a new one in the antiabortion trenches .
But the new - media twist on the idea has put her front and center of a new generation .
“ There is this stereotype of who we pro-life leaders are , and for the most part it would be white middle - aged religious men trying to impose their will on women , ” said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition .
“ So now with Lila , you bring this young , fresh college student that completely blows any stereotypes away .
No one is going to accuse Lila of being mean , vindictive and harsh . ”

Rose ’s goal is to undermine legal abortion by showing that Planned Parenthood , the largest provider of abortions in the country , abets sexual exploitation by counseling pregnant minors to lie about the ages of their adult boyfriends .
Planned Parenthood officials strenuously deny the charge .
Protecting minors is a crucial part of their mission , they say , but with 30,000 employees and volunteers and 850 clinics , they say , mistakes are inevitable .
Abortion is not likely to be outlawed any time soon , but Rose ’s work is having an impact , particularly on a local level , where abortion foes are increasingly focusing their efforts .
On Wednesday , Tennessee lawmakers said they would seek to end a $ 721,000 contract with Planned Parenthood , citing outrage over what they saw in a video Rose had posted two days earlier from a Memphis clinic .
She posed there in July as a 14 - year - old impregnated by a 31 - year - old ; a Planned Parenthood staffer says , “ Just say you have a boyfriend , 17 years old , whatever . ”

Last month , the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted to suspend a grant worth nearly $ 300,000 to Planned Parenthood that was earmarked for sex education , not abortions .
A conservative Tustin businessman raised the issue with Supervisor John Moorlach after meeting Rose and seeing her videos .
Last year , after the Indiana videos were posted on Rose ’s website , Bloomington ’s Herald Times reported that the nurse ’s aide seen on the tape had been fired .
A second Planned Parenthood staffer , in Indianapolis , resigned : Rose ’s tape appeared to show that employee directing the young woman across the state line to a clinic in Illinois , which does n’t have a parental consent law .
A grand jury is investigating whether Planned Parenthood violated the law , said Mario Massillamany , a spokesman for the prosecutor of Marion County , where Indianapolis is located .
“ After we stated we were conducting an investigation , they hired a group to conduct better training for their staff , ” he added .
Laurie Rubiner , vice president for public policy and advocacy for Planned Parenthood Federation of America , said it is a violation of the organization ’s policy to tell a young woman to lie about the age of a father .
The well - being of patients , she said , is paramount .
“ And that means making sure that we are complying with minor - abuse reporting requirements . ”

Rose , she added , has refused to show Planned Parenthood her unedited tapes , so “ it ’s very difficult for us to know what happened . ”
Rose said the full , 48 - minute video of her encounter in Indianapolis is available at her website .
The conversation in the uncut version is more nuanced than the edited five - minute version , and includes a staffer stating emphatically , “ We have to follow the laws , ” and another urging Rose to tell her mother about the pregnancy .
“ I should also note that every time we release footage from a new clinic , ” said Rose in an e-mail , “ we send complete copies of the footage to various state authorities , including the attorney general . ”

For this story , Rose would answer questions only by e-mail .
When contacted in December , she agreed to meet a reporter the next day but canceled , citing schoolwork , and refused to reschedule .
She was subsequently advised by a publicist to communicate only in writing .
She did not answer a question about who funds her work , saying only that she operates “ on a very low budget ” and uses “ mostly student volunteers . ”
Federal tax records for Live Action Films , created in 2008 , are not yet available .
Planned Parenthood is treading carefully with Rose .
Though the organization does not want to be seen as engaging in a David vs.
Goliath struggle with a college student -- albeit one with stellar connections -- it has not ignored her .
In May 2007 , Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles accused Rose of breaking state privacy laws when she secretly taped her interactions .
It demanded she remove the videos from her website , which she did , though they are still easily found on YouTube .
( Arizona , Indiana and Tennessee , where she went next , have less restrictive privacy laws . )

For Rose , the threat was a badge of honor : “ They are on the lookout for me , ” she told an audience of conservative Christian activists at the Family Research Council ’s Values Voter Summit in Washington in September .
“ When I walk into Planned Parenthoods across the country , I am flattered to see my picture on the wall .
It is because to Planned Parenthood , I am -- quote -- a ‘ known anti-choice extremist . ’
This is one of the better compliments I have received . ”
In February , she was awarded $ 50,000 from the Gerard Health Foundation , a Massachusetts - based charity founded by a Catholic businessman that funds antiabortion and abstinence - only sex education efforts .
David French , an attorney with the Alliance Defense Fund , a Christian legal group , gave her free advice when Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles threatened action , and appeared at her side during an interview with conservative TV talk - show host Bill O’Reilly .
She also receives guidance from CRC Public Relations , a Washington - area firm that represents conservative clients and had a hand in the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign that targeted Democrat John F. Kerry during the 2004 presidential race .
Rose , the third of eight children , grew up in San Jose .
Her father is an engineer for Sun Microsystems .
She was home - schooled , she wrote in an e-mail , and also attended a part - time Christian school and a junior college throughout high school .
When she was 15 , she said , she founded Live Action and began giving antiabortion presentations to schools and youth groups .

Between 2006 and 2008 , Rose attended four workshops at the Leadership Institute , a Virginia - based educational foundation that teaches conservatives how to polish their communication skills .
In fall 2006 , when she was a UCLA freshman , she and fellow conservative activist James O’Keefe came up with the idea to infiltrate clinics .
Rose , by e-mail , and O’Keefe , in a phone interview , said they were inspired by the work of Mark Crutcher , a Texas antiabortion activist who in 2002 taped fake calls to hundreds of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country featuring women posing as pregnant minors .
They also found an unlikely source of inspiration : “ Rules for Radicals , ” a handbook on grass - roots organizing by Saul Alinsky , a legendary left - wing activist who was an inspiration to President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Among Alinsky ’s most famous admonitions is one that O’Keefe said he and Rose took to heart : “ Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules . ”

O’Keefe , 24 , said he and Rose have received criticism from some of their associates for using deception .
“ It ’s a pretty complicated ethical issue , ” he said , “ but we believe there is a genocide and nobody cares , and you can use these tactics and it ’s justified . ”
Rose and O’Keefe visited their first clinic -- UCLA ’s Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center -- in 2006 .
They videotaped an employee telling them “ some pretty bad things , ” said O’Keefe , including that the fetus is a collection of cells .
“ That ’s what set us in motion . ”
“ The videos , ” O’Keefe added , “ are not supposed to necessarily show people breaking laws .
They are supposed to change hearts and minds . ”
That ’s precisely the effect Rose ’s work had on Mark Bucher , the Tustin businessman who sent the videos to Orange County supervisors .

“ I have never gotten riled up about Planned Parenthood getting taxpayer money to do abortions , ” Bucher said .
“ I got riled up when I saw that this organization does n’t care about their legal obligation to make sure some 13 - year - old girl is n’t going to be molested by a 31 - year - old man anymore .
No matter where you stand on the abortion issue , that ought to bother you . ”

While the nation had no idea what would be on Ms. Franklin ’s head , Mr. Song knew it would be one of three models she had picked out .
He learned which one only while watching her sing at the inauguration on the television in his crowded workroom .
“ I ’m so glad she chose that one . ” he said .
“ It was the one I was pushing her to wear . ”
Interest in Mr. Song ’s work has exploded so much that he expects his business , Moza Incorporated , which recorded $ 1 million in sales during 2008 , to do six to seven times more than that this year .
Mr. Song would like to double his workforce , currently at 11 people , if he could find more experienced seamstresses .
The only hitch , he said , is that millinery “ is a dead art . ”
And indeed , Mr. Song , who estimates that he is one of about a dozen custom milliners in the country , is , in a sense , an accidental milliner .
Image Delois Dawkins of Flint , Mich. , shopping at Mr. Song Millinery in Detroit , where each piece is hand - sewn .
The shop had a local following long before January .
As a young man , Mr. Song , 36 , had no intention of taking over the business his parents , Han and Jin Song , started after emigrating from South Korea in 1982 .
After studying biochemistry in college , he left one semester short of a degree to pursue art studies at Parsons the New School for Design in New York .
More than 40 % of the world 's fishing is carried out unsustainably and largely in defiance of international codes of conduct , according to a new study .
The team that carried out the research said that voluntary schemes to prevent overfishing should be replaced with binding international laws that can better protect marine ecosystems .
Scientists graded the 53 major fishing nations - those that take 96 % of the world 's marine catch - on how their intentions matched actions in complying with the UN 's code , a voluntary measure developed in 1995 as a potential way to tackle overfishing .
The code sets out criteria on how countries should implement the right type of equipment for how fish are caught and how to minimise ecosystem impacts such as catching unwanted fish species that have to be thrown back into the sea and minimising effects on dolphins and other mammals .
Norway comes top of the list with a compliance rate of 60 % , followed by the United States , Canada , Australia , Iceland and Namibia .
In the bottom 28 countries , representing more than 40 % of the world 's marine fish catch , the compliance rates were so poor that the authors gave them " fail " grades , meaning they complied with less than 40 % of the UN code of conduct .
Twelve countries in this category also failed in all or most sections of the compliance analysis .
The UK is ranked 14th .
The work , carried out by Tony Pitcher and Ganapathiraju Pramod of the fisheries centre at the University of British Columbia in Cabnada , Daniela Kalikoski at the Federal University of Rio Grande in Brazil and Katherine Short at WWF International in Switzerland , is published in the journal Nature tomorrow .
Giles Bartlett , WWF 's fisheries policy officer , said he was surprised by the low scores of countries that are thought to have the most progressive fishing policies .
" We know the global oceans are in crisis but I thought that the highest - scoring countries would score higher than they 've done .
That shows the challenge is pervasive – not just in the high seas but in areas we consider to be the best - managed in the world such as Australia , New Zealand , Iceland and Canada . "
Overall , the five questions on which countries scored worst concerned introducing ecosystem - based management , controlling illegal fishing , reducing excess fishing capacity and minimising bycatch and destructive fishing practices .
The authors wrote that new international rules were needed to address overfishing .
" Although the voluntary nature of the code may have been necessary in getting all - nation agreement when it was drafted in the early 1990s , attitudes to the oceans have changed , " they said .
" There is now widespread scientific consensus on the ecological impacts of continued overfishing and the threats to seafood security , and broad agreement on policy issues such as curtailing illegal catches and minimising the impacts of fishing on marine ecosystems .
The time has come for a new integrated international legal instrument covering all aspects of fisheries management . "
Bartlett said that the next reform of the EU 's common fisheries policy , due in 2012 , had the potential to tackle some of the problems .
" The last reform was going to adopt ecosystem management as a fundamental principle but it has n't delivered on that , " said Bartlett .
" [ They should ] look at the best systems in the world in terms of governance such as Australia , where they 've changed the emphasis of fisheries management to keeping ownership of resources to the industry .
This means the industry does n't have the incentive to overfish , the incentive is to look after the resource . "
Other management systems include setting up marine reserves .
" You can look at how humans use the sea and look at how humans mitigate those impacts , be they fisheries impacts or oil and gas exploration .
Marine reserves are the best tool for mitigating those impacts on the ocean . "
" The United Kingdom comes out 14th below Namibia and South Africa and only just above Malaysia , " said independent fisheries biologist Doug Herdson .
" What is most surprising is the spread of the European Union nations 10th to 31st when all are supposed to be following a ' common fisheries policy ' .
It can certainly be argued that things have been changing in the four years since the majority of this study was carried out ; most notably the EU 's maritime strategy , its discards policy , and the UK 's marine bill , though none of these is yet in effect . "
He added : " The global problem is the mindset that economic necessity must override everything else , and consequent failure to recognise that no economic measure can succeed if it is not supported by a sustainable environment .
Despite recent studies showing the degradation of marine ecosystems , we have not yet outgrown the 19th - century concept that the seas are endlessly bountiful . "
CSS isolation : there has got to be a better way Tuesday , April 14 , 2009
CSS can be a tricky thing .
I ’m trying to do something that I think should be pretty simple .
Let ’s say a page contains a section ( e.g. an admin panel ) that must be styled independently from the rest of the page , but consistently and predictably .
The DOM and CSS for the main part of the page is undetermined ( e.g. because it ’s part of a user - defined theme ) .
Of course , you could use iframes , which are about the only isolation mechanism in HTML but we ca n’t do this here because iframes are quite rigid in shape ( they are rectangles ) , they make scripting the DOM more difficult and they pretty much require an additional round - trip to the server to serve their contents .
The real problem to solve here is that if the main CSS for the page defines very general styles that for example target all elements with a given tag name , and those styles are going to bleed into our specialized region unless we find a way to block that CSS from cascading down .
Ideally , you ’d have an attribute on the tag , something like inheritcss = ” false ” , but no such thing exists .
So the only way I ’ve found to solve this problem is to write a stylesheet that explicitly resets the defaults for all properties and all elements .
Here is an excerpt from the CssIsolation.css file :
.isolate * { background : white none repeat scroll 0 % 0 % ; border : 0 px none black ; border - collapse : separate ; border - spacing : 0 px ;
[...] z-index : auto ; } .isolate p { display : block ; margin - top : 16px ; margin- bottom : 16px ; } .isolate strong , .isolate b { font - weight : bold ; } .isolate h1 { display : block ; font - size : xx-large ; font - weight : bold ; margin - top : 21 px ; margin- bottom : 21 px ; }
This is lame for a number of reasons :
Defaults might vary from browser to browser ( this is particularly true of fonts and sizes ) .
Some styles ca n’t be reset to defaults , such as default button styles ( at least , not without using browser - specific styles that are n’t consistently available ) :
An exhaustive list of tags and style properties is sure to be wrong now or in the future ( I did CSS 2 , so it ’s already outdated by CSS3 ) .
Still , imperfect as it is , this is a solution that works reasonably well and can be improved as problems are found .
The equivalent of that inheritcss = ” false ” attribute , using my isolation stylesheet , is to set class = ” isolate ” on the parent element of the section of the page you want to isolate .
None of the styles defined for the rest of the page ( which is defined just as usual , with no difference whatsoever ) should bleed then .
Here a snapshot of my test page , where you can see , side - by - side , unstyled HTML and HTML with reset styles :
Differences exist but are quite subtle .
The HTML for an isolated section is defined like this :
< div class = " isolate " id = " isolated1 " > Isolated 1 ... </ div >
If for example the main style sheet defines the style of lists like follows , this style wo n’t bleed into any element that has the isolate class ( on the right on the next screenshot ) , just because we set the “ isolate ” class on the parent element .
ul li { list - style - type : square ; } ol li { list - style - type : upper-roman ; }
You can then style each of these sections independently by just qualifying each of the style selectors with the ID of the parent element .
In other words , just paste “ #isolated1 ” in front of each selector of the local stylesheet , if the id of the parent element is “ isolated1 ” :
#isolated1 p { color : Green ; border : solid 1 px black ; }
This style will override the isolation CSS because it is qualified by id , which always wins over styles that are only qualified by class :
I really wish one of you will tell me how stupid I am for not knowing about feature / hack X that is way simpler and gets you to the same place …
There has got to be a better way .
The code for the isolation stylesheet , as well as the test pages , can be found here :

What things cost in Ancient Rome
Distributed by Ancient Coins for Education , Inc .
When studying Ancient Rome , it is only natural to wonder what the price of everyday items might have been .
In order to fully understand the price of an item , you must also consider the wages workers received at the time the item was purchased .
Before you study the information below , it is helpful to understand that professions were valued differently in ancient times than they are today .
Likewise , the value of items was different then than now .
For instance , in todays world , one might spend 20 % of their total income on food , but in ancient times the cost may have been 50 % or more of ones total income .
In fact , during parts of the history of Rome , food costs were so high that without free wheat subsidies from the government , the common people would not have been able to survive !
These subsidies were known as doles and according to AEJ Morriss History of Urban Form [ 1970 George Godwin LTD ] , up to 1/3 of the citizens of the capital city received this public assistance .
Grain formed the foundation of the common Romans diet .
It was not uncommon for grain to be the only thing a poor Roman ever ate .
The cost of baking bread was very high to a poor Roman , so if no access to a communal , public oven could be had , the grain would be crushed and made into a porridge known as puls that was likely similar in taste and texture to modern polenta .
While we take it for granted today , meat was an extravagant luxury that most Romans could not afford to indulge in .
Clothing was another expensive proposition .
One libra ( Roman pound , just under ¾ of a modern pound - 326 grams ) , of fine silk cost more than a dozen human beings .
It seems absurd to us today , but such was the case , because Ancient Romans lacked the production machines of today that make cheap fabric possible .
For the commoners , fashion was not a consideration - clothing was utilitarian , had to be durable , and was patched until finally the garment became the thing from which patches were taken for its replacement .
Historically , the cost of living has expanded to consume all of the income that is available to the majority of the people in the society .
As technology has enabled faster production , technology has also introduced new things to consume the income the increased productivity creates .
The ancient Romans did not have many things to pay for in comparison to life today , yet it was every bit as much a struggle for them to survive as it is today - and probably , it was even more of a struggle for them .
As you read the data below , consider what you might have been in Ancient Rome .
Would you have been a carpenter ?
A mason ?
Would you have been fortunate enough to receive an education and become an advocate ( ancient equivalent of the modern lawyer ) ?
Pick your profession , and then take a look at the kind of food and clothing you would have been able to afford .
You might gain a new appreciation for modern life !
All the prices and wages are listed in denarii communes , which were not actually silver denarii as we usually think of when discussing ancient Roman coinage .
Denarii communes , or d.c. , were notational currency .
What this means is , an exchange rate was given , telling how much of the currency in circulation at that time ( nummii ) it took to equal one d.c .
This made it easy to change the value of the money in circulation , without having to rewrite and redistribute the entire Edict .
A series of exchange tables are at the end of this page .

Soldiers in Ancient Rome
Soldiering was one of the best ways a Roman male could provide for his family .
The base wage was low , not enough to live on .
Four times a year , a soldier received a  Donative greater than his annual base pay .
Additionally , soldiers received an annual  Annona subsidy for grain purchases .
The best soldiers hoped to be recruited to the Praetorian Guard , the soldiers who guarded the Emperor .
These soldiers were paid roughly 3 times the base wage of the average soldier , and likely enjoyed many additional privileges as well .
Soldiers had high expenses in their profession , but they still came out much better than the average citizen even after expenses .
The soldiers were expected to pay for much of their own equipment , rations , and clothing .
They even had to pay part of the cost of burial for their fallen from their unit .

Prices in 301 AD in the Roman Empire
All data based on Diocletians  Edict of Maximum Prices  issued in 301 AD
The Edict of Maximum Prices was an attempt to control runaway inflation and poverty in the Empire .
The penalty for exceeding the prices of the Edict was severe : death .
Not satisfied to execute just the seller , Diocletian decreed that the buyer was to be executed as well .
As a final measure , if a seller refused to sell his goods at the stated price , the penalty was death .

Late in the afternoon on Good Friday , in a cold , steady rain , a gray - haired 60 - year - old woman sat shivering and praying on a stone step outside of 1016 Fairfield St. , which is where the terrible shooting had occurred .
She read from a prayer book and from time to time would take a drag on a soggy Newport cigarette .
A candle flickered beside her as she prayed .
Police officers in a squad car a half - block away were keeping a close eye on the woman and the house with the boarded - up windows behind her .
Reluctant to talk at first , the woman eventually whispered , “ I ’m the grandmother of the kid that killed those cops . ”
She said her name was Catherine Scott and that she was praying for her grandson , Richard Poplawski , who is 22 and being held in the Allegheny County Jail , and for the three officers he is accused of gunning down : Stephen Mayhle , who was 29 ; Paul Sciullo II , 37 ; and Eric Kelly , 41 .
The officers were killed a week and a half ago as they responded to a disturbance at the house .
Police said they were met there by Poplawski , who was wearing a bulletproof vest and was armed with a variety of weapons , including an AK - 47 assault rifle .
( CNN ) --
There had been no confirmed deaths in the United States related to swine flu as of Tuesday afternoon .
But another virus had killed thousands of people since January and is expected to keep killing hundreds of people every week for the rest of the year .
People are nervous about swine flu , but the regular flu kills 36,000 people a year in the United States .
That one ?
The regular flu .
An outbreak of swine flu that is suspected in more than 150 deaths in Mexico and has sickened dozens of people in the United States and elsewhere has grabbed the attention of a nervous public and of medical officials worried the strain will continue to mutate and spread .
Experts are nervous that , as a new strain , the swine flu will be harder to stop because there are n't any vaccines to fight it .
But even if there are swine - flu deaths outside Mexico -- and medical experts say there very well may be -- the virus would have a long way to go to match the roughly 36,000 deaths that seasonal influenza causes in the United States each year .
" That happens on an annual basis , " Dr. Brian Currie said Tuesday .
Currie is vice president and medical director at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx , New York .
Do n't Miss CDC flu report
CDC flu report Mexico closes public places to prevent swine flu spread
Since January , more than 13,000 people have died of complications from seasonal flu , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's weekly report on the causes of death in the nation .
No fewer than 800 flu - related deaths were reported in any week between January 1 and April 18 , the most recent week for which figures were available .
The report looks at deaths in the 122 largest cities in the United States .
Worldwide , the annual death toll from the flu is estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000 .
About 9 out of 10 of those deaths are among people older than 65 , Currie said .
Most times , they already have health problems that the flu makes worse , he said .
" Regular influenza can be taxing , " he said .
" It causes their underlying disease to decompensate and then they do n't have the reserves to get through it .
" While it may not be the direct cause listed on the death certificate , it certainly contributed . "
One of the reasons medical experts are nervous about the swine flu outbreak is that many of the people who have died in Mexico have been young and otherwise healthy .
The strains found in the United States have so far been weaker .
But even the regular flu is sometimes fatal for younger victims .
" It 's not unheard of .
It happens , either directly from influenza or they get a bacterial superinfection " like staph , said Currie .
While researchers have n't developed a vaccine to fight the new swine flu , it can be treated with antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza , the same drugs used on the regular flu .
Many times , seasonal flu itself is tough to prevent because it has mutated to a form different than it was when the vaccine was made .
Seeking to put the swine flu outbreak in perspective Tuesday , Los Angeles County public health officer Dr. Jonathan Fielding echoed other public officials calling it " cause for concern , but not for alarm . "
" Given the size of L.A. County , given the traffic between here and Mexico , it would be very surprising if we did n't have any cases , " Fielding said .
He said the county , where the CDC had confirmed 10 cases of swine flu by Tuesday , sees more than 1,000 flu - related deaths every year .
" So it would also not be surprising if there were deaths with swine flu -- even if it had the pattern of seasonal flu , " he said .
" Thus far , the pattern we see in the United States is very similar to that of seasonal flu -- relatively mild to moderate cases . "
CNN 's Samira Simone and KC Wildmoon contributed to this report .

The PlayStation is , at the moment , the most popular piece of gaming hardware in the world .
After selling more than 136 million pieces of hardware around the world , the PS2 recently saw its price drop to $ 99.99 in North America , that magical sub -$ 100 price point that makes the system so palatable for gamers on a budget .
In fact , Sony is the only major console maker that is still interested in ( and profiting from ) its last - generation hardware .
Ars caught up with John Koller , Director of Hardware Marketing for Sony Computer Entertainment America , to talk about the system that refuses to die .
A changing audience
While some core gamers may still have PS2s in their entertainment centers , the demographic for the system has changed .
" At this stage of its lifecycle , the primary audience centers on casual and social gamers , skewing more towards families who want to play as a family , and individuals who enjoy PlayStation 2 for its wide variety of games and its capabilities as a DVD and CD player , " Koller told Ars .
" From a pure gaming perspective , the PlayStation 2 provides a ton of value to those who want a gaming system that feeds into family night or other social activities , considering the low cost of entry for the hardware as well as for the games themselves . "
PS2 sales are also important because they get gamers comfortable and happy with the Sony name and then when they 're ready — it 's time for a PS3 .
That 's the theory , at least .
" We 've found that almost 80 percent of PlayStation 3 owners either currently own or have in the past owned a PlayStation 2 , so that statistic on its own speaks volumes , " Koller said .
" One could argue that there 's no richer source of PS3 purchasers than the 50 million PlayStation 2 owner base , and we 're engaging those PlayStation 2 owners as they get ready to jump into next - gen with PS3 . "
There 's also the God of War effect : the best PlayStation properties will be continued on the PS3 , giving people a strong reason to buy the newer system to keep up with their favorite characters .
" Many of the most loved PlayStation 2 franchises are now migrating to PlayStation 3 , which we 've found to be a significant driver of PS3 purchases , " Koller said .
" We view the migration of the PlayStation 2 consumer to PlayStation 3 as paramount to the success of that platform , and have absolute confidence that that transition will occur . "
Salivation over God of War 3 is not rare these days , and it seems many are waiting for that game to upgrade into the newer system .
But there 's a problem : retailers like GameStop are flush with used PS2 hardware , and they are aggressively pushing the higher - margin used systems over Sony 's $ 100 new units .
Koller downplays this challenge , noting that there 's nothing like that new - console smell .
" The secondary market is a challenge to all console manufacturers , " he told Ars when asked about used sales .
" Certainly there are quite a few used PlayStation 2's out in the market .
However , we think the secondary market will be less of a concern now that PlayStation 2 is $ 99 .
Generally speaking , consumers prefer ' new , works for sure ' , over 'used , hope this works like I want it to '— and the price point makes this decision even easier . "
What 's impressive is that we 're talking about the PS2 at all at this point in its life , but the numbers do n't lie : this is a system that people still want .
" We 're almost nine years into its 10 - year lifecycle , but I really do n't see an end date in sight for the PlayStation 2 , because the consumer demand is still there and developers are continuing to support the platform with new games , " Koller said .
" We 've always said that the only way that the PlayStation 2 stops selling is if we stop supporting it . "
A crossroads of maestros and tyros , the venerable Joseph Patelson Music House in Manhattan has been like a living room for the classical music world .
For more than six decades its shelves bulged with the fruit of Mozart and Bach , Stravinsky and Strauss , to be plucked by shoppers who wore its wooden floors black and sought counsel from expert and sometimes cantankerous sales clerks .
Yes , you know it is coming : Goodbye , Patelson’s .
Marsha Patelson , the daughter - in - law of the founder , said she planned to close the store and sell its home , an 1879 carriage house that sits a baton ’s throw across 56th Street from the Carnegie Hall stage door .
It is falling victim to a transfigured world , in which the power of digital retail has made places like used bookshops , record stores and sheet - music dealers little more than quaint relics .
Nowadays numerous
Web sites offer sheet music for sale , either by mail or download .
Publishers like G. Schirmer sell directly online .
Other sites provide free downloads for works in the public domain .
Reinstituting Glass - Steagall : the only way to fix financial markets
Obama was absolutely right when he said , on September 16th ( 2008 ) , that modern markets have completely failed not just for the last 8 years but for most of the last 28 — whenever Republicans were in charge , and a fair bit when Democrats were in charge .
Ordinary people have n’t had a raise in nearly 30 years .
Which leads to the question : why is Obama now letting Geithner , Summers and Bernanke spend trillions to reboot a fundamentally flawed market , one based on securitization and leverage ?
I simply , completely and utterly fail to see what is so wonderful about the process of securitization or why the government should reboot a market which still includes it as a fundamental feature .
What securitization does is take the risk and spread it from the people who might be able to understand it and control it ( the people actually issuing the mortgages , for example ) to a ton of people who could not possibly know the risk even if they wanted to .
Yes , it allows you to create more financial products .
Yes , it reduces the cost of capital somewhat .
But are we really better off because of securitization ?
— Of course we are n’t .
Without securitization this current market meltdown would have been a heck of a lot milder .
Ratings agency reform is not the solution : ratings agencies completely fell down on the job , and even if incentives were changed they are still not in a position to know whether a mortgage from Mr. Smith is legitimate .
Are they going to visit the property ?
Talk to Mr. Smith ?
Call his employer ?
Of course not , they can ’t .
The only people who can are the people who issued the original mortgage .
Nor should risk be transferred much if at all .
Risk must stay with the people who issue the mortgage .
If they know it will be off their books they wo n’t do proper due diligence , and no one else can do it .
At most , risk should be transferred once and must be transferred in whole and understandable form .
In contrast , the current system takes multiple different incomes steams ( say 20 or more ) , melds them together , chops them into tranches , and sells them to people who really have no idea what they ’re buying — with middlemen at every step booking profits and washing their hands of responsibility .
Risk must be assumed only by people who can understand it and manage it and who are exposed to the consequences of their decisions .
In other words , risk must be assumed by people with the ability to manage that risk , who know that if they fail then they will pay the price themselves .
It is necessary for the Fed to basically regulate everyone , with the SEC occasionally peeping over it ’s shoulder to see whether market manipulation is occurring .
This is necessary because there are , as Obama points out , no longer clear cut differences between banks , insurance companies , investment banks , brokerages and so on .
The repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act put an end to those differences .
Glass - Steagall , remember , was put in place during the Great Depression to stop another Great Depression from occurring .
People who lived through the 1920 ’s believed that one of the causes of the the Great Depression was not having clear - cut boundaries between the businesses , meaning risk was not divided appropriately and companies became “ too large to fail ” .
The Glass - Steagall Act was passed in 1933 to mandate separating bank types according to their business ( commercial and investment banking ) , thereby preventing the formation of banking conglomerates , and also founded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) for insuring bank deposits .
But somehow we think we know better today than the people who lived through the last Great Depression , the people who lived through the 1920 ’s and the last great market crackup .
So we ’ve repealed most of Glass - Steagall and allowed everyone to be in everyone else ’s pockets , allowed huge financial conglomerates to mushroom into monstrosities , and allowed unregulated “ innovative ” financial “ products ” like collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) to grow into such huge bubbles that financial markets were huge multiples of the entire real world economy .
Then it all comes crashing down and people claim to be surprised .
Enough , already .
Yes , the world is not exactly the same as it was in the 1920 ’s and 1930 ’s , but we did n’t start having these disasters till after Glass - Steagall and other Depression - era securities laws started getting repealed .
The first set were repealed in the 1980 ’s , followed by most of the remainder in 1999 ( e.g. , Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act , 1980 ; Garn - St. Germain Depository Institutions Act , 1982 ; Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , 1999 ) .
It ’s time to reinstate the financial reforms of the 1930 ’s that worked :
Force financial conglomerates to cut themselves up and divide back into brokerage houses , investment banks , retail banks , and insurance companies .
Put finance companies under the clear control of regulators .
Reinstitute Glass - Steagall , with very mild modernization .
Get rid of most complex derivatives , excessive leverage , the carry trade , etc .
Obama was right : the philosophy of the past 28 years has been a failure .
Let ’s treat it a failure then , and re-institute what worked , re-regulate , then slowly modify from there , with complete transparency and strong regulation .
Financial markets exist to serve ordinary Americans and non-financial American businesses .
They have n’t been doing that properly .
It is time to make sure that they do .

A Bonding Experience : NASA Strengthens Welds
Conventional wisdom says little things strengthen relationships .
NASA knows the same is true for welding .
Admit it .
You may not have been " wowed " when you read " welding . "
But what if welding could make your next car safer , more fuel efficient and more affordable ?
If that fires your interest , then you might want to read further .
Traditional or fusion welding involves blowtorches , solder and all the tools of the trade .
Now imagine a different welding process that joins materials with no blowtorch , no solder , no sparks , no smoke , no ozone and no radiation .
Instead , it uses friction to heat materials and then " stir " them together at a molecular level .
It may sound like science fiction -- but actually , it 's closer to " science friction .
"
NASA technology has refined a unique process known as friction stir welding , founded by The Welding Institute in Great Britain .
It 's been used since the 1990's to help make the space shuttle 's external tanks safer and more reliable .
Friction stir welding happens something like this .
Two pieces of material are clamped firmly together , then a rapidly spinning pin -- that 's 300 revolutions a minute -- is forced between the materials at pressures up to 10,000 pounds per square inch .
Just as your hands warm when you rub them together , the interaction between the pin and the material edges creates friction energy on a much larger scale .
The friction heats the material edges to a soft state called plasticity , which starts to happen around 800 degrees ( F ) for most material .
The friction energy is carefully controlled not to exceed the point of turning the material to a liquid -- about 1,200 degrees ( F ) in most cases .
Once the materials are softened the friction stir tool pushes the edges together , allowing them to bond at a molecular level .
When it cools , the welded seam is as strong as the original material -- because it IS the original material .
No solder or filler are ever used in the process .
Like relationships , " little things " matter in welding .
In the original friction stir process , withdrawing the rotating pin left a small opening known as a keyhole .
The tiny keyhole created a potential weakness in the weld , and it also added an extra step to fill the hole during manufacturing .
Engineers at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center developed an innovative pin tool for use in friction stir welding .
The pin retracts automatically when a weld is complete and prevents a keyhole .
This improvement makes the weld stronger and eliminates the need for patching .
The retracting pin also allows materials of different thicknesses and types to be joined together , increasing the manufacturing possibilities .
The NASA - developed pin tool has helped friction stir welding advance within many other industries besides aerospace .
It 's used to build panels for cruise chips and the walls and ceilings of railroad cars .
It bonds the wings and fuselages to some business jets .
It strengthens car decks on ferries , and it even improves radioactive waste containers .
Fiction stir welding also has the advantage of being friendlier to both people and the environment .
The lack of smoke , fumes and sparks creates better working conditions , and the lack of emissions reduces wear - and - tear on planet Earth .
Back to those improvements that might show up in your next car .
Friction stir welding can create braking and steering systems that are stronger and more precise , increasing safety .
It improves the performance and design for those all - important wheel rims .
It also permits greater use of lighter materials like aluminum .
Less weight increases both fuel efficiency and handling ability , so you can love your zippy new sports car even more .
Now that 's a REAL bonding experience .
Prince Edward Island ( PEI ) may only be 224 km long and 6 - 64 km wide , but it is still a must see place for many people from all over the world .
It ’s capital , Charlottetown , is known as the birthplace of Canada where leaders met back in 1864 to discuss the formation of Canada .
The Island is alive with music and festivals all summer long making it a must see destination .
The crescent shape of the island is perfect for a leisurely drive around the island .
The Island is known for it ’s rich red soil which is formed from sedimentary bed rock of soft , red sandstone .
Prince Edward Island has over 90 beaches with reddish sand , sand dunes and red sandstone cliffs which create the perfect background for swimming and boating .
The Northern beaches are known as a haven for windsurfers , birdwatchers and beach - combers while The Southern beaches are known for their warm waters for swimming .
There are three ways to get to PEI .
You could always fly , but most people prefer to arrive by either going across the Confederation Bridge or by Ferry ( or vice versa ) .
The Confederation Bridge , which was opened in 1997 , joins the Provinces of New Brunswick and PEI .
It is the longest bridge in the world over ice - covered water and is almost 13 km long and takes 12 minutes to drive across .
It was built to withstand the harsh weather conditions , including ice floes , of Canadian winters and is seen as an engineering marvel .
You only pay on departure from the Island , or as many Islanders like to say , “ If you decide to leave ” .
One of the reasons that over 350,000 visitors from all around the world come to visit PEI on a yearly basis , is because of the beloved novel “ Anne of Green Gables “ .
Anne of Green Gables is actually a series of books that tells the story of a red - haired orphan girl that is mistakenly sent to a couple that wanted a boy .
It has been made into movies for both the big screen as well as the small screen as well as several TV series , including an animated one .
2008 marked the 100th Anniversary of the publication .
The books have been translated into 15 different languages and have sold more than 50 million copies .
The “ Green Gable House ” as well as several museums and sites mentioned in the books , are must see destinations for any Anne of Green Gable fan .
While you ’re there , do n’t forget to take in the theatrical performance of “ Anne of Green Gables ” which runs every summer at the Charlottetown Festival .
Prince Edward Island has a lot to offer for anyone regardless of how old or young they may be .
It is a perfect tourist destination for the whole family as well as a beautiful relaxing vacation / honeymoon stop .
You can enjoy the festivals or just go for a quiet walk on the beach if you like .
Prince Edward Island is a place that you should visit if you ever have the chance to .

Star Wars has so many different collectibles and figures for their millions of different characters , so it is really refreshing to see a Matryoshka doll set that not only looks amazing but could stand up proud .
This hand painted Matryoshka doll set was created by Matt Brown as a Christmas gift for his brother .
As he mentioned , it was n’t an easy task , but the results as you can see are very much fulfilling .
From His Blog :
I bought a set of blank Matryoshka dolls online and painted them with acrylic .
It took several evenings to finish , whilst watching the original trilogy .
There was quite a bit of cursing here and there , and the hair - drier came in very handy , but I think it turned out fairly well .
With the sizes varying from a six inch Darth Vader doll to a 1 inch Yoda , the set stores inside one another as should , and is definitely something Star Wars fans would drool for .
When asked about some personal feedback about such a project , Matt added :
Well , my brother loves them – which made all the fretting worthwhile .
And since posting it on my blog I ’ve actually had a few requests to do private commissions on other themes .
It ’s brought people to my site that otherwise would n’t have seen it .
One was a band wanting me to do some work for their next album cover , after seeing the dolls – which is fantastic .
For other great collectibles and art of the series , check out the gadget collection of Star Wars charcters or even the Disney Star Wars figures .
Well Done Matt !
Thank you for the images and taking time to talk .
Satellites Show Arctic Literally on Thin Ice
The latest Arctic sea ice data from NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center show that the decade - long trend of shrinking sea ice cover is continuing .
New evidence from satellite observations also shows that the ice cap is thinning as well .
Arctic sea ice works like an air conditioner for the global climate system .
Ice naturally cools air and water masses , plays a key role in ocean circulation , and reflects solar radiation back into space .
In recent years , Arctic sea ice has been declining at a surprising rate .
Scientists who track Arctic sea ice cover from space announced today that this winter had the fifth lowest maximum ice extent on record .
The six lowest maximum events since satellite monitoring began in 1979 have all occurred in the past six years ( 2004 -2009 ) .
Until recently , the majority of Arctic sea ice survived at least one summer and often several .
But things have changed dramatically , according to a team of University of Colorado , Boulder , scientists led by Charles Fowler .
Thin seasonal ice -- ice that melts and re-freezes every year -- makes up about 70 percent of the Arctic sea ice in wintertime , up from 40 to 50 percent in the 1980s and 1990s .
Thicker ice , which survives two or more years , now comprises just 10 percent of wintertime ice cover , down from 30 to 40 percent .
According to researchers from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo. , the maximum sea ice extent for 2008 - 09 , reached on Feb. 28 , was 5.85 million square miles .
That is 278,000 square miles less than the average extent for 1979 to 2000 .
" Ice extent is an important measure of the health of the Arctic , but it only gives us a two - dimensional view of the ice cover , " said Walter Meier , research scientist at the center and the University of Colorado , Boulder .
" Thickness is important , especially in the winter , because it is the best overall indicator of the health of the ice cover .
As the ice cover in the Arctic grows thinner , it grows more vulnerable to melting in the summer .
" The Arctic ice cap grows each winter as the sun sets for several months and intense cold sets in .
Some of that ice is naturally pushed out of the Arctic by winds , while much of it melts in place during summer .
The thicker , older ice that survives one or more summers is more likely to persist through the next summer .
Sea ice thickness has been hard to measure directly , so scientists have typically used estimates of ice age to approximate its thickness .
But last year a team of researchers led by Ron Kwok of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , produced the first map of sea ice thickness over the entire Arctic basin .
Using two years of data from NASA 's Ice , Cloud , and land Elevation Satellite ( ICESat ) , Kwok 's team estimated thickness and volume of the Arctic Ocean ice cover for 2005 and 2006 .
They found that the average winter volume of Arctic sea ice contained enough water to fill Lake Michigan and Lake Superior combined .
The older , thicker sea ice is declining and is being replaced with newer , thinner ice that is more vulnerable to summer melt , according to Kwok .
His team found that seasonal sea ice averages about 6 feet in thickness , while ice that had lasted through more than one summer averages about 9 feet , though it can grow much thicker in some locations near the coast .
Kwok is currently working to extend the ICESat estimate further , from 2003 to 2008 , to see how the recent decline in the area covered by sea ice is mirrored in changes in its volume .
" With these new data on both the area and thickness of Arctic sea ice , we will be able to better understand the sensitivity and vulnerability of the ice cover to changes in climate , " Kwok said .

For the past few days , Stephanie Miller has gotten all kinds of hate mail , including death threats ( Google it to witness the negative spin ) , because of something she said on Larry King Live about Boss Limbaugh ... as a joke .
Nobody on the panel was fazed because they realized it was said in jest , but apparently some conservative websites took it out of context and put the word out .
The relevant snippet starts at about 1:15 .
" He loves this attention , and if I could say something tonight that gets me that kind of attention , like maybe Rush Limbaugh should be executed for treason .
How about that ? "
If I could say something .. that gets me that kind of attention , like
New York Times
In her response , which was written in all capital letters , [ Ann ] Coulter called the paper the “ Treason Times ” and said that the Times ’ editors should have been “ executed for treason ” for revealing the Bush administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program :
Do you consider yourself as speaking for the conservative movement , or just someone who has attracted many conservative fans ?
Something else ?
I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL AMERICANS WHO THINK NEWSPAPER EDITORS WHO PRINT THE DETAILS OF TOP - SECRET ANTI - TERRORIST INTELLIGENCE GATHERING PROGRAMS ON PAGE ONE IN WARTIME SHOULD BE EXECUTED FOR TREASON .
... " Okay ?
Context .
Good .
Now check out this response to a question from areporter to The Madam 's Apple about her upcoming debate with Bill Maher :
Is n't she hilarious ?
See how she did that ?
The Madam's Apple threw out a snarky little quip , just like Stephanie Miller's !
The tones are absolutely identical .
Who could n't see that ?
This is n’t the first time Coulter has wished for the death of people who work for the New York Times .
In August 2002 , Coulter told the New York Observer that her “ only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building . ”
Double standard much ?
Meghan McCain was right .
And Stephanie Miller deserves a whole lot of apologies ... and perhaps a bodyguard or two .
A new , playable music chart is like a Billboard chart for the P2P generation – and you can play anything on it with a single click .
It would take an army of listeners to keep tabs on all the music being recorded and posted to MySpace , YouTube , BitTorrent and the like .
How to filter it all ?
We Are Hunted , a clean and simple music chart cuts to the chase .
It tracks the most - favored music on P2P and social networks , Twitter , web forums and blogs .
It then presents the 99 hottest tracks ( according to its calculations ) through an intuitive Brady Bunch - style interface .
Best of all , it slaps a play button on each track .
Clicking the play button starts the song playing right there on the page , using links to YouTube audio tracks , record label sites and other internet locations that the site 's automated system finds online .
Wired.com got a sneak preview , and after an hour or so of testing , it 's clear that We Are Hunted is a fantastic and simple way to hear full versions of the latest , hottest tracks .
It 's as if this chart is trying to tap into our brains to assemble a playable list of the songs we 're thinking about the most .
If you bookmark it ( or sign up for the e-mail list ) , you 'll probably stand a better chance of knowing what the kids are talking about at the next party you attend .
" In the physical world , charts are built on shipped albums , " reads the site 's description .
" Online , traditionally , they have been a count of digital downloads .
We Are Hunted is different , in that it tracks sentiment , expression and advocacy . "
BigChampagne , Elbo.ws , Hype Machine and other sites track similar information , but We Are Hunted is far simpler for consumers to use , with big play buttons in the middle of album covers and other images that scroll past in batches of nine from right to left .
It 's a preposterously easy way to hear the most talked about songs and artists of the current day , week , month or year .
" So many websites are too complex , too wordy , too long , " said
Native Digital 's Nick Crocker , one of the site 's founders .
" I wanted this site to be digestible in three seconds ... to deliver users exactly what they want — amazing , new music , every day .
There 's lots of work to do , but I think the foundations are in place . "
Not only is this site smooth and obvious in terms of how you use it , but its homegrown music popularity tracking system , based on the WotNews ' news scraping technology , appears to be fairly accurate .
Right now , the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are the hottest band on We Are Hunted ( screenshot to the right ) , which makes sense considering their rock - solid performance on the most recent Saturday Night Live .
" We do this by continuously sampling the noise from news , blogs and social media , " said Stephen Phillips , lead programmer for Wotnews .
" We monitor the mainstream press , blogs , Twitter ,
MySpace , YouTube , Last.fm , iLike , bit torrent , Limewire , and more . "
In addition , he says the site detects whether the press and people on social networks like or dislike a particular track and uses " semantics to understand who people are talking about , clustering and classification to group related artists and their noise , and network analysis to uncover the connections between artists and the people who write about them . "
A few slight nitpicks :
The only Buy links on We Are Hunted go to the iTunes music store , and in a couple of cases , it played live or remixed versions rather than studio versions of songs .
Also , if the site gets popular , it could swamp some of the servers upon which its system relies .
Regardless , We Are Hunted is getting saved in my FireFox toolbar .
The site has already introduced me to a slew of great new music in the brief time I 've been testing it .
The site is a collaboration between Wotnews and Native Digital – the same firm that helped develop the first major label music blog in the world .
The founders plan to eventually include advertising , but Wotnews general manager Richard Slatter says the more interesting opportunity is for " organizations with an interest in music to engage in the right way with the conversation and to monitor what activity is occurring . "

Mexico ’s Ambassador to the U.S. Arturo Sarukhan was on CBS ’s Face the Nation on Sunday , where he urged President Obama to reinstate the assault weapons ban due to the increased violence along the U.S. / Mexico border .
This issue is certain to come up in the meeting between the two presidents next week .
Here is the video :

Ambassador Sarukhan restated the Mexican government ’s claim that 90 % of the weapons are coming from the U.S. , “ Ninety percent of all weapons we are seizing in Mexico , Bob , are coming from across the United States , ” he said , citing the high number of Federal firearms licenses a few miles north of the border .
“ Just on the Arizona and Texas borders with Mexico alone there are approximately 7,000 FFLs , federal firearms licensees .
And weapons bought by the drug syndicates , directly or proxy purchases , are coming from those gun shops . ”
He also claimed that there is a direct connection between the increase in assault weapons in Mexico and the lifting of the ban in 2004 , “ The assault weapons ban ran out in 2004 , Bob , ” he said , “ and since then we have seen a rise of assault weapons being seized in Mexico .
There is a direct correlation between the expiration of the assault weapons ban and our seizures of assault weapons . ”
Host Bob Schieffer pointed out that the NRA disputes the Mexican government ’s statistics , and when pressed , Sarukhan could not clearly explain where his government is getting their data .
Obama has already made it clear that his administration will not be bringing back the ban .
The sense is that there is no need for him or Congress to wade into this issue , when many Congressional Democrats are against the ban .
In addition , Democrats do not want to give Republicans an issue to run on in the 2010 midterm election .
The administration wo n’t be reinstating the ban .
If both the U.S. and Mexican governments want to stop the illegal flow of weapons , the ban is far from the best option .
Why wo n’t each government hire more agents to work along the border to stop the flow of weapons ?
In a down economy , the administration could create thousands of new jobs this way .
Instead of shifting agents around the border , hire more , for the express purpose of halting weapons smuggling into Mexico .
However , the Mexicans cannot solely pass the political blame on to the U.S. Mexico needs to do their part .
An assault weapons ban will not reduce the violence along the border .
The ban would only serve to create political problems for Obama at home .
How do kids these days get started in programming ?
Back in the 80's , when I was growing up , all personal computers would come with a BASIC interpreter which you could use to write your own software .
As a matter of fact , it was expected for end users to write their own applications .
My very first personal computer was an Atari 800 , I was in my early teens when I got it , it was a hand me down from my uncle , who had gotten himself a shiny new IBM PC .
During that time , computer magazines came with games and applications in source code form that you had to type into your computer in order to " install " them .
A lot of us did n't know exactly what all these lines of code meant , but we wanted the game or application so we typed away , unfortunately typos were an issue , since we were just blindly copying what seemed like greek into our BASIC prompt .
Fortunately BASIC was interpreted , so it would catch syntax errors immediately , but many times the syntax was correct , but there was still a typo in the line , making the program not run as expected .
It could be frustrating at times , but it was very satisfying to finally get the code to work exactly right .
You could also experiment and make little changes here and there to see if you could change the behavior of the software .
I remember eagerly waiting for the next issue of A.N.A.L.O.G magazine to arrive in the mail every month to see what goodies it would bring .
It is worth mentioning that at this time there was n't yet a dominant computer architecture for personal computers .
Some of us had Ataris ( 8 bit and / or ST ) , others had Commodores ( PET , Commodore 64 or 128 , Amiga ) , others had IBM PCs , other architectures existed as well .
What all of these architectures had in common was that they all came with a BASIC interpreter .
As a matter of fact , in most cases , the machine would boot directly into a BASIC prompt .
The BASIC versions of the machines were not 100 % compatible across one another , since vendors modified them to highlight specific features of their own products , but in general your BASIC skills could be used across architectures .
I remember been amazed at the wonderful things you could make these machines do , it got me really motivated to learn to write my own software , not simply blindly typing code listings from magazines .
A lot of software developers from that era got our start that way , at the time , the barrier of entry for software development was very low .
I derived a lot of satisfaction in creating software , I would proudly show my creations to my friends and relatives .
All of these got me motivated to pursue a career in software development , which is what motivated me to major in computer science when I went to college .
Somewhere in the 90's most of these various architectures disappeared , and the one true personal computer platform emerged , the IBM PC , or what we simply call a PC today .
Just like all the platforms of the time , the IBM PC came with a BASIC interpreter , but unlike the others , BASIC was n't built into the operating system , it was something you had to look for if you wanted to use it .
When the PC became the de facto standard , the focus of having end users as programmers started to decline .
Magazines stopped coming with BASIC listings for you to type in .
When DOS 6.0 came out , PCs even stopped coming with a BASIC interpreter altogether .
Now if you wanted to develop software , you had to install a compiler or interpreter yourself , which , sadly , is still the case today .
So I wonder , how do new generations of software developers get their start ?
It is not as easy to " get your feet wet " these days like it was back in the day .
I wonder if they pick computer science without knowing exactly what they are getting into ?
It 's a shame that software development is not as accessible as it once was .
To hear some tell it , file sharing gutted the music industry by encouraging people to gorge themselves on free , illegal content .
Indeed , unless Friday 's landmark verdict against The Pirate Bay is overturned , four Swedes will spend a year in jail and owe millions of dollars to entertainment companies for operating a file sharing network .
Nonetheless , sites like The Pirate Bay taught — and continue to teach — valuable lessons to the content industry .
Even as music labels and movie studios try to sue peer - to - peer networks out of existence , these same networks have been preparing music labels and movie studios for the emerging social - media world , in which sales form only a small slice of the revenue pie , and what really matters is who likes what , and who pays attention to them .
Facebook , MySpace , imeem , YouTube and other social media sites — which the labels now recognize as a major part of their revenue streams going forward — incorporate several aspects of Napster and other early , rogue file sharing networks : buddy lists , user uploads , filtering content by user , viral marketing , ad - supported content and the potential of mining valuable data .
The complete DNA of social media was right there , from the very start of P2P .
And even in the early days , the labels were intrigued by the vast pools of user data available on networks like Napster and Kazaa , although they were reticent to take advantage of it .
" It was more than just stigmatized , " recalled Eric Garland , CEO of BigChampagne , which measures the popularity of media on file sharing networks .
" They feared that to even look at or inquire about what was happening in the file sharing universe would somehow compromise their unflinching stance that this was unauthorized . "
But as the initial furor over P2P died down , labels began monitoring file sharing networks through BigChampagne and other services .
The data they find there continues to help them in any number of ways , from choosing which leaked song to use as the single , to where a band should tour based on the IP addresses of its fans , to figuring out which artists should perform on the same bill .
The labels beat down Napster , Kazaa , Scour and other P2P networks , and if today 's Pirate Bay verdict stands , they will have beaten four Swedes too .
Meanwhile , new ways to share files continue to surface , including private and encrypted networks .
And The Pirate Bay developers say mirrors exist in other countries , so no matter what happens in Sweden their site will continue to operate .
Besides ,
The Pirate Bay is only one bit - torrent tracker site .
For some , the offense committed by an enabler like The Pirate Bay —
as opposed to the people who actually do upload and share copyright material — may be difficult to grasp .
You can also find torrents on several other sites — even on Google 's search engine .
And YouTube hosts pirated copyright material , until and unless it is asked to remove it by the owner , because it is unable to programmatically detect which video clips are pirated .
But the difference is that Google , Yahoo and MSN aspire to catalog everything indiscriminately , while services like The Pirate Bay explicitly cater to practitioners of digital piracy — and are proud of it , to boot .
Even as the content industry celebrates another false victory over file sharing , the world is moving on , to cloud - based , on - demand streaming services — some licensed — where you can hear music and watch videos faster and in a more social way than you can with bit torrent .
And as content holders look to monetize those networks , P2P networks provide the only useful template , because they share so many characteristics with today 's social - media networks .
Garland , who was there , says tools designed to measure user behavior on file sharing networks led directly to tools that now mine licensed networks like Facebook , imeem , MySpace and YouTube .
When it comes to " where and how people stream , download , watch , listen to , blog about or otherwise make use of or interact with music , "
said Garland , " file sharing ended up being the blueprint . "
And it 's a good thing that blueprint was there , from the labels ' and studios ' perspectives , because today 's social - media networks contain even more user data than P2P networks do , and that translates to a bigger opportunity to monetize them through advertising , recommendations and , yes , the occasional sale .
In addition to teaching them how to mine social networks for user data , file sharing taught the content industry that it 's often more efficient to address networks than users .
On one hand , this sort of thinking led to The Pirate Bay lawsuit .
On the other , we have Choruss , Warner Music Group adviser and digital music guru Jim Griffin 's plan to license universities , then ISPs , to allow subscribers to download and upload as much music as they want for an overall , royalty - like fee .
" Asserting property rights and attempts at control have cost the sound recording industry over a decade of licensing revenue [ and trading ] control for compensation , " said Griffin during his Digital
Music Forum Eastkeynote .
" Monetizing friction - free access to music will require swinging to the next vine , and when we make that transition we 'll uncover a bigger music service business that 's been too - long trapped in the too - small body of an old product - based business of control . "
The Choruss plan and the RIAA 's officialshift away from suing individuals are acknowledgments on the part of the music industry that file sharing will always be a factor , so it could be simpler — and even beneficial — to lump licensed and unlicensed services together under one monthly fee tacked onto users ' ISP bills .
( ESPN and other video networks already do something similar . )
Love Choruss or hate it , Griffin would never have come up with this efficient way of addressing social - media consumption if file sharing networks had never existed .
Finally , P2P accelerated the development of products that people want to purchase when free alternatives exist .
Whether music sales are competing with The Pirate Bay or imeem , the answer is the same :
Sell ads against free content , and try to sell people something they can't access through the free alternative , be it bonus materials , instant access , concert tickets or whatever .
Witness Radiohead 's infamous deluxe box set , the recently launched iTunes pass ( essentially an album subscription ) , Josh Freese 's crazy album extras , or iPhone apps that deliver an artist 's latest creations in near - real time .
File sharing networks forced an industry notoriously set in its ways to acknowledge the enormous power of the internet to distribute music through social channels —
if anything , increasing its odds of thriving during the inevitable social - media era .
Lawsuits like this one against The Pirate Bay make sense on the surface .
On another level , they 're a funny way of saying , " Thanks . "

Daifallah defended himself in court
A chemist who contaminated food and wine in Gloucestershire supermarkets with his own urine and faeces has been sent to prison for nine years .
Sahnoun Daifallah , 42 , of Bibury Road , Gloucester , was found guilty of four counts of contaminating goods at four businesses in May 2008 .
Judge Carol Hagen said at the hearing in March that she found him to be " a potentially very dangerous man " .
Daifallah , who defended himself , had pleaded not guilty to all charges .
Bristol Crown Court had heard the Algerian - born chemist sprayed the mixture in the Air Balloon Pub , in Birdlip , near Cheltenham on 14 and 16 May .
Deportation proceedings
He then moved on to the Waterstones bookstore in Cirencester , Tesco in Quedgley and Morrisons in Abbeydale .
Your actions showed a callous disregard for public safety
Judge Carol Hagen
The court heard shoppers and staff in both stores saw Daifallah with a black laptop computer with a vapour coming from the bag being sprayed on the shelves .
The cost of damaged products and lost business due to resulting store closures was estimated at £ 700,000 .
When police searched his house they found stockpiles of the mixture and plans to spread it in other cities including Bristol and Birmingham .
Daifallah , who had fantasies about biological weapons to cause public alarm , was also found guilty of having an offensive weapon , namely a catapult with marbles .
Judge Carol Hagen sentenced him to concurrent sentences of three years , five years and two of nine years for the contamination offences and 12 months for possession of a weapon .
She added she had wanted to jail him indefinitely but the law would not allow her to .
" Your actions showed a callous disregard for public safety and you caused considerable alarm and anxiety , " she said .
Proceedings to deport him are underway .
SEATTLE , Washington ( CNN ) --
Predicting the path of a swine flu outbreak is next to impossible , public health officials say .
But Dr. Ira Longini has spent more than three decades trying to do just that .
Dr. Ira Longini studies simulations of hypothetical influenzas and how they would spread .
more photos »
And Longini says the apparent new strain of swine flu appears to be here to stay .
" We are probably going to have to live with this virus for some time , " he told CNN .
Longini specializes in the mathematical and statistical theory of epidemics .
He works at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute at the Hutchinson Research Center in Seattle , Washington .
The researcher studies simulations of hypothetical influenzas and how they would spread across the United States .
For the moment , he said , there is not enough information about the swine flu that has sickened hundreds in Mexico and about 50 people in the United States to accurately forecast how the disease will travel .
But Longini 's simulations of a fictional killer flu that were ordered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) show the importance of steps health officials can take to prevent further spread of the virus .
These measures include " social distancing , " or encouraging those sickened with the flu to stay home or seek medical treatment ; closing places where groups of people gather ; and making anti-flu medications available to large portions of the population .
In the simulations , Longini said , these forms of containment reduce the sickness by nearly two - thirds .
" The name of the game is to slow transmission until a well - matched vaccine can be made and distributed .
I am fairly optimistic we can do that , " he said .
Watch how computer models simulate an outbreak 's spread »
So far , Longini said , it appears that everyone sickened by swine flu in the United States contracted the disease while traveling in Mexico , the apparent epicenter of the outbreak .
But he cautioned : " That could change very fast .
Obviously people in these communities could also get on airplanes and go other places or get on buses or cars or trucks and move around .
The picture may change very rapidly .
Basically , influenza is going to go where people go . "
Health officials agree that the worst may still be yet to come .
" It is too soon for us to say what the spectrum is , " Dr. Richard Besser , the acting director of the CDC , said Monday on Larry King Live .
" We are going to see cases in this country that are more severe , individuals who are hospitalized , and I would not be surprised if we see deaths in this country . "
Longini said health officials are doing everything they can to mitigate how widely the swine flu spreads in the United States .
Even if authorities examined everyone entering the country , Longini said , it would not solve the problem .
" Through simulations and mathematical work we 've shown that travel restrictions -- although potentially useful in slowing spread [ of swine flu ] -- they are not going to stop it , " Longini said .
" We can screen airline passengers , but there all those asymptomatic or incubating people we would miss .
So you really have to deal with these outbreaks locally , everywhere they are occurring . "
Watch how countries are scanning travelers »
Longini said he hopes that as more data come in about the outbreak , it will help to answer questions researchers have about why the swine flu appears more deadly in the Mexico cases than the ones in the United States .
Researchers also hope to find out why such a large percentage of fatalities in Mexico are young people whose healthy immune systems usually protect them from the flu .
But there is good news , Longini said , at least temporarily , for populations in certain areas .
In North America and Europe , summer will soon begin , ending the traditional flu season .
Even outbreaks such as swine flu tend to follow standard flu season patterns , he said .
Other parts of the world may not be so lucky .
" Timing is terrible for people in the Southern Hemisphere -- places like New Zealand , Australia , South Africa , parts of South America , " Longini said .
" They are just coming into their flu season . "

A close study has shown that opening the doors to iPhones at large - scale business has not only made workers happier but has often saved money over competing smartphones in the process .
In a report issued last week , Ted Schadler of Forrester Research has presented an about - face for the research group 's attitude towards iPhones that recommends businesses consider the devices for their network and that many users are genuinely more interested in accessing work content on an iPhone than on corporate mainstays using Microsoft or Research in Motion software .
Using the web is a " chore " on a BlackBerry but intuitive on an iPhone , Schadler writes , and many workers are ultimately happier when they can pick their phones instead of having that choice dictated by IT .
Where Forrester had previously warned companies to avoid iPhones when possible due to the high phone prices and lack of security , it now says that many of these legacy worries have been softened significantly in the wake of Apple 's iPhone 2.x firmware and uses Amylin Pharmaceutical , Kraft Foods , and Oracle as examples of how permitting the phones ultimately helped their respective bottom lines .
Amylin 's senior IT director Todd Stewart describes iPhones as being easier to support than " other mobile platforms " and that iPhone 2.0's hooks for Exchange calendaring and e-mail meant it only took three days to ready the 3,000 - person firm to support iPhones .
The relative strength of mobile Safari and the e-mail client has led many to treat their systems more like netbooks than mobile devices .
On a pure cost basis , the phones themselves are less expensive to run : their combined plans save about $ 360 per year , per phone .
Stewart adds that individual ownership of devices , instead of handing them out from a corporate pool , has also trimmed costs by persuading workers they should be more careful with their smartphones .
" If an employee owns his own device , the phone tends to hit the pavement a lot less , " he says .
Kraft , meanwhile , emphasizes that the iPhone was brought in to support a " culture change " at the company and that many of those using iPhones are happier than they were before they switched .
It pushes the company at large to use newer technology and has been cutting costs by letting iPhone owners get their own support rather than depend on the company alone for help .
" Overall they provide better support than we can , " one person from the company 's IT management says .
Oracle sees the iPhone 's software development base as a way of rendering its business tools mobile and sees the smartphone as offering possibilities that were n't there before .
The company plans to develop apps for customer relations management and other key aspects of its business , and at the iPhone 3.0 SDK event demonstrated some of these apps in advance of their release .
Some problems still remain and range from hardware to purely administrative issues .
Besides the sometimes short battery life , calendar sync and VPN auto - login are n't fully in place .
Management tools to control the phones ' security are still relatively scarce , and features that are for now taken for granted in veteran mobile operating systems , like copy - and - paste text , are n't in place as of April .
As many businesses wo n't necessarily keep traditional company - wide accounts , it 's often necessary to move users either to individual corporate accounts or even personal accounts that are matched with official compensation .
i Phone 3.0 's release in the summer should address some of these problems , particularly CalDAV for calendars , a more automated VPN login process , and significantly tighter security policies that involve disabling built - in cameras in high - security environments as well as creating encrypted backups .
Even with the immediate hurdles , all three of the sample companies have had rapid growth or expect to in the future .
Oracle currently counts 4,000 iPhones among its total mobile base ; Kraft is adding 400 phones a month and may top 5,000 by December , while Amylin despite its size still anticipates that as many as 650 of its smartphone - equipped workers — or 75 percent — will use iPhones by the end of the year .
And notions that BlackBerries are go - to devices should fade , according to Schadler , who argues that smartphone use is no longer dominated solely by e-mail and schedules , with other functions often falling short on those phones that center too heavily on obvious corporate uses .

Medical Marijuana Passes House Civil Justice Committee Without Dissent
CONTACT : Former Rep. Chris DeLaForest ( R - Andover ) ......................................................( 763 ) 439-1178
ST .
PAUL , MINNESOTA --
The House version of Minnesota 's medical marijuana bill passed the House Civil Justice Committee this morning in a voice vote with no dissenting votes .
The vote came after powerful testimony from Joni Whiting , whose adult daughter 's suffering was relieved by medical marijuana while she was undergoing treatment for the melanoma that eventually took her life .
" It really feels like the momentum is building and this is the year we 're going to get this done , " said Sen. Steve Murphy ( DFL - Red Wing ) , sponsor of the Senate version of the bill .
" One-quarter of the country now protects medical marijuana patients from arrest , and there is simply no reason to use Minnesota 's police resources to arrest the sick for trying to relieve their suffering . "
A previous version of the bill passed the Senate and every House committee in the 2007 - 2008 session , but was never brought up for a vote on the House floor .
Thirteen states , comprising approximately one - quarter of the U.S. population , now permit medical use of marijuana under state law if a physician has recommended it .
The newest such law was enacted by Michigan voters last November , passing with a record - setting 63 percent " yes " vote .
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder reaffirmed on Feb. 25 that the Obama administration intends to pursue a policy of non-interference with these state laws .
A number of other states are considering medical marijuana legislation this year , including New Jersey , Illinois , Iowa and New Hampshire .

The Tigger Trojan : Icky , Sticky Stuff
A relatively unknown data - stealing Trojan horse program that has claimed more than a quarter - million victims in the span of a few months aptly illustrates the sophistication of modern malware and the importance of a multi- layered approach to security .
When analysts at Sterling , Va. , based security intelligence firm iDefense first spotted the trojan they call " Tigger . A " in November 2008 , none of the 37 anti-virus products they tested it against recognized it .
A month later , only one - AntiVir - detected it .
That virtual invisibility cloak , combined with a host of tricks designed to elude forensic malware examiners , allowed Tigger to quietly infect more than 250,000 Microsoft Windows systems , according to iDefense 's read of log files recovered from one of the Web servers Tigger uses to download code .
i Defense analyst Michael Ligh found that Tigger appears designed to target mainly customers or employees of stock and options trading firms .
Among the unusually short list of institutions specifically targeted by Tigger are E - Trade , ING Direct ShareBuilder , Vanguard , Options XPress , TD Ameritrade and Scottrade .
i Defense said the Trojan is the first known malware to exploit a specific vulnerability Microsoft patched in mid-October 2008 .
That flaw is what 's known as a " privilege escalation " vulnerability , in that it cannot be exploited remotely , and merely allows the attacker to gain access to the almighty " administrator " account in Windows .
That means that even if the user is running the system as I so often advise - under a limited user account that does not have permission to make changes deep within the operating system -- the presence of this unpatched vulnerability on a Windows system would let this invader override that protection .
While running Windows under a limited user account is a key step in keeping your system in its safest state , staying up - to - date on patches -- both fixes for the operating system and third - party software -- is still just as important .
I would actually rank anti-virus a distant third protection mechanism , given how poorly most anti-virus tools seem to be faring against the latest malware families .
Read on after the jump for other " fun-fun - fun - fun - fun " facts about the " T - I - Double - Guh - Er " Trojan that hint at its motives and perhaps origin .
Update , Feb. 25 , 5:00 p.m. ET : Byron Acohido , the Pulitzer Prize - winning cyber security reporter for USA Today , has published a fascinating yarn about the underground market for customized banking Trojans that is worth a read .
Tigger removes a long list of other malicious software titles , including the malware most commonly associated with Antivirus 2009 and other rogue security software titles .
iDefense analysts say this is most likely done because the in - your - face " hey , your - computer - is - infected - go - buy - our - software ! " type alerts generated by such programs just might tip off the victim that something is wrong with his system , and potentially lead to all invaders getting booted from the host PC .
According to iDefense , it also installs a " rootkit " on the infected system that loads even when the system is started up in " Safe Mode , " the Windows diagnostic boot sequence that is supposed to disable non-essential Windows components to make troubleshooting system problems easier .
A rootkit is a set of tools designed to allow malware authors to better hide their creations in host systems so that they are extremely stealthy and difficult to remove .
Finally , iDefense 's Ligh said one aspect of this new Trojan suggests the authors behind the Srizbi botnet may have had a hand in developing or distributing it .
As a result of the shutdown of hosting provider McColo in November 2008 , the Srizbi botnet -- at the time responsible for sending more than 40 percent of the world 's spam -- was cut off from the servers its masters used to control it .
But Srizbi had a built - in mechanism to resurrect itself : it told all infected systems to seek out a rotating set of new domain names every few days , names that the bad guys could ( and did ) use to regain control over the botnet .
According to iDefense , Tigger uses a special key code to extract its rootkit on host systems , a lengthy key that is almost identical to the key used by the domain name generation feature built into the Srizbi botnet .
While the nearly matching keys may be nothing more than a coincidence , it is unusual to find data - stealing Trojans that remove other malicious software , Ligh said .
Rather , such features are far more commonly found in bot programs typically used to turn systems into spam relays , such as the Srizbi botnet .
" The scary part is , none of us are really sure how Tigger is even being distributed , " Ligh said .
" I look at a lot at info - stealing malware , and this is the first one I 've seen in a while that goes to the trouble of removing other pieces of malware . "

Guy Sues Children 's Charity After No-Show By Angelina Jolie
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
You know those celebrity meet - and - greet charity auctions we often talk about ?
Yea , well , apparently they do n’t always work out .
A lawsuit has been filed by an unnamed plantiff alleging that the $ 30,000 he paid to a children ’s charity for a meet with Angelina Jolie never amounted to anything .
The charity , Lili Claire Foundation , is a group that helps children with neurogenetic disorders .
TMZ reports that two years have passed and the meeting did not take place , nor has the payment been returned .
The man is suing for the return of his money , in addition to damages .
Damages ?
What the hell kind of mental anguish did this guy suffer ?
I can understand wanting his money back — but to request more , from a children ’s charity no less , just seems in poor taste .
A rep for the organization told TMZ , “ The Lili Claire Foundation has a 100 percent track record of honoring its commitment to donors and recipients with respect to every single auction item sold to support its charitable services . ”
“ In the rare event that a sold auction item cannot be satisfactorily delivered to the winning bidder through no fault of our own , The Lili Claire Foundation works faithfully for an appropriate resolution with our bidder . ”
We imagine they ’ve probably attempted to hook this guy up with other actresses — but anyone who forks over $ 30 K to meet someone probably has their heart ( or mental disturbance ) set on one person .
We ’re just wondering why Angie does n’t step in and fulfill her original olbligation to the charity ?
Odd — and I ’m sure there ’s much more to the story .
Stay tuned …
I was flattered to be invited to present to the BrightTALK Green Marketing Summit tomorrow ( Friday , 4/24 ) .
BrightTALK is aiming to become the “ YouTube for Business , ” meaning they arrange targeted meetings / summits online and then store the webcasts so people can watch them in the future ( upon registration ) .
According to the BrightTALK site , “ This summit will help companies leverage the growing interest of consumers in purchasing products and services from companies with strong ‘ green ’ messages through understanding the need to develop a green marketing strategy .
Summit attendees will gain insight from companies who have implemented successful green marketing initiatives and improve their understanding of why going green will help build a strong brand connection with their target audience . ”
The summit will include representatives from companies like Intel and HP , as well as green marketing experts like Joel Makower , who runs GreenBiz , among other ventures .
My session , scheduled for 4 pm EST , is titled : Green Marketing : Bridging Theory & Practice – A Guide to Making Your Direct Marketing Efforts More Sustainable .
To attend the summit , please click here .
Here ’s a brief abstract on my talk from the BrightTALK site : “ Please join Ben Grossman , Director of Grossman Marketing Group ’s Green Marketing & Sustainability Practice , to learn about the latest trends in green marketing .
Specifically , Ben will discuss how the green movement is having an impact on communications , and will highlight ways to make your organization ’s direct marketing efforts more sustainable and relevant to your constituents .
He will highlight creative ways that he and his colleagues have helped organizations like ZipCar , J.P. Morgan and the National Park Foundation , leverage green marketing techniques without adding any extra cost to the bottom line . ”
There will be a live Q&A session , so I will be back with a full report over the next several days .
Fujitsu ’s Flepia , the color e-book last seen in testing at an upscale Tokyo restaurant , is now available to buy .
Do n’t get too excited though — even if you ’re in Japan , where the Flepia is on sale , it will cost you a whopping ¥ 99,750 , or just over $ 1000 .
You get a lot for your money , though .
The reader has a an 8 " screen which displays 260,000 colors , Bluetooth , Wi - Fi ( b and g ) , a mini USB port and , most important of all , a touch screen ( although it comes with a stylus so we expect that it is a resistive touch screen , not capacitive like the iPhone . )
This is completed by a soft , on - screen keyboard ( just like the Kindle should have ) and a battery life of 40 hours ( continuos use — Fujitsu says 2400 page turns ) .
Books are stored on an SD card and can be bought from the online bookstore Papyless .
Curiously , the Flepia seems to be a kind of tablet / e- book hybrid .
Along with the book reading software , the device comes loaded with Windows CE 5 , meaning support for e-mail , spreadsheets , web browsing and the like .
If you view this as a low powered , long life computer instead of a color e-book reader , it starts to look less expensive .
The Flepia will start shipping on April 20th .
It looks like the age of the e-book is finally upon us , the dream of every science fiction writer ever .
Next up — flying cars .

Five of France 's leading rightwing politicians , including President Nicolas Sarkozy and three of his cabinet ministers , have been sent death threats accompanied by 9 mm - calibre bullets , police said today .
The justice minister , Rachida Dati , the interior minister , Michele Alliot - Marie , and the culture minister , Christine Albanel , had all received anonymous packages in the past week , their respective offices confirmed .
Contradicting an earlier denial by Sarkozy 's spokesman , the police said the president had also been targeted , along with the former prime minister and mayor of Bordeaux , Alain Juppé .
" You think you control our lives – well , no , it 's us who control yours and those of your family and friends , " the letters were reported to have said .
Typed by computer over two pages and in brown paper envelopes , some of the messages described the recipients as the legislators of " liberty - crushing " and " fascist " laws .
Police said others referred to the politicians as " dead men walking " .
It was not clear whether the sender or senders had any specific political agenda or complaint , but investigators in Paris 's counter - terrorism police department said they thought it probable the threats were the work of a mentally unstable person .
At the end of last week , copies of the letters and individual bullets were also sent to two MPs in Sarkozy 's ruling UMP party : Jacques Blanc , mayor of La Canourgue , and Raymond Couderc , senator - mayor of the town of Béziers .
Juppé , who was prime minister for two years under Jacques Chirac , said he had lodged an official complaint with the police but felt " absolutely serene " despite the menacing tone of the packages .
" These are the risks of the job , " he said .
" If you start reading anonymous letters when you 're in politics , you 'll never stop .
You have to step back a bit . "
Referring to a German citizen who was found to have been sending him death threats several years ago , Juppé added : " It 's not the first time and it wo n't be the last . "

Until some future version of HTML gives us new native controls to use in a browser , at Google , we ’ve been playing and experimenting with controls we call “ custom buttons ” in our apps ( among other custom controls ) .
These buttons just launched in Gmail yesterday , and they ’ve been in Google Reader for two months now .
The buttons are designed to look very similar to basic HTML input buttons .
But they can handle multiple interactions with one basic design .
The buttons we ’re using are imageless , and they ’re created entirely using HTML and CSS , plus some JavaScript to manage the behavior .
They ’re also easily skinnable with a few lines of CSS , which was a key factor now that Gmail has themes .
I thought it would be interesting to provide a portion of the background on our buttons here , and discuss some of the iterations we ’ve been through so far to get to the current state .
Background
Today ’s web apps allow increasingly complex interactions .
Users can view , create , manage , and manipulate all kinds of data , from email messages to feeds to photos to blog posts , or even choosing what their DVR records on any given night .
We ’re at the point where these apps need something beyond standard HTML form controls and basic hypertext links to represent the actions a user can take .
A basic < input type =" submit " > could be used for single actions , a < select > element could be used for a compact menu of actions , and < input type = " radio " > could be used for selecting mutually exclusive options .
But we ’re left with no way to represent other interactions common in desktop apps .
Such as a checkbox that represents more than just on or off .
Or the use of auto - complete to refine or narrow the options in a drop - down menu .
On top of this , the controls we can render have significantly different appearances across browsers and platforms .
Even within a single browser , buttons and select menus have quite different designs .
Enter : the concept of custom buttons .
The first iteration
Not long after I started at Google , I remember seeing mockups for a new product that eventually become Google Spreadsheets .
The mockups I saw used simple buttons that looked similar to default HTML buttons in certain browsers .
But they were subtly different than any default buttons I had ever seen before .
The giveaway was seeing three buttons sandwiched together to make a pill button :
At first , I thought they were just generic browser - agnostic representations — and wishful thinking for the appearance — of actual HTML buttons .
But once we started using an internal - only version of the product , I realized this button design actually got built into the product .
That was fine .
But I cringed when I realized how the buttons had been implemented .
Each button was set up with a nine - cell table so they could place each corner image , and still allow the button to expand in all four directions according to the width and height of the text inside :
Eliminating the table and corner images
I knew there had to be a better way to render these buttons than using tables , and especially nine - cell tables just for the tiny little corners .
So I tried creating a few prototypes to improve our button code .
My first button attempt , which I named Custom Buttons 2.0 , ( version 1.0 would be the nine - cell tabled version done by one of our engineers ) used a similar trick that I used for event chips in Google Calendar : the top border was one element with 1 px left and right margins , the middle of the button was another element with left and right borders , and the bottom border recycled the styles of the top border with 1 px left and right margins .
This created a one - pixel notch in each of the four corners , giving the subtle illusion of a small rounded corner .
That 2.0 attempt was fine , and worked pretty well ( as I expected ) in almost all browsers .
But it required that each button as a whole either be floated or positioned absolutely with a width .
I wanted a set of buttons that could be treated as inline elements , and that would take up as much horizontal space as the text inside each button needed .
Going inline
My 3.0 attempt relied on treating the buttons and everything inside them as inline elements .
The top / bottom borders still needed to be rendered separately from the left / right borders to get 1 px - notched corners .
The left / right borders were rendered on the outer element .
The top / bottom borders were rendered on the inner element .
Because borders do n’t compound and add to the width or height of an inline element , we get the 1px notches in each corner .
I ran into a lot of frustration with this inline approach until I remembered display : inline - block .
That seemed to solve everything at once .
A demo page for Custom Buttons 3.0 shows my progress to this point .
As you can see there , I built in affordances for changing the border color on hover , and for reversing the gradient direction for the active / click state to make it feel like the button is actually pressable .
I also attempted to show how we could sandwich multiple buttons together to form a pill button .
The pill button was n’t perfect — I did n’t want gaps in the top / bottom borders between each button .
But it was a start .
The magical inline - block solved everything , except in IE .
That ’s where the genius of Google engineers came in .
They knew how to get tricks working in all browsers , and this technique interested a couple of them enough that they dedicated the time to make it work .
So 3.0 buttons were fine .
After some modifications by our engineers , they made it into live production code .
I believe 3.0 buttons are currently still in use for edit buttons in Google Sites , and in editor modes for Google Docs .
( As of this writing .
Expect those to change in the near future to buttons described below . )
But I was still bothered by the requirement of a background gradient image .
Not only was this an extra request to the server , but if anyone wanted to change the colors of a button , they ’d be required to create a new gradient image .
This was n’t flexible enough , in my opinion , and I thought we could push further .
Eliminating the gradient image
Instead of rendering the gradient with an image , I thought we might be able to simulate a gradient with a few bands of color .
With a few light grays laid beside each other that were close enough in value , we ’d get something that looked like a gradient .
With only two bands of color , I got a glossy - looking button with a sharp division between the two bands of color .
Not what I wanted .
Adding a third band of color between the first two colors blended each color together better .
So three color bands it had to be .
To get that band of color and fake the gradient , I had to insert one more element in the button code .
I chose < b > because it was short , and semantically , it did n’t mean anything .
That element was absolutely positioned , so it could live inside the button and behind the text without affecting anything else .
For the button itself , I used the almost - white # f9f9f9 .
For the < b > element I used # e3e3e3 .
The < b > element was absolutely positioned to the bottom of the button , and given a height of 40 % .
To get the middle band of color , I added a top border of #eee to the < b > element .
Another demo page for Custom Buttons 3.1 shows my attempt at getting this pseudo - gradient to work .
It works in Firefox and Safari , and probably a few other modern browsers .
But not everywhere .
It was never perfect , and I do n’t recommend using it in production code .
Again , I could n’t get this working right in IE .
Google eng to the rescue again .
To see the final code we ended up using in Gmail and Reader , you ’ll have to reverse engineer the button code in one of those products .
Sweating the details
If we were going to undertake the task of recreating basic HTML form controls , we knew there were a lot of details that need to be accounted for and thought through .
Like all the possible states of a button : resting , hover , focus , active , toggled - on , and disabled .
There are also the accessibility ramifications of creating non-standard controls .
I ’m sure we have n’t factored in or solved every access issue yet .
But engineers are working on that .
Here ’s a glimpse of the many states and types of buttons , along with the visual specs we had to think about and create if we were really going to replace default buttons and menus :
Major credit
I certainly did n’t create the concept of custom buttons at Google .
Nor did I write the final code that made it into production .
I merely initiated a couple steps to improve the methods we use to render custom buttons .
My portion of the iteration is what ’s documented here .
There were many other steps in making these buttons a reality .
These buttons never would have made it into production code without the help of several Google engineers .
One of the primary aids , Emil Eklund , helped fix a lot of my code for these custom buttons , and got it working in the browsers Gmail supports .
He just posted an entry on the Official Gmail Blog yesterday about the label and folder - like functionality behind the new buttons in Gmail .
Two developers ( no longer at Google ) also contributed heavily to the original button code : Ryan Carver and Greg Veen .
They deserve huge props too .
Even more credit for the launch of these buttons in Gmail goes to one of the Gmail designers , Michael Leggett , who dreamed up all the fancy new functionality and interactions behind applying labels .
Michael gave me lots of feedback and suggestions as we were building the original specs for 3.0 and 3.1 buttons .
He also created countless iterations of the button interactions for Gmail , and endured numerous reviews and feedback cycles to finally get them launched in the product .
If you like the new labeling menus in Gmail , Michael is the one to thank .
The menus are especially slick if you use the new v and l keyboard shortcuts , along with auto - complete to apply labels ( and even archive at the same time ) without ever touching your mouse .
There are numerous other designers , developers , and engineers at Google who touched these buttons at one point or another .
They all deserve credit too .
I ’ve only given props to four of the most prolific people who made these buttons a reality .
In its final days , the George W. Bush administration issued a Justice Department opinion dramatically reversing most of the legal arguments that governed its war on terrorism - from interrogations to electronic surveillance .
On Monday , the Obama Justice Department declassified a Jan. 15 memo from Steven G. Bradbury , the outgoing principal deputy assistant attorney general , repudiating the interpretations of the Office of Legal Counsel from 2001 to 2003 regarding the president ’s wartime authorities .
The memo upheld Congress ’ right to make binding laws regarding the treatment of suspected terrorists and withdrew “ doubtful interpretation ” of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , questioning the obligation of the U.S. government to abide by international agreements on treatment of prisoners of war .
In fact , the memo said , the president was obliged to follow international treaties , signed by the United States , prohibiting torture .
Jameel Jaffer , director of the American Civil Liberties Union national security project , said the “ repudiation in this memo suggests a long - overdue recognition that the OLC ’s legal analyses were indefensible . ”
He called the details discussed in the Jan. 15 document the “ basis for the Bush administration ’s most sweeping national security policies including the [ National Security Agency ’s ] warrantless wiretapping program and the CIA ’s torture program . ”
“ The obvious question is what conduct was authorized based on this deeply flawed legal reasoning , ” Mr. Jaffer said .
“ Now we know what their legal arguments were , but we are still to a large extent in the dark about what conduct the administration authorized based on these memos . ”
It remains unclear why the Bush administration reversed the legal basis for so many of its actions so late in its term .
However , before it left office , the Bush administration had already signaled in congressional testimony and in other memos and opinions that it was moving away from the expansive constitutional interpretations that the president invoked after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Not until Jan. 15 had these reversals been stated in one document .
At times , the memo ’s tone sounds like a mix between apology and explanation .
“ The opinions addressed herein were issued in the wake of the atrocities of 9/11 , when policymakers , fearing that additional catastrophic terrorist attacks were imminent , strived to employ all lawful means to protect the nation , ” Mr. Bradbury wrote .
After the Sept. 11 attacks , attorneys “ confronted novel and complex legal questions in a time of great danger and under extraordinary time pressure , ” he wrote .
The memo repudiates the assertion that president ’s powers as commander in chief “ would deny Congress any role in regulating the detention , interrogation , prosecution and transfer of enemy combatants captured in the global War on Terror . ”
This view reverses the opinion issued by Jay S. Bybee , then an assistant attorney general , in a March 13 , 2002 , memo asserting the president ’s power to transfer captured terrorists to the control and custody of foreign nations .
On the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , Mr. Bradbury withdrew all memos asserting that the law did not restrict the president ’s authority to wiretap suspects inside the United States without a warrant .
Mr. Bradbury also suspended the Nov. 15 , 2001 , memo from John Yoo , then a deputy chief in the Office of Legal Counsel , asserting that “ the president ’s power to suspend treaties is wholly discretionary , and may be exercised whenever he determines that it is in the national interest to do so . ”
While the Office of Legal Counsel had reversed this opinion in 2006 , the Jan. 15 memo was more forceful in asserting that the president did not have the power unilaterally to withdraw from a treaty signed with other foreign countries .

WASHINGTON --
The banking industry is aggressively lobbying the Treasury Department to make it less costly for financial institutions to get out of the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
The move could prove controversial for the banking industry , which is busy deflecting criticism about higher fees it is charging consumers for credit cards and other products and services .

Obama Gets High Marks From Public
Despite all the grim news and the increasingly critical coverage , President Obama remains hugely popular with the American people .
The latest Washington Post / ABC
News poll finds Obama with a 66 percent approval rating , unchanged from a month ago , and a 60 percent approval rating for how he 's handling the economy .
Overwhelming majorities of Americans ( 70 to 80 percent ) blame big business , banks , former president George W. Bush and consumers who overextended themselves , in that order , for the financial crisis -- while only a small minority ( 26 percent ) blame Obama .
By a greater than two - to - one margin , the public trusts Obama to do a better job handling the economy than they do Republicans -- although the percent saying " neither " is up significantly over a month ago .
And fully 64 percent of Americans are confident that Obama 's economic program will improve the economy .
That 's down from 72 percent before his inauguration -- which was also before the full scope of the problem was apparent .
Asked if " beneath it all " Obama is " an old - style , tax - and - spend Democrat " or a " new - style Democrat who will be careful with the public 's money , " respondents chose the latter two to one .
Jon Cohen and Dan Balz write in The Washington Post : " The number of Americans who believe that the nation is headed in the right direction has roughly tripled since Barack Obama 's election , and the public overwhelmingly blames the excesses of the financial industry , rather than the new president , for turmoil in the economy , according to a new Washington Post - ABC News poll . "
So what 's the bad news for Obama ?
" Despite the increasing optimism about the future , the nation 's overall mood remains gloomy , and doubts are rising about some of the administration 's prescriptions for the economic woes .
Independents are less solidly behind Obama than they have been , fewer Americans now express confidence that his economic programs will work , barely half of the country approves of how the president is dealing with the federal budget deficit , and the political climate is once again highly polarized . "
But that 's not really so bad .
For instance , although Cohen and Balz write that " barely half " approves of how Obama is dealing with the deficit , barely half is still , well , more than half -- and who really thinks the deficit is a big issue right this minute , anyway ?
OK , well , just wait then , Cohen and Balz write : " The findings suggest that the public continues to give Obama considerable latitude as he attempts to jump - start the economy , but public patience may be limited .
The coming debate over his budget , where he faces both Democratic and Republican resistance to some of his major priorities , should produce a more definitive first - year judgment on his economic program and his presidency . "
A new USA Today / Gallup Poll pegs Obama 's approval rating at 64 percent .
CNN reports : " More than eight out of 10 Americans think Barack Obama will do a good job representing their country to the world , according to a new national poll published as the U.S. president set off on his first overseas trip since taking office . "
And Lois Romano writes in The Washington Post about the poll numbers for Michelle Obama : " Her favorability ratings are at 76 percent , up 28 points since summer .
The number of people who view her negatively has plummeted .
Her most striking inroads have come among Republicans who viewed her negatively last year , perhaps in part because of comments she made about feeling proud of her country for the first time . "
In the aftermath of the Pirate Bay verdict , many are now on the lookout for other forms of online piracy .
Among the latest batch of uncovered copyright - snubbing websites is a Google - based search platform called Torrent Search .
Want to watch a hot new theater release , but are unwilling to pay the price of admission ?
Type in the movie title on Torrent Search and you can be instantly directed to thousands of popular piracy websites .
Google Fueling Pro-Piracy Campaigns
While the search platform was probably not created by someone working for Google , seeing as how almost anyone can create a page with a defined set of sites , many who support and perform illegal downloads are using its affiliation with Google as ammo for their pro-piracy agendas .
In the interest of fairness , many are asking that Google be treated in the same manner as the four creators of Pirate Bay .
Of course , Google does not intend for their search platforms to be used in the same manner as that of an illegal filesharing network .
Google Crawls Where Pirate Bay Tracks
By definition , Google is a " web crawler " meaning that while its search engine(s ) are able to uncover pirated media , the source of its content resides on an external website .
Pirate Bay , on the other hand , is known as a " torrent tracker " meaning that users are able to find pirated content faster than using a random search platform .
As Infopackets Reader ' Bloodaxe ' states :
" Pirate Bay does not now , nor ever has , hosted pirated material .
Pirate Bay merely provides a platform for file - sharers to list the files that reside on their own computers and allow others access to this list .
Basically , Pirate Bay is what Google would be if Google merely let content providers log on to request that their content be listed by Google .
Google , on the other hand , goes out of their way to list everything on accessible websites , whether the creators of those sites so intended or not , and as an added bonus , eats up tons of bandwidth because they constantly refresh their ' image ' of the web . "
Those on the fence about the issue are saying that sleuthing out online piracy is a never - ending battle , since even the most grassroots websites could be found to have some form of copyright violation .
Removal Process Underway
Google has since started making strides in combating the issue .
For instance , a torrent search for " Wolverine " came with a blurb stating that four pages had been omitted , having been found to be in direct violation of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
The blurb also provided several links where people could go to read the DMCA complaints that caused the removals .

Still , the thousands of other sites that appeared on the results page prove that ridding the online world of media piracy is still a long time away .
Best Buy , like many other stores , has a public " price matching " policy .
But HD
Guru reports that according to internal docs , personnel are trained to deny price - matches and even paid bonuses for shutting them down .

This all comes out of a lawsuit that was just granted class action status .
Internal documents , plus depositions from past and current Best Buy employees reveal just how evil Best Buy is .
A price match is when , say , Circuit City advertised a Sharp HDTV for cheaper than Best Buy , Best Buy 's public policy is to match that price .
Advertisement
But Best Buy actually trains employees in New York how to deny legitimate price match requests , and the average Best Buy store denies 100 price matches a week .
You even get paid bonuses based on how many price matches you deny !
Here 's how it works , according to Phil Britton , a member of Best Buy 's Competitive Strategies Group :
What is the first thing we do when a customer comes in to our humble box brandishing a competitor 's ad asking for a price match ?
We attempt to build a case against the price match .
( Trust me , I 've done it too ) .
Let 's walk through the " Refused Price Match Greatest Hits : " Not same model ?
Not in stock at the competitor ?
Do we have free widget with purchase ?
Is it from a warehouse club ( they have membership fees , you know ) ?
Limited Quantities ?
That competitor is across town ?
We 've got financing !
Is it an internet price ?
It 's below cost !….. "
If you live in NY state , and you 've been screwed by Best Buy 's anti-price matching , HD Guru has further info on the attorney to contact so you can take a piece out of Best Buy .
What a bunch of scum .

Update : Giz reader
Jake reveals how they scam you on model numbers to avoid price matching :
Example : A few months ago my wife and I were looking at a Frigidaire Washer .
The model we were interested was the ATF8000FS .
At Best Buy , we found the washer there however it was displayed as the ATF8000FSL .
At first I figured " Oh this must be some variation on the original model number , like how manufacturers sometimes add a letter to the end of the model to indicate the product color . "
Anyways , to make a long story short , this ATF8000FSL was not available from the manufacturer .
The " L " was added on by Best Buy in order for them to skirt around price matching .
This is so no one can come to Best Buy and claim to have found a lower price of this product because no one else sells the product under the model number ATF8000FSL .
It 's ATF8000 FS everywhere else .
Best Buy will tell people that its simply a different product , so therefore , no price matching .
Even on the manufacturer 's sticker on the washer , it said ATF8000FS , as it was supposed to .
Upon further investigation I could see that Best Buy 's internal computers even listed the model as ATF8000FSL .

Creating Your Own Theme
Kuler provides very efficient tools to quickly create new color themes .
You can choose different harmony rules , use the interactive color wheel and different sliders for brightness and angle , extract colors from an image or simply input color values .
Base Color and Related Colors
Like the name says , you can choose a Base color and build the color theme around it .
After setting the Base color , four other colors are available to choose .
Harmony rules will apply to the base color and affect the colors around it .
By dragging and dropping on the color wheel , you can adjust the base color .
The other colors will then move simultaneously .
Color Rules
The color rules are based on color theory .
If you are interested in the theory behind Kuler , check out the links provided below .
After selecting the base color , select one of the following rules to quickly create harmonious themes .
I think the best way to understand what any single rules does is to experiment with each of them .
By selecting Custom , Kuler gives you the freedom to select colors individually .
Color Wheel
Move the markers on the interactive color wheel to choose the colors in your theme .
Do this by either using a color rule or individually selecting colors .
Below the color wheel is another Slider , which adjusts the brightness of the colors .
Color Values
If the color wheel is imprecise , you can additionally adjust the colors in your theme by inputting numeric values for the HSB , RGB , CMYK , LAB , or HEX color models .
If you only want to change a single color , make sure Custom is selected , since entering a new value will adjust all the other colors in the theme .
If you want to experiment with the theme , use the color sliders under each color swatch .
For those of you who are not logged in , you can easily create themes and copy & paste the values to Photoshop or any other Software .
Color from an Image
A very neat feature of Kuler is the extraction tool which generates themes from an image .
You can upload images from your desktop or use images from Flickr .
Just as the harmony rules , Kuler provides different Moods : Colorful , Bright , Muted , Deep , Dark , and Custom .
The moods you can choose from , will automatically generate appropriate colors .
By moving the markers around , Kuler picks the color of the current position and displays it , below the image , in the color theme preview .
Kuler supports TIFF , JPEG , GIF , PNG , and BMP image formats .
Saving and Publishing
Before saving your themes , you should always give it a proper title and tags to make it easier for other users to find .
You can choose to save your themes in private mode to your MyKuler section or share them with other members , who can rate them and add comments .
Tags and comments are displayed in the details section .
Popular tags are displayed in a certain text size .
The larger the size , the more popular the tag word .
Creator 's can set an avatar or personal color swatch as their default picture .
Other members can click on avatars to view all the themes created by that member .
Using the Kuler Extension in Photoshop
Downloaded Adobe Swatch Exchange files can be used as color swatches in all Adobe CS4 , CS3 and CS2 products .
We 'll take a look at Photoshop CS4 .
Find and Open the Kuler Extension
With the new CS4 version , Adobe integrated Kuler right into Photoshop .
You can find it by going to Window > Extensions > Kuler .
The Kuler Panel will appear .

Features : Browse and Create
Browse
The Browse tab reveals a list of currently uploaded and available color themes .
To use this feature an Internet connection is required , since the extension uses a RSS Feed to read and list the color themes in Photoshop .
You can browse , search and sort themes the way we did on the Kuler website .
At the bottom of this section , you can see the arrows pointing up and down .
These help you to view the previous or next sets of themes .
Create
The create tab reveals a smaller version of the Create Page on kuler.adobe.com .
As you can see , these are the same functions like choosing a harmony rule , adjusting the single colors or brightness , setting the base and related colors and retrieving the values .
At the bottom of this section there are additional buttons , which let you upload your theme directly to your account or download / save the current theme .
Swatch Panel
This is how the standard Swatch Panel looks like in Photoshop .
You can open it via Window > Swatches .
In a previous step we 've learned how to import ASE files to our Swatch Panel .
The extension makes it a lot easier for us .
We can easily browse and directly add themes to our Swatch Panel though without downloading and importing ASE files from the Kuler website .
Directly Add Themes to Swatches
The button on the bottom - right - corner , adds the theme directly into your Swatches Panel .
You can now select single colors as your Foreground or Background color and apply them to your project .
You can reset or delete the colors by clicking on the little triangle in the top - left corner .

Overview
Diamondback Ruby ( DRuby ) is an extension to Ruby that aims to bring the benefits of static typing to Ruby without compromising the expressiveness of the language .
The main features of DRuby are :
Type inference : DRuby uses inference to model most of Ruby ’s idioms as precisely as possible without any need for programmer intervention .
Type annotations : Methods may be given explicit type annotations with an easy to use syntax inspired by RDoc .
Dynamic checking :
When necessary , methods can be type checked at runtime , using contracts to isolate and properly blame any errant code , similar to gradual typing .
Metaprogramming support : DRuby includes a combined static and dynamic analysis to precisely model dynamic meta- programming constructs , such as eval and method_missing .
News
11/19/2009 – Added two new papers .
“ Static Typing for Ruby on Rails ” ( ASE’09 ) and “ Work In Progress : an Empirical Study of Static Typing in Ruby ” ( PLATEAU’09 )
09/03/2009 – Added two new conference papers .
“ The Ruby Intermediate Language ” ( DLS’09 ) and “ Profile - Guided Static Typing for Dynamic Scripting Languages ” ( OOPSLA’09 )
07/26/2009 – New release with many bug fixes and a few new features .
See the download page for details
04/21/2009 –
This source tarball now includes the files necessary to build new rubygem packages .
Also fixed a couple of minor bugs since 20090415 .
Current Status
While DRuby is an ongoing research project , it already works quite well for small , self - contained Ruby scripts .
Currently , it is unable to analyze much of the Ruby standard library “ out - of - the - box ” .
Analyzing such library code is something we ’re working toward and have already had some initial success , finding several real programming errors with its analysis .
The DRuby type analysis is built on top of a more general framework for analyzing Ruby programs ( which we call RIL — the Ruby Intermediate Language ) .
In future releases , we plan to distribute this framework separately in the hope that other researchers can use RIL to explore their own ideas for Ruby .
Until then , a motivated OCaml hacker should already be able to get started with the current tarball , but feel free to email our mailing list if you need help .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A federal judge on Tuesday set aside the conviction of Republican former Sen .
Ted Stevens while excoriating the case 's prosecutors .
A courtroom sketch shows ex- Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens at Tuesday proceedings , where he said he had " new hope . "
District Judge Emmet Sullivan also appointed an independent , nongovernment attorney , Henry Schuelke III , to investigate possible misconduct by the government lawyers who prosecuted the 85 - year - old former senator from Alaska .
" In nearly 25 years on the bench , I 've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I 've seen in this case , " Sullivan said .
In October , Stevens was found guilty of seven counts of lying on Senate ethics forms .
He lost his bid for re-election in November to Democratic challenger Mark Begich , then mayor of Anchorage .
In December , an unnamed FBI whistle - blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense .
The whistle - blower reported that someone with the government had an inappropriate relationship with Bill Allen , an oil industry executive who was the government 's key witness .
In a dismissal motion filed Wednesday , the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to the notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen .
The notes show that responses by Allen were inconsistent with testimony he gave against Stevens and that information from the interview could have benefited Stevens at trial , according to the motion .
" When we were finally given [ the notes ] , you might have thought my reaction would be to celebrate , do high - fives , that we were right , " Brendan Sullivan , an attorney for Stevens , said Tuesday .
" It was not like that at all .
I was sick to my stomach .
How could they do that ?
Then my revulsion turned to rage , silent rage for a number of days . "
The revelation also helped prompt Attorney General Eric Holder to drop the case .
" In light of this conclusion , and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case , I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial , " Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement last week .
" If I were Sen . [ Robert ]
Byrd , I 'd say ' hallelujah , ' " a triumphant Stevens said after leaving the courthouse Tuesday .
Stevens maintained his innocence throughout a government investigation that led to an indictment and conviction for failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of " freebies " from an oilfield services company on Senate ethics forms .
In a statement read to the court Tuesday , Stevens said that his faith in the justice system had been restored .
" Until recently , my faith in the criminal justice system was unwavering .
But what some members of this prosecution team did nearly destroyed my faith .
Their conduct has consequences they must know can never be reversed , " he said .
" But [ I now have ] new hope that others may be spared from similar miscarriages of justice . "
Stevens added that he would " encourage the enactment of legislation to reform laws relating to the responsibilities and duties of those entrusted with the solemn task of enforcing federal criminal laws . "
Paul O'Brien , one of the new government attorneys assigned to the case , made no attempt to the justify the conduct of the previous prosecution team .
" We deeply regret this occurred , " he said .
" We apologize to the court . "
In issuing his ruling , Sullivan noted the Justice Department 's investigation into potential misconduct by government prosecutors had gone on for six months with no result .
" The silence is deafening , " Sullivan said .
See what the reversal means for the Justice Department »
The judge previously had excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point .
One of Stevens ' longtime friends , Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah , said last weekend that Stevens was " screwed by our own Justice Department . "
Hatch praised Holder for " standing up and fixing this foul situation . "
" I think he 's more than shown integrity and decency in this matter , and it's not an easy thing for him to do that , " Hatch said .
" He has , in looking at it , realized now what people like myself have been saying is 100 percent right . "
In the days that followed the Justice Department 's dismissal motion , Alaska state Republican leaders , including Gov. Sarah Palin , called on Begich to step down and allow a rematch without what has been called the " taint " of a criminal case against Stevens .
" There 's no way [ Stevens ] can just ' put this behind him ' as some have suggested he should , " Palin said in a statement released Tuesday .
Begich , while indicating his support for a special prosecutor to investigate the botched prosecution , stated that he intends to serve his six - year term .
CNN 's Terry Frieden contributed to this report
All About Ted Stevens • Alaska • Sarah Palin • Mark Begich
Rodreick originally faced 28 counts but pleaded guilty to only a quarter of them : four counts of sexual exploitation of a minor stemming from the pornography , and one count each of failure to register as a sex offender , fraud and simple assault .
The assault charge involved an allegation that he grabbed a girl 's buttocks at a school in Prescott Valley with the intent to injure , insult or provoke .
The incident took place in the South China Sea , in international waters about 75 miles south of Hainan Island .
The Defense Department said the following :
" On March 8 , 2009 , five Chinese vessels shadowed and aggressively maneuvered in dangerously close proximity to USNS Impeccable , in an apparent coordinated effort to harass the U.S. ocean surveillance ship while it was conducting routine operations in international waters .
" The Chinese vessels surrounded USNS Impeccable , two of them closing to within 50 feet , waving Chinese flags and telling Impeccable to leave the area .
" Because the vessels ' intentions were not known , Impeccable sprayed its fire hoses at one of the vessels in order to protect itself .
The Chinese crew members disrobed to their underwear and continued closing to within 25 feet . "
A protest has already been lodged with the Chinese government and it was to be repeated face - to - face to a Beijing military attache at a Pentagon meeting Monday , according to officials .
Of course , China considers most of the South China Sea as its own , which has led in the past to sovereignty issues with other countries in the region .
Susan Davis reports on politics .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin no longer will headline the annual congressional Republicans annual joint fund - raiser this June , a GOP aide said today .
Instead , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich will speak in her place .
The 2008 vice - presidential nominee was trumpeted as the headline speaker in a joint March 16 press release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Sen . John Cornyn of Texas , who heads the Senate campaign operation , praised her then as “ one of the most popular and recognizable faces in the Republican Party . ”
Rep. Pete Sessions , also from Texas , who heads the House campaign operation , called her “ one of the brightest rising stars in the Republican Party . ”
The day after the announcement , a Palin aide said the governor was unaware of the speaking gig — an apparent miscommunication between her political team and the governor ’s office — to the frustration of congressional aides .
The annual dinner is the major fund - raising event of the year for the congressional campaign committees , and would have been a good venue for the governor , who is considered — albeit by smaller circles lately — to be a 2012 presidential contender .
“ After initially confirming her attendance ” the governor ’s team said she would be unable to attend due to responsibilities in Alaska through the end of the legislative session , the campaign committees said in a statement .
“ We completely understand and respect Governor Palin ’s focus on her official state business . ”
The committees praised Gingrich as “ one of our party ’s brightest minds and most energetic speakers . ”

Hello Friends , I hope you take the time to read the quote , on the side - bar , by our good friend and mentor , Oscar Wilde .
In that one quote Oscar brings to life the isolation and despair of what he refers to as " us " , the homosexuals .
It is a long , lonely , desolate road , homosexuality .
I 've been there , friends .
I know how horrible and rough that road can be .
I have been called a " Faggot " .
You are not alone and guess what , God Loves You even if he hates your Homosexuality .
You just can't stay that way .
Let me help you love yourself .

' Your comment is awaiting [ a future deletion ] '
by Jeremy Hooper
Well it 's official .
The National Organization For Marriage is , as predicted , moderating comments on their blog so that they can shut out voices of dissent .
On Tuesday we gave you a mission :
To go to NOM 's newly launched blog and leave respectful comments .
You responded in a big way , with several of you sending us the screen caps of your words , and others simply reposting your NOM comment on our initial post .
And while NOM has now begun approving certain comments ( both positive and mildly negative ) , here 's a sampling of some of the comments that they 've arbitrarily chosen to shut out :
All of the above are perfectly fair and acceptable ( unless you find dissenting with NOM 's beliefs out of line ) .
Plus , if you go back to our initial post on this subject , you 'll see several more comments from our readers who could n't / did n't make a screen cap :
COMMENTS : We 're giving you a mission [ G - A - Y ]
None of them approved .
But hey , when you 're launching a multi-million dollar national campaign against queer people , why should you give an ear to the ones who are truly affected ?
* Keep commenting !

Just as an aside , I 've been trying to post all kinds of comments at Jim Daly 's blog at Focus on the Family - - I think one has been approved , and I do n't think I was overtly rude in any of them .
Jeremy did a post on his blog a while ago , and they posted a couple of non-FOF generated comments for a day or two , but they 've returned to their old heavily moderated habits !
On the other hand -- the Boundless blog at FOF is way better for discussion -- there are actually some really intellectual conversations taking place over there , and I really respect that .
Boundless is for the younger ( mostly college age / young adult ) readers .

NOM launched its Northeast Action Plan today with a series of radio ads airing in Vermont , New Hampshire and Maine .
The ads open with a child asking questions about same - sex marriage : “ If my Dad married a man , who would be my Mom ? ”
Listeners then hear an urgent marriage alert , asking them to contact their legislators in opposition to same - sex marriage legislation pending in the three states .
We need your help !
Please make a generous donation today to help us keep these ads on the air !<
What an absolute JOKE .
These people are nuts .

I just used the NOM blog to send a message to the Iowa Legislature .
Only I changed it and told them not to support the effort to get a contsitutional amendment going .
I mean why should something that was deemed unconstitutional be voted on to add to the constitution ?
I also told them they should be cool like Vermont .
I might get some spam mail from NOM but it will be sent to my parents address so I do n't care .
It was fun to do anyway .

Your comment is awaiting moderation .
“ – A psychologist in Georgia was fired after she declined for religious reasons to counsel a lesbian about her relationship . ”
Do n’t Psychologists have to take the same Oath as other doctors ? “.. do no harm . ”
I think its great that she has the faith in whatever religion she practices , but how can it benefit anyone if she is going to force her beliefs onto her patients ?
Does she advertise her religion so that others will know to choose or avoid her based on their own religious beliefs ?

Here is another comment disapproved / deleted by their so called non-corrupt organization .
http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t132/mewimi/other/nomcoverup.jpg
" Dear leaders of the National Organization for Marriage .
After reviewing your video I have acknowledged that the information you provide is not accurate .
I also have found that the actress stating that she is a doctor who has to choose between her job and her faith ... is highly unethical to support .
Of course a doctor must place her job and the welfare of other 's above her faith , it is against the law not to do so .
You take legal oaths when it comes to medical licenses that are binding under state and US laws .
As for the rest ...
It is all similar other cases regarding to anti-discrimination laws that do n't actually have anything to do with same sex civil marriage .
I 'd like NOM to officially apologize to the LGBT community for this ad , would you do that for us ?
Thank you for your time .
~ Celeste ~ "

I had three denied myself .
I 'm guessing they had a surge of pro-gay comments and did not want to make it seem like their community was overwhelmingly in favor of same - sex marriage .
Posted by : Family Fairness | Apr 12 , 2009 3:56:46 AM
Just wanted to let y'all know that NOM has apparently gotten around to deleting comments on their Facebook postings as well .
I 've had to post one of my comments three times already due to them disappearing and I imagine I 'll have to do it a few more times afterward .
Posted by : Preston | Apr 12 , 2009 9:09:36 PM
You 're absolutely right , Preston .
Some of mine have been deleted .
Thanks for the heads up .

As of June 4 , 2009 , the NOM blog is still being heavily moderated .
I have posted a total of 10 comments , all intelligent and devoid of any derogatory terms or name calling , and 3 have made it through .
The 3 that did go through , which were specifically presented toward other blog writers , have been completely ignored of course even though the people they were directed towards have posted new comments right under mine with no regard for anything I have addressed .
This is ridiculous , you can't argue with people who do n't want to listen .

Great debate .

Welcome to the 68th installation of Encephalon , a blog carnival devoted to presenting the best recent blog posts in neuroscience and psychology .
Last time I hosted Encephalon I used a new format , motivated by my philosophy about what makes for good science blogging :
Science blogging is n’t merely a means of recording information .
The best science bloggers are expert at asking , and then answering , a question that the reader might never have even thought about before .
That gives us the organizing theme of today ’s carnival : Q&A .
I liked the Q&A format so much that I ’m going to use it again ( though I do n’t promise to always frame the questions that the bloggers themselves intend to be answering ) .
Without further ado , then …
Q : What would neuroscience be like without informed consent ?
A : It would be dreadful , as epitomized by the infamous Rafferty experiment .
Roberts Bartholow , a physician , performed a series of invasive experiments on the brain of a “ feeble - minded ” terminal cancer patient , Mary Rafferty .
His investigations caused significant pain and may have materially contributed to Rafferty ’s death , but that did n’t stop Bartholow from publishing his findings and going on to a successful career .
Romeo Vitelli has the gory details at Providentia .
Q : What can we learn from a damaged brain ?
A : We learn a great deal about the functioning of the human brain by studying the symptoms that arise from damage to specific areas within the brain .
At their best , these studies allow neuroscientists to test hypotheses that could n’t be falsified in any other way .
Brain - damage studies are n’t perfect , however ( what study is ? ) and they ’re vulnerable to a wide variety of confounding variables .
Using an analogy between brains and computers , Jared Tanner discusses the advantages and disadvantages of brain damage studies at Brain Blogger .
A : The things we learn from damaged brains can be quite specific .
From patients with heterotopopagnosia , we have learned that the left parieto - occipital junction is implicated in our ability to recognize the parts of other people ’s bodies .
At the Neurocritic .
Q : How do we figure out what to do ?
A : In order to deal with the world , we must allocate our attention to gather the most relevant information , identify the available options , choose between the alternatives and then execute our action .
When you put it that way , it ’s a wonder we can get out of bed in the morning .
Sandy G ponders stimulus conditioning and maximization of utility functions at The Mouse Trap .
Q : How does socioeconomic status influence the brain ?
A : A large body of recent work has elucidated relationships between poverty and neuroanatomy , focusing on the physiological effects of chronic stress .
At Neuroanthropology , Daniel Lende takes a critical look at the way some of these findings have been discussed .
I was especially impressed by his points about the brain as “ fetish ” or “ token ” in discussions of the issue .
Q : Where do emotions come from ?
A : Joseph Kim talks about the stereotypical differences in emotional expression between men and women , and between people from different cultures , in a question - filled , free - form post at Brain Blogger .
Q : Why do we have bad moods ?
A : Low moods are often associated with unpleasant feelings and difficulty getting through the day .
How could such a response have evolved ?
When the going gets tough , the tough should get going , not lie around on the couch eating pork rinds .
In order words , it seems maladaptive to respond to bad circumstances by losing the ability to improve one ’s lot .
Then again , if risk has n’t paid off , maybe it makes sense to be risk averse .
What ’s the ideal outcome ?
At The Mouse Trap , Sandy G summarizes and discusses a recent peer - reviewed paper on these issues .
Q: What is the mission of neuroanthropology ?
A : In a 1986 video , Oliver Sacks describes the goal of the neurologist as “ to try to imagine what it is like for them and enter into their situation and their world and relate it to one ’s own . ”
Daniel Lende of Neuroanthropology argues that this effectively summarizes the mission goals of the modern neuroanthropologist .
Over the past three decades , a number of developments ( in neuroscience , epistemology , anthropology and psychology ) have converged to dramatically changed the landscape in which neuroanthropologists work .
The upshot , Lende argues is that we ’re now able to design scholarly work around the mission defined in Sacks ’ statement .
Q : What is the best way to disseminate and discuss a paper before it ’s “ published ” ?
A : At The Neurocritic , an discussion of the controversy surrounding the paper formerly known as “ Voodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience . ”
Q : How do baseball players catch fly balls ?
A : Running to intercept tiny projectile moving rapidly along a ( more or less ) parabolic course is , to say the least , difficult .
A significant amount of scholarship has been devoted to analyzing the trajectories of outfielders as they pursue their implicit strategies for catching that fly ball .
Never one to take the easy road , Daniel Lende of Neuroanthropology ponders why novice players tend to take a step forward as soon as they realize a ball has been hit in their general direction .
Q : How do we learn from our mistakes ?
A : More broadly , how do we use experience of the past to adapt to a changing environment ?
At Brain Health Hacks ,
Ward Plunet describes a study of the effect of a dopamine receptor polymorphism on learning behavior — the results would seem to indicate that some of us have a genetic predisposition to acknowledge ( or at least realize ) when we ’re wrong , and to do something about that .
The next Encephalon will be hosted at Brain Stimulant on April 27th .
More information about future installations of the carnival , as well as details about making submissions , can be found at the Encephalon archive .

Buying lots of new things seems to be going out of fashion .
It ’s not hard to see why – you ca n’t spend what you do n’t have .
And while we ’d always advocate shelling out for the best - quality , well - priced ( i.e. not super - cheap ) products , there ’s another way to get exactly what you want on a tight budget .
It takes a little more effort – but it ’s fun , creative , and it ’s been popular for thousands of years .
It ’s bartering .
Products or services , a straight swap or a fierce haggle … bartering is an online boom industry that ’s never been more timely .
Where to start ?
Here are 20 places that will help you click your way to a new wardrobe , bookshelf or even four walls and a ceiling !
http://bookmooch.com
What ’s traded ?
Used books – hardback , paperback , anything with pages you can turn .
How does it work ?
You ’re earning and spending “ mooch points ” – earning by searching for titles , giving them to other members and telling people you ’ve received what they sent you …and spending by acquiring the books you want ( with a further option of making a donation to the charities Bookmooch support ) .
It ’s a system that rewards good practice – and since books fit nicely into small parcels , it operates worldwide .
http://www.bookcrossing.com/
What ’s traded ?
Books .
But in the most fun way possible .
How does it work ?
Welcome to one of my favorite concepts on the web – a place where books are freed into the wild , to not only contain stories but become them , as well .
You register your book onto the site on its own profile , and then you write the book ’s individual Book Crossing identifier and associated web address on the book ’s inside cover , along with a message asking anyone holding the book to go online and register where and how they got it .
Then … you take it somewhere fun , and leave it there .
You update the profile to say where you left it .
And you watch .
With a bit of luck , it ’s the start of an amazing journey !
Meanwhile , you check what books have been “ freed ” in your local area , and you go in search of them .
Awesome fun .
http://www.craigslist.org/
What ’s traded ?
Absolutely everything .
How does it work ?
It ’s the daddy of all bulletin board sites , it ’s the subject of a documentary , it ’s permanently busy ( 20 billion page views a month ) , it ’s simply everywhere … and it ’s a bit of an online Wild West .
Search hard enough and you ’ll find what you want – but there are no safety nets here .
http://www.freecycle.org/
What ’s traded ?
There is nothing that is n’t offered on Freecycle .
It ’s Life in miniature .
How does it work ?
We love Freecycle !
Love it !
Sorry , I could n’t contain myself there .
This is a colossal ( 4,000 + groups , 6 million + people ) network of non-profit recycling hubs , operating as online bulletin boards .
Everything is given away free .
You log on at key points during the day , scan down the list of offers , spot something you need and leap to the phone , hoping nobody beats you to it .
It ’s also a great way to shift unwanted possessions quickly , for example when you ’re moving house ( I got rid of a single bed in this fashion when I was at University ) .
It ’s all about what someone wants to give away for free .
I ’ve even seen an iBook on there – apparently snapped up in about ten seconds .
http://www.frugalreader.com
What ’s traded ?
Books … and book - related gossip .
How does it work ?
It ’s not just a site to swap books back and forth ( you list the books you have ; other people request them when you ’ve posted your list ; you get credit to request books yourself ) .
It ’s a reading community , with reviews , discussion forums and all sorts of lines of communication at work .
That final “ Relate ” in the tagline is what makes it distinct from its competitors .
http://www.house4trade.com
What ’s traded ?
Only your home , dude .
No biggie .
How does it work ?
Obviously this is a big deal , in every sense .
This site is all about permanent house trading , and so it ’s really a sophisticated way of getting in contact with people – no PayPal purchasing here – but the backbone of the site is a very real Real Estate Network .
http://www.makeupalley.com/swap/
What ’s traded ?
Well , now , this should polarize you .
Fancy putting on the slightly used makeup of a stranger ?
How does it work ?
You browse the items on offer – you find something of your own that the swapper would be willing to accept in return – and off you go .
The FAQ notes that all swapped items should be cleaned with alcohol before swapping , and only unused mascara should be swapped , but even so , there will be some people who will flinch .
Since there ’s a feedback system and therefore an element of accountability , there ’s probably little to fear .
Satisfied or disappointed swappers can also air their views on a product review page .
http://www.paperbackswap.com/index.php
What ’s traded ?
Right there in the title .
How does it work ?
Credits , that ’s how .
When you successfully send away a requested book for trade , your account swells by one credit ( or two , if it ’s an audio book ) .
And if you spot a book on offer , it costs you one credit to complete the process .
You can also put in a standing order for a book that ’s not yet available – which is unlikely , as there are over 3 million titles in there .
How much media coverage has this service enjoyed ?
Maybe all of it .
http://www.readitswapit.co.uk/
What ’s traded ?
Books books books .
How does it work ?
Running since 2003 , this is a veteran of the swapping scene ( but note the dot - co - dot - uk … yes , it ’s Brits - only , I ’m afraid ) .
Want a particular book ?
You click through The Library , their swap - enabled directory of books , and you choose .
The person whose book it is gets confirmation that you want to swap – and checks out what books you have on offer .
If there ’s a meeting of needs – swap ahoy .
It ’s all free – the only payment ReadItSwapIt asks for is a voluntary donation to a registered charity .
http://rehashclothes.com/
What ’s traded ?
Clothes and books .
How does it work ?
Rehash is in it for the good of the environment ( their recycling - style logo is a big clue ) .
When you “ rehash ” ( i.e. put up for swap ) an item , it ’s listed as a page in the site ’s Trading Post hub , and people make offers that you can flick through and weigh up .
Once you ’ve confirmed a mutually acceptable deal , the mechanics of getting item to new owner are left completely up to you .
The site also has a nice line in community - based activities and reference resources .
http://seedypeople.co.uk
What ’s traded ?
Unwanted bags of seeds – anything from vegetables to trees .
How does it work ?
Unfortunately , by the looks of it , it is n’t working – there ’s not much going on in that site right now .
But it ’s such a fun idea that I felt it worth including for the concept alone .
Trading plant seeds has terrific potential ( although food - related legislation might be a hurdle to clear ) – and postage ?
Cost of a stamp .
http://www.swapace.com
What ’s traded ?
Everything under the sun .
How does it work ?
Want the push & pull of a negotiated deal ?
This is the place for you , because you do n’t swap based on existing predetermined values – you decide how much your swap is worth , by haggling ( using their fancy electronic negotiation system ) .
When you both see eye to eye , the swap can take place – accompanied with the quiet satisfaction of knowing you gave it your best shot .
http://swapcove.com/
What ’s traded ?
In theory , anything you like , large or small .
( Since it ’s new , it ’s still sparsely - populated ) .
How does it work ?
There are no points , no credits …it ’s all about how much you think your swappable item is worth .
You use this SF - based site to come to an arrangement on your terms only .
It looks nice , there are plenty of great features ( such as finding deals within so many miles of your home ) – but right now it ’s waiting for enough people to bring it alive .
One to watch .
http://www.swapcycle.co.uk/
What ’s traded ?
Anything goes , it looks like .
How does it work ?
If you ’re in the UK , you can use it to offer goods or services by making a formal trade offer to someone , in exchange for their goods / services .
If they decline , you can open an e-mail and start negotiating , or move along to a more successful attempt .
Some of the offers on here are fascinating broad ( “ Wanted : anything with an engine in it ” ) and the front page is rather tatty , but it looks like a good place to check out for cars , clothes and mobile phones .
http://www.swapstyle.com
What ’s traded ?
In a word , glam .
Clothes , accessories , cosmetics , shoes .
How does it work ?
You build up your swapping potential by gaining a positive feedback score , so that other people can see you ’re a trustworthy recipient of their fashion triumphs .
You can also go for Address Verification status , which is a physical letter containing a code that once entered , confirms you ’re where you say you are .
Once you ’re trusted and verified , you never have to wear the same thing twice and you can keep your principles intact .
http://www.swapthing.com
What ’s traded ?
Mainly music , but generally a bit of everything in the realm of the small to medium - sized .
How does it work ?
This site is much more eBay - esque in that you can offer an item for swapping , but also choose to sell it , transacting via PayPal .
There ’s no fancy automated bartering engine behind the scenes : you create adverts , you sift through e-mails , and you move items and / or money around .
It ’s strictly hands - on , so if you ’re a control freak , this is the one for you .
http://www.swaptree.com
What ’s traded ?
Books , music , film & television DVDs , and video games .
How does it work ?
It ’s all about the barcode .
Input the UPC or the ISBN from the back of the item you have , and the fancymajiggery behind the scenes at Swaptree will find what items are offered for trade in return , and display them Amazon - style down the screen .
What ’s more , it ’ll keep searching while you ’re logged off , meaning you ’re faced with a new list of potential swaps every time you log on .
Specific to entertainment media – but brilliant at what it does .
http://www.tradeaway.com/
What ’s traded ?
Things from the very , very small to the astounding large .
How does it work ?
“ World ’s Largest Online Barter Exchange Auction Site ” , TradeAway boldly claims .
It ’s big , we ’ll give them that , but that big ?
Anyway , there ’s plenty to see here .
Listings range from the so - brief - they - must - be - spam all the way to exhaustively detailed multimillion - dollar property offers , but the theme is bartering .
It ’s true : this is where hugely expensive real estate gets swapped !
http://www.u-exchange.com
What ’s traded ?
Items big and small , including vehicles – and homes , just for the holidays .
How does it work ?
It ’s up to you – what this site does is put you in touch with a wide range of bartering services , and provide you with a profile on which you can flag up your status ( Trading or Away ) – but that ’s it .
Less a specific service , more a gateway to lots of them .
http://www.whatsmineisyours.com/
What ’s traded ?
Fashion !
How does it work ?
This site is based in Britain but most items seem to have overseas delivery as an option .
As a trader , you put a detailed advert up , attach a price to it for comparative reasons , and mention what items you ’re interested in acquiring in return .
Then you wait for an offer , tailored to the price or your item ( or perhaps attempting to haggle you down a little ) .
Or , if you want to get even more organized , you can set up a Boutique , rather like a shop in eBay .
Bags are the most popular trading item .

A goal without a plan is just a wish .
Antoine de Saint - Exupery
To be successful in your life , you need to have a life plan .
Without a plan , many of your dreams will only be dreams .
A life plan , on the other hand , will help you turn your dreams into reality .
It works because it gives you not a just a destination , but also a way to get there .
A life plan does n’t have to be complicated .
It should answer just two questions :
What is your destination ?
How will you get there ?
Let ’s look at them one by one .
What is Your Destination ?
You should know where you are going .
Not knowing your destination is a mistake because you may end up in the wrong place .
You need to know where you want to go so that you do n’t waste your time and effort .
Here are some tips related to finding your destination :
1. Create your life map
To see how your life will be in the future , it ’s helpful to see how your life has been in the past .
By creating a life map , you can see patterns in your life that help you find out where you should go .
Look backward , connect the dots in your life , and project them into the future .
Further reading :
2 . Find your life purpose
Your life purpose gives you meaning in everything you do .
It helps you do what matters to you and makes your life fulfilling .
Without a purpose , you may achieve much but feel empty inside .
Take the time to find your purpose in life .
Further reading :
3 . Discover your big dreams
The size of your dreams has a lot to do with living in mediocrity .
If your dreams are small , there is no reason for you to move past mediocrity .
It ’s easier to just live a comfortable life .
On the other hand , if your dreams are big , you have to move past mediocrity to make your dreams come true .
So discover the big dreams in you .
4 . Make short - term goals
You should know what your final destination is , but you should also have milestones along the way .
These milestones help you stay on track .
They help you know whether or not you are on the right path to reach your destination .
You create the milestones by breaking your long - term goals into short - term ones .
What do you want to achieve this year ?
What do you want to achieve this month ?
What do you want to achieve today ?
5. Keep refining
Knowing your destination is a process .
If you are like me , you will refine your destination over time .
It ’s like zooming in a picture .
At first you see the big picture , but after zooming it in you can see its details .
Similarly , perhaps you can only see the big picture of your destination now .
That ’s fine .
Follow it .
Along the way , you will find clues that make the picture clearer .
How Will You Get There ?
After knowing your destination , you need to know how to get there .
Here are some tips related to it :
1. Find and communicate your personal brand
To achieve your goals , you need to market yourself .
You need to find the unique value you can provide to others and communicate it .
This way people know that they can come to you to meet their needs .
Further reading :
2 . Have some guiding principles
There are a lot of distractions along the way to your destination .
To prevent yourself from being distracted , you need to have some guiding principles .
You need to identify the value you believe in .
These principles help you stay true to yourself in everything you do .
3 . Find your deliberate practice
Doing deliberate practice is important if you want to be remarkable .
Deliberate practice is the kind of practice that stretches the boundaries of your capabilities .
A good rule of thumb is you need about 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to become a world - class expert in a field .
Find out where you should invest that 10,000 hours .
Further reading :
4 . Use tacking strategy
The world constantly changes so you need to constantly adapt .
That ’s why tacking – a term taken from the world of sailing – is a good strategy to apply .
With tacking you set a short - term objective , work hard to achieve it , evaluate your performance , and adjust accordingly .
Further reading :
Executing Your Life Plan
After knowing your destination and how to get there , you need to execute your plan .
Here are some tips on executing your life plan :
1. Focus
There is no question that focus is essential to achieve your goals .
Without focus , you will spread your effort and attention too thin and eventually achieve nothing .
Be careful though .
You should be focused but not obsessed .
Further reading :
2 . Be persistent
You should be persistent because failure is inevitable on your way to success .
Without persistence , it ’s easy to get discouraged in the face of failure and stop before reaching your destination .
Have faith and keep pushing forward .
Further reading :
3. Build relationships
Nobody can succeed alone .
You need the support of other people to succeed .
So build your network before you need it .
Further reading :
4. Start now
A good plan vigorously executed right now is far better than a perfect plan executed next week .
George S. Patton
Do n’t wait until your plan is perfect before you start .
Do n’t wait for the perfect time .
Start now .
You will learn more by doing than by waiting .
The Pentagon is adding a new compound to its pain ray .
Eventually , it might help make the weapon become smaller , more powerful , and easier to deploy abroad .
But for now , the U.S. military wo n't say much about the compound , at all .
The Active Denial System is a non-lethal ray gun that heats the outer surface of the skin – a painful but ( mostly ) harmless experience -– using microwaves .
But the thing is a little unwieldy for battlefield use .
( And let 's not even get into the public perception concerns . )
So we were interested to see that Active Denial - maker Raytheon was recently granted a military contract to develop a new " solid state source for use in non-lethal weapons . "
It relies on gallium nitride , a hard , stable material with a huge heat capacity .
A second contract , this one with Darpa , involves developing gallium nitride ( GaN ) as a semiconductor for missile defense radars .
The GaN device looks very promising for high - power microwave amplification and will produce millimeter waves , just like the existing Active Denial System . *
But the military has dropped a cloak of secrecy over the new technology .
Raytheon told me that due to the " classified nature of the program , " little information is available .
All the company would say was that " GaN will impact a range of military electronic systems , including communications , radar and electronic warfare . "
However , the cone of silence is far from air - tight .
The existing Active Denial System is a huge device that travels in a shipping container and costs millions .
Elsewhere , the Raytheon press machine explained that GaN will help change that .
" Our ... high frequency , millimeter - wave GaN [ will ] provide the warfighter with a lower - cost , lighter - weight , non-lethal engagement alternative , " said company exec Michael Del Checcolo .
In addition , in an interview with Mass High Tech , John Finkenaur , the Active Denial System ( ADS ) project manager reveals that not only will the GaN technology make the device smaller and lighter , it will also remove the need for supercooling which previously made it difficult to operate the ADS on hot days .
More importantly , using gallium nitride reduces the two - hour warmup time it takes for a gyrotron ADS to become usable after powering on .
I
do n’t recall that two - hour warmup being mentioned previously -– it sounds like one of those small quirks of the system that manufacturers only drop in when they 're trying to sell you the next , upgraded version .
It 's another sign that the non-lethal weapons community is fixed on the idea of a skin - heating pain beam , but is not satisfied with the current technology .
Gallium Nitride offers another possible way forward , on top of the sheet beam klystons and infra-red lasers we 've seen previously .
Different technologies may work better at different scales .
GaN technology could give us small , efficient Active Denial weapons
–- small enough to be installed as a non-lethal option in existing vehicles ( lack of this technology meant the previous small pain beam built for Project Sheriff was not powerful enough ) .
If successful , the technology will doubtless feed into the portable active denial systemprogram , adding a pain beam option to the police 's existing arsenal of Tasers , pepper spray , bean bags and batons .
In the longer run , the technology will also have many other spin - offs - – advanced sensors using millimeter - wave radar , more compact communications with longer ranges , and even domestic applications .
In
1947 , the original microwave ovenwas a spin - off from Raytheon 's radar ( that 's why they called it
" Radarange " ) .
GaN technology may give us portable microwave ovens as well as theultimate burglar deterrent ... and the idea of ultra-efficient microwave central heating that just warms up peoplerather than empty space might even be revived .
* The Air Force likes to claim that millimeter waves are not microwaves - – but as microwaves are generally described as any electromagnetic waves with a wavelength between one millimeter and meter , millimeter waves are microwaves , just as shortwave and longwave are still radio waves .

AUSTRALIAN children are exposed to about 2200 junk food advertisements on television each year , according to a study .
The study has renewed calls from health and consumer groups for a government ban on junk food advertising during peak children 's viewing times to help fight obesity .
Launching a campaign yesterday to raise awareness of the amount of junk food advertising directed at children , a coalition of more than 15 organisations , including the Cancer Council , pointed to research that children who watch two hours of television a day could be exposed to up to 2200 junk food ads a year .
The Cancer Council NSW and the University of Sydney carried out the study .

When he's not blowing things up , making models , or otherwise holding the job you wish you had , Adam Savage is serious about personal projects .
We chatted with him about MythBusters , managing time , and other geeky stuff .
Photo by ensceptico .
Savage was raised by a father who worked as a painter , filmmaker , and animator , and a psychotherapist mother .
In his own career , Savage has worked as a graphic designer , carpenter , stage designer , toy crafter , welder , and , since 1993 , special - effects consultant for the film industriy , including stints with the Star Wars prequels , Terminator 3 , and the Matrix sequels .

But you probably know him best from the Discovery Channel 's MythBusters , which takes those legends you 've had Re : Fwd : Fwd'ed to you , stuck in your memory from grade school , or otherwise circulating around the realms of science and puts the screws to them — quite literally , sometimes .
Savage and co-host Jamie Hyneman , along with a three - person " build team , " tear into and explain all sorts of scientific and maker - friendly topics on the show , but always with a mind for safety and education .
We spoke with Savage by phone last week , and the edited ( mostly for length and clarity ) transcript follows :

I know I should n't say this , but , when it comes to a lot of sites , I do some self - filtering .
On the show site , the Discovery forums , or anywhere that 's writing about ( MythBusters ) , I do n't ever read any of the comments sections .

Lifehacker : I could guess why , but , why ?
Adam Savage :
While 90 percent of what is up there is positive , every now and then , someone posts something just nasty .
And it can actually interrupt what works for me as the flow of the show ...
Someone in a comment once pointed out all my verbal tics in certain episodes .
We were filming a week later , and I found myself editing myself ahead of time while I was talking to the camera .
Why am I doing that , to prove one anonymous person wrong ?
A friend of mine has this tactic of , whenever someone says something intentionally difficult during a conversation , he 'll say , " You have something in your teeth . "
That pretty much kills any aggressiveness that was going , and I guess I wish we had that ability online ...
Stuff like that is the reason I find myself gravitating toward Twitter .

Lifehacker :
Why that platform , in particular ?
Adam Savage :
It 's just an idealized version of the comments section .
It moves quickly , you 're engaged in this ongoing dialog , this general conversation between the show and the fans that I 'm really enjoying .

Lifehacker :
What 's your preferred computer platform ?
Well , to start , Mac or PC ?
Advertisement
Adam Savage : Mac , 100 percent .
I made a Tweet the other day , because someone had sent me an Excel document , I grabbed it and opened it , and watched my home machine just burn and grind trying to open it with Excel .
So , I sent out , " Oh , Microsoft , is there anything you CAN do ? "
It 's ridiculous .
I learned about OpenOffice through Twitter , and it just amazes me .
On my Mac , a super - fast 17 " laptop , a video editor takes less time and power to run than an Office product .
... My main browser stays Camino .
I like it , it suits me better than most things ... and , yeah , it 's really fast .
Every once in a while , like 1 out of 80 pages , it will have trouble with something , but it 's no big thing to jump over to Safari in those rare cases .

Lifehacker : Really ?
No Firefox extensions have tempted you away ?
Adam Savage : I have n't really gotten into any of that extension stuff .
I have n't even really spent the time to learn the Gmail shortcuts .
As I 'm cruising through 70 to 80 emails a day , I 'm seeing a lot of information out there , but only occasionally learning a new piece that I really want to adapt to .
Advertisement
...
There end up being places where I 'm completely involved in adjusting my interface .
My Mac desktop , for instance , I hardly ever see it .
The programs I 've always got open , Adobe Bridge , Camino , and Stickies , they 're constantly open .
Adobe Bridge is the most vital management tool I have .
I collect a whole lot of stuff , download it , combine it , create smaller temporary files .
The desktop becomes the repository , and Bridge is how I get through all of it .
Lifehacker :
What does a typical work day schedule look like for you ?
Advertisement
Adam Savage : I have split custody with twin 10 - year - old boys that I have every other week .
Those weeks , I 'm up at 6:30 or 7 to see them off , and then I 'm usually at work about a half - hour early , to adjust to any show emails or other things .
That 's also when I try to kick out any personal stuff or projects .
Jamie and I also have a production manager who oversees our time for stuff that 's extracurricular to actual MythBusters shooting ...
We shoot MythBusters nine hours a day , five days a week .
You hear stories about Hollywood shows going for 14 - hour days , but Jamie and I realized early on that we can't work that way , and a regular schedule was really important .
Advertisement
Lifehacker :
It 's probably a matter of safety , too .
I would n't want to be tired doing some of the stuff you do on the show .
Adam Savage :
We take those kinds of factors very seriously .
When we know we 're going to do something on the show that requires real attention , we do n't put too much before it .
Your brain gets real spongy after that amount of work .
Keeping regular hours ends up being totally critical to the quality and flow of the show ... and the other thing for me is the twin boys .
I made a personal commitment to myself , and for them .
I have the odd business trip or two , and I travel a tremendous amount , but it really has n't cut into my family time .

Lifehacker : How do you plan out a season of MythBusters ?
How much can you plan ahead , and how much space do you leave yourself to explore stuff you had n't anticipated ?
Advertisement
Adam Savage :
The flow of the season happens very much like the flow of an episode .
We 'll plot out a straight line through an episode , or a season , then it changes radically , constantly .
The story list for the next full season , for example , had 60 stories .
That came from a master list of about 130 , 140 items , from which we 'll choose 60 .
As we film that season , we 'll end up following maybe 40 of those , but then 20 new items come up during shooting .
All it takes is one more news story for me to realize how I could dig into something .
...
There 's also room for totally randoms stuff .
Jamie came up with this idea of proving you could build a working ship out of wood pulp and water , during the Alaska episode .
What we built was stupendous , and what we built was n't on anybody 's list .
It normally takes about 9 or 10 days to finish a story , but we try to be flexible .
We find a story sometimes we just do n't want to sink our teeth into or , more often , need to give more juice to .
We had one thing , duct tape , slotted as a three - day story , but we realized that is not a small story .
We can turn on the idea that duct tape can do almost anything .
So we turned out this episode that takes duct tape to the absolute edge of its performance capabilities .

Lifehacker : Like whether it can really cure warts ?
Adam Savage : Ooh , no , we did n't , but that 's a good one .
Lifehacker :
One of the things that 's unique about the show is the failures , or at least the things that do n't turn out the way you guys seemed to plan it .
You 'll be firing stuff into ballistics gel and , halfway through an episode , realize your first theory on something is just completely dead .
It seems like everything else on TV is just so determined to deliver exactly what everyone expects .
Advertisement
Adam Savage : Right .
One of my favorite parts of this show is that it's an accurate depiction of how ( experiments ) are going .
That said , we are aware that we 're telling a story , but ...
We were doing this myth out at Fort Mason .
We 'd made all these plans to perform an experiment in this specific way , we spent a full day of prep to get this experiment working in this specific fashion .
Then we realized that the whole thing we 're trying to show would be visible in the high - speed camera anyways .
So we ended up with an entirely different direction to take .
Does that mean a lot of the show is shaped in the editing room ?
Adam Savage :
Well , you should know that Jamie and I do n't have a direct hand in editing .
For a typical episode , we 'll deliver 25 - 30 hours of footage from as many as 16 different cameras ...
You might notice that the show now , as opposed to earlier seasons , includes more talking to the camera directly .
That 's partly because the editors would get all this footage , but we have n't made it exactly clear what we were doing .
What we get back after sending it off is a first version that 's extremely long , and then the production team has to make the hard decisions .
We get a bit more involved with the rough cut before it goes to Discovery , where we can point out bits of science to include , say that things are n't properly highlighted , advocate for a particular sequence .
Then you get the responses , which explain what else has to be sacrificed to fit things in .

Lifehacker :
What kinds of pet projects do you have going on at home , or on the side ?
Adam Savage : I 'm constantly doing little pod projects .
I did a series of talks , culminating in a speech you can see on the TED web site ( Note : Embedded below ) about my obsession with the Maltese Falcon ... about how I wanted to make a perfect one , and how I find diving into the extreme details of something like that very rewarding .
Advertisement
Note : Savage 's EG Conference talk also reveals a bit about his work flow and thought collection processes , and how he stocks his " CREATIVE PROJECTS " folder for the future .
Click to view
Lifehacker : How so ?
Adam Savage :
It 's the same thing I love about model making , when I worked in the film industry .
There 's a narrative going on with any object , and the object only really works if the narrative has some veracity to it .
There is n't a model maker in the world who 's created a space ship that could n't tell you , at least on a rough level , why all those parts and details are there , what they do , and the stories of how they got there .

...
Things like owning my own Time Bandits map .
Or a leather bullwhip , which I built myself because I could n't afford one .
I always have a couple of projects going , some I 've been working on for a couple of weeks , maybe a year , or sometimes 10 years going after I started them .
My time on the internet , my time to myself , I always spend some of it doing research on everything I need to know about whatever it is I 'm working on .
If I 'm making something , it almost always includes making two of them , start to finish , because you always learn during the first try that now you really know what you need for the full thing .
It 's a self - imposed sissyphean task , I know , trying to get everything in , but it 's a hugely satisfying thing .
...
One of the ways ( Jamie and I ) work so well together is that we 're the same way about projects — we have to get what we need to know to get going .
Once I 've got a piece of furniture really in my head , cutting up the pieces of wood to make it is trivial .
But until it 's in my head , it 's just grueling .
We 've often said this , but if you measure our adrenaline levels throughout filming an episode , we 're often far more excited while researching and planning a big thing then when we 're on set and actually doing it .

Lifehacker :
What can we look for in the new season ?
( Note : Starting April 8 )
Adam Savage :
The new season 's going to be phenomenal .
We did a two - hour disaster special , where we actually took on the bus turn from the movie Speed , which involved me and Jamie getting to do some terrible things to a full - size bus .
The one we were doing out at Fort Mason ...
One of my favorite ( experiment ) categories over the past couple of years has been thought experiments .
Things like , if a plane is on a conveyor belt , will it take off ?
One of those we had n't tackled yet was , if you drop a bullet , and fire a bullet , from the exact same height , at the exact same time , they will both hit the ground at the exact same time .
Advertisement
Lifehacker :
That 's a classic of 11th - grade physics .
Adam Savage : Yeah , except the fired bullet is however many thousands of feet away .
This is something I 've been wanting to do for years .
Last year , during a story discussion , Jamie and I hammered out a way to do it in full scale , and , last week , we tried it out .
I 'm not going to tell you how it turns out , but I can guarantee you , nobody else has ever wasted their time trying to get the shot that we 've got .

Somebody 's mother in Wisconsin found an old Nokia 6810 in a bag of freshly opened Clancy 's Ripples .
Wow , people actually still rock those old brick phones ?
Yes , people who work in potato chip factories do .
The phone , which did n't work , was slathered with " greasy potato - chip film " and looked like it once lived on a belt clip .
" You kind of do n't want chips for a while " after something like that , she said .
Schweiger is n't sure what she 'll do next but hopes the FDA can track down the owner of the phone .
She 's glad she found the phone and not a child who might have put it in his or her mouth , she said .
She 's also glad the phone was n't in a product she would have heated , she said .
Schweiger does n't know when she 'll have an appetite for potato chips again , but when she does , she 'll do things a little differently .
" I will never , ever eat chips out of a bag again , " she said .
" They will be dumped in the bowl . "
Wow , could you be any less grateful ?
You opened a bag of chips , found a prize , and then complained about it .
Congratulations , you just won the lottery !
" I dunno , I 'm starting to wish I 'd picked different numbers .... "
Seriously though , are you gonna eat those ?

NIGHTS have been so chilly this month that I ’ve held off planting heat - lovers like tomatoes and peppers .
But I started them from seed two months ago in the greenhouse and now they ’re pawing at the door .
They ’re starting to flower .
They ’re too big for their pots .
So when Memorial Day rolled in , I wished my babies good luck and planted my salsa garden : three kinds of chilies , or hot peppers ; two sweet - pepper varieties ; two paste tomatoes , and one big juicy heirloom .
I ’m growing about a dozen varieties of heirloom tomatoes this year , but my favorites for salsa are San Marzano , an Italian plum tomato that ripens to a brilliant red with clusters of five or six fruits on a vine , and Amish Paste , a large oblong tomato with a deep , sweet flavor .
Both are meaty types that do n’t turn to pulp when chopped , and are delicious cooked or raw .
For contrasting color , I ’m growing Yellow Brandywine , a juicy tomato with a rich flavor often lacking in yellow varieties .
Must - haves for chilies include jalapeño , a blunt three - inch pepper that can be harvested any time as it ripens from green to red ; habanero , a wrinkled little fruit that can cause serious pain , so beware ; and ancho-poblano , a heart - shaped flattened four - incher that is relatively cool for a hot chili .
( When green , it is known as poblano ; as it ripens to red , it is called ancho and can be dried for storage and used in smoky moles . )
It is well past time for real Democrats and even Hopium addled Dimocrats to oppose Barack Obama .
It is well past time for Republicans to recognize how they hurt the country when they abandoned their alleged principles with unwavering support of irresponsible , if not criminal , George W. Bush policies and begin to intelligently oppose Barack Obama .
Democrats , Dimocrats , and Republican must realize the essential facts about Obama : ( 1 ) Obama is a flim - flam man ; ( 2 ) Obama is a confidence artist who only cares about his advancement ; ( 3 ) Obama race - baited his way , with help from powerful Dimocrats like Dean / Brazile / Pelosi / Kennedy / Kerry to the Democratic nomination ; ( 4 ) It was only disgust with George W. Bush and the massive economic crisis during the last month of the election that allowed Obama to overcome John McCain ’s lead ; ( 5 ) Obama employs distraction as a key weapon to forswear responsibility ; ( 6 ) Obama never takes responsiblity .
Further , Democrats , Dimocrats , and Republicans must realize that
Obama simply cannot be trusted .
Obama can not be trusted on any issue .
Obama can not be trusted by his friends .
Obama can not be trusted by his enemies .
Obama can not be trusted .
* * *
Barack Obama , like George W. Bush , is employing fear to ram through wasteful spending and long repressed Democratic wish - lists .
Democrats who rejoice in the looting of the American economy today will in the very very near future rue their support of Obama in the same way Republicans today rue their support of George W. Bush .
On September 11 , 2001 when the planes brought down the World Trade Center towers Americans united behind George W. Bush .
Prominent Democrats ( like Rosie O’Donnell and Barbra Streisand ) and powerful Democratic elected officials joined with Republicans in calls for unity .
Unity was a big mistake .
What Americans needed was accountability and rational thought followed by action .
But no , the demands for “ Unity ” cowed Democrats and emboldened Republicans .
George W. Bush used the national emergency to evade responsibility for the massive national security intelligence failure .
George W. Bush also attacked the halcyon Bill Clinton presidency in order to evade his responsibility to the American people .
However , George W. Bush bore ultimate responsiblity for the massive intelligence failure which took down the massive World Trade Center towers .
Bush tried to place the blame on Bill Clinton for Bush failures for years .
Now Obama tries the same trick and blames George W. Bush .
But the White House desk has a sign “ The Buck Stops Here “ .
In other words there is no passing the buck , no passing on of responsibility .
The man ( and it is a man ) behind the desk bears the responsibility .
Obama will never accept responsibility though , he never has .
Ask the freezing tenants in his Chicago district .
George W. Bush used the crisis of September 11 , 2001 to push through the wish lists of the neo- conservatives ; now Dimocrats want to push their wish lists using the economic crisis .
Obama continues to blame George W. Bush even though the elections were held over 4 months ago .
The political campaign lasted for years .
Obama understood , or said he understood , the problems America faced .
Obama also chest - thumped and said he too would be ready on Day 1 .
Obama was not ready on Day 1 nor is Obama ready today .
What Americans are witnessing is the politics of distraction and the dangers of the Obama cult of personality .
The American people desperately need an economic policy .
Obama will distract and take a trip to Europe at the end of March with Mary Todd Michelle Obama .
The purpose of the Obama European Vacation is distraction .
There is no economic policy nor plan for America .
There is a tourist itinerary and doll houses on the White House lawn instead .
Bill Clinton “ Put People First ” .
Cult of Personality Obama prefers to Put Obama First .
Bill Clinton cared about policy and his first thoughts and appointments were directed towards appointments to policy positions .
With Obama we witness continued chaos in policy and in the government departments because Cult of Personality Obama gave priority to his White House staff .
Americans need an economic plan and intelligent economic policies instead we have more “ quits ” .
While Sanjay Gupta ’s departure has little economic effect ( it is interesting that Gupta quit on the day of the so - called Health Care Summit ) other “ quits ” do matter .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithnerâ€™s top pick to be his deputy withdrew from consideration Thursday , a setback for the agency as it confronts the worst financial crisis in decades .
Annette Nazareth , a former senior staffer and commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission , withdrew after several interviews and vetting of her financial history , a person familiar with Nazarethâ€™s decision said .[ snip ]
Nazarethâ€™s withdrawal from consideration comes as critics say Geithnerâ€™s lacks the senior staff he needs to make critical decisions about the financial crisis .
Not one of his top 17 deputies has been named , let alone confirmed .
Without senior leadership , lower - level Treasury employees canâ€™t make decisions or represent the government in crucial conversations with banks and others .
At a Senate hearing Thursday about failed insurance giant American International Group Inc. â€ ” which has received four separate bailouts totaling more than $ 170 billion â€ ” Sen.
Chris Dodd said he had asked Treasury for someone to appear , but that no one was available .
Nazareth was not the only “ quit ” yesterday .
Mr. Geithnerâ€™s pick for undersecretary for international affairs , Caroline Atkinson , has also withdrawn .
The responsiblity for the economy and fully staffing the government unfortunately belongs to Obama .
Bill Clinton is not responsible for the current mess .
George W. Bush is not responsible for the current mess .
The mess now belongs exclusively to Barack Obama .
Bill Clinton Put People First , Cult of Personality Obama Puts Obama First .
We wrote about Bill Clinton ’s concern for policy and Barack Obama ’s concern for himself a short time ago :
Ambinderâ€™s protection of Obama actually highlights that Obamaâ€™s much ballyhooed â€œgreatest transition everâ€ focused on the White House staff which still managed to bungle .
Ambinderâ€™s protection of Obama highlights that Bill Clinton cared and focused on POLICY .
That is the difference – POLICY .
Hillary Clinton cares and focuses on POLICY .
Our comments were precipitated by Marc Ambinder ’s fawn over Obama which unwittingly exposed the non-entity which is Barack Obama :
Remember how bad that Clinton transition was ?
All the nominee juggling .
The stronger - than - expected prerogatives of Congress ?
Early White House chaos ?
Communications problems ?
The point is : transitions are very hard .
Maybe it ’s not fair to compare them .
Depending upon your point of view , Obama ’s transition was stunningly efficient ( thanks in large part to the Bush White House ) or it vindicated the decisions that Clinton ’s planners made .
In late 1992 , Clinton decided to focus on cabinet nominees and policy first , and put off the organization of the White House staff until later .
Some of Obama ’s policy reviews , by contrast , still have n’t been completed .
The White House staff had weeks to prepare , but in retrospect , the building is like a gravity field operating on energy : everything slows down , regardless of input .
Metrics do n’t tells us everything either ; by this point in 1993 , every cabinet member sans one — the Attorney General — was confirmed .
Here we are in March still waiting for “ policy reviews ” and the White House staff which Obama gave priority to is a mess and the rest of the government is non-existent .
The Treasury Department continues to be a one - man operation and no plan nor policy is present .
Obama , as usual will take a trip .
A flim - flam man is always on the run .
Obama is taking a trip .
Mary Todd Michelle Obama presumably is exercising her arms and ordering new sleeveless dresses to display .
The economy … well the economy has become the Obama “ Did I do that ?
Urkel economy .
The Barack Obama / Urkel “ take no responsiblity ” economy .
Businesses and predatory lenders who looted the economy continue to loot the economy and instead of accountability they are rewarded with taxpayer dollars .
651,000 jobs were lost in February and unemployment is the highest since 1983 at 8.1 percent .
“ There is no light at the end of the tunnel with these numbers , ” said Nigel Gault , economist at IHS Global Insight .
“ Job losses were everywhere and there ’s no hope for a turnaround any time soon . ”
Food stamp enrollment is up to 31.8 million ( up 700,000 in one month ) .
The FDIC which insures banks , as we wrote yesterday , will soon be penniless and will borrow $ 500 Billion .
Obama is taking a trip .
Barack Obama / Urkel now has the distinction of presiding over his own bear market – The Obama Bear Market .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20 percent since Inauguration Day , the fastest drop under a newly elected president in at least 90 years , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
The gauge has lost 53 percent from its October 2007 record of 14,164.53 , slipping 4.1 percent to 6,594.44 yesterday .
More than $ 1.6 trillion has been erased from U.S. equities since Jan. 20 as mounting bank losses and rising unemployment convinced investors the recession is getting worse .
The president is in danger of breaking a pattern in which the Dow rallied 9.8 percent on average in the 12 months after a Democrat captured the White House , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
â€ œObama should be listening to the stock market more than talking to it , â€ said Kenneth Fisher , the billionaire chairman of Woodside , California - based Fisher Investments Inc. , which oversees $ 22 billion .
â€ œHe hasnâ€™t gotten out of the gate well.â€ 
Obama is not ready .
Not on Day 1 , not on Day “ infinity ” .
Obama is not ready .
Dimocrats are still making Obama excuses and attacking Pink websites for telling the truth – the Obama Budget : Sleeveless , Clueless , Truthless , Hopeless , Penniless .
Others however are beginning to echo Big Pink :
The specific problems , however , far outweigh the positives .
First are the quite optimistic forecasts , despite the higher taxes and government micromanagement that will harm the economy .
The budget projects a much shallower recession and stronger recovery than private forecasters or the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office are projecting .
It implies a vast amount of additional spending and higher taxes , above and beyond even these record levels .
For example , it calls for a down payment on universal health care , with the additional “ resources ” needed “ TBD ” ( to be determined ) .
Obama dinner partners too are beginning , finally , to echo and repeat Big Pink :
Forget the pork .
Forget the waste .
Forget the 8,570 earmarks in a bill supported by a president who poses as the scourge of earmarks .
Forget the “ $ 2 trillion dollars in savings ” that “ we have already identified , ” $ 1.6 trillion of which President Obama ’s budget director later admits is the “ savings ” of not continuing the surge in Iraq until 2019 — 11 years after George Bush ended it , and eight years after even Bush would have had us out of Iraq completely .
Forget all of this .
This is run -of - the - mill budget trickery .
True , Obama ’s tricks come festooned with strings of zeros tacked onto the end .
But that ’s a matter of scale , not principle .
All presidents do that .
But few undertake the kind of brazen deception at the heart of Obama ’s radically transformative economic plan , a rhetorical sleight of hand so smoothly offered that few noticed .
Krauthammer is echoing our catechism in his own words : Obama ca n’t be trusted .
The markets ’ recent precipitous decline is a reaction not just to the absence of any plausible bank rescue plan , but also to the suspicion that Obama sees the continuing financial crisis as usefully creating the psychological conditions — the sense of crisis bordering on fear - itself panic — for enacting his “ Big Bang ” agenda to federalize and / or socialize health care , education and energy , the commanding heights of post - industrial society .
Clever politics , but intellectually dishonest to the core .
Health , education and energy — worthy and weighty as they may be — are not the cause of our financial collapse .
And they are not the cure .
The fraudulent claim that they are both cause and cure is the rhetorical device by which an ambitious president intends to enact the most radical agenda of social transformation seen in our lifetime .
The Republicans are finally hitting their stride in opposition to Obama .
We have been the very first to write about the multiplying and growing NObama coalitions .
A NObama coalition had a big victory last night which makes Harry Reid look extra foolish after the many times he has said he has the votes , but it has been proven that he does not have the votes .
The big victory against wasteful spending :
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) had been confident Thursday evening that he had the 60 votes needed to cut off debate .
But a half hour after the roll call was to begin , Reid admitted he was still one vote short , forcing a late night meeting in Speaker Nancy Pelosiâ€™s office over where to go next .
The stupidity of the Senate Dimocrats is compounded by their excuses .
Apparently they were too busy at an Obama publicity stunt to get real work done , Part of the confusion may be explained by the fact that so many top senators , including Reid , spent so much of Thursday at a White House summit on health care reform .
Did we mention Obama is taking a trip ?
Obama does not want to get the work done either so he will go off on another publicity stunt instead of getting the job done .
Maybe he will take Senate Dimocrats with him on the publicity tour of Mary Todd Michelle ’s missing Winter sleeves .
Republicans will appropriately be labeled “ hypocrites ” by Dimocrats and Democrats but they are doing the right thing for the American economy .
Now Republican John Boehner is calling for a “ spending freeze ” instead of the wasteful 2009 spending porkfest Obama wants to sign .
Democrats and Republicans need to fight back against the Obama deceptions and gambles .
Some Democrats are beginning to remove themselves from the B.O. stink .
But among people I talk to thereâ€™s a growing sense of frustration , even panic , over Mr. Obamaâ€™s failure to match his words with deeds .
Obama is all talk , and travel , no action .
We have been saying that since April 2007 .
Krugman exposes the fakery at the center of Obama ’s “ plans ” for the economy – one failed plan gets gussied up and paraded as new .
Moneymen however are not fooled .
Even long - time PINOs are moved to reject Obama .
Stuart Taylor :
Having praised President Obama ’s job performance in two recent columns , it is with regret that I now worry that he may be deepening what looks more and more like a depression and may engineer so much spending , debt , and government control of the economy as to leave most Americans permanently less prosperous and less free .
Other Obama - admiring centrists have expressed similar concerns .
Like them , I would like to be proved wrong .
After all , if this president fails , who will revive our economy ?
And when ?
And what kind of America will our children inherit ?
The house is burning down .
It ’s no time to be watering the grass .
But with the nation already plunging deep into probably necessary debt to rescue the crippled financial system and stimulate the economy , Obama ’s proposals for many hundreds of billions in additional spending on universal health care , universal postsecondary education , a massive overhaul of the energy economy , and other liberal programs seem grandiose and unaffordable .
With little in the way of offsetting savings likely to materialize , the Obama agenda would probably generate trillion - dollar deficits with no end in sight , or send middle - class taxes soaring to record levels , or both .
Real Democrats must stand up to the flim - flam man who gambles with the American economy with George W. Bush type panache .
Some real Democrats are joining us in opposition to the flim - flam man and his flim - flam scams
It is not Rush Limbaugh that threatens Obama the most .
It is Democrats who threaten the flim - flam man and his flim - flam scams :
I do n’t like talking politics .
It is personal , but some things are a matter of public record , including my substantial six figure donations to the Democratic Party before I was no longer allowed to contribute by contractual agreement .
I regard two Democratic governors as my friends , and helped back one of them in a major financial way and spoke and campaigned directly for the other .
I also made it clear in a New York magazine article that I favored Obama over McCain because I thought Obama to be a middle - of - the - road Democrat , exactly the kind I have supported all my adult life , although I will admit to being far more left - wing during my teenage years and early 20s .
To be totally out of the closet , I actually embrace every part of Obama ’s agenda , right down to the increase on personal taxes and the mortgage deduction .
I am a fierce environmentalist who has donated multiple acres to the state of New Jersey to keep forever wild .
I believe in cap and trade .
I favor playing hardball with drug companies that hold up the U.S. government with me - too products .
But these are issues that we have no time for now , on the verge of a second Great Depression .
This is an agenda that must be held back for better times .
It is an agenda that at this moment is radical vs. what is called for .
I am proud to have voted for the Obama who I thought understood the need to get us on the right path , and create jobs and wealth before taxing it and making moves that hurt job creation — certainly ones that will outweigh the meager number of jobs he ’s creating .
Most important , I believe his agenda is crushing nest eggs around the nation in loud ways , like the decline in the averages , and in soft but dangerous ways , like in the annuities that ca n’t be paid and the insurance benefits that will be challenging to deliver on .
So I will fight the fight against that agenda .
I will stand up for what I believe and for what I have always believed : Every person has a right to be rich in this country and I want to help them get there .
And when they get there , if times are good , we can have them give back or pay higher taxes .
Until they get there , I do n’t want them shackled or scared or paralyzed .
That ’s what I see now .
If that makes me an enemy of the White House , then call me a general of an army that Obama may not even know exists — tens of millions of people who live in fear of having no money saved when they need it and who get poorer by the day .
Now is not the time for “ unity ” nor silence .
Now is the time for full throated opposition .
Obama is gambling with the American economy and with America itself .
When the first two planes hit , America became tranquilized with the narcotic of silence in the name of patriotism .
The economic planes are hitting now .
Now is not the time for Hopium induced slumber .
Now is the time to strike against the fear mongers and for our future .

We 're not convinced that insiders are really the smart money everyone assumes them to be .
But either way , they 're sending one message : head for the door !
Rather than take advantage of stock prices that are still at historically low valuations , insiders are taking advantage of the aggressive run up in stocks and cashing out .
Bloomberg : Insiders from New York Stock Exchange - listed companies sold $ 8.32 worth of stock for every dollar bought in the first three weeks of April , according to Washington Service , which analyzes stock transactions of corporate insiders for more than 500 institutional clients .
That ’s the fastest rate of selling since October 2007 , when U.S. stocks peaked and the 17 - month bear market that wiped out more than half the market value of U.S. companies began .
The $ 42.5 million in insider purchases through April 20 would represent the smallest amount for a full month since July 1992 , data going back more than 20 years show .
That drop preceded a 2.4 percent slide in the S&P 500 in August 1992 .
For a take on the that 's dripping with snark and sarcasm , see Barron 's Alan Abelson .

A love story between two badly burned koalas rescued from Australia 's deadliest bushfires has provided some heart - warming relief after days of devastation and the loss of over 180 lives .
The story of Sam and her new boyfriend Bob emerged after volunteer firefighter Dave Tree used a mobile phone to film the rescue of the bewildered female .
She was found cowering in a burned out forest at Mirboo North , 90 miles southeast of Melbourne .
Badly burnt koala Bob ( top ) gives his new friend Sam a hug :
Both animals have been taken to a wildlife centre near Melbourne after being rescued from Australia 's deadly bush fires
Photos and a video of Tree , 44 , approaching Sam while talking gently to her , and feeding her water from a plastic bottle as she put her burned claw in his cold , wet hand quickly hit video sharing website YouTube .
But it was after reaching a wildlife shelter that Sam met and befriended Bob , who was saved by wildlife workers on Friday , two days before Sam .
Tree , who has been a volunteer firefighter for 26 years , said it was extremely rare to get so close to a koala so he asked his colleague Brayden Groen , 20 , to film him .
' You can how she stops and moves forward and looks at me .
It was like a look saying
" I can't run , I 'm weak and sore , put me out of my misery " , ' Tree said .
' I yelled out for some water and I sat down with her and tipped the water up .
Recovering : Sam will not be ready to be released into the wild for several months
' It was in my hand and she reached for the bottle then put her right claw into my left hand which was cold so it must have given her some pain relief and she just left it there .
It was just amazing . '
Sam was taken to the Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter in Rawson .
Her story was reminiscent of a koala named Lucky who survived the 2003 bushfires that destroyed about 500 homes and killed four people in the capital of Canberra .
Lucky became a symbol of hope .
Colleen Wood from the Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter that is caring for Sam and Bob said both koalas were doing well while other animals like possums , kangaroos , and wallabies were also starting to emerge from the debris .
Inquisitive : Sam takes a look at the camera - and shows off her badly injured paws which have had to be bandaged
She said Sam had suffered second degree burns to her paws and would take seven to eight months to recover while Bob had three burned paws with third degree burns and should be well enough to return to the bush in about four months .
' They keep putting their arms around each other and giving each other hugs .
They really have made friends and it is quite beautiful to see after all this .
It 's been horrific , ' said Wood .
' Sam is probably aged between two to four going by her teeth and Bob is about four so they have a muchness with each other . '
Wood said about 20 koalas had been brought into her shelter in recent days , several of whom had bonded as koalas are known to clump together , but none had garnered the same attention as the new Internet star Sam .
Internet hit :
The original picture of David Tree sharing his water with Sam .
She was later taken to the rescue centre
Tree , a volunteer with the Country Fire Authority Victoria , has visited Sam since her rescue and was delighted to see she had found a boyfriend in Bob .
' They 've really taken a shine to each other as they are both burnt and share the same burnt smell , ' he said .
' My heart goes out to the people in these fires and this was so innocent so people have used this to distract them from all the sad stuff that has gone on .
' It gives people a bit of hope . '

Empire State Building Begins Huge Energy Efficiency Retrofit
April 6th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
Building to cut energy consumption by nearly 40 % in three years
Officials at New York ’s Empire State Building today unveiled a new process for analyzing and retrofitting existing structures for environmental sustainability .
As central elements of the $ 500 million upgrade program presently underway at New York City ’s tallest building , the program is expected to reduce energy consumption by up to 38 percent , providing a replicable model for similar projects around the world .
The program is being spearheaded by former President Bill Clinton ’s Clinton Climate Initiative , as well as the Rocky Mountain Institute , Johnson Controls Inc. and Jones Lang LaSalle .
“ In this distressed economic climate , there is a tremendous opportunity for cities and building owners to retrofit existing buildings to save money and save energy , ” said Mr. Clinton today at the announcement .
“ I ’m proud of the work my foundation ’s climate initiative has done with 40 of the world ’s largest cities , including New York . ”
On the outside , the building will get 6500 windows refurbished into triple - glazed insulated modules , dramatically improving summer and winter efficiency .
On the inside , the 78 year - old building is getting upgraded lighting , lighting controls and lighting design ; upgraded or overhauled furnaces , chillers , and air - handlers .
There will also be an emphasis put on demand - side management systems , allowing tenants to use their energy efficiently .
“ Commercial and residential buildings account for the majority of the total carbon footprint of cities around the world – over 70 percent in New York City , ” said Anthony E. Malkin of building owner , Empire State Building Company .
“ Most new buildings are built with the environment in mind , but the real key to substantial progress is reducing existing building energy consumption and carbon footprint . ”
With an initial estimated project cost of $ 20 million and additional alternative spending in tenant installations , the Empire State Building will save $ 4.4 million in annual energy savings costs , repay its net extra cost in about three years .
Work has already commenced , and building systems work is slated to be completed by year - end 2010 .
The balance of the work in tenant spaces should be concluded by end of 2013 .

A television advertisement for the March issue of Kadokawa Shoten 's Newtype magazine has reportedly revealed that the " true " relaunch of the Haruhi Suzumiya anime series will premiere on television in April .
The March issue will ship on February 10 , and the television advertisement can been viewed for now on Nico Nico Douga website .
( Nico Nico requires viewers to register in Japanese . )
According to the cover , the magazine will detail the staff and story of the new anime project based on Nagaru Tanigawa and Noizi Ito's Haruhi Suzumiya light novels .
The issue will also have an interview with " Brigade Leader 's Assistant " Yasuhiro Takemoto .
Takemoto was an episode director on the first television series , while the Haruhi Suzumiya character is the fictional " brigade leader " of the franchise .
Tanigawa wrote the original light novels about an eccentric , assertive girl who creates her own school club ( " S.O.S. Brigade " ) to plan and execute her strange antics .
America 's Little , Brown Books for Young Readers will publish the light novels in English starting this April , while Yen Press is publishing Gaku Tsugano 's manga version .
The first television anime series aired in Japan in 2006 , and Bandai Entertainment released it in North America in 2007 .
Since the first series , the creators have been dropping hints about more anime projects .
One of the first indications came in a cryptic December 2007 website update that listed Takemoto as the director of a new project and hinted at a story based on the fourth light novel , The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya .
Another web update last May relisted Takemoto as the " brigade leader 's assistant . "
Two spinoff manga , Puyo's Suzumiya Haruhi - chan no Yūutsu four - panel gag manga and Eretto's Nyorōn Churuya - san parody manga , are being adapted into web anime that will premiere on February 13 .
Source : 2ch
Update : More background information added .
Update 2 : The J - Cast News website reports that it contacted a public relations representative from the Kadokawa Shoten Animation Group , and the representative said the group is absolutely not making an announcement now .
On the topic of the April television debut , the representative reportedly said , " It is a rebroadcast .
It is broadcasting mainly on Teletama and other UHF stations . "

Researchers have found that many people with autism share common genetic variations , a discovery that may improve diagnosis and offers the promise of developing treatments for the frustratingly mysterious disorder .
Their findings , published in the journal Nature , compared the genomes of thousands of autistic people with those of thousands of people without the disorder -- a massive task that new technology has only recently made possible .
The genome is the complex system of DNA coding that builds and runs the human body .
The review showed that most autistic people examined have a genetic variation in a portion of their DNA that affects the way brain cells connect with one another .
Scientists also reported a link between autism and small “ mistakes ” in another DNA segment involved with cell communication .
Both reports add weight to the idea that autism is related to problems with the way brain cells connect .
“ It is very exciting , ” said study leader Hakon Hakonarson , director of the Center for Applied Genomics at Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia .
“ It opens up the opportunity someday for new interventions to fix the bad consequences this variant has on brain function and development . ”

A disorder marked by impaired language and ability to interact , autism affects 1 in 150 children in the U.S. , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Up to now , the medical community could say very little about what causes autism or how to treat it .
The lack of scientific knowledge about autism has led to a proliferation of pseudoscientific explanations for the disorder , as well as unproven treatments .
Though this is not the first time geneticists have found a link between autism and DNA , past discoveries have involved extremely rare instances in which a tiny bit of DNA was missing or there were too many copies of another bit .
Those differences were helpful in understanding how trouble in those regions of the genome can lead to autistic symptoms , but they accounted for only a tiny fraction of autism cases .
By contrast , the new research is “ a big step , ” said Thomas Lehner , chief of the Genomics Research Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health .

The first of two Nature studies released Tuesday found that 65 % of autistic participants shared a variation between cadherin 10 and cadherin 9 , a region of the genome that controls cell - adhesion molecules in the brain .
Those molecules help brain cells connect , and autism researchers have long suspected that trouble there may be linked to the disorder .
The second study suggested a link between autism and an excess of genetic material associated with ubiquitin , a protein involved with connections between cells .
The reports also do not explain the rising numbers of diagnosed cases of autism .
That increase may be occurring because of heightened awareness , because the definition of autism has expanded , because of some environmental factor , some combination of these factors or something else entirely .

Size matters in particle physics :
The bigger the machine , the more violently physicists can smash atoms together and break open the deepest mysteries of the subatomic world .
But a revolutionary new technology could eventually render some gargantuan particle accelerators passé .
Using simulations , a team of German and Russian physicists have pioneered a new technique for particle acceleration , called proton - driven plasma - wakefield acceleration ( PWFA ) .
The technique may one day allow machines a fraction of the size of today ’s accelerators to create the highest - energy particles ever .
" This could be a major step forward , " says Allen Caldwell of the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich , coauthor of the study , which appeared in Nature Physics Sunday .
" The dream is that it will lead to much more compact — and therefore much cheaper — electron accelerators . "
Progress in particle physics is contingent on the power of particle accelerators , and as particle colliders grow , the price tag and bureaucratic hurdles grow with them .
Government pocketbooks are becoming increasingly tight — in December both the U.S. and the U.K. pulled out of the proposed $ 7 billion International Linear Collider , which may never actually be built .
So to continue searching for answers to physics ’ greatest questions — dark matter , extra dimensions , supersymmetry — physicists may have to find a fundamentally new way to accelerate particles .
Caldwell and his colleagues hope proton - driven PWFA will pave the way .
Giant particle accelerators work by smashing subatomic particles such as electrons or protons together at high energies .
This transforms the particles into energy , which then converts back into matter , potentially revealing new particles and advancing understanding of old ones .
Over the past half century , particle accelerators have thoroughly probed the lower energy levels .
The next frontier is the land of the teraelectronvolt ( TeV , or a million million electronvolts ) .
There are only two ways for accelerators to increase the power : create a stronger electric field , or increase the distance over which particles are accelerated .
We ’ve already pretty much maxed out the strength of electric fields that can be contained without ripping electrons off the walls and essentially melting the inside of the accelerator .
The other option is to create ever larger accelerators .
Building bigger proton accelerators , such as Fermilab ’s Tevatron in Illinois and the Large Hadron Collider in Europe , is still possible because protons can be accelerated to very high energies in a circle .
But the highest - energy electrons need linear tracks such as that of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory or the proposed International Linear Collider .
While proton accelerators are more powerful because of the continuous circular acceleration , electron accelerators are important because they are more precise .
This is where plasma - wakefield acceleration may be able to help .
This radically new kind of acceleration skirts the electric field issue by using plasma — gas in which electrons have been ripped from their nuclei .
This soup of ionized gas can handle electric fields about a thousand times stronger than can conventional accelerators , meaning the accelerators can potentially be a thousand times shorter .
In PWFA , tightly - packed bunches of electrons are fired into the plasma like bullets from a machine gun , blowing the plasma ’s electrons away in all directions leaving the heavier plasma nuclei behind .
These positively charged nuclei form a bubble of electron - free plasma behind the particle bullet .
The negatively charged expelled electrons are drawn back toward the positively charged bubble .
But as the electrons snap back toward the bubble , they overshoot their original positions .
So the particle bullet leaves behind a wake of mispositioned electrons , creating an intense electric field .
By riding in this wake , the electrons can reach very high energies in a very short distance .
In 2007 , a collaboration between SLAC , UCLA , and USC demonstrated PWFA ’s potential :
In a single meter , they were able to boost electrons zooming down SLAC ’s linear track to twice what they can achieve over the entire two - mile - long accelerator .
But this strategy also has its limits .
The maximum energy of the accelerated electrons depends on the energy of the particle bunches .
SLAC currently produces the highest - energy electrons of any accelerator , at 50 gigaelectronvolts ( GeV , or a thousand million electronvolts ) .
So Caldwell and his colleagues decided to give plasma - wakefield acceleration a new twist by blasting the plasma with protons instead of electrons .
Today ’s accelerators can bring protons to much higher energies than they can electrons .
Protons at the Tevatron can hit 1 TeV ( hence the name ) , and those at the LHC will be seven times as energetic .
" This would be a tool to transfer that energy from the protons to the electrons , via the plasma , in a single stage , " says Caldwell .
In a numerical simulation , the team used proton - driven PWFA to accelerate electron bunches to 500 GeV in 300 meters of plasma .
Compare that to the proposed $ 7 billion International Linear Collider ( ILC ) , which will need at least nine miles to hit the same target , and SLAC ’s linear accelerator , which needed 10 times the distance to reach a tenth of the energy .
Combining the new proton - driven PWFA with the LHC ’s powerful proton beam , Caldwell says it might be possible to accelerate electrons to several TeV , so that physicists can have their power , and their precision too .
" I look forward to watching these ideas continue to develop , " says Mark Hogan , a member of the electron - driven PWFA team at SLAC .
" There is still a lot of research and development needed to nurture these ideas .
But in the not too distant future , we may find that ideas such as this have transformed the field of particle accelerators to make future machines that are both smaller and more affordable to society . "
Electron acceleration by proton - driven PWFA is in its earliest theoretical stages — this study is the first to describe the concept — and is far from experimental verification .
Perhaps the biggest issue is the proton bunch length , which must be very small to allow the electrons to overshoot and create the wakefield .
" It ’s easy to do for electron bunches , " says co-author Frank Simon of the Max Planck Institute .
" But hadron colliders have bunches that are centimeters in length .
We need bunches that are a hundred micrometers in length .
We ’re still looking at how to test the idea with present technology . "
As governments put a stranglehold on spending , advancements in PWFA may be the best hope for refining the discoveries expected to be made at the LHC .
" In the past , opening up energy frontiers allowed us to discover new particles and to understand the basic forces , " says Caldwell .
" Today , there are new theories around that we want to test which predict new particles .
But the basic reason is to just see what ’s there . "

I recently finished reading The Chris Farley Show ( I strongly recommend this book for everyone ) and have been wanting to buy SNL’s Best of Chris Farley .
After my fiancee ’s grandmother ’s 90th birthday party in the northwest suburbs ( very lovely gathering , by the way ) Saturday late afternoon / early evening , I decide to stop by and buy it .
Right away , I find the last one on the shelf as my fiancée is looking for other “ bargains , ” and I pass it to her when I realize my stomach is rumbling .
I decide to take a trip to the men ’s room in search of a better life for myself .
That ’s when complications began to arise .
As I walk towards the men ’s room , a mother is telling her son “ it ’s okay , use the bathroom , I ’ll be right here ” or something like that .
I remember being that age ( about 7 - 9 ) and public bathrooms were not your friend .
I walk in just behind the little boy and see him glance at the urinal for a brief second – and then he walks to the rear stall .
DAMMIT !!
The middle stall is taken , and I think pooping in a urinal on a Saturday afternoon is a felony in most states .
I sigh , leave , and take a couple of more ( fast ) laps around all of the movies and Wii games .
I return to the restroom about four minutes and ten seconds later , and the rear stall is now open .
PAYDIRT !!!
The middle stall is still occupied by the same dude as before ( I can tell by seeing the same shoes and pants on the floor underneath the door ) .
I actually think to myself , “ that sucks , poor guy . ”
After wiping the toilet seat , I sit down and take a refreshing and cleansing poo .
Things are looking up in life again .
I go to flush the toilet and sneer at how ugly it looks in there .
It ’s bad .
Really bad .
It is actually too gross for me to follow - through on taking a picture of it and texting it to my friend Steve .
Anyway , here is where things went awry .
Very .
I flush the toilet .
Bubble .
Bubbling .
Rumbling .
Uh-oh .
The water rises a little .
Please go down .
Please .
The water rises a little more .
Nervousness settles in .
Quickly .
Shit. Dammit .
Fuck .
Fuck .
Fuck .
Stop the water .
Industrial toilet .
It ’s not an option .
WTF .
Shit .
Please go down .
Water still rising .
Not going down .
Really bad .
1 ” to go .
Fuck Fuck Fuck .
Please just stop .
1/2 ” left .
Time to think of an exit strategy .
Water overflows .
Well , I guess you can call it water , but it does n’t really look like water anymore .
And , I just remember about the poor guy in the middle stall .
Stay calm .
And get out of there .
Now .
“ Watch your feet , dude , I ’ll get somebody quick . ”
I said it as calm as I possibly could .
I almost immediately find a Best Buy employee : “ I just wanted you to know that a toilet is overflowing in the men ’s restroom , and you ’re going to want to get somebody in there quick .
” I find my fiancée almost immediately .
I walk very ( very ) fast towards her .
“ Can you get the movies ?
I ’ll get the car . ”
She knows something is wrong .
Very wrong .
I guess I wo n’t argue with her buying Forgetting Sarah Marshall , then .
I go to the car and circle around the parking lot for about eight minutes .
I am hoping that the guy from the middle stall is n’t scouring the parking lot yet for the guy with brown hair in the black pullover and dark green vest .
My fiancée walks out , she jumps in , and I speed away as fast as a 5 MPH speed limit in a parking lot permits .
So , please accept my apology , the guy in the middle stall , and also the fine employees at the Best Buy # 305 .
I sincerely apologize for any heartache , headaches , and pain I may have caused you .
And for ruining your weekend .
Every time I watch Forgetting Sarah Marshall with my lovely soon - to - be wife , a special cloud of guilt will hang over my head for you .
Sincerely , Anonymous .
BAGHDAD  The United States and Iraq will begin negotiating possible exceptions to the June 30 deadline for withdrawing American combat troops from Iraqi cities , focusing on the troubled northern city of Mosul , according to military officials .
Some parts of Baghdad also will still have combat troops .
Everywhere else , the withdrawal of United States combat troops from all Iraqi cities and towns is on schedule to finish by the June 30 deadline , and in many cases even earlier .
But because of the level of insurgent activity in Mosul , United States and Iraqi military officials will meet Monday to decide whether to consider the city an exception to the deadline in the Status of Forces Agreement , or SOFA , between the countries .
“ Mosul is the one area where you may see U.S. combat forces operating in the city ” after June 30 , the United States military ’s top spokesman in Iraq , Maj .
Gen. David Perkins , said in an interview .
In Baghdad , however , there are no plans to close the Camp Victory base complex , consisting of five bases housing more than 20,000 soldiers , many of them combat troops .
Although Victory is only a 15 minute drive from the center of Baghdad and sprawls over both sides of the city ’s boundary , Iraqi officials say they have agreed to consider it outside the city .
The first thing that stands out as you peruse the Federal Communications Commission 's latest report on rural broadband is that it reads like it was actually written by somebody .
" As long as a grade - school child living on a farm cannot research a science project , or a high school student living on a remote Indian reservation cannot submit a college application , " the 78 page document begins , " or an entrepreneur in a rural hamlet cannot order spare parts , or a local law enforcement officer cannot download pictures of a missing child without traveling to a city or town that has broadband Internet access , we cannot turn back from these challenges . "
Who penned these words ?
If you guessed William Booth of the Salvation Army , you are getting warm .
Bringing Broadband to Rural America is the first big FCC published survey that I 've come across that is signed by the head of the agency , in this case interim Chair Michael Copps .
It definitely has the senior Democrats ' crusading tone , and turns an otherwise dreary list of bureaucratic recommendations into a Rooseveltian call to arms .
" Infrastructure deployment is something Americans do well ; it plays to our national strengths , " the report notes .
" We have built out canals , bridges , electricity , telephone service , roads , and highways .
Now , with much history to learn from and with an array of technological resources at our disposal , we can and will do it again . "
Thank you , Dr. Win - the - War .
Human faces
But first , let 's get the dreary stuff out of the way .
The 2008 Farm Bill required the Chair of the FCC to crank out this compendium outlining " a comprehensive rural broadband strategy " that answered three questions .
What is the state of rural broadband ?
How can the government help overcome obstacles to its expansion ?
And how can key government agencies cooperate in doing this ?
The report 's answer to query number one is candid .
" The Commission and other federal agencies simply have not collected the comprehensive and reliable data needed to answer this question , " it confesses .
The survey cites a 2008 Pew Broadband Adoption Study which found that between 57 to 60 percent of urban / suburban consumers have broadband , compared to 38 percent of rural residents .
That last number is pretty close to a National Telecommunications Information Administration estimate : 39 percent .
But these numbers are " inexact , " the FCC concedes .
So what does Copps do to fill in the gap ?
He borrows inspiration from James Agee and Walker Evans ' Depression era classic Let Us Now Praise Famous Men and tells a story , taken from a filing submitted by the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council .
Although we do not have accurate data on broadband deployment in rural America , MMTC presents one community , Weirwood , Virginia , and through Weirwood gives ' rural broadband deployment ' a human face .
As MMTC describes it , Weirwood is an isolated rural community on Virginia ’s Eastern Shore , on the site of a former cotton plantation .
Weirwood is only a mile and a half from U.S. Route 13 , along which lies a broadband Internet backbone .
The residents of Weirwood , however — mostly African - American descendents of former slaves — lack access to broadband .
MMTC states that Weirwood has ' absolutely no ability to raise internally ' the funds needed to build a broadband node to the community from the existing backbone line .
Pending acquisition of thorough , reliable , and disaggregated data , we glimpse through Weirwood the state of broadband deployment in impoverished rural areas .
It 's rare that one finds literature in an FCC document , but the policy wonks will be looking for specifics .
Here they may be somewhat disappointed .
Sure enough , the report acknowledges the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 's call for a national broadband map , recommending that the FCC and the Obama administration " continue their efforts to coordinate federal , Tribal , state , local , and private mapping efforts . "
But Bringing Broadband glides past difficult questions about who will really oversee the production of this map — the government or a telco - backed nonprofit like Connected Nation ?
The document urges reform of the Universal Service Fund , but is very brief about how .
It looks for ways to encourage interagency cooperation , recommending that the FCC create a " comprehensive website that will provide a centralized access portal for information concerning all federal programs addressing broadband . "
But beyond that , the report calls for the continuation of the National Economic Council 's interagency working group , and not a lot more .
Much of the essay is an encyclopedia of extant consultative agreements between states , localities , Indian tribes , and Federal agencies .
The heritage we bring
But what stands out above the forest of Executive Orders , memorandums of understanding , and legal precedents is Copps philosophy about government .
And here he is as plain as fiber .
" Relying on market forces alone will not bring robust and affordable broadband services to all parts of rural America , " he writes .
" Therefore , all levels of government should explore ways to help overcome the high costs of rural broadband deployment . "
Where does the FCC 's temporary boss find precedent for this ?
First , in the American past — in the New Deal 's Rural Electrification Service , in the Federal government 's railroad land grants , in the US postal system ( which heavily subsidized newspaper delivery with cheap rates ) , in the Federal Highway Act of 1956 , and , of course , in the Defense Department 's Advanced Research Projects Agency , germinator of the Internet .
" Federal funding and visionary federal agencies created a noncommercial enterprise that would ultimately generate enormous sums of money , transform nearly every aspect of our daily lives , and change how the entire world communicates , " Copps declares .
" This is the heritage we bring to the current challenge of comprehensive broadband deployment in rural areas . "
Second , he finds his precedents in the rest of the world — in Australia 's promise to upgrade most of its homes and work offices to 100 Mbps , in France 's " dead zone programme , " which lets operators use public cash to get mobile service to thousands of rural towns , and in Sweden 's " stadsn�tt " network , a municipal fiber network rent out at cost to ISPs .
" A complementary government role in broadband deployment can yield advantages that a free market solution cannot achieve alone , " the report concludes .
Give me a broadband New Deal , Copps is whispering to Congress .
The problem is that what he 's got now is the Recovery Act 's $ 7.2 billion in broadband stimulus cash , and a labyrinth of federal and state agencies that will oversee its deployment .
Copps ' obvious hope is that this inadequate mess is just the beginning .
" We are at an early stage in the national effort , " he observes , and is cautiously writing the story as he wants it to play out — a story that will continue with the National Broadband Plan Congress expects the FCC to complete by February of next year .
" I view this Report as a prelude to , and a building block for , the national broadband plan , " Copps concludes , " which will address in greater detail and on a vastly more complete record , the input of all stakeholders and the steps the nation must take to achieve its broadband goals . "
Copps is also filling a void created by the absence of a permanent agency chair .
That , perhaps , is why a footnote to this report indicates that it represents his views and not the FCC 's proper .
It is unclear when the heir apparent , Obama nominee Julius Genachowski , will finally get his Senate confirmation hearing .
It is also uncertain whether Genachowski's Clinton era / dot - com narrative will entirely comport with the decidedly old - school philosophy we 're currently getting from the FCC 's former college teacher .
But if nature abhors a vacuum , so does government .
So until the new boss shows up , just remember that there 's nothing to fear but fear itself , at least for now .

ZANGABAD , Afghanistan  American commanders are planning to cut off the Taliban ’s main source of money , the country ’s multimillion - dollar opium crop , by pouring thousands of troops into the three provinces that bankroll much of the group ’s operations .
The plan to send 20,000 Marines and soldiers into Helmand , Kandahar and Zabul Provinces this summer promises weeks and perhaps months of heavy fighting , since American officers expect the Taliban to vigorously defend what makes up the economic engine for the insurgency .
The additional troops , the centerpiece of President Obama ’s effort to reverse the course of the seven - year war , will roughly double the number already in southern Afghanistan .
The troops already fighting there are universally seen as overwhelmed .
In many cases , the Americans will be pushing into areas where few or no troops have been before .
Through extortion and taxation , the Taliban are believed to reap as much as $ 300 million a year from Afghanistan ’s opium trade , which now makes up 90 percent of the world ’s total .
That is enough , the Americans say , to sustain all of the Taliban ’s military operations in southern Afghanistan for an entire year .
“ Opium is their financial engine , ” said Brig .
Gen. John Nicholson , the deputy commander of NATO forces in southern Afghanistan .
“ That is why we think he will fight for these areas . ”
( CNN ) --
In his first television interview since being forced from office in a prostitution scandal , former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer talked with CNN about his personal failings , the AIG bailout and President Obama 's handling of the economy .
Ex -New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer says focusing on those AIG bonuses misses the bigger financial picture .
In a wide - ranging discussion , Spitzer told CNN's " Fareed Zakaria GPS " that he thinks he still has a duty to speak about issues like million - dollar bonuses to American International Group executives , but that he comments on the issues " with full awareness and heaviness of heart about what I did . "
" I would say to [ critics ] that I never held myself out as being anything other than human , " he said in the interview , which airs Sunday at 1 p.m. ET .
" I have flaws as we all do , arguably .
I failed in a very important way in my personal life .
And I have paid a price for that . "
The former governor , a Democrat who led New York from January 2007 until he resigned in March 2008 , was hired recently by Slate magazine to write a regular online column .
Spitzer , who was New York 's attorney general for eight years , said he is concerned about the economic crisis and other problems the nation is confronting .
" These are issues that I feel deeply about , " he said .
" But I am where I am because of my own conduct .
And as I say , I make no excuses . "
His first column for Slate criticized the federal government 's bailout programs .
One of the companies to receive bailout money ( $ 173 billion ) was insurance giant AIG , which scheduled $ 165 million in bonuses to senior executives .
' Fareed Zakaria GPS ' Ex -New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer shares his insights into the complicated story that is AIG 's meltdown on this coming Sunday 's ' GPS . '
Sunday , 1 & 5 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Spitzer told CNN that executive bonuses may grab headlines , but the insurance company 's payouts on complicated financial instruments deserve closer examination .
Spitzer said that AIG was at the " center of the web " of transactions that have forced a massive bailout of the U.S. financial system , and that the insurer 's woes stem from financial practices he first investigated as New York 's attorney general .
" Back then I said to people , ' AIG is the center of the web . '
The financial tentacles of this company stretched to every major investment bank , " he said .
Watch Spitzer say AIG has larger problems »
AIG 's collapse stemmed largely from its array of exotic financial products such as credit - default swaps , which went sour when the U.S. housing market turned south after 2006 .
" Bonus is a real issue .
It touches us viscerally , " Spitzer said .
But he added , " The real money and the real structural issue is the dynamic between AIG and the counterparties . "
Much of the $ 170 billion in taxpayer funds AIG has received is going straight to the buyers of its instruments , which amounted to a form of insurance on mortgage - backed bonds .
With the housing market in free fall and foreclosure rates spiking , those bonds have tumbled dramatically .
That forced AIG to pay out money it did n't have to its clients .
" Virtually all " of the $ 80 billion - plus in the initial AIG bailout went to the company 's counterparties , including nearly $ 13 billion to investment bank Goldman Sachs alone , Spitzer said .
" Why did that happen ?
What questions were asked ?
Why did we need to pay 100 cents on the dollar on those transactions if we had to pay anything ? " he asked .
" What would have happened to the financial system had it not been paid ?
These are the questions that should be pursued , " he said .
Spitzer looked at AIG 's financial practices as attorney general , an inquiry that led to the resignation of Maurice " Hank " Greenberg , the insurance giant 's longtime chairman , in 2005 .

Spitzer commended Obama for the way the he has handled the economic crisis , comparing the situation to putting out 500 fires .
It is a difficult task to institute good policies that will bring back the economy while keeping support of the nation 's citizens , Spitzer said .
" I think one of the largest , most difficult tasks that he has is to control the outrage that is brewing in the public , sympathize with it and garner it , but use it to get good policy , not policy based upon anger , " he said .

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Moldova on Tuesday , fighting with police and ransacking parliament .
The BBC News website looks at the causes and potential consequences of the unrest .
What sparked the violence ?
Protesters have been angered by an election result they believe was rigged .
The ruling Communist Party won 50 % of the vote , according to official results , with the nearest opposition party taking only 13 % .
News of protests in the capital , Chisinau , spread via text messages and the internet , and an angry crowd of about 15,000 - according to organisers - gathered .
Clashes broke out with police , and the demonstrators broke into and ransacked parliament .
Was the election rigged ?
The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe gave a mostly positive assessment of the poll , saying election day went smoothly , though it noted some flaws .
The Communist victory was not unexpected - opinion polls before the vote gave it about 36 % , while the three main opposition groups mustered only about 22 % between them .
But opposition figures have made allegations of repeat voting by Communist supporters , and one OSCE observer questioned the group 's " too warm " assessment .
Baroness Emma Nicholson told the BBC that she and others had a " very , very strong feeling " that there had been manipulation .
Who is behind the protests ?
Pro-democracy groups say the protests were a spontaneous reaction to the election result , which grew rapidly through word of mouth and messages over the internet and mobile phones .
The main opposition parties say they had no major role in the protests .
But Moldova 's president , and the Russians , have accused neighbouring Romania of stoking the protests .
Some in Russia perceive Western governments trying to foment regime change , and draw a link with other European protest movements .
" These are provocateurs at work , using the elections as a shield .
The same people stand behind the events in Moldova , the Orange Revolution in Ukraine , and behind [ President Mikhail ] Saakashvili in Georgia , " said Gennadiy Zyuganov , the leader of Russia 's Communist Party .
So is revolution in the air ?
Mark Grigoryan , of the BBC's Russian Service , says the Moldovan protests do not seem to have either the level of organisation , or the development over time , of those in Georgia in 2003 or Ukraine in 2004 .
He cites Moldovan analyst Vladislav Kulminskiy , who doubts the events will lead to regime change , since the Communists have genuine public support .
What are the links between Moldova and Romania ?
Moldova - or Bessarabia as it was known - was unified with Romania in the early 20th Century but was annexed by the Soviet Union in World War II .
There remain close cultural links between Romania and Moldova , where Romanian is the main language spoken .
Some of those protesting on Tuesday were calling for reunion with Romania - perhaps inspired by Romania 's place in the EU and the dreams of prosperity associated with it .
Moldova is the poorest country in Europe , where the average wage is just under $ 250 ( £ 168 ) a month .
There remains an unresolved conflict with the breakaway region of Trans - Dniester , which has run its own affairs , with Moscow 's support , since the end of hostilities in a brief war in 1992 .

Recursion is the enemy of fast - running scripts .
Too much recursion can cause the browser to grind to a halt or quit unexpectedly , and so must be addressed a serious performance problem in JavaScript .
In part 2 of this series , I wrote briefly about handling too much recursion in a function through memoization .
Memoization is a technique for caching previously calculated values so that they need not be recalculated ; when a recursive function is doing such a calculation , memoization is incredibly useful .
The memoizer I presented was Crockford ’s , and is useful primarily for recursive functions that return integers .
All recursive functions , of course , do n’t return integers .
A more generic memoizer ( ) function can be created to deal with any type of recursive function :
function memoizer ( fundamental , cache ) { cache = cache || {} var shell = function ( arg ) { if ( !cache.hasOwnProperty ( arg ) ) { cache[ arg ] = fundamental ( shell , arg ) } return cache[ arg ] ; } ; return shell ; }
This version of the function is a bit different than Crockford’s .
First , the order of arguments has been reversed with the original function as the first argument and an optional cache object as the second argument .
Not all recursive functions are seeded with initial information , so making that argument optional makes sense .
Inside , I ’ve changed the caching data type from an array to an object , which makes this version applicable to recursive functions that return non-integer results .
Inside the shell function , I ’m using the hasOwnProperty ( ) method to see if the argument already has a cache entry .
This is safer than testing if the type of value is n’t undefined since undefined is a valid return value .
Example usage with the previous Fibonacci example :
var fibonacci = memoizer ( function ( recur , n ) { return recur(n - 1 ) + recur(n - 2 ) ; } , { " 0 " : 0 , " 1" :1} ) ;
Once again , a call to fibonacci ( 40 ) results in only 40 calls of the original function instead of 331,160,280 .
Memoization works great for recursive algorithms with a strictly defined result set .
There are , however , other recursive algorithms that do n’t lend themselves to optimization through memoization .
One of my professors in college insisted that anything written using recursion could also be written using iteration if necessary .
Indeed , recursion and iteration are often considered remedies for one another when one is seen as a problem .
The techniques for converting a recursive algorithm into an iterative algorithm are the same regardless of the programming language ; the importance in JavaScript is greater , though , because the resources of the execution environment are so restrictive .
Consider a typical recursive algorithm such as a merge sort .
In JavaScript , it may be written like this :
function merge ( left , right ) { var result = [ ] ; while ( left.length > 0 && right.
length > 0 ) { if ( left [ 0 ] < right [ 0 ] ) { result.push( left.shift ( ) ) ; } else { result.push ( right.shift ( ) ) ; } } return result.concat( left ).concat( right ) ; } //recursive merge sort algorithm function mergeSort ( items ) { if ( items.length == 1 ) { return items ; } var middle = Math.floor( items.length / 2 ) , left = items.slice ( 0 , middle ) , right = items.slice ( middle ) ; return merge ( mergeSort ( left ) , mergeSort ( right ) ) ; }
Calling the mergeSort ( ) function on an array returns an array of the items sorted in correct order .
Note that for each call to mergeSort ( ) there are two recursive calls .
This algorithm wo n’t benefit from memoization because each result is only calculated once and , therefore , caching the results does n’t help .
If you were to call mergeSort ( ) on an array with 100 items , there would be 199 calls total ; a 1,000 item array would result in 1,999 calls .
The solution in this case is to convert the recursive algorithm into an iterative one , which means introducing some loops ( algorithm credit : List Processing : Sort Again , Naturally ) :
//iterative merge sort algorithm function mergeSort ( items ) { if ( items.length == 1 ) { return items ; } var work = [ ] ; for ( var i=0 , len=items .
length ; i < len ; i++ ) { work.push ( [ items [ i ] ] ) ; } work.push ( [ ] ) ; // in case of odd number of items for ( var lim=len ; lim > 1 ; lim = Math.floor ( ( lim+1 ) /2 ) ) { for ( var j=0 , k=0 ; k < lim ; j++ , k+=2 ) { work [ j ] = merge ( work[k ] , work [ k+1 ] ) ; } work[j ] = [ ] ; // in case of odd number of items } return work [ 0 ] ; }
This implementation of the merge sort algorithm uses a series of loops instead of recursion to sort the array .
Since merge sort works by first breaking down an array into several one - item arrays , this method does that explicitly instead of implicitly via recursive calls .
The work array is initially an array of one - item arrays .
The loops enable the merging of two arrays at a time , placing the result back into the work array .
When the function has done its job , the result is stored in the first position of work and is returned .
In this version of merge sort , there is no recursion .
It does , however , introduce a large number of loops based on the number of items in the array , so it may be worth revisiting the techniques discussed in part 2 to handle the extra overhead .
The bottom line : always be on the look out for recursion in your JavaScript .
Memoization and iteration are two ways to avoid excessive recursion and the long - running script dialog .

* Woman in latest case had been in intensive care
* California health officials expect more cases ( Updates with details of latest confirmed case )
LOS ANGELES , April 25 ( Reuters ) - A seventh case of the swine flu that has killed dozens of people in Mexico was confirmed in California on Saturday , involving a woman who was hospitalized in intensive care but has since recovered .
The 35 - year - old Imperial County woman became ill on April 4 and was hospitalized for a week , the most severe case of swine flu yet found in the state , said Dr. Bonnie Sorensen , deputy director of the California Department of Public Health .
The woman , who was not identified , has since fully recovered , Sorensen said .
She was being interviewed by health authorities to determine how she may have been infected but had not traveled abroad or handled animals .
“ None of the seven cases in California have recently traveled to Mexico and none had any direct contact with pigs , so all of these folks must have caught it from someone else , ” Sorensen told Reuters .
The woman was diagnosed as part of stepped - up testing in California following the swine flu outbreak that showed signs of spreading as the World Health Organization warned it could become a global epidemic .
All seven of the state ’s confirmed swine flu cases have been found in San Diego and Imperial counties , which share a border with Mexico .
Four of Mexico ’s suspected cases have been reported in Mexicali , which is on the border with California .
State health officials have not ordered any border restrictions but Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has advised Californians to take precautions , including avoiding close contact with others , washing hands often and covering the nose and mouth when sneezing .
California ’s top health officials have said they expect to find more cases of swine flu , calling the eruption of a new strain puzzling .
“ When you start looking more intensely , you are likely to find more cases , ” said Dr. Gil Chavez , director of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the California Department of Public Health and the state ’s chief epidemiologist .
“ We are watching this very closely .
It ’s largely a mystery .
It ’s very unusual whenever you have as many as even six cases ( of swine flu ) .
That ’s very , very rare , ” Chavez said .
Schwarzenegger said California had requested extra flu experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was expanding lab testing and the monitoring of animals .
The state has activated its Joint Emergency Operations Center and has been in communication with officials in Mexico .

One of the oldest and most efficient wind farms in Britain is to be dismantled and replaced by a nuclear power station under plans drawn up by the German - owned power group RWE .
The site at Kirksanton in Cumbria - home to the Haverigg turbines - has just been approved by the government for potential atomic newbuild in a move that has infuriated the wind power industry .
Colin Palmer , founder of the Windcluster company , which owns part of the Haverigg wind farm , said he was horrified that such a plan could be considered at a time when Britain risks missing its green energy targets and after reassurance from ministers that nuclear and renewables were not incompatible .
" My first reaction was disbelief , quickly followed by a sense of years of commitment to sustainable energy being destroyed , " Palmer said .
" At a time when the government is calling for wind energy development to be accelerated , it beggars belief that they are supporting plans that will result in the destruction of existing capacity . "
Palmer said he was angry that he was never consulted about the plan by RWE or anyone else before the site was put forward for official approval .
" The first we heard was when the proposals were made public , which is contrary to the nomination requirements that stipulate early consultation with key stakeholders , " he said .
The Haverigg site , on the fringes of the Lake District , was commissioned in 1992 and is believed to be one of only two of its type in this country .
The scheme has been praised by Friends of the Lake District as a fine example of appropriate wind energy development and the turbines were financed by a pioneering group of ethical investors .
The site was subsequently expanded to a total of eight turbines after £ 6 m additional investment .
Haverigg was still one of the most efficient wind farms with a 35 % " capacity factor " - or efficiency - compared with an average of 30 % , said Palmer .
RWE confirmed last night that its plans to construct a nuclear plant at Kirksanton could lead to the destruction of the windfarm , but said that was by no means certain .
" It is true there is an overlap and it could lead to some turbines needing to be moved or the whole site being used .
But we would have to discuss that with the operator and landowner , " said a spokesman for RWE .
" Its worth pointing out that we could build up to 3,600 megawatts of low or free CO2 power compared to the 3.5MW or so of wind power that we might replace .
And it 's not a case or wind or nuclear .
We ourselves are spending over £ 1bn on wind . "
Triodos Renewables , the owner of three of the turbines on the same site , shares Windcluster 's concerns .
Matthew Clayton , operations director of Triodos , said : " It 's staggering that they [ ministers ] do n't exclude areas that are already productive sites for renewable technologies as part of the initial screening process .
It just is n't very joined up .
They 're stamping out prime wind sites with arguably a much less sustainable technology . "
Martin Forwood , a spokesman for local environmental campaign group Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment , said the RWE plans had been revealed at a Cumbria county council forum meeting .
" It beggars belief that at a time when wind power has never been more vital to the UK , a viable windfarm is to be sacrificed on the altar of nuclear power .
" It also exposes the duplicity of RWE , who have previously claimed that it was a myth that newbuild will detract from the construction of renewables , " he said .
The British Wind Energy Association said the enormous speed with which nuclear plants appeared to be moving through the planning process - responsible for part of the anger around Haverigg - compared dramatically with all the problems being faced by dozens of windfarms .
" We need a level playing field for all types of generation when it comes to planning regulation and government support , " said the association .
How they compare Wind Nuclear Overall cost of generating electricity / KWh 5.42 p 2.8 p
Cost of fuel per Mwh none 4 Speed of build 5 years 8 years +

• This article was amended on Thursday 30 April 2009 .
The table above published with the report Anger at plans for nuclear power station to replace wind farm , listed the Campaign to Protect Rural England ( CPRE ) as an opponent of wind farm development .
The CPRE does not oppose wind power ; it assesses applications for wind farms on a case - by - case basis .
This has been corrected .
Hogan 's Heroes - Wrong Guns Galore !
The weapons held by the Camp guards include , not only the MP40 SMG and the Mauser Kar 98 K as they would have been issued , but also the American Thompson SMG , also known as the " Tommygun " .
The model shown in multiple episodes on at least half the guards and other military personnel is furthermore a Thompson model from the early 1920's , and not even the one issued to US and allied troops during the WWII conflict .
Why the production crew would allow such an obvious error to occur is beyond me .
It is absolutely sure that they were aware that the Thompson was an American weapon , and not used by Germans at any time .
An unsubstantiated weapons - blooper is also that some of the bolt - action rifles used on the show would appear to be Enfield 's rather than Mausers .
I shall get back to this if it can be proven from the footage .
17 Intriguing Matchups on the 2009 NFL Schedule
The NFL released the 2009 NFL Schedule today , so I ’ll do what the 4,000 other websites do and list some of the more juicier matchups of the year .
( Although in the sake of being at least a little creative , I ’ll list one interesting matchup for each of the 17 weeks on the schedule . )
Before we get to the matchups though , let me state for the record that it ’s a complete farce that the Cowboys get six nationally televised games next year despite not making the playoffs last season .
I guess “ America ’s Team ” opening a brand new stadium is worth major national exposure … six times a year .
Week 1 : Bears at Packers , 8:20 PM ET
Jay Cutler ’s first game in a Bears uniform will be at Lambeau against the rival Packers on Sunday Night Football .
How much will John Madden overplay the , “ The Bears finally have a quarterback ” angle after every pass Cutler completes ?
Week 2 : Giants at Cowboys , 8:20 PM ET
One of the ‘ Boys six nationally televised games , Dallas will open up their new stadium against division rival New York on Sunday Night Football .
How much will John Madden overplay the , “ Tony Romo and Wade Phillips must win now because Jerry Jones built this brand new stadium and he wants a contender ” angle ?
Week 3 : Falcons at Patriots , 1:00 PM ET
The over / under on the number of times Matt Ryan is compared to Tom Brady in this game has officially been set at 800,994,990 .
Week 4 : Chargers at Steelers , 8:20 PM ET
AFC Divisional Round rematch in Pittsburgh – let ’s see if the Chargers can hold onto the ball for more than 17 seconds in the third quarter unlike the last time these two teams met .
Week 5 : Patriots at Broncos , 4:15 PM ET
If Bill Belichick shakes Josh McDaniels ’ hand at midfield after this game , I ’m calling shenanigans on the behalf of Eric Mangini .
Week 6 : Bears at Falcons , 8:20 PM ET
Here ’s hoping the Bears ’ secondary figured out that they have to cover the out pattern when that ’s the only route Matt Ryan can look for when there ’s 11 seconds on the clock and he needs to get his team into field goal range .
Week 7 : Cardinals at Giants , 8:20 PM ET
Kurt Warner seeks maximum revenge against Eli Manning for taking his starting job in New York in a few years ago .
This is also the battle of two goofy ( yet loveable ) quarterbacks .
( Look , I know Warner is a good guy but you have to admit those gloves he wears look ridiculous . )
Week 8 : Giants at Eagles , 4:15 PM ET
I ’d write something humorous about this matchup , but there ’s just nothing funny about the NFC East – or Philadelphia fans .
People may die …
Week 9 : Dolphins at Patriots , 1:00 PM ET
The Big Tuna returns to his old stomping grounds in what could be a midseason battle for first place in the AFC East .
Unless of course Miami was a fluke last year , Tom Brady re-injuries himself or the Bills and Jets are in first place by a wide margin .
But seriously , if those things do n’t happen , then this could be a midseason battle for first place in the AFC East .
Week 10 : Patriots at Colts , 8:20 PM ET
Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning – finally , a forum where fans can debate who the best quarterback is in the NFL .
I ’m tired of not having the opportunity to discuss who the better quarterback is between Brady and Manning because these two teams never play each other .
Week 11 : Chargers at Broncos , 4:15 PM ET
Think Ed Hochuli ’s crew will be asked to officiate this game ?
Week 12 : Packers at Lions , 12:30 PM ET
Good to see the NFL is still honoring the tradition of keeping Thanksgiving in Detroit .
Hopefully this game remains interesting for more than the seven and a half seconds that it was last year when the Titans drubbed the Lions in one of the worst Thanksgiving Day games since Drew Henson and the Cowboys took on Craig Krenzel and the Bears in 2004 .
( Does anyone remember that game ?
At one point during that game I actually cursed God for blessing me with vision . )
Week 13 : Jets at Bills , 8:20 PM ET
T.O. gets his first opportunity to play in front of a national audience in his new city of Buffalo … actually the game is being played in Toronto .
Too bad only four people will get the chance to watch it since the game will be on the NFL Network .
Week 14 : Panthers at Patriots , 1:00 PM ET
Hopefully by this point in the season Tom Brady will be leading the Pats back to the playoffs and Jake Delhomme will have figured out how to get through an entire game without turning the ball over seven times and generally crapping himself .
( Side note :
There ’s no proof that Delhomme has ever crapped himself during a game .
I just flat out do n’t like him . )
Week 15 : Giants at Redskins , 8:30 PM ET
Were the guys in charge pissed at the Giants when they were making this schedule ?
Check out this stretch of games to finish the season : vs. Dallas , vs. Philadelphia , at .
Washington , vs. Carolina , at Minnesota .
Yikes .
Week 16 : Ravens at Steelers , 1:00 PM ET
If this game is anything like the three these two teams played last year , we should expect plenty of anger , mass hysteria and controversy .
Week 17 : Giants at Vikings , 1:00 PM ET
Hey , remember when the Vikings needed to beat the Giants in Week 17 of the season last year in order to get into the playoffs ?
And they barely did , even though New York played its back ups for most of the game ?
Well this will be a replay of that game for those that missed it .
Yesterday researchers at the University of British Colombia in Vancouver announced that they 'd created a tiny battery ( pictured ) that could draw power from human blood .
They 're basically cyborg batteries , half biological and half technological .

The batteries are designed for use in pacemakers and other implantable medical devices .
A small colony of yeast lives inside each battery , and this living core of the fuel cell can draw energy from glucose ( sugar ) in blood flowing around it .
According to New Scientist :
The yeast - based fuel cell produces around 40 nanowatts of power , compared to the microwatt a typical wristwatch battery might produce , Chaio says .
That might be enough power for some devices if it were coupled with a capacitor to allow energy to be stored .
The yeast could also be genetically engineered to boost its power output .

Now that we can have bio - batteries implanted in our bodies , we 're well on the road to becoming cyborgs .
We can become biological organisms implanted with technology that is in turn implanted with biological organisms .

昨年一挙に浸透し たSSD ですが、プチフリーズや使用するうちに速度が低下するなどHDDには見られなかった問題も起きています。これらの原因の一つは、内蔵されているFlash ROMを上書きするときに非常に時間がかかるというものです。まっさらな状態だと比較的高速に書き込めるにもかかわらず、上書きには非常に大きな時間がかかります。
そこで、MicrosoftはSSD用に特殊な機能をWindows7で実装する予定です。この機能は、ファイルシステムからファイルを消去した際、ファイルが使用していた領域を「もういらないよ」とSSDに知らせます。これによって、SSDは不要領域をバックグラウンドで消去しておくことが出来、次回その領域に書き込むときには上書きではなくまっさらの領域に対する書き込みとなります。この結果、ディスク・アクセス速度が向上します。
この時に使われるのは 、ATA8 - ACS2のTRIMコマンドです。
また、パーティションの開始セクターも、SSDの特性に合わせて変更されます。現在の開始位置は2のべきにあわせていませんが、SSDを検出した場合には、Windows7はSSDの速度が向上するようなキリのいい位置でパーティションを切ります。Windows7をインストールするときには、パーティションの作成はWindows7で行うように気をつけた方が良いようです。
There is a lot of misinformation out there about gun control , gun rights , self defense , “ assault weapons , ” and the like .
This article is intended to briefly set the record straight :
Myth # 1 : Gun control stops criminals from having guns .
Fact : Gun control laws do not keep guns out of criminals ’ hands .
Gun control laws do n’t stop criminals from having guns , any more than the laws against murder stop criminals from committing that crime .
A criminal who wants a gun will get a gun , whether they smuggle it in to the country , steal it , or buy it on the black market .
The rampant gun related crime in cities such as Chicago and District of Columbia show that handgun bans and other strict gun control laws do not stop criminals from having guns , but instead only disarm the law abiding citizens .
Myth # 2 : Guns are ineffective for self defense .
Fact :
Guns are the most effective means of self defense yet devised by human kind .
A gun is able to effectively stop an attacker at a safe distance , before that attacker can injure or kill the law abiding citizen .
A gun can be used by a small woman to stop a large man from attacking her , or by an elderly grandma to fend off a home invader .
No other tool of self defense is as reliable , effective , and easy to use .
Indeed I have seen people fire a gun for the first time , and consistently hit the target on their very first few shots .
it is true that gun owners should seek training and practice to gain maximum proficiency with their firearm of choice , however this training is easily acquired at one ’s local gun store or range .
Myth # 3 : Gun ownership is not an constitutional right .
Fact :
The Supreme Court of the United States has conclusively declared gun ownership for self defense to be an individual right .
In the D.C. v. Heller case , the United States Supreme Court made clear that gun ownership for self defense is a right of law abiding , non mentally ill , Americans .
This right is independent of service in the military or militia .
This ruling is in keeping with the text of the constitution , and the intent of this country ’s founders .
Myth # 4 : Guns are not needed since the police can be called .
Fact :
The police simply cannot get there quickly enough , or at all in some situations .
Even for citizens that live right next door to the police station , the police ca n’t respond quickly enough .
That is because it takes less time for a criminal , who is already entering the home , to kill or seriously harm a home owner than it takes for the police to get to the home and stop the criminal .
Natural disasters or civil unrest can also stretch a police department ’s resources to the breaking point , leaving citizens with no option but self defense .
Myth # 5 : Only violent and uneducated people want to own guns .
Fact :
Gun ownership is a right that between one third and one half of all Americans exercise .
This author is a well educated and peaceful gun owner , as are a great many gun owners .
Law abiding citizens own guns for a variety of reasons , ranging from self defense to target shooting .
Indeed it is the mark of an intelligent and peace loving person to make themselves ready and able to defend their home against criminals , while hoping that they never need to act in self defense .
Myth # 6 : A home owner is 43 times more likely to be killed by their own gun than to kill an intruder .
Fact : 65 lives are protected for every 2 lives lost .
The long since discredited myth that gun ownership is more dangerous than beneficial was started by a Mr. Kellermann , in his flawed study “ Protection or Peril ?
An Analysis of Firearms - Related Deaths in the Home . ”
There were numerous flaws in the study , including the fact that it only counted deaths , which are not a measure of self defense , any more than the number of suspected criminals shot dead by the police is a measure of police effectiveness .
Furthermore , the overwhelming majority of the 2.5 million self defense uses each year do n’t result in a shot being fired at all , meaning that this “ study ” totally ignored most self defense gun uses .
The proper statistic is that 65 lives are protected for every 2 lives lost , which means that gun ownership is overwhelmingly safe and beneficial , both to the individual and to society .
See Dr. Suter ’s paper “ Guns in the Medical Literature – A Failure of Peer Review . ” Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia .
Published March 1994 .
Myth # 7 : Banning so called “ assault weapons ” will stop crime , since these guns are especially dangerous .
Fact :
The ban on so called “ assault weapons ” only pointlessly targets safety and cosmetic features of these ordinary guns .
So - called “ assault weapons ” are no more dangerous than any other gun , and are used by criminals in well under 1 % of crimes .
A gun is defined as an assault weapon if it has certain cosmetic and safety features , and the presence of these features does not in any way make the gun more dangerous or useful to criminals .
Bans on “ assault weapons ” are merely a way of eroding gun rights and further complicating gun laws , making it difficult for law abiding citizens to know and obey the law .
It is also important to note that the so called “ assault weapons ” are NOT fully automatic machine guns , which have been very tightly regulated by the federal government since before World War II .
Britain is condemned today in a highly critical UN report for breaching basic human rights and " trying to conceal illegal acts " in the fight against terrorism .
The report is sharply critical of British co-operation in the transfer of detainees to places where they are likely to be tortured as part of the US rendition programme .
It accuses British ­intelligence officers of interviewing detainees held ­incommunicado in Pakistan in ­" so - called safe houses where they were being tortured " .
It adds that Britain , and a number of other countries , sent interrogators to Guantánamo Bay in a further example of what " can be reasonably understood as implicitly condoning " torture and ill - treatment .
It said the US was able to create its system for moving terror suspects around foreign jails only with the support of its allies .
Some individuals faced " prolonged and secret detention " and practices that breached bans on torture and other forms of ill - treatment , the report says .
The document , drawn up for the UN general assembly by Martin Scheinen , the organisation 's special rapporteur on the " promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism " , is likely to add pressure on the government , which is facing demands from human rights groups and frontbench opposition MPs for an inquiry into the role of UK security and intelligence officials in the CIA 's secret transfer of detainees to " dark prisons " .
The UN report comes days after fresh ­disclosures about MI5 co-operation in the secret interrogation and torture of ­Binyam Mohamed , the UK resident recently released from Guantánamo Bay .
While the practice of extraordinary rendition was put in place by the US , it was only possible through collaboration from other countries , the report says .
It identifies the UK , with ­Bosnia and Herzegovina , Canada , Croatia , ­Georgia , Indonesia , Kenya , Macedonia and Pakistan , as countries that provided " intelligence or have conducted the initial seizure of an individual before he was transferred to ( mostly unacknowledged ) detention centres in Afghanistan , Egypt , Ethiopia , Jordan , Pakistan , Morocco , Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Syria , Thailand , Uzbekistan … or to one of the CIA covert detention centres , often referred to as ' black sites ' " .
The report continues : " The active or passive participation by states in the interrogation of persons held by another state constitutes an internationally wrongful act if the state knew or ought to have known that the person was facing a real risk of torture or other prohibited treatment . "
It highlights concerns about " the increasing use of state secrecy provisions " and accuses the UK , along with the US , Germany , Italy , Poland , Romania and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia , of concealing " illegal acts from oversight bodies or judicial authorities " .
The report says information that is inaccurate and wrongly recorded can lead to innocent people being identified as terrorist threats , referring to Bisher al - Rawi , a British resident seized in Gambia after MI5 tipped off the CIA .
Bruce Karatz , who rode the housing boom to become one of the highest - paid executives in the country , was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on charges of manipulating stock options -- becoming one of the few executives to face criminal charges in the nation ’s options backdating scandal .
Karatz , 63 , served as chairman and chief executive of Westwood - based KB Home from 1986 to 2006 , when he resigned under fire .
Over a three - year period ending in 2005 , Karatz garnered more than $ 232 million in compensation .
“ This investigation painted a picture of avarice and dishonesty at its core , ” said Salvador Hernandez , who heads the FBI office in Los Angeles .
Karatz ’s lawyer said his client did nothing wrong and was being unfairly prosecuted .

“ We are disappointed that during this economic collapse the government chooses to waste its resources on backdated options , an issue that has long ago been fixed at KB Home and generally in the corporate world , ” attorney John Keker said in a prepared statement .
Karatz , who has already been forced to pay $ 20 million to the company and the federal government in connection with the case , faces up to 415 years in prison if convicted on all 20 counts of the indictment , which includes charges of fraud and making false statements .
The indictment said Karatz orchestrated the backdating of stock options from 1999 to 2006 .
Stock options typically are granted to employees with an exercise price tied to the date of the grant .
Companies can legally backdate stock options to a date when the stock price was lower -- insuring an immediate paper gain -- but they must account for it properly , pay taxes accordingly and report the backdating to shareholders .
In the KB Home case , the backdating was not disclosed until nearly a decade after it began .
The company was forced to adjust its financial statements by $ 70 million when the backdating of options held by Karatz and other shareholders was finally disclosed in 2008 .

In Karatz ’s case , the backdating made his stock options worth $ 1.63 to $ 4.56 more per share , according to the indictment -- a fact that should have been disclosed to other shareholders , it said .
The indictment does not say exactly how much Karatz gained as a result , but KB Home required Karatz to pay back $ 13 million in backdating gains when he left the company in 2006 .
And the SEC agreed to a settlement of $ 7.2 million with Karatz in 2008 to cover what it reckoned were his gains .
Karatz has long been a target of shareholder activists and labor unions , who accused him of taking more than his fair share of company profit .
In 2005 , the year before he stepped down , Karatz had take - home pay of $ 6.3 million , but he received an additional $ 150 million , mostly from exercising stock options .
“ For the whole backdating scandal , he was one of the biggest poster CEOs , ” said Patrick McGurn , a special counsel for New York - based Risk Metrics Group who specializes in executive compensation .
“ He had to hand back more of his gains than almost anyone else . ”

The indictment accuses Karatz of concealing the practice from KB ’s board of directors and compensation committee as well as from shareholders .
It alleges that when KB undertook an internal investigation into the stock - option grants in May 2006 , Karatz falsely denied his orchestration of the backdating scheme and caused a false report of KB ’s options practices to be submitted to the company ’s auditors , resulting in improper disclosures in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The SEC and other agencies have investigated more than 250 companies for backdating improprieties since 2005 , and there have been some large settlements .
In December 2007 , United Healthcare CEO William W. McGuire agreed to pay $ 458 million to settle a civil case with the SEC over backdating .
The KB Home case produced one of only a handful of criminal indictments under which executives might lose more than money .

The case also stands apart because of how much Karatz himself allegedly benefited .
In most of the backdating cases , including the case of Broadcom founders Henry T. Nicholas III and Henry Samueli , the companies and executives are accused of using backdating to attract and keep employees .
“ Companies can say they were using these options to equalize the pay among employees who entered at different times , ” said Michael Lemmon , a University of Utah finance professor who has studied backdating .
“ It becomes a much harder story to sell when you have the CEO benefiting personally . ”
Karatz ’s resignation in November 2006 surprised Wall Street analysts who had watched him , since he took over as CEO in 1986 , expand the company from its Los Angeles roots into one of the country ’s largest home builders .
KB
Home grew rapidly during the recent housing boom .
From 1995 to 2005 the company ’s revenues rose 576 % .
In 2005 , he helped strike a partnership with Martha Stewart to create a line of Stewart - branded homes .
KB
Home was named one of America ’s most admired companies by Fortune magazine in 2006 .

But the crash of the housing market , the collapse of the mortgage lending industry and the subsequent economic crisis have changed public sentiment dramatically .
The company ’s stock , which topped $ 80 a share three years ago , closed Thursday at $ 8.14 , down 19 cents .
Attorneys who advise companies on executive pay said prosecutors could benefit from a growing backlash against corporate excesses .
“ Home builders are not popular right now because of the economic crisis we ’re in , and now you throw in a top executive making a lot of money at the expense of shareholders , ” said Andrew Stoltmann , a Chicago lawyer for plaintiffs in investor lawsuits .
“ That will not play well in front of a jury . ”

The prosecution in this case also will have the aid of a key insider .
A former senior vice president of KB , human relations chief Gary A. Ray , pleaded guilty Feb. 6 to conspiring with Karatz to obstruct justice .
Ray has been cooperating with prosecutors .

Times staff writer E. Scott Reckard and Times researcher Scott Wilson contributed to this report .
“ Peer review is n’t all it ’s cracked up to be , ” and that phrase ’s many variants , is something you year a lot these days .
It ’s a complaint that is heard most often with reference to climate science , and most often by people who understand neither the science behind climate disruption nor the purpose of peer review .
So , as someone who ’s undergone peer review repeatedly in both academia and as an electrical engineer , I ’d like to explain why peer review matters .
First , a little explanation of what peer review is .
Peer review is a formal process instituted by an organization to ensure that a quality product is produced .
In the case of scientific peer review , the product is scientific papers that meet a presumably high standard of scientific accuracy and professionalism .
Scientific peer review involves distributing review copies of submitted papers to experts in the field in advance of publication .
These usually anonymous experts read and offer comments that suggest improvements in the style , data , or thought processes described in the paper .
The comments are then given to the paper ’s authors who incorporate the suggestion , resubmit the paper to the journal for another round of review and , if there are no additional necessary improvements , the paper is then published .
In my own profession of electrical engineering , the peer reviews tend to be more in - depth than what I just described .
Here ’s the usual list of reviews .
I ’ll pick up after the specification phase , when engineers get handed a design and told “ design this . ”
Any one of the reviews described below may be done repeatedly if the first review finds a significant number of problems .
Project internal design review :
When the design is largely complete , the entire design team sits down and tries to ensure that nothing major was missed .
Problems are identified and corrected before the next review Independent design review : other engineers in the company , often senior engineers with decades of experience , are brought in to review the design with the engineer in charge and other members of the team .
Problems are identified and corrected before the next review .
Customer design review ( optional ) :
If you ’re doing contract engineering work , then the customer often wants to be involved in the design review process .
This review may include any outside experts that the customer hires to review the work as well .
This review always happens after the independent review .
Design document review :
In the process of writing up the documentation in enough detail that another engineer could replicate the design if the engineer in charge were struck by lightning , small errors can be discovered .
These errors would be corrected and the documentation review ( usually by independent reviewers again ) often turns up further small errors missed in earlier reviews .
Preliminary layout review : Just because you can design an electronic circuit does n’t mean it can be built .
Design problems that cause manufacturing difficulties are first identified here .
Final layout review : Due to ( usually ) minor changes that are made during layout , the schematic is reviewed yet again at the same time that the layout of the printed circuit board is .
One major misconception about all varieties of peer review is that the reviews guarantee no errors in the final product .
Not even five or more engineering design reviews described above can ensure that there are n’t any errors in the design .
In fact , one of the differences between a designer with experience and one fresh out of college is that the experienced designer plans for the inevitable errors that are discovered in testing , while the inexperienced designer thinks his or her design wo n’t have errors because it was reviewed .
While catching errors is an important purpose of peer review , what kind of errors are caught and corrected depends greatly on who the expert reviewers are .
If a climatology paper that relies on detailed knowledge of statistics has an error in the statistics , sending the paper to only expert climatology reviewers might not turn up the statistical error .
Similarly , if there ’s a power problem in an electronics design , it might only be detected if a power supply engineer was one of the reviewers .
Ultimately , though , this is n’t a problem – not with peer review in general and not with scientific publications in particular .
Just as there ’s a check on an engineering design review called “ product testing , ” the publication of a peer reviewed paper provides the final check as well .
Once a scientific paper is published , it ’s reasonably likely that someone reading the paper will discover any errors .
Discovered errors are corrected either by a retraction if the error is significant , or by the submission of another another paper describing the errors that also goes through the peer review and publication cycle .
So why does scientific peer review matter ?
Because the peer review process described above is a key component in a process that continually improves the overall quality of scientific research .
And because participating in that process is the price of entry to be taken seriously as a scientist .
It takes confidence in your skills and knowledge in order to put yourself through the wringer that is publication .
After all , your discoveries and data are then publicly available for all to critique , agree with , or even mock .
The process alone provides a level of confidence in the scientific accuracy and veracity of the papers that are published .
After all , anyone can publish a blog filled with with so many numbers that it looks legitimate , but only a scientist would subject him or herself to peer review .
As a final aside , there is no such thing as a “ peer reviewed book . ”
Books are published not based on the quality of the science as determined by anonymous expert reviewers , but rather on a publisher ’s and editor ’s determination of how well the book will sell .
If the science happens to be interesting and accurate , great , but at best that ’s a secondary consideration over profit .
Scientific journals publish papers based on the quality of the science first and foremost , and then charge whatever the market will bear .
Given that a single journal can cost over $ 1,000 per year for a subscription , the market is willing to bear a great deal .
MARCH 16 -- A Florida man wearing an " I ♥ My Marriage " t- shirt was arrested last night for allegedly choking his wife during an argument in their Tampa - area home .
Bradley Gellert , a 32 - year - old financial consultant , was busted by Hillsborough County Sheriff 's Office deputies and booked into jail on a felony domestic battery by strangulation charge .
According to a police report , Gellert , pictured in his mug shot , got into an argument with his wife and " screamed at the victim and threw numerous items . "
He then allegedly " grabbed the victim 's neck and strangled her , " which " prevented the victim from breathing normally . "
Gellert 's spouse subsequently fled the couple 's Apollo Beach home and went to a nearby sheriff 's office to report the incident .
Investigators noted that the woman had been " taken to the ground by the arrestee and suffered an abrasion to her knee and red marks on her neck . "
The " I ♥ My Marriage " shirt was a promotional item tied to the 2008 movie " Fireproof , " a Christian - themed film starring Kirk Cameron .
The movie , a hit in evangelical circles , centers on a fireman 's religious awakening and his simultaneous effort to save a failing marriage .

Amazon.com Inc. said an internal cataloging glitch inadvertently removed more than 57,000 books from its sales rankings and main search page .
The Seattle company was hit by criticism in recent days from the authors of affected books , mainly those focusing on gay themes .
But Amazon said the problem was global , and affected other categories such as health , mind and body , reproductive and sexual medicine and erotica .
" This is an embarrassing and ham - fisted cataloging error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection , " wrote Drew Herdener , Amazon 's director of communications , in an email .
Amazon declined to explain its cataloging process or what had gone wrong with it .
" Many books have now been fixed and we 're in the process of fixing the remainder as quickly as possible , and we intend to implement new measures to make this kind of accident less likely to occur in the future , " added Mr. Herdener .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama lifted all restrictions Monday on the ability of individuals to visit relatives in Cuba , as well as to send them remittances .
The changes in Cuban policy was unveiled before President Obama 's trip to the Summit of the Americas .
The move represents a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century .
It comes days before Obama leaves for a key meeting of hemispheric powers , the Summit of the Americas , in Trinidad and Tobago .
" President Obama has directed that a series of steps be taken to reach out to the Cuban people to support their desire to enjoy basic human rights and to freely determine their country 's future , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said .
Obama also ordered new steps to promote the " freer flow of information among the Cuban people and between those in Cuba and the rest of the world , as well as to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian items directly to the Cuban people , " Gibbs added .
The president took " these steps [ in part ] to help bridge the gap among divided Cuban families . "
Obama believes that the change in U.S. policy will ultimately help bring about a more tolerant , democratic Cuban government , noted White House Latin American policy adviser Dan Restrepo .
He thinks " that creating independence , creating space for the Cuban people to operate freely from the regime is the kind of space they need to start the process toward a more democratic Cuba , " Restrepo said .
Several key components of America 's embargo on the island nation will be preserved , however .
Among other things , Americans will still be barred from sending gifts or other items to high - ranking Cuban government officials and Communist Party members .
Travel restrictions for Americans of non-Cuban descent will also remain in place .
Critics of the change blasted the administration for unilaterally changing what had been a long - settled U.S. policy .
President Raúl Castro's " dictatorship is one of the most brutal in the world .
The U.S. economic embargo must remain in place until tyranny gives way to freedom and democracy , " Rep. Connie Mack , R - Florida , said in a written statement .
Obama " should not make any unilateral change in America 's policy toward Cuba .
Instead , Congress should vigorously debate these and other ideas before any substantive policy changes are implemented . "
Sen . Mel Martinez , R - Florida , and a native of Cuba , had kinder words for the administration , saying , " The announcement today is good news for Cuban families separated by the lack of freedom in Cuba . "
He said that , in turn , the Cuban government should focus on improving its relationships with its citizens and the United States .
" Lowering remittance charges and allowing travel for Cuban families wishing to see relatives abroad are two steps the Cuban regime could immediately take that would show change in Havana , " he said .
Reps .
Chris Smith , R - New Jersey , and Frank Wolf , R - Virginia , held a news conference last week urging Obama to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all " prisoners of conscience , " shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech , and holds " free and fair " elections .
" Over the past 50 years , the Castros and their secret police have been directly responsible for killing thousands of nonviolent , courageous pro-democracy activists and for jailing and torturing tens of thousands of others .
And they continue to this day to perpetrate their brutal crimes , " Smith said .
Rep. Barbara Lee , D - California , who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus , responded that it makes no sense to continue what she characterized as a failed policy .
Watch report on easing of travel restrictions »
" Everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but by any objective standard , our current policy toward Cuba just has n't worked .
Simply put , it 's time to open dialogue and discussion with Cuba , " she said in a written statement .
Lee and other Congressional Black Caucus members met in Havana this month with Raúl Castro and his brother , former President Fidel Castro .
Several members of Congress see broader relations with Cuba as vital to U.S. interests .
A group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill March 31 to lift the 47 - year - old travel ban to Cuba .
" I think that we finally reached a new watermark here on this issue , " said Sen. Byron Dorgan , D - North Dakota , one of the bill 's sponsors .
Sen . Richard Lugar , R - Indiana , another sponsor of the bill , issued a draft report in February that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions .
Lugar is the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Sarah Stephens , director of the Cuba Travel Projects and one of the leading advocates pushing for an end to the embargo , said Monday that " these are welcome steps , but the right course is to allow all Americans to travel to Cuba , to open up commerce and to directly engage the Cuban government in diplomacy and solving problems in both countries ' interests . "
Watch report on whether Cuba is ready for U.S. tourists »
Obama " has a historic opportunity not to be the last president of the Cold War but the first president to turn the page in U.S. - Cuba relations , " she argued .
Before he was elected president , Obama promised to lower some of the barriers in Cuban - American relations .
Provisions attached to a $ 410 billion supplemental budget Obama signed in March also made it easier for Cuban - Americans to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island .
In addition , they facilitated the permitted sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba .
The provisions loosened restrictions enacted by President George W. Bush after he came to office in 2001 .
Obama 's moves appear to be tracking the overall public sentiment on what has historically been a hot - button political issue .
Seventy - one percent of Americans think the United States should re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba , according an April 3 - 5 CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll , and 64 percent think the United States should lift the travel ban to Cuba for all Americans .
Sampling error for the poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points .

“ Simplicity is the essence of happiness . ” – Cedric Bledsoe
Post written by Leo Babauta .
Follow me on Twitter .
A lot of the complexity in our lives come when we try to keep up certain appearances .
A simpler , happier life can be achieved when we drop those appearances and just live naturally , without pretense or artfulness .
Let me give you just a few examples :
There was a time when wardrobe was important to me — I wanted to impress my superiors and so I had lots of ( fairly ) expensive clothes .
Now that I ’ve decided I do n’t need to keep up those appearances , I normally wear shorts and a T - shirt and sandals to all of my meetings .
I do n’t pretend to be someone I ’m not , and people can deal with me on those terms or not .
I ’m happier , and my wardrobe and life are simpler for it .
I ’ve also decided that a huge , fancy house and beautiful luxury car are no longer important to me ( not that I ever had either , but I did strive for them ) .
Now I go for function , and I ’m debt - free .
There was also a time when I tried to impress others with my knowledge , intelligence , competence .
I ’d try to show off , or take on more than I could handle , just to impress people .
Now I worry less about this and instead just try to do the best I can in whatever I do .
In the end , I ’m more satisfied with the job I do , and with myself , and others seem to be happy with this as well .
Shaking off these pretenses , this artfulness , results in simplicity .
It ’s when we try to hold up the pretenses that things get complex .
We ’re also less honest , and less true to ourselves .
Learn to live a simpler , more natural life , and drop the pretenses one at a time .
You ’ll be glad you did .
A few ideas to get you started :
Dress :
Do your clothes aim to impress ?
Do you have to keep a complicated , expensive wardrobe to maintain this image ?
How can you shed this need to impress , and just dress simply and functionally instead ?
I ’m not saying you need to dress in rags ( or wear sandals , as I do ) .
But if you decide that you do n’t need to impress anyone , you can drop a lot of your wardrobe “ needs ” and simplify things tremendously .
Grooming : I no longer worry about grooming as much as I once did .
Now I have a shaved head , and my grooming tools are down to a reasonable minimum : soap , razor and shaving cream , deodorant , electric trimmer ( for the hair ) .
I do n’t need hair products , aftershave , a comb , or many other grooming products .
Of course , not everyone is going to shave their head , but going for a more natural look could simplify things : stop trying to look a certain way , and you can cut back on the number of grooming products and tools you use and keep .
Language : I know lots of people who use “ impressive ” language , often full of jargon or academic - speak or geek - speak .
Well , that might impress some , but knowledgeable people know that you ’re covering up a lack of real competence with complicated language .
Speak simply , with plain language , and your real intelligence will shine through .
You ’ll also communicate better — a plus in my book .
Decorating : Almost every home I visit is filled with decorative things , perhaps meant to impress or convey a certain message about the home .
I find that the simple , natural look is better — subtract as much as you can , until you are left with a minimum of simple , beautiful things .
For example , my walls are covered by only three pieces of art ( all done by my dad ) .
Everything else in my house is functional furniture — no decorative anything .
Gifts :
When we try to impress and keep up appearances , we can end up spending a lot of money on gifts , especially around the holidays but also on birthdays and other occasions .
And while I think it ’s great to show someone that you care with a gift , does it really need to be expensive ?
Ca n’t something home - made , or consumable , be just as nice ?
Or perhaps you can do something nice for someone , like a massage or chores or babysitting ?
Keep things simple , but show you care .
Work :
Do n’t do things at work to impress — you ’ll end up doing things that are artificial and false , and often stretch too far and fail , or at least show your shortcomings .
While there ’s nothing wrong with having shortcomings ( who does n’t have them ? ) , you should aim instead to do the best you can , not because you want to impress but because you want to feel good about the job you ’ve done .
Transportation : Forget about an impressive car — go for minimalism and function .
I have a van because I need one ( yes , I have 6 kids , and yes , I know that ’s not keeping things simple ) , but if you only need a tiny car , go for that .
Or maybe you do n’t need a car at all — can public transportation or a bike suffice ?
I ’ve been walking more , for transportation , because I no longer worry about what people will think of me when I ’m the only one in my town who walks places .
As a result , I get more exercise , and I enjoy the outdoors more .
Oh , and I help conserve resources a little more .
Devices :
Do you have to have the latest and greatest gadget ( the iPhone , the Palm Pre , the Android ) , not because you need it but because you want to show people you have it ?
I ’ve done this many times .
I bought a Macbook Air , telling myself that I needed a laptop ( which I did ) and that the Air was the best functional device for me because it was light and a Mac and fairly minimalist in function ( I only need it for writing and Internet ) .
But really I just loved its sleek and minimalist design .
Pretension , not simplicity .
Drop the pretension and get only what you need .
( Btw , I do n’t regret getting the Air — I really love using it and it works beautifully for my needs . )
There are many more ways you can live a simpler life by dropping artfulness in different areas .
What areas have you changed by dropping pretenses ?
What areas would you like to change ?

This month 's devastating wave of suicide attacks in Afghanistan ( including three attacks on Monday , which brought the total number to 69 since 2005 ) is a grim reminder that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , under fire for his role in Iraq , has been the architect of not one but two failing wars – and of a dangerous vision for how to apply American power .
August 2002 was Afghanistan's " Mission Accomplished " moment .
Mr. Rumsfeld declared the military effort " a breathtaking accomplishment " and " a successful model of what could happen to Iraq . "
America had routed the Taliban , disrupted Al Qaeda , and set Afghanistan on a course for stability and democracy – and it had done it Rumsfeld 's way , at little cost and with minimal loss of life .
But in reality , the mission was never accomplished .
Five years after Sept. 11 , America 's efforts in Afghanistan , as in Iraq , are unraveling .
The country 's government remains weak and corrupt , and it faces daunting obstacles : dismal development indicators , an entrenched opium industry , and a reinvigorated insurgency .
How did things go so wrong so quickly ?
Certainly Rumsfeld and his team made tactical errors , but it's hard not to trace the mistakes to a more systemic problem : a dangerously naive notion of American power that was ascendant in Washington .
The Rumsfeld doctrine , in military terms , stresses reliance on high technology and air power and downplays large ground forces .
Its corollaries are that America operates best when unencumbered by international institutions , that state - building is a distraction , and that force can accomplish political objectives with few long - term repercussions .
Afghanistan was the laboratory for this new notion of warfare and national power .
Rumsfeld 's Pentagon wanted to demonstrate that small groups of ground forces combined with overwhelming air power could win wars – in theory , a useful approach because it limits American casualties and costs .
The doctrine 's failures in Iraq are well documented .
But its shortcomings in Afghanistan have received less attention because the unraveling has occurred in slow motion and with scant media attention .
The Taliban were routed by small teams of Special Forces , who directed devastating airstrikes and guided their Afghan allies on the ground .
But victory was never achieved .
America's Afghan proxies allowed Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden to slip away and reestablish their operations in Pakistan .
The Taliban were driven out , but were never disbanded or politically reintegrated , and their reconstituted forces , drawing from the Iraq playbook , have made this the bloodiest year yet .
Of course we will never know what would have happened if the war in Afghanistan had been handled differently : if America had taken up NATO 's Article 5 declaration ( " an attack against one is an attack against all " ) in earnest and led a genuinely multinational force ; or if the expanded coalition had deployed 200,000 troops , rather than 20,000 , and stabilized the whole country , rather than just Kabul ; if peacekeepers from Muslim nations had been enlisted ; if ground troops were in place to cut off Mr. bin Laden 's escape ; or if the 5th Special Forces Group had been permitted to continue its hunt for bin Laden , rather than being redeployed to prepare for Iraq .
If security had been established , the new Afghan government would have had a major head start in building on its early popularity to consolidate authority and disarm warlords and spoilers .
Development projects might have won the hearts and minds of Afghans , rather than being bottled up because of insecure conditions .
The hard - core Taliban might have been shattered and its more moderate backers integrated into the political process .
The drug lords , who thrive on lawlessness , could have been confronted and poppy farmers provided with genuine livelihoods .
We will never know because Rumsfeld and the administration took a different tack .
Washington marginalized international institutions and long insisted that the ad hoc peacekeeping force be limited to Kabul .
It subcontracted security to mujahideen in the provinces .
It fought a narrowly conceived war against the Taliban that combined airstrikes and civilian detentions , neither sufficiently precise and each arousing deep resentment .
It bypassed the United Nations to divide responsibility for rebuilding the Afghan state among a handful of Western countries – a messy and costly endeavor made more difficult by the absence of authoritative coordination .
The result has been a steady unraveling in Afghanistan , as in Iraq .
These are , to be sure , the president 's wars , but they were fought under Rumsfeld 's strategy .
Each was predicated on unrealistic notions of what could be achieved by force , and each dismissed the importance of international legitimacy .
Afghanistan is not yet lost , but what once required several ounces of prevention now requires a pound of cure .
