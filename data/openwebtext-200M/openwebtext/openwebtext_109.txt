George Washington University Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley says that the latest NSA warrantless wiretapping revelations -- wherein the administration knowingly broke the law and continued spying on American citizens after top DoJ officials refused to certify the legality of the program -- make this a " clear impeachable offense .

" The problem comes down to the failure of Congress to deal with what is a very ugly and unfortunate fact .
This would be a clear impeachable offense .
I do n't know of a more potential charge of impeachment within the modern presidency .
This quote from Glenn sums it up perfectly :
And , as I 've asked many times before , if we passively allow the President to simply break the law with impunity in how the government spies on our conversations , what do n't we allow ?
Under FISA , spying on American citizens on American soil without a warrant is a felony .
President Bush has been caught red - handed violating that law , and has even admitted as much .
If there are no longer consequences for breaking the law , what has our country become ?
A Japanese man who arranged suicide pacts via the internet with three people he subsequently killed has been sentenced to death , AFP reports .
Hiroshi Maeue , 38 , met a 25 - year - old woman online and " proposed that they kill themselves together " .
However , when they entered the car chosen to host the suicide , he " bound her with ropes and choked her to death " .
His other victims were " a 21 - year - old college student and a 14 - year - old junior high school student " , similarly dispatched .
Maeue filmed the murders and even issued a ransom demand for the high school student 's return after killing him .
A court - ordered examination confirmed Maeue did not suffer " any mental disorder and that he was mentally competent " .
He pleaded guilty to the charges .
In sentencing Maeue to hang , Osaka District Court presiding Judge Kazuo Mizushima said : " The crime was cruel , harsh , and outrageous .
This was a crime aimed at fulfilling the accused 's sexual desire .
It is difficult for him to change these unusual characteristics .
We can not help but give the extreme penalty . " ®
THE yen is perhaps the world 's most undervalued currency .
It is even cheaper than the Chinese yuan by some measures .
Last week the Japanese currency hit an all - time low against the euro and its real trade - weighted value fell to its lowest since at least 1970 , according to an index tracked by JPMorgan .
But do not expect the G7 finance ministers and central bankers meeting in Essen , Germany , on February 9th and 10th to spend much time discussing the yen , let alone to do anything to support it .
American and European policymakers do not see eye to eye on the yen .
The Europeans would like some action to push up the currency , which , they say , is not bearing its fair share of the dollar 's decline .
Our latest update of The Economist 's Big Mac index suggests that the yen is a massive 40 % undervalued against the euro .
America 's big carmakers have also complained that the weak yen makes imported Japanese cars unfairly cheap .
However , neither the American nor the Japanese government thinks there is a problem .
Hank Paulson , America 's treasury secretary , says he is not worried about the yen 's weakness because it is market - driven and reflects economic fundamentals — namely low interest rates and a fragile economy .
China , in contrast , is accused of manipulating its currency with heavy intervention .
Mr Paulson is being short - sighted .
Even if Japan is not intervening to hold down its currency , the yen is still misaligned .
A country with one of the world 's largest current - account surpluses and low inflation ( but no longer deflation ) should have a much stronger currency .
Japan 's economy is no longer flat on its back .
Last year it grew by an estimated 2.3 % , and it is forecast to maintain a similar pace this year .
As a result , Japan does not need such low interest rates or a super - cheap currency any more .
Indeed , Japan 's abnormally low rates could be viewed as a form of intervention to hold down the yen .
The Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) bowed to government pressure and held rates unchanged at 0.25 % in January .
But figures due on February 15th , which are expected to show that GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.5 - 4 % in the three months to December , could give the bank the green light to raise rates at its next meeting .
This weekend the G7 could usefully back such a move .
The yen has been pushed down in recent months by the highly profitable “ carry trade ” .
At its simplest this involves borrowing in yen at very low interest rates to buy higher - yielding assets , such as American or Australian bonds , or even emerging - market debt that offers a still more lucrative interest margin .
Carry trades weaken the Japanese currency , because investors sell the borrowed yen to convert them into other currencies .
Carry trades make sense only if the investor assumes that the yen will remain weak .
If it appreciated , this would increase the repayment cost of yen - borrowing and offset the interest differential .
But such an assumption is dangerous when the yen is already so undervalued .
In theory , carry trades should not yield a predictable profit because the difference in interest rates between two countries should equal the rate at which investors expect the low - interest - rate currency , here the yen , to rise against the high - interest - rate one .
But the carry trade turns this logic upside down by causing the yen to fall , not rise .
This , in turn , lures more investors into the same strategy , amplifying the distortion .
Mr Paulson may be revealing more than he intends when he says the yen is “ market - driven ” : the market is chasing its own tail in defiance of the economic fundamentals .
An elusive number
Nobody really knows how big the carry trade is .
Japanese official figures show little evidence of large net lending to foreigners .
For much of 2006 Japan actually had a net inflow of bond investment .
Estimates based on the short - term net foreign lending of Japanese banks put the carry trade at only $ 200 billion .
But hedge funds do not need to borrow yen and then buy higher - yielding currencies .
Instead , the carry trade is typically done through transactions , such as currency forward swaps , that are off - balance - sheet and therefore do not show up in official statistics .
A better clue comes from record net “ short ” positions in yen futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
Estimates of the total size of the carry trade range as high as $ 1 trillion .
The term “ carry trade ” usually refers to leveraged trades by speculative international investors , such as hedge funds .
But Japanese households have also shifted money out of their low - interest - rate bank accounts to earn a higher return in , say , New Zealand bonds .
These outflows are certainly large , but they are of a very different nature .
If markets suddenly become more volatile , hedge funds can very quickly unwind their short yen positions , whereas households are more likely to sit tight .
It is the volatile type of trade that central bankers lose sleep over .
The received wisdom in the markets is that yen carry trades will continue as long as the BoJ raises rates only slowly .
It would take a rise in Japanese interest rates of at least two percentage points to undermine these trades , and nobody thinks that likely in the next year or so .
Furthermore , goes the argument , as long as interest rates stay low , so will the yen .
In fact , the main trigger for an unwinding of carry trades is likely to be not Japanese interest rates , but an upsurge in currency volatility .
That is what happened in 1998 , when enormous yen carry trades had built up .
After Russia 's default in August and the subsequent near collapse of Long - Term Capital Management , hedge funds reduced their leveraged positions and the yen started to rise .
Then in October the Japanese government announced a plan to recapitalise its crippled banks , which further bolstered the currency , forcing those who had bet against it to cover their positions .
The yen jumped by 13 % within three days .
Nouriel Roubini , at Roubini Global Economics , says that the lesson of 1998 is that it takes only a small piece of positive news to unravel such trades .
Suppose there is suddenly some good news about the Japanese economy at the same time as America 's appears to be stalling .
An initial rise in the yen could cause today 's carry trades to unwind just as rapidly , causing the currency to soar , American interest rates to rise and risk spreads to widen .
The volume of yen - related leverage is probably greater now than in 1998 .
The G7 should be concerned about carry trades not just because they could suddenly unwind and trigger financial turmoil but also because the yen 's misalignment is distorting the world economy .
The yen carry trade has amplified global liquidity ( see article ) , further inflating asset - price bubbles across the world .
The trade has also prolonged global imbalances by making it easier for countries such as America , Britain and Australia to finance their large current - account deficits .
A severely misaligned exchange rate calls for action .
It is true , as Mr Paulson says , that Japan is not intervening to hold down the yen .
But since Japan still holds almost $ 900 billion of foreign - exchange reserves , accumulated a few years ago when it was intervening , it is hard to claim that the currency is truly market - determined .
Stephen Jen , an economist at Morgan Stanley , argues that Japan 's Ministry of Finance should consider selling some of those reserves to break the one - way bet against the yen .
There is a risk that such a move could itself upset financial markets .
But the lower the yen slides , the greater the threat of an even sharper rebound .
In the mid-1980's , a breakthrough in the world of prosthetic limbs occurred .
An amputee by the name of Van Philips , disillusioned with the response of his existing foot , set about reinventing the prosthetic foot .
As a result , the Flex Foot was born ; a lightweight foot [ that looked nothing like a foot ] made from carbon fibre , the consequence of which has improved the lives of thousands of amputees around the world .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
The Flex Foot has gone through several refinements since the 1980's , as a result , amputee sprinters are racing towards an Olympic showdown with their non-amputee counterparts .
Amputee runners benefited from the technological advance almost immediately .
The first proponent of running on the Flex Foot was former soccer player Dennis Oehler .
Oehler shaved seconds off 100 m , 200 m and 400 m at the 1988 Paralympics in Seoul .
However , in 1992 and 1996 a new phenom by the name of Tony Volpentest took over the crown , made even more phenomenal by the fact Volpentest was a double arm amputee and leg amputee below the knee .
In the summer of 2003 , American Marlon Shirley became the first leg amputee to break the 10 second barrier for the 100 meters .
In 2005 , Shirley 's records were surpassed by South African Oscar Pistorius who clocked a 21.4 for the 200 m and 47.34 for the 400m .
Pistorius ' time in the 400 m surpassed the gold medal winning time in the men's 400 m event at the 1928 Olympics .
At the current rate of improvement , a leg amputee could at least qualify for the 2012 Olympics with possible records being broken shortly thereafter .
However , a significant barrier must be broken before any amputee sprinters gets anywhere near an Olympic qualifying heat .
' Challenged ' or ' assisted ' ?
As it stands , there are numerous examples of where athletes with disabilities have been denied competition against their " able - bodied " counterparts .
In 1976 , a Canadian above knee amputee qualified for the Montreal Olympics 10 meter pistol shooting event .
Shortly after qualifying at the Canadian trials , the shooter who garnered 3rd place behind the amputee shooter complained the prosthetic leg was a " support device " .
As a result of the challenge and the slow moving process of interpreting the problem , he was denied the right to compete at the ' 76 games , even after qualifying .
Other similar instances of rules being inappropriately applied have arisen , with amputee athletes bearing the brunt of the inappropriateness .
Given this past history , chances are amputee sprinters will never make it to an Olympic sprint final , regardless of how fast they run .
The narrow position between " challenged " and " assisted " is practically non-existent ; amputee sprinters will be interpreted as one or the other .
As long as there is a disgruntled athlete willing to use rules to this end , amputee sprinters will have to face this hurdle sooner or later at the Olympic level .
History shows us that rules eventually get changed , slowly and only after the fact .
Sport is often held as a mirror to our society , sport often reflects our changing societal values and vice versa .
If and when this particular change happens , it could well be interpreted as the most important technological improvement on the human body ; the ramifications of this event are staggering .
Combined with a worldwide media audience of millions , how we as a society accept or reject the validity of prosthetic limbs as an improvement to the human body will be subject of many philosophical debates far beyond the scope of sport and " disability " .

HYDERABAD , India ( Reuters ) -
An elderly Indian husband and wife were burnt to death after villagers accused them of practicing black magic , tied them together on a pyre and set them on fire , police said Thursday .
“ The aged couple died screaming for help , ” said police superintendent P.V. Sunil Kumar .
Sayanna , 70 , and his 61 - year - old wife , Pochamma , were set ablaze after being doused with kerosene .
Both were farm laborers near the southern city of Hyderabad who also practiced traditional medicine .
Police have arrested six villagers for the incident .
Belief in black magic is common in some parts of rural India , despite the country ’s robust economic growth and cutting - edge high - technology industries .
Dozens of women are murdered each year after being accused of witchcraft .
Last year , a barber in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh killed his four - year - old son by slitting his throat with a razor after the man started seeing visions of the Hindu goddess Kali demanding a sacrifice .

During his presidency , Bill Clinton would conclude his trips abroad by telling his advisors that he was determined to use the powers of his office .
Those powers ,  of course , included what are called executive orders ,  which are orders that come from the office of the president of the United States and have the force of law .
Lest anyone think that Congress is supposed to be the supreme lawmaking body of the central government of the United States , those days have long passed .
A trend that began during the War Between the States and that accelerated during the Progressive Era and the Great Depression continues unabated .
Laws and lawmakers are not what they used to be and certainly not what existed when the republic known as the United States of America was formed .
The typical schoolroom civics class is taught that the U.S. government has three branches —
Congress , the president or chief executive , and the U.S. Supreme Court .
Congress , it is said , makes the laws , presidents enforce them , and the Court interprets the laws .
Each branch has its own delegated powers , which creates a balance in which no entity gains power at the expense of another .
While this makes for nice , tidy civics lessons , the truth is found elsewhere .
The political reality of the 20th century , and now the 21st century , is that Congress has faded greatly in importance , with the executive branch gaining the most strength .
( Despite what many conservatives claim , the federal courts , while powerful , also have ceded some of their powers to the executive , as shall be later explained . )
Furthermore , the executive branch has two powerful entities within it — the presidency itself and the bureaucracies , which in many ways wield more power than the president .
One may speak of an imperial presidency  but a more accurate description is that of an imperial bureaucracy . 
Bipartisan executive orders
The president of the United States wields the power to issue an executive order ,  which is an order supposedly based on current law .
For example , near the end of his presidency , Bill Clinton issued an executive order greatly reducing the amount of arsenic ( which often appears naturally in groundwater in Western communities ) that was permitted in a municipal water supply .
He said that this order was based on the Clean Water Act and other laws Congress previously had passed .
Likewise , upon taking office , George W. Bush issued an executive order changing how the federal government would fund research into embryonic stem cells .
Once issued , an executive order has the force of law and can serve as the basis for challenges in court .
For example , environmental groups recently took the Bush administration to court , claiming it was not obeying Clintons executive orders to close huge portions of national forest lands to loggers , and the courts agreed .
Likewise , Congress recently attempted to pass legislation expanding the federal role in embryonic stem cell research in order to counter Bushs original executive order .
As former Clinton aide Paul Begala once remarked ,  Stroke of the pen , law of the land .
Kinda cool .
There is no specific provision in the Constitution for presidents to issue executive orders .
However , as was recently made clear when Congress made a somewhat feeble attempt to rein in the proclivities of CIA field officers and U.S. military personnel to torture suspected terrorists held by U.S. forces , the Bush administration claims to reserve the right to interpret legislation as it sees fit .
In other words , Bush ( not to mention other presidents before him and almost certainly presidents to follow ) declares that the executive branch owns the power supposedly held by the judicial branch to be the interpreter of legislation .
While executive orders themselves have the authority of law , supporters of this process hold that the power to issue such orders is not the same as the power to make new laws .
As shall be demonstrated , that is a point of debate ; surely , the ability of the executive branch to issue executive orders and to interpret law — and to influence the courts along the way — tells us that we are close to having an all - powerful and all - encompassing branch of government that ultimately is not accountable to anyone .
That certainly was not the intent of those who framed the Constitution when they created the office of president of the United States .
Founding principles
The Constitution of the United States is a marvelous document that carefully attempts to lay a balance of power from the central government to the states and also within the central government itself .
As Jacob Hornberger and others have noted in this publication , the original decentralist principle of spreading political power among the states has been steadily replaced by the centralization of power in Washington , D.C .
While we have dealt often with the fact that power has moved from the states to the central government , another power shift has gone on within the central government itself , as power has shifted from both the legislative branches and the courts to the executive branch .
Furthermore , there is an element of the executive branch that is almost impervious to change , that being the established bureaucracies , where policies are made by employees who , in effect , are tenured and who have managed to accumulate powers for which there is no antidote .
The ultimate problem comes when the White House and the bureaucracies effectively join forces in order to impose various political orders that almost are impossible to overturn once they come into force .
Thus , any real balance of power has long been abandoned , as the executive branch has accumulated powers that no other branch can — or is willing — to dislodge .
The Framers , who understood that concentration of power ultimately would mean that those people who held political authority could exercise their powers in tyrannical fashion , clearly did not wish for such a thing to happen .
The genius of the Constitution was found not simply in the Bill of Rights ( which was a recognition of the rights that people already held and which prohibited the central government from infringing those rights ) , but also in the way that the powers of the various political entities were separated .
The idea was simple but profound : divide the powers that the state and federal governmental bodies are permitted to exercise .
Furthermore , not all aspects of this division of powers were spelled out , but the implications were there .
For example , Abraham Lincolns contention notwithstanding , early Americans believed that secession was a political option for states or groups of states .
Even before seven Southern coastal states cut their ties with the United States in late 1860 and early 1861 , a number of other states , including those of New England , had earlier threatened to leave the Union over matters of war and taxation .
The longest - lasting legacy of Lincoln is not the War Between the States or even the violent way in which slavery ended in the United States .
Lincoln was able to use brute force to settle the various arguments regarding the centralization of political power in this country .
As the late Shelby Foote said during an interview on Ken Burnss PBS documentary on the Civil War , in the years before the war people spoke of the United States in the plural , as in  the United States are .
However , after the war , people spoke of the country in the singular , as in  the United States is . 
Perhaps the most famous document to come from the war was the Emancipation Proclamation , an executive order which Lincoln issued on January 1 , 1863 .
Despite the continuing belief that Lincolns proclamation freed the slaves ,  in reality , it freed no one , but it did have the effect of further concentrating power in the executive branch .
The Emancipation Proclamation declared that all slaves living in the areas of the Confederate States of America which were not secured by Union forces were legally free .
In and of itself , it was a curious claim , as it failed to emancipate slaves held in Union slave states such as Delaware and Kentucky ; and people living in the Confederate States did not believe themselves to be subject to Lincoln or any other Northern political institution , so it could not free slaves in those places , at least by itself .
( Union soldiers did use the Emancipation Proclamation to justify releasing slaves as they occupied new territories in the South .
However , given the state of the fighting , it is just as likely that Union forces would have freed those slaves anyway , if for no other reason than to cripple the economies of the Southern states , making it more difficult for the Confederates to continue to fight . )
In issuing his order , Lincoln did not refer to any specific statutes — as there were none that he could have claimed as the basis of the Emancipation Proclamation .
Instead , he said that the Constitution gave him that particular power .
( Indeed , following the war , Congress pushed through the Thirteenth Amendment to abolish chattel slavery , as abolitionists fretted about the legality of Lincolns order , and decided to anchor the prohibition into the Constitution itself .
The popularity of the order notwithstanding , abolitionists rightly feared that the Supreme Court would overturn it because of the absence of any legal basis for Lincolns actions . )
While the Lincoln presidency and the War Between the States did not lead to an immediate flood of new executive orders , it did help to set a longer - term precedent of concentrating powers in the executive branch .
When the Progressive Era came to the United States , one can say that Lincoln helped to set the table when the intellectuals and political classes began to demand that government be centralized and that the presidency be strengthened .
The Great Depression and the subsequent New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt were a major turning point , as far as the power of the executive branch is concerned .
Because the business downturn was so severe , Americans were willing to try anything , and that anything from the Roosevelt administration was the old Progressive agenda of turning power over to the executive branch .
Growth of executive orders
As Paul Craig Roberts and Lawrence W. Stratton point out in their book The Tyranny of Good Intentions , the entire business of congressional lawmaking changed .
Instead of passing legislation that was carefully written and aimed at laying down clear boundaries , Congress began to crank out laws willy - nilly that were hastily written and unclear both in their language and their intent .
( That is still the case , as most lawmakers do not even read the legislation they pass , preferring to leave that job to staffers , as well as the lobbyists and people from the executive branch , since those two groups actually are the authors of much current legislation . )
Roberts and Stratton write that Joseph T. Robinson ( Senate Majority Leader , 1933 — 1937 ) wept at the realization of what Congress was doing .
Most important was that Congress came to accept its role as being secondary in the legislative process , and the courts agreed to give up part of their role in the interpretation of congressional law .
This should not be surprising , given that one of the tenets of Progressivism was that experts  should be the decision - makers when it came to the workings of government .
Thus , if prosecutors and U.S. Department of Justice attorneys were the experts ,  the courts agreed to defer to them .
( One obvious example of this deference was how the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1970s began to interpret the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
The law specifically forbade the use of racial quotas , and one of the bills sponsors , Sen .
Hubert Humphrey , declared he would eat the pages of the law itself if it permitted racial quotas .
However , at the prodding of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission , the high court later declared that it would defer to the expert opinion of the commission and interpret the 1964 law as requiring employers to have certain numerical standards — quotas , if you will — in order to be in compliance  with the law .
In this case , it was the triumph of the bureaucracy over the wishes of the White House , which only underscores the tremendous power that the bureaucracies wield . )
Emboldened by the failure of Congress and the courts to hold their ground , the executive branch has grown in power , authority , and its ability to control the lives of individual Americans without fear of legal retribution .
From Roosevelts executive order seizing private gold holdings of Americans , to his order to illegally intern Japanese - Americans during World War II , to Clintons executive order to bomb Serbia in 1999 , to the slew of orders from the Bush administration , executive orders have become tools for the president and executive - branch bureaucrats to impose their own agendas that by themselves could not get past Congress .
Moreover , Bushs recent statements after signing an anti-torture  bill from Congress that he would interpret the law in any way he saw fit shows only how big the problem has become .
Both Republicans and Democrats are fond of referring to the imperial presidency  when someone from the opposite party is in the White House .
Yet both parties have acted to protect and strengthen the presidency when it was to their advantage .
For example , while Republicans supposedly favor more decentralized  government , they consistently have given the central government more power ( at the expense of the states ) since they came to control Congress in 1995 .
Democrats , on the other hand , who coined the term imperial presidency  during Richard Nixons years in office , nevertheless raised no objection when Bill Clinton ordered dozens of military interventions across the globe .

On Tuesday , I used my car 's spinning rim as a centrifuge .
I need to separate the oil from the water in an emulsion .
It is an important step for another experiment , and I did n't know quite how I was going to do it .
I had already tried freezing and thawing with lousy results .
A centrifuge is a device which spins around , subjecting whatever is inside to a strong force .
This force can be used to separate the heavy parts of a mixture from the lighter parts .
For example , if you spin a nearly - empty bottle of chocolate sauce around , you can force the remaining chocolate sauce towards the opening .
I 've also used a centrifuge at a Laundromat overseas .
For just 25 p , my wet clothes were spun at an incredible speed , whipping water out of them .
This was much cheaper and energy efficient than heating the clothes and removing the water through evaporation .
Though , it did seem a little dangerous .
Centrifuges are also used to separate cream from whole milk .
Given time , the cream will rise to the top .
If you use a centrifuge , you can separate the two in just a few minutes .
Centrifuges are commonly used in biology to separate parts of whole blood .
The spinning action forces blood cells and platelets to the bottom of the container , while clear plasma is left at the top .
( It is easier to perform chemical tests using just the plasma ) .
For industrial applications , a continuous centrifuge is sometimes used .
A continuous centrifuge works by pouring liquid onto a stack of spinning bowls .
The bowls are arranged almost like a Christmas tree , spinning on its trunk .
The liquid which is to be separated ( feedstock ) is poured down the center , where it falls onto the plates .
The heavier material ( precipitate ) tends to fly away from the lighter part of the fluid ( supernatant ) , falling against the sides of a bowl and splatting against the inside walls of the centrifuge .
The lighter material ends up pressed against the sides too , but the heavy material is always closest to the actual walls .
The mechanism for a salad spinner or laundry centrifuge is a little different .
The cylinder which contains the clothes or lettuce is perforated , allowing liquid to be flung completely out of the spinning cylinder , away from the clothes or lettuce .
Centrifuges can also be used to separate mixed gasses .
This can be hard to envision , but just as heavier gasses drift to the ground in the atmosphere , heavier gasses get pulled to the outside of the can in a centrifuge .
For example , if you put a helium / nitrogen mix into a centrifuge , the heavy nitrogen would be thrown flush against the outside walls .
The helium would also be thrown toward the walls , but it would lie against the layer of nitrogen there .
Gas centrifuges are always in the news because they are used to separate the valuable , dangerous , volatile isotopes of Uranium 235 from natural Uranium , which is mostly comprised of lowly Uranium 238 .
Building gas centrifuges that can actually separate the two varieties is really tough , because the two isotopes are almost exactly the same weight ( And they are expensive , caustic and radioactive , not to mention Mohammad el Baradei will be all over your ass if he hears about your plans ) .

I have been working on a number of Erlang - based projects this week ; it 's spring break !
Most of them are just simple libraries .
I would think that my code is not the greatest , but I did notice a few things .
1 . Having variables not change state does help .
Coupling that with unit testing , it makes debugging quite straightforward .
The fact is , is that when you focus using functional techniques , by that virtue alone , you remove indeterminacy in what values variables are .
Imperative programming did tend to make me a sloppier programmer , I think , and for this , I always felt a bit uncomfortable with the type of code I was writing .
In Erlang , most errors that I am making are mostly silly pattern matching errors .
I will admit , in this regard , just in terms of the variable issue , I feel more confident with the code that I am writing .
2 . I faced some challenges when I was dealing with looping over some data structure that seemed perfect for a regular loop .
In these cases , given that I forced myself to pose the question in a functional way , the resulting code was more concise in the end .
3 .
Besides minor problems that would come up , I have been consistently producing semi-complicated functions that work correctly the first time .
I have not documented specifically when this has occurred .
All I remember is that it happened a number of times and I was pleasantly surprised .
It is a pleasant surprise because it never seemed to happen that way when working in an imperative language .
In functional programming , with Erlang , there are cases where I consider what the problem is , write a little documentation to describe it , then just write it ( I have not committed myself to TDD yet ) .
Thinking functionally gives me a chance to look at the problem on a very high level , like , in terms of how the data structure is structured , the types of transformations that are applied to the structure , and what the results of functions over the data structure are .
With those in mind , producing good - working functions tend to be the result .
4 . I will admit that I have not worked much concurrency with Erlang .
Most of the work I have done has been using sequential Erlang .
Concurrency is a little harder , but the times I have actually worked with it were times when I just sat down and coded something , not exactly knowing what I was coding .
I wrote a short program that opens a large number of processes and then each process sends a message to each other process .
There was some weird things that were occurring with it , but it works , and not being a multi- threading wizard by a long shot , I think this was really really nice .
5 . Pattern matching is probably one of the most useful language features next to variables not changing values ( of course though , the two ideas are connected , since variables are patterns . )
The type of things that I am doing with pattern matching is just utterly amazing ; I use it in every program I write .
The power lies in how I am able to describe large ideas through simple functions , by a matter of how the particular function accepts its input .
In one tool I am writing ( the one I mentioned in the prior post ) , I can easily categorize a cross-section of features for different parts of the execution of the tool using patterns ; the approach is concise and is very clear to me .
Here is an example :
In the code above , I handle a case where web form data is valid .
I have two such forms in this case , and they are both related to authentication .
My tool goes ahead and validates the data that comes in and is able to call the right function above .
I can't explain how neat this is .
I wish Python had something like this .
( Let me explain a design goal in this .
If a user submits a form on the web , it comes to my server and my tool checks to see if the form is valid .
If so , it calls the " when_valid " function .
If there is no " when_valid " function , it calls a default version .
The " when_valid " function just returns data .
This is opposed to a normal ErlyWeb controller where you return an ErlyWeb tuple .
I separated that out , since I never liked framework - level code to be mixed in such a way with this type of application logic . ) 6 .
Not worrying about OOP has helped me immensely .
When I stopped thinking about OOPish things , which is one reason why I started using functional programming more , it has helped me focus on my problems more .
There are a number of things that have started to go through my head on this issue .
Of course , it is a bit personalized .
One of the main issues is that , whenever I am working in an OOP language , I feel obligated to do things in an OOPish way and not in a way that solves the problem most simply , as well as cleanly .
This is merely my way of wanting to use the best practices of the language .
To me though , the best practices of a given OOP language are not really the best practices to me .
The confirmation of my incremental success that I stated earlier lies in the absence of OOP .
Maybe for big enterprise -y stuff it works nice .
Maybe it is nice to know what a particular piece of data is , in the context of a software system .
Maybe something like data encapsulation on objects really does wonders for ensuring some form of safety of implementation in big software systems .
But , for the first , I am not working on enterprise -y stuff .
For the second , if I need to say what something is , I put it in a tuple , and document that , for example , the data that is being returned is a tuple that begins with a specific atom .
And , for the third , if I need data encapsulation , I always got the support of Erlang 's module system .
I could go on what * I * do not need in OOP .
This is not the point .
I have come to the opinion now if I am worrying myself over side concerns to suit the best practices of a language , maybe I should try another language .
This is , at least , for cases where I have complete control over language choice .
I do worry over Erlang standards .
I lay out all my projects the OTP way .
I try to focus on writing code with the principle of " just let it crash if it fails . "
But see , these things do n't get in my way .
Anyway , I went on too long .
So , I 'll shush now .
Mr Gaidar was rushed to intensive care after collapsing in Dublin
Mr Gaidar became violently ill during a visit to Ireland last week , and his daughter Maria told the BBC that doctors believe he was poisoned .
Irish police are investigating the claims , as he recovers in Moscow .
Mr Gaidar , 50 , fell ill a day after Russian ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko died of radiation poisoning in London .
Mr Gaidar briefly served as prime minister in 1992 under Russian President Vladimir Putin 's predecessor , Boris Yeltsin .
He now heads a Moscow - based think - tank which has criticised President Putin 's economic policies , but he is a marginal political figure who is not regarded as a prominent political opponent of the Russian leader .
' Pale and thin '
Mr Gaidar suffered from a nose bleed and vomiting before fainting in Dublin last Friday , during a visit to promote his book The Death of Empire : Lessons for Contemporary Russia .
YEGOR GAIDAR June - Dec 1992 : Russian acting prime minister Implemented economic " shock therapy " Director of Institute for the Economy in Transition
Ms Gaidar , an anti-Kremlin activist , told the BBC doctors in Moscow had been unable to find any other cause except poisoning .
" The doctors think that they do n't find any other reason of his condition that he was poisoned with some strange poison they cannot identify , " she said .
" But to have an official conclusion they 're still waiting for the information of the doctors of Dublin . "
She said that if her father had been deliberately poisoned " it could be a political poisoning because there are no personal or business reasons why someone would want to do that " .
She told Reuters news agency her father was speaking , but looked pale and thin .
Mr Gaidar was treated in intensive care in Dublin after he collapsed , before being flown to Moscow .
The Irish government has said it had no reason to believe there was anything untoward about Mr Gaidar 's illness .
However , the police force said it was investigating Mr Gaidar 's movements during his trip .
" Enquiries to date have been conducted with hospital and medical staff and through the diplomatic corps , " a police statement said .
" Public health and safety is of paramount importance and there is nothing known which indicates that any member of the public is at risk . "
As acting prime minister , Mr Gaidar was responsible for introducing sweeping economic reforms following the collapse of the Soviet Union .
His programme of economic " shock therapy " under which price controls were lifted and large - scale privatisations were launched angered many Russians who saw their savings devalued .

In discussions about the impacts of Peak Oil , it is sometimes implicitly assumed that we NEED to replace the energy lost from the coming liquid fuels decline with other energy sources in order to maintain our way of life and our happiness .
Indeed , it seems that much of the current effort is focused on comparing / discovering the best energy alternatives with respect to EROI , environmental impact and scalability / timing .
In addition , demand experts also look at efficiency , carpooling , 4 day workweek , living locally type solutions , etc .
In this post , I look at Peak Oil from a broader context : the necessity and purpose of continued increases in demand for energy .
What is it all for , if not to make us happy ?
Peak
Oil is one of many symptoms of an ecologically full planet .
Our genetically embedded drive for `more ' coupled with an expanding world population of 6.5 billion mathematically suggests a finite limit for growth will eventually be reached , if it has n't been already .
Some ecologists are of the opinion that the world can sustainably house 1 - 2 billion humans - others believe we can hold upwards of 10 billion .
Any figure used here presupposes a certain energy consumption and planetary impact per human .
But the world currently has a broad variety of cultures , habits , and energy footprints .
Based on the sometimes fearful rhetoric of the Peak Oil community , it is presumed that less energy per capita is necessarily a bad thing .
In an initial exercise towards some longer term research , I looked at data of subjective well - being from a large multinational study done by www.worldvaluessurvey.org.
This study , done in 4 waves over the last 15 years , measured dozens of demographic indicator variables , one of which was subjective well - being .
Below is one of their better known graphs showing the relationship between GNP per capita and % of population in each country that is `satisfied ' or `happy ' with their lives .
It can be seen , that at low levels of GNP , happiness is lacking , but once a certain level of GNP is reached , incremental income per capita adds very little to subjective well being .
Ronald Inglehart of World Values Survey verbalized the above graph by stating that after meeting basic needs , lifestyle choices make up the majority of the difference in the GNP spectrum , and lower energy lifestyles do just about as well as high energy lifestyles ( indeed , there are at least 10 countries on that graph that score higher on life satisfaction than the USA , and they each produce less GNP ) .
In reading on this site , and in observations of life , it seems the concept in the above graph of diminishing returns once a set minimum has been reached , is ubiquitous in our culture .
When you buy your 5th car , does that make you anything close to as happy than when you bought your first ?
( does it really make you happy at all , or is it like opening the fridge at midnight ? ) .
Is the 10 million dollar in the bank 10 times better than the first ?
Do we buy the 50th pair of shoes because we need them , or we need the feeling we get from buying them ?
Since GNP and energy use are correlated , I was curious what the link would be between happiness and per capita energy use .
Using the `very happy ' percentage from the 1999/2000 wave of international tests from World Values Survey , I compared them to all countries that www.bp.com had primary energy data for ( primary energy is a broader measure than just oil ) and then divided by 2000 population census .
The results are in this graph :
As can be seen , there is little correlation at all between subjective well being and energy use .
( The actual r2 is 14 % ) .
Of note is the United States uses 39 times the primary energy as the Phillipines yet the percentage of the population that is `very happy ' is about equal .
While there is a low r2 , this does not mean there is not a relationship .
The graph shows that all high energy users are happy .
But it also shows you do n't need high energy to be happy .
It could therefore be read as saying that the high users are wasting considerable amounts of energy - ie not needed to be happy .
Vaclav Smil , in his book " Energy at the Crossroads " did similar work on objective measures of wellbeing vs energy consumption .
A pattern similar to the above `boomerang ' curve is found on comparisons of female longevity , sufficient nutritional food , educational opportunities , freedom etc .
The shape is also the same , but inverted , for infant mortality .
In general , Smil concludes that a reasonable level of well being on objective measures is achievable between 50 and 70 GJ / per capita , with marginal increases up to 100 GJ per capita .
As a comparison , North America is currently at 340 GJ per capita .
Again , the large excess consumption is not improving objective wellness .
As evolved animals at the top of the food chain , humans have become adept at acquiring resources , including energy .
At some point though , " more energy " apparently does not make us " more happy " .
Anecdotally , as a former stockbroker , I witnessed first hand that clients worth hundreds of millions were no happier than the entry level clerks , even though being fabulously wealthy represented the `carrot ' that people strived for .
Similarly , in travels abroad to Ecuador , Zambia , Thailand , etc , I consistently noticed extremely happy people with very low energy usages .
Everyone has wants and needs .
The wants can never really be satisfied , irrespective of energy use ( look at Donald Trump or Tom Cruise ) .
The needs are what are most important .
This is an encouraging point to be aware of in the years leading up to and following Peak Oil .
More is not necessarily better .
Less is not necessarily worse .
Perhaps , through education , marketing and living by example , society can slowly modify the definition of the `carrot ' , to one requiring less energy but providing equal or greater happiness .
In Part II I will look at : how subjective " subjective well being " is , how our happiness is based on meeting / acquiring certain neurotransmitter cocktails that met with evolutionary success , how happiness itself is probably a combination of contentment + novelty and the large energy consumption is on the novelty side of the equation .
In closing , a Thought Experiment :
Think of or write down the 10 things in life that you most enjoy or like to do .
Then , imagine you could only choose 3 from that list .
What type of things would those be ?
Compare the wide boundary energy / ecological expenditures of your favorite 3 versus the other 7 .
More or less ?
Note :
This is an update on the first post I wrote for theoildrum , archived here .
I 'll soon be building on these concepts with a Part II .
It should have been unmitigated good news yesterday when President Bush finally announced that he would back Senator John McCain 's proposal to ban torture and " cruel , inhuman or degrading " treatment at United States prison camps .
Nothing should be more obvious for an American president than to support a ban on torture .
But this is the president who scrapped the rules on the decent treatment of prisoners in the first place and whose lawyers concocted memos on legalizing torture .
On further reflection , the feeling of relief faded fast .
Mr. McCain 's amendment is attached to a malignant measure -- introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , and now co-sponsored by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee -- that would do grievous harm to the rule that the government cannot just lock you up without showing cause to a court .
This fundamental principle of democratic justice must not be watered down so the Bush administration does not have to answer for the illegal detentions of hundreds of men at Guantánamo Bay and other prison camps .
Mr. Graham 's original measure would at least have barred the use of coerced confessions from prisoners like those at Guantánamo .
But the current version actually appears to allow coerced evidence .
Lawmakers were also discussing language that would strip United States courts , including the Supreme Court , of the power to review detentions .
Bruce Ackerman , a professor of law at Yale University , said that Congress had not attacked the courts in this fashion since Reconstruction .
Investitionsfehler Wärmepumpe
Wärmepumpen sind eine beliebte Heizvariante in Deutschland – tatsächlich sind sie jedoch teuer und unökologisch .
Zudem machen die Pumpen abhängig vom lokalen Stromversorger .
Das will EnBW bei einem Neubaugebiet nahe Freiburg ausnutzen
VON BERNWARD JANZING
Die Energie - Baden - Württemberg ( EnBW ) hat eine neue Variante ersonnen , Stromkunden langfristig zu binden :
In March - Hugstetten bei Freiburg will das Unternehmen ein Neubaugebiet mit 151 Wohneinheiten mit elektrischen Wärmepumpen ausstatten – ein landesweites Pilotprojekt .
Bürgermeister Josef Hügele unterstützt die Aktion : Wer auf dem Areal „ Neumatten “ ein Grundstück erwirbt , soll die Elektrowärme als Baulast ins Grundbuch eingetragen bekommen .
Damit wäre die Wahl einer anderen Heizung blockiert .
Energieexperte Christian Meyer von der ortsansässigen Beratungsfirma EnergyConsulting kritisiert : „ Man macht sich auf alle Zeiten vom Strompreis abhängig . “
Zudem könnten die künftigen Bewohner ihren Stromversorger nicht wechseln ; Strom für den Wärmemarkt bietet in der Regel nur der örtliche Netzbetreiber an – in diesem Fall die EnBW .
Der Hugstettener Banker Jörg Schriever warnt , dass ein derartiger Grundbucheintrag den Wert der Immobilie mindert : „ Bei der Hausfinanzierung würde ich eine solche Baulast sehr kritisch sehen . “
Energieberater Meyer lehnt die Wärmepumpe auch generell ab : „ Sie ist ökonomisch wie ökologisch absurd . “
So lägen die Investitionskosten deutlich höher als bei anderen Heiztechniken .
Und da Wärmepumpen „ erfahrungsgemäß zu 85 Prozent tagsüber laufen “ , müsse man überwiegend Tagstrom bezahlen , den die EnBW für Heizzwecke derzeit für 14,51 Cent je Kilowattstunde anbietet .
Experten merken zudem an , dass eine Wärmepumpe mit halbwegs vernünftiger Effizienz nur Temperaturen bis 35 Grad erzeugen kann .
Für eine Fußbodenheizung würde das reichen .
Wird aber Brauchwasser auf 60 Grad erwärmt – was aus hygienischen Gründen nötig ist – , lässt sich der Strom nur sehr ineffizient einsetzen .
Wärme aus Öl oder Gas wäre dreimal billiger .
Die landeseigene Klimaschutz - und Energieagentur ( KEA ) in Karlsruhe kommt in einem eigens für das Baugebiet „ Neumatten “ erstellten Gutachten zum Ergebnis , dass „ die konventionelle dezentrale Wärmebereitstellung “ – also Öl - oder Gasheizungen – „ auch bei heutigen Energiepreisen noch deutlich kostengünstiger “ sei als die elektrische Wärmepumpe .
THE street price of cocaine varies hugely across the world .
No surprise that it is cheapest in Colombia , the world 's biggest producer of coca : at $ 2 , a gram costs less than a Big Mac .
Geography is an obvious price factor .
The farther away a country from the main producers in South and Central America , and the more isolated it is , the higher the cost to traffick there .
In far - flung New Zealand , a gram costs a wallet - busting $ 714.30 .
But there are some pricing anomalies .
Although the street price in Japan is several times higher than in Israel , Germany and Britain , the wholesale price in the countries is similar , around $ 46.40 .
In Canada the wholesale price is 50 % more than in America , but Canadians pay 40 % less on the street .
It could be that policing is more zealous in some countries , or that there is less competition among suppliers .

Google is to discard some of the information it stores about user search requests in an effort to address concerns by privacy watchdogs and defend itself against government demands for data .
The search giant will scrub personal information from cookies and remove some of the bits in IP addresses after that information has been stored for a set period of time , probably 18 to 24 months , a Google official wrote in a company blog .
It expects to roll out the new policy by the end of the year .
Until now , Google has kept information that can link specific searches to individual users indefinitely , potentially providing a trove of data to prosecutors or rogue employees with the proper credentials .
Google will continue to log and store user activity but will anonymize it after a period of time .
Google said the plan would be altered if laws governing the retention of data required it .
The change is sure to be welcomed by privacy advocates , who have been aghast at the permeability of the walls containing search data that can easily identify those who make the requests .
Last year , AOL touched off a firestorm when it published 19 m search queries made by more than 650,000 users .
AOL had taken steps to anonymize the data , but some searches contained intimate information that allowed readers to identify the requesters .
AOL had revealed the data as part of a research project .
Prior to that , the US Department of Justice , working on a case involving child pornography , issued subpoenas demanding several search engines surrender huge amounts of information related to searches .
While Yahoo ! , MSN and AOL largely caved , Google fought the demand , arguing it would violate user privacy .
( The search king , perhaps more transparently , also objected on the grounds that the disclosure would reveal proprietary algorithms . )
Google lost part of its bid , and now wisely believes a better tack to take is to discard some of the vast amounts of information it collects .
Google said its decision to continue hoarding identifying information for as long as two years was an attempt to strike harmony among conflicting goals of personalizing its services , safeguarding user privacy , and complying with data retention laws throughout the world . ®
Let 's say you had a drink or two but do n't feel you are under the influence of alcohol .
However , you are arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and offered the choice of taking a breath or blood test ( or , in some states , urine ) .
Most DUI suspects choose the breath test - a choice which could doom your chances to prove your innocence .
Consider the following advice when deciding which test to take :
1 . If you smoke cigarettes , you may want to pass on that Breathalyzer mouthpiece the officer is handing you .
Scientific research has shown that smoking can raise the test result considerably - enough to get you charged and convicted of drunk driving .
This is because most breath analyzing devices will falsely report acetaldehyde as alcohol .
Acetaldehyde is a compound produced in the liver in small amounts as a by - product in the metabolism of alcohol .
However , scientists have found acetaldehyde concentrations in the lungs of smokers are far greater than for non-smokers .
( " Origin of Breath Acetaldehyde During Ethanol Oxidation : Effect of Long - Term Cigarette Smoking " , 100 Journal of Laboratory Clinical Medicine 908 ) .
Translated : because breathalyzers can’t tell the difference between alcohol and acetaldehyde , cigarette smokers will have a higher blood - alcohol reading .
2 . If you are a diabetic with possible low blood sugar , you should also avoid the breath test .
A well - documented by - product of hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) is a state called ketoacidosis , which causes the production of acetone - and acetone , like acetaldehyde , will be reported by the Brethalyzer as alcohol .
In other words , the Breathalyzer will read significant levels of alcohol on a diabetic ’s breath where there may be little or none .
See " Diabetes , Breath Acetone and Breathalyzer Accuracy : A Case Study " , 9(1 ) Alcohol , Drugs and Driving ( 1993 ) .
To make matters worse , the reactions of a person in the early stages of a diabetic attack include dizziness , blurred vision , slurred speech , weakness , loss of coordination and confusion - the same symptoms which the patrol officer is looking for : the clear signs of a person under the influence of alcohol .
And the officer 's observations are quickly followed by a failing performance on DUI field sobriety tests .
3 . Are you on a low - carb diet ?
Or had nothing to eat in quite awhile ?
Avoid the Breathalyzer in a DUI investigation -- for the same reasons stated in number 2 .
Perfectly normal , healthy individuals can experience temporary conditions of low blood sugar after consuming small amounts of alcohol , resulting in exaggerated but false symptoms of intoxication .
Fasting glycemia can exist where a person has not eaten in 24 hours or has been on a low - carbohydrate diet .
Production of glucose in the liver is stopped while the alcohol is broken down .
Result : the blood sugar level will drop , affecting the central nervous system - and producing symptoms of a person under the influence of alcohol and a higher breath test result .
Click Here !
4 . If you have acid reflux or have burped or belched before taking the Breathalyzer , offer to provide a blood sample instead .
The reason is that you will be breathing alcohol from your stomach into your throat and oral cavity , where it will stay for 20 minutes or so - to be breathed directly into the breath machine .
This is not a good thing .
The machine 's computer is multiplying the amount of alcohol in the breath sample by 2100 times to provide a reading of the alcohol in the blood .
This is because it assumes the sample came from the lungs , not the stomach , and the average person has 2100 units of alcohol in his blood for every unit of alcohol in his breath ( called the partition ratio ) .
The Breathalyzer does not " know " that your breath sample is not from your lungs and that it should not multiply the alcohol level by anything .
Result : false high readings - and a DUI conviction .
5 . When you see that officer in the rear - view mirror , do n't reach for the mouthwash or breath spray to disguise the drink or two you 've had .
Most of them contain significant levels of alcohol ( Listerine , for example is 27 % alcohol ) and create a mouth alcohol effect : they remain in the oral cavity for 20 minutes or so - just long enough to be breathed into the Breathalyzer , with the same results mentioned in number 4 .
Some breath machines have a mouth alcohol detector , but these are highly unreliable .

[ Edu- sig ] Python & Smalltalk ( was Re : OLPC related : pyGTK )
ajsiegel at optonline .
net wrote : >

Sometimes I think something like that myself . :-)
But , to elaborate on your point a little more ( in a toned down way :-) : Smalltalk came out of an industrial research lab ( Xerox PARC ) .
The people who invented and then built it and refined it were paid industrial employees working in the scope of their duties on company time ( though very unusual ones , even by such R&D standards . :-)
Its subsequent history for decades involved mainly development by commercial organizations ( either as Smalltalk or also as the Macintosh OS which in some sense was a Smalltalk - derivative , but Steve Jobs just got the window system because he left too soon . :-) .
http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html
" One of the best parts of the [ 1979 ] demo was when Steve Jobs said he did n't like the blt - style scrolling we were using and asked if we cold do it in a smooth continuous style .
In less than a minute Dan found the methods involved , made the ( relatively major ) changes and scrolling was now continuous !
This shocked the visitors , espeicially the programmers among them , as they had never seen a really powerful incremental system before . "
And : http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/sj1.html
" Steve Jobs : ... That 's the real gem .
I 'll tell you an interesting story .
When I was at Apple , a few of my acquaintances said " You really need to go over to Xerox PARC ( which was Palo Alto Research Center ) and see what they 've got going over there . "
They did n't usually let too many people in but I was able to get in there and see what they were doing .
I saw their early computer called the Alto which was a phenomenal computer and they actually showed me three things there that they had working in 1976 .
I saw them in 1979 .
Things that took really until a few years ago for us to fully recreate , for the industry to fully recreate in this case with NeXTStep .
However , I did n't see all three of those things .
I only saw the first one which was so incredible to me that it saturated me .
It blinded me to see the other two .
It took me years to recreate them and rediscover them and incorporate them back into the model but they were very far ahead in their thinking .
They did n't have it totally right , but they had the germ of the idea of all three things .
And the three things were graphical user interfaces , object oriented computing and networking .
Let me go through those .
Graphical interface : The Alto had the world 's first graphical user interface .
It had windows .
It had a crude menu system .
It had crude panels and stuff .
It did n't work right but it basically was all there .
Objects :
They had Smalltalk running , which was really the first object - oriented language .
Simula was really the first but Smalltalk was the first official object oriented language .
Third , networking :
They invented Ethernet there , as you know .
And they had about two hundred Altos with servers hooked up in a local area network there doing e-mail and everything else over the network , all in 1979 .
I was so blown away with the potential of the germ of that graphical user interface that I saw that I did n't even assimilate or even stick around to investigate fully the other two . "
Essentially Xerox Parc in 1976 ( thirty years ago ! ) invented the computing landscape most of us use now , and Alan Kay was part of that .
What we have seen since is mainly just the dispersal and magnification of those ideas ( often in a warped or dumbed down fashion , e.g. C++ instead of Smalltalk ; XML instead of Lisp ) .
Smalltalk 's demise as a major player on the commercial scene in terms of VisualWorks and its predecessor ObjectWorks ( * the* leading Smalltalk product , and still the most comprehensive and definitive and most cross-platform -- excepting perhaps Squeak is more cross- platform in theory ) was mostly due to greed and mismanagement IMHO by a now defunct company ( the current VisualWorks owners bought it cheaply from them ) .
IBM 's VisualAge Smalltalk 's demise , on the other hand , was mostly due to IBM 's decision to back Java ( shortsighted and unfortunate I think as IBM had the clout to push Smalltalk syntax through to the masses IMHO ) .
Smalltalk is still actively used by many , but is more of a niche player at the moment ( like , say , OCaml or Haskell or Common Lisp ) , having been eclipsed by Java .
The support community for Smalltalk was ( at first ) mostly commercially oriented , and remains so to some degree .
While there were academic users , and in the past decade , especially with Squeak , the number of people using it for academic or free or open source type applications has grown , that has not been the bulk of the history .
Even Squeak 's most recent evolution was driven by work at Apple and then at Disney , with the Smalltalk principals reprising their roles as employees of large industrial research and development labs , with the licensing ambiguity that sometimes entails in navigating for - profit corporate waters in an emerging free - and - open - source way ( i.e. Alan Kay claims Disney is OK with the Squeak changes done there being released , but there is no " peace of mind " letter from Disney signing off on them I am aware of , or related licensing statement in the code ) .
Python on the other hand , was started as a hobby by one person who was based in an academic research lab .
It was always given freely .
Excepting one bobble with licensing issues ( which was corrected and involved a not - for - profit ) , the licensing situation has always been pretty straightforward from a free software perspective ( and is even now GPL compatible ) .
For most of Guido 's time with python ( except the last few years ) he was affiliated with one of two non-profits .
Even now his job is at a pro -" open source " corporation which is also releasing several other free and open source projects .
The community that grew around Python , while with many commercial users , had a very different emphasis to it .
Part of that early community spirit was also from the " Monty Python " humorous yet playfully radical themes ( although Guido has said by now he has heard enough Monty Python jokes . :-)
Python also has one core definitive free code base as a reference standard implementation ( even as there are spinoffs like Jython ) .
Personally , I feel Smalltalk is the better syntax for kids to learn as that purpose was what it was supposedly designed for ( if you ignore that most adult programmers come from Algol syntax and have trouble adapting to the syntax initially ) ;
Smalltalk keyword : syntax is certainly the easier syntax to use to maintain large bodies of code using powerful tools and is easily extendable by the end user programmer for many new uses including new control structures and iteration concepts ; Smalltalk historically also has the better development tools ( in part due to the syntax ) and also has a better library architecture ( e.g. Streams , Magnitude ) and better VMs and garbage collection ( especially in VisualWorks , and less so in Squeak ) , and also has benefited from a culture of Smalltalk all - the - way - down ( as Squeak exemplifies ) ;
Smalltalk has a powerful notion of bracketed nameless code blocks and is a tour de force of one paradigm ( objects and message passing ) .
However , Python has the better community ( from a free and open source perspective ) , better license and licensing history , and better breadth and modularity of libraries ;
Python also is more easily taken up by adult programmers who already know C or a similar Algol - style language because of its Algol - like syntax and also because you can use familiar text - oriented tools like emacs or vi or Scite with it ( which makes it easier for it to gain commercial acceptance as a new thing ) ;
Python code is clear and concise and maintainable because of the decision to use significant indentation instead of braces or brackets ( like Occam ) ;
Python also is a standard defined by a reference implementation , which is much better than a standard defined by an ambiguous or incomplete textual specification ;
Python is easier to do small projects in for people who only know a little of the language , so in that sense it has an easier learning curve as a system .
I feel , especially with Ruby 's increasing popularity [ as effectively a Smalltalk with Algol syntax plus some other bells and whistles ] , that the * themes * in Smalltalk are the future of most programming .
Even Python continues to get more Smalltalk - like , such as the " new classes " changes .
Yet , I want to write some programs now , as part of a free and secure ecosystem of such programs . :-)
Ironically , in my own case as a typical Smalltalk programmer , because of my own history as a Smalltalk developer working on commercial projects with commercial versions which nonetheless included source as most Smalltalks do , I am in some ways " contaminated " by that experience and the current overly broad reading of copyright and that puts into potential question anything I develop which is a Smalltalk - derivative ( unless I do it very , very carefully , say by using mostly GNU Smalltalk sources ) ; not to say I ever would use such commercial code , just that I might face the effectively impossible task of proving I had not if there was any coincidental similarity at all ( which is a much smaller problem when I am working with something very different like Python ) .
If I perhaps oversimplify , essentially the choice right now is between elegant syntax , uniform abstractions , and powerful tools , embodied in a system originally designed for kids by big corporate R&D ( Smalltalk ) versus practical syntax , uniform community history of freedom , and powerful economic forces , embodied in a system originally designed for adult programmers by an academic researcher as a hobby project which grew beyond initial expectations ( Python ) . :-)
Both languages along with their communities have different strengths and weaknesses , and also both have subcultures which are in opposition to the main ( e.g. mostly commercial Smalltalk has several free versions , mostly free Python has heavy proprietary commercial usage where no doubt such users have large interesting and yet proprietary libraries ) .
That the strengths and weaknesses are so different in different areas and that one must also assess where trends are heading when embarking on big projects is why I am in conflict about which to use ( especially for writing educational simulations ) , and that is why I tried to mix the best features of the two in the PataPata experiment -- though perhaps ended up with the worst features of the two in some ways ( Smalltalk 's . :-) .
Barring moving that PataPata project forward somehow , I am left with a situation that I either have to put a lot of work into a free Smalltalk ( Squeak , GNU , A Little Smalltalk , Bistro , Sharp Smalltalk , etc. ) to make it more to my liking ( e.g. mainstream widgets for Squeak , build tools for GST or Bistro , etc. ) or I have can use Python + GTK or wxWidgets or Jython +
Swing out of the box , and just accept greater maintenance issues down the road ( e.g. debugging and modifying a running program is so easy in Smalltalk , in Python it does n't quite work right , even with tools I have built to make it easier [ posted to the Jython list ] ) .
While I have n't made a big point of it , in the past , my choice of Python in the past has also been motivated by the " contamination " issue I mentioned above as well .
It may well be the deciding factor once again , sadly -- ironic to not be able to use and improve a wonderful thing you have experienced precisely because you have experienced it .(* ) :-( Happy Solstice .
-- Paul Fernhout (*)
Note : most people may not be as concerned about such a theoretical " contamination " issue as I am , since obviously this is a major problem for almost all Squeakers , and most likely for all the major developers on that project .
And , on a practical point , I can Agree with Alan Kay who maintains that most copyright issues are not settled by any sort of logic ( more by jury emotion in reaction to vague or inconsistent laws ) and so there is at least some justification for ignoring * potential * problems related to the edge of copyright .
Still , I feel better avoiding even the appearance of potential controversy of that sort ( I navigate too many oceans of controversy of other sorts , e.g. unschooling , transcending war through sustainable development , designing self - replicating space habitats , returning to a a gift economy , etc.. :-)
Historians vs. George W. Bush
Mr. McElvaine teaches history at Millsaps College .

Editor 's Note 12-5- 05 :
This article was first published 19 months ago .
It was referred to in an article by Richard Reeves on Dec. 2 , attracting wide notice .

Although his approval ratings have slipped somewhat in recent weeks , President George W. Bush still enjoys the overall support of nearly half of the American people .
He does not , however , fare nearly so well among professional historians .
A recent informal , unscientific survey of historians conducted at my suggestion by George Mason University ’s History News Network found that eight in ten historians responding rate the current presidency an overall failure .
Of 415 historians who expressed a view of President Bush ’s administration to this point as a success or failure , 338 classified it as a failure and 77 as a success .
( Moreover , it seems likely that at least eight of those who said it is a success were being sarcastic , since seven said Bush ’s presidency is only the best since Clinton ’s and one named Millard Fillmore . )
Twelve percent of all the historians who responded rate the current presidency the worst in all of American history , not too far behind the 19 percent who see it at this point as an overall success .
Among the cautions that must be raised about the survey is just what “ success ” means .
Some of the historians rightly pointed out that it would be hard to argue that the Bush presidency has not so far been a political success — or , for that matter that President Bush has not been remarkably successful in achieving his objectives in Congress .
But those meanings of success are by no means incompatible with the assessment that the Bush presidency is a disaster .
“ His presidency has been remarkably successful , ” one historian declared , “ in its pursuit of disastrous policies . ”
“ I think the Bush administration has been quite successful in achieving its political objectives , ” another commented , “ which makes it a disaster for us . ”
Additionally , it is , of course , as one respondent rightly noted , “ way too early to make a valid comparison ( we need another 50 years ) . ”
And such an informal survey is plainly not scientifically reliable .
Yet the results are so overwhelming and so different from the perceptions of the general public that an attempt to explain and assess their reactions merits our attention .
It may be , as one pro-Bush historian said in his or her written response to the poll , “ I suspect that this poll will tell us nothing about President Bush ’s performance vis-à - vis his peer group , but may confirm what we already know about the current crop of history professors . ”
The liberal - left proclivities of much of the academic world are well documented , and some observers will dismiss the findings as the mere rantings of a disaffected professoriate .
“ If historians were the only voters , ” another pro-Bush historian noted , “ Mr. Gore would have carried 50 states . ”
It is plain that many liberal academics have the same visceral reaction against the second President Bush that many conservatives did against his immediate predecessor .
Yet it seems clear that a similar survey taken during the presidency of Bush ’s father would not have yielded results nearly as condemnatory .
And , for all the distaste liberal historians had for Ronald Reagan , relatively few would have rated his administration as worse than that of Richard Nixon .
Yet today 57 percent of all the historians who participated in the survey ( and 70 percent of those who see the Bush presidency as a failure ) either name someone prior to Nixon or say that Bush ’s presidency is the worst ever , meaning that they rate it as worse than the two presidencies in the past half century that liberals have most loved to hate , those of Nixon and Reagan .
One who made the comparison with Nixon explicit wrote , “ Indeed , Bush puts Nixon into a more favorable light .
He has trashed the image and reputation of the United States throughout the world ; he has offended many of our previously close allies ; he has burdened future generations with incredible debt ; he has created an unnecessary war to further his domestic political objectives ; he has suborned the civil rights of our citizens ; he has destroyed previous environmental efforts by government in favor of his coterie of exploiters ; he has surrounded himself with a cabal ideological adventurers . . . . ”
Why should the views of historians on the current president matter ?
I do not share the view of another respondent that “ until we have gained access to the archival record of this president , we [ historians ] are no better at evaluating it than any other voter . ”
Academic historians , no matter their ideological bias , have some expertise in assessing what makes for a successful or unsuccessful presidency ; we have a long - term perspective in which to view the actions of a current chief executive .
Accordingly , the depth of the negative assessment that so many historians make of George W. Bush is something of which the public should be aware .
Their comments make clear that such historians would readily agree with conclusion that then - Democratic presidential hopeful Richard Gephardt pronounced a few months ago : the presidency of George W. Bush is “ a miserable failure . ”
The past presidencies most commonly linked with the current administration include all of those that are usually rated as the worst in the nation ’s history : Nixon , Harding , Hoover , Buchanan , Coolidge , Andrew Johnson , Grant , and McKinley .
The only president who appeared prominently on both the favorable and unfavorable lists was Ronald Reagan .
Forty - seven historians said Bush is the best president since Reagan , while 38 said he is the worst since Reagan .
Almost all of the historians who rate the Bush presidency a success are Reagan admirers .
Indeed , no other president ( leaving aside the presumably mostly tongue - in - cheek mentions of Clinton ) was named by more than four of the historians who took a favorable view of the current presidency .
Ronald Reagan clearly has become the sort of polarizing figure that Franklin Roosevelt was for an earlier generation — or , perhaps a better way to understand the phenomenon is that Reagan has become the personification of the pole opposite to Roosevelt .
That polarization is evident in historians ’ evaluations of George W. Bush ’s presidency .
“ If one believes Bush is a ‘ good ’ president ( or great ) , ” one poll respondent noted , he or she “ would necessarily also believe Reagan to be a pretty good president . ”
They also tend to despise Roosevelt .
“ There is no indication , ” one historian said of Bush , “ that he has advisors who are closet communist traitors as FDR had .
Based on his record to date , history is likely to judge him as one of America ’s greatest presidents , in the tradition of Washington and Lincoln . ”
The thought that anyone could rate the incumbent president with Washington and Lincoln is enough to induce apoplexy in a substantial majority of historians .
Among the many offenses they enumerate in their indictment of Bush is that he is , as one of them put it , “ well on his way to destroying the entire ( and entirely successful ) structures of international cooperation and regulated , humane capitalism and social welfare that have been built up since the early 1930s . ”
“ Bush is now in a position , ” Another historian said , “ to ‘ roll back the New Deal , ’ guided by Tom DeLay . ”
Several charges against the Bush administration arose repeatedly in the comments of historians who responded to the survey .
Among them were : the doctrine of pre-emptive war , crony capitalism / being “ completely in bed with certain corporate interests , ” bankruptcy / fiscal irresponsibility , military adventurism , trampling of civil liberties , and anti-environmental policies .
***
The reasons stated by some of the historians for their choice of the presidency that they believe Bush ’s to be the worst since are worth repeating .
The following are representative examples for each of the presidents named most frequently : REAGAN : “ I think the presidency of George W. Bush has been generally a failure and I consider his presidency so far to have been the most disastrous since that of Ronald Reagan -- because of the unconscionable military aggression and spending ( especially the Iraq War ) , the damage done to the welfare of the poor while the corporate rich get richer , and the backwards religious fundamentalism permeating this administration .
I strongly disliked and distrusted Reagan and think that George W. is even worse . ”
NIXON : “ Actually , I think [ Bush ’s ] presidency may exceed the disaster that was Nixon .
He has systematically lied to the American public about almost every policy that his administration promotes . ”
Bush uses “ doublespeak ” to “ dress up policies that condone or aid attacks by polluters and exploiters of the environment . . . with names like the ‘ Forest Restoration Act ’ ( which encourages the cutting down of forests ) . ”
HOOVER : “ I would say GW is our worst president since Herbert Hoover .
He is moving to bankrupt the federal government on the eve of the retirement of the baby boom generation , and he has brought America ’s reputation in the world to its lowest point in the entire history of the United States . ”
COOLIDGE : “ I think his presidency has been an unmitigated disaster for the environment , for international relations , for health care , and for working Americans .
He ’s on a par with Coolidge ! ” HARDING : “ Oil , money and politics again combine in ways not flattering to the integrity of the office .
Both men also have a tendency to mangle the English language yet get their points across to ordinary Americans .
[ Yet ] the comparison does Harding something of a disservice . ”
McKINLEY : “ Bush is perhaps the first president [ since McKinley ] to be entirely in the ‘ hip pocket ’ of big business , engage in major external conquest for reasons other than national security , AND be the puppet of his political handler .
McKinley had Mark Hanna ; Bush has Karl Rove .
No wonder McKinley is Rove ’s favorite historical president ( precedent ? ) . ”
GRANT : “ He ranks with U.S. Grant as the worst .
His oil interests and Cheney ’s corporate Haliburton contracts smack of the same corruption found under Grant . ”
“ While Grant did serve in the army ( more than once ) , Bush went AWOL from the National Guard .
That means that Grant is automatically more honest than Bush , since Grant did not send people into places that he himself consciously avoided .
. . .
Grant did not attempt to invade another country without a declaration of war ; Bush thinks that his powers in this respect are unlimited . ”
ANDREW JOHNSON : “ I consider his presidency so far to have been the most disastrous since that of Andrew Johnson .
It has been a sellout of fundamental democratic ( and Republican ) principles .
There are many examples , but the most recent would be his successful efforts to insert provisions in spending bills which directly controvert measures voted down by both houses of Congress . ”
BUCHANAN : “ Buchanan can be said to have made the Civil War inevitable or to have made the war last longer by his pusillanimity or , possibly , treason . ”
“ Buchanan allowed a war to evolve , but that war addressed a real set of national issues .
Mr. Bush started a war . . . for what reason ? ”
*** EVER : The second most common response from historians , trailing only Nixon , was that the current presidency is the worst in American history .
A few examples will serve to provide the flavor of such condemnations .
“ Although previous presidents have led the nation into ill - advised wars , no predecessor managed to turn America into an unprovoked aggressor .
No predecessor so thoroughly managed to confirm the impressions of those who already hated America .
No predecessor so effectively convinced such a wide range of world opinion that America is an imperialist threat to world peace .
I don 't think that you can do much worse than that . ”
“ Bush is horrendous ; there is no comparison with previous presidents , most of whom have been bad . ”
“ He is blatantly a puppet for corporate interests , who care only about their own greed and have no sense of civic responsibility or community service .
He lies , constantly and often , seemingly without control , and he lied about his invasion into a sovereign country , again for corporate interests ; many people have died and been maimed , and that has been lied about too .
He grandstands and mugs in a shameful manner , befitting a snake oil salesman , not a statesman .
He does not think , process , or speak well , and is emotionally immature due to , among other things , his lack of recovery from substance abuse .
The term is " dry drunk " .
He is an abject embarrassment / pariah overseas ; the rest of the world hates him . . . . .
He is , by far , the most irresponsible , unethical , inexcusable occupant of our formerly highest office in the land that there has ever been . ”
“ George W. Bush 's presidency is the pernicious enemy of American freedom , compassion , and community ; of world peace ; and of life itself as it has evolved for millennia on large sections of the planet .
The worst president ever ?
Let history judge him . ”
“ This president is unique in his failures . ”
And then there was this split ballot , comparing the George W. Bush presidencies failures in distinct areas .
The George W. Bush presidency is the worst since : “ In terms of economic damage , Reagan .
In terms of imperialism , T Roosevelt .
In terms of dishonesty in government , Nixon .
In terms of affable incompetence , Harding .
In terms of corruption , Grant .
In terms of general lassitude and cluelessness , Coolidge .
In terms of personal dishonesty , Clinton .
In terms of religious arrogance , Wilson . ” ***
My own answer to the question was based on astonishment that so many people still support a president who has : Presided over the loss of approximately three million American jobs in his first two - and - a - half years in office , the worst record since Herbert Hoover .
Overseen an economy in which the stock market suffered its worst decline in the first two years of any administration since Hoover’s .
Taken , in the wake of the terrorist attacks two years ago , the greatest worldwide outpouring of goodwill the United States has enjoyed at least since World War II and squandered it by insisting on pursuing a foolish go - it - almost - alone invasion of Iraq , thereby transforming almost universal support for the United States into worldwide condemnation .
( One historian made this point particularly well : “ After inadvertently gaining the sympathies of the world 's citizens when terrorists attacked New York and Washington , Bush has deliberately turned the country into the most hated in the world by a policy of breaking all major international agreements , declaring it our right to invade any country that we wish , proving that he ’ll manipulate facts to justify anything he wishes to do , and bull - headedly charging into a quagmire . ” )
Misled ( to use the most charitable word and interpretation ) the American public about weapons of mass destruction and supposed ties to Al Qaeda in Iraq and so into a war that has plainly ( and entirely predictably ) made us less secure , caused a boom in the recruitment of terrorists , is killing American military personnel needlessly , and is threatening to suck up all our available military forces and be a bottomless pit for the money of American taxpayers for years to come .
Failed to follow through in Afghanistan , where the Taliban and Al Qaeda are regrouping , once more increasing the threat to our people .
Insulted and ridiculed other nations and international organizations and now has to go , hat in hand , to those nations and organizations begging for their assistance .
Completely miscalculated or failed to plan for the personnel and monetary needs in Iraq after the war , so that he sought and obtained an $ 87 billion appropriation for Iraq , a sizable chunk of which is going , without competitive bidding to Haliburton , the company formerly headed by his vice president .
Inherited an annual federal budget surplus of $ 230 billion and transformed it into a $ 500 + billion deficit in less than three years .
This negative turnaround of three - quarters of a trillion dollars is totally without precedent in our history .
The ballooning deficit for fiscal 2004 is rapidly approaching twice the dollar size of the previous record deficit , $ 290 billion , set in 1992 , the last year of the administration of President Bush ’s father and , at almost 5 percent of GDP , is closing in on the percentage record set by Ronald Reagan in 1986 .
Cut taxes three times , sharply reducing the burden on the rich , reclassified money obtained through stock ownership as more deserving than money earned through work .
The idea that dividend income should not be taxed — what might accurately be termed the unearned income tax credit — can be stated succinctly : “ If you had to work for your money , we ’ll tax it ; if you did n’t have to work for it , you can keep it all . ”
Severely curtailed the very American freedoms that our military people are supposed to be fighting to defend .
( “ The Patriot Act , ” one of the historians noted , “ is the worst since the Alien and Sedition Acts under John Adams . ” )
Called upon American armed service people , including Reserve forces , to sacrifice for ever - lengthening tours of duty in a hostile and dangerous environment while he rewards the rich at home with lower taxes and legislative giveaways and gives lucrative no -bid contracts to American corporations linked with the administration .
Given an opportunity to begin to change the consumption - oriented values of the nation after September 11 , 2001 , when people were prepared to make a sacrifice for the common good , called instead of Americans to ‘ sacrifice ’ by going out and buying things .
Proclaimed himself to be a conservative while maintaining that big government should be able to run roughshod over the Bill of Rights , and that the government must have all sorts of secrets from the people , but the people can be allowed no privacy from the government .
( As one of the historians said , “ this is not a conservative administration ; it is a reckless and arrogant one , beholden to a mix of right - wing ideologues , neo- con fanatics , and social Darwinian elitists . ” )
My assessment is that George W. Bush ’s record on running up debt to burden our children is the worst since Ronald Reagan ; his record on government surveillance of citizens is the worst since Richard Nixon ; his record on foreign - military policy has gotten us into the worst foreign mess we ’ve been in since Lyndon Johnson sank us into Vietnam ; his economic record is the worst since Herbert Hoover ; his record of tax favoritism for the rich is the worst since Calvin Coolidge ; his record of trampling on civil liberties is the worst since Woodrow Wilson .
How far back in our history would we need to go to find a presidency as disastrous for this country as that of George W. Bush has been thus far ?
My own vote went to the administration of James Buchanan , who warmed the president ’s chair while the union disintegrated in 1860 - 61 .
Who has been the biggest beneficiary of the horrible terrorism that struck our nation in September of 2001 ?
The answer to that question should be obvious to anyone who considers where the popularity ratings and reelection prospects of a president with the record outlined above would be had he not been able to wrap himself in the flag , take advantage of the American people ’s patriotism , and make himself synonymous with “ the United States of America ” for the past two years .
That abuse of the patriotism and trust of the American people is even worse than everything else this president has done and that fact alone might be sufficient to explain the depth of the hostility with which so many historians view George W. Bush .
Contrary to the conservative stereotype of academics as anti-American , the reasons that many historians cited for seeing the Bush presidency as a disaster revolve around their perception that he is undermining traditional American practices and values .
As one patriotic historian put it , “ I think his presidency has been the worst disaster to hit the United States and is bringing our beloved country to financial , economic , and social disaster . ”
Some voters may judge such assessments to be wrong , but they are assessments informed by historical knowledge and the electorate ought to have them available to take into consideration during this election year .

I , for one , am glad that the scholarly historians quoted in this article do n't run our country !
This article clearly illustrates how our own personal ideology colors our perception and our documentation of people and events .
As historians , would n't you agree that your purpose is to record facts - all the facts ?
Record the facts without your personal bias ?
The beauty of this country is that every four years we get to choose a side to have a turn at running our government .
I can't see how either side has been overwhelmingly successful during their four years .
It seems to me that we view most of what occurs in big government very simplistically .
George W. Bush did n't start the decline of how our allies and adversaries view us .
That started the first time we told someone " no " or " stop that " or we felt compelled to act as police in some conflict .
Our economic woes with the burst of the technology bubble - and before that any other bubble - was n't caused by George W. Bush .
Jimmy Carter did n't cause the high gas prices of the '70s .
We are all so quick to blame and yet so slow to accept responsibility .
At least , right or wrong , George W. Bush did n't make his decisions based on the results of the latest poll .
I 'd rather have a leader who makes decisions based on what he feels is right within the confines of the Constitution of The United States , and , no on the latest whim of the last group of people to answer questions .
I am certain there may be grammatical errors in my post .
I am not an English professor .
I do believe all my words are spelled correctly and I do believe you can read and interpret correctly my sentences with the grammar used .
Bill Hutto - 7/13/2008
Undermining basic values , not sure about that , but Bush has ruined the country , unless you want to ignore the deaths of over 4000 of our men and women --------- and for what ??????
Why are we not going after the real culprit of 9/11 ?
Old Sarg - 4/16/2008
None of this matters .
No one will be impeached , no laws were broken and no government friends or insiders became rich off our nations actions in this war against terror .
Your type are simply dogs .
Hiding behind your walls biting at the heels of men as we walk by .
You can whine and live in the past and dram of the demise of this nation but this nation is stronger than what you may think .
Sit in your little office and chase your little dreams of Neocons and government badmen hiding in the shadows .
You are a nobody in this life .
Ha !
Old Sarg - 4/16/2008
Such a good judge of others .
Too bad you come across as a shrill whiner .
Old Sarg - 4/15/2008
Sorry guys .
This article simply make you all look like you are a joke .
This is really sad .
John Williams - 4/12/2008 should stick to his penchant for regurgitating liberal talking points and leave the real history to historians .
Has Bush made mistakes ?
No doubt .
But the talking points memo Mr. McIlvane includes in his " analysis " is more indicative of a political operative than an objective observer .
Eric Foner - 2/18/2008
This is such a specious argument .
Most spying on the citizens since Nixon ??
Last I read was LBJ , Bobby Kennedy , et.al .
spying on all sorts of rabble rousers ; but Nixon ?
You all seem to forget when talking about the deficit that the House of Representatives has the power of the purse according to the US Constitution .
All but one of Reagan 's budgets was considered ' dead on arrival ' after being presented to the Congress .
Reagan wanted to slow the growth of social spending while increasing defense .
Increased tax revenues from a country coming out of recession would offset any disparities .
Alas , the Democrats would n't have any of that .
Bush , with Republicans in control of both houses , has been a disaster on the budget , it 's true ; two wars , totally ill - advised prescription drug plan , etc .
But it seems that federal deficits are always laid at the feet of the president in power .
A majority of the federal budget is FIXED by law and cannot be reduced .
Pork barrel spending by congress barely gets passing mention .
In the final analysis , Bush 's war against Islamofacism will seem prescient .
His ratings will surely go up , just like Reagan 's did , and more importantly , just like Nixon 's did ; to the point that when Nixon died in 1994 , he was revered as a statesman , and Watergate was a minor footnote .
Stop trying to rank sitting presidents !!!
maggie e. winslett - 12/31/2007
You are so very correct in your commits .
Not only is he burring the history he is preparing to rewrite it for the future at his soon to be constructed presidential library on the campus of S.M.U .
The library is to include his years as president but it is to include a special section on the George Bush philosophy on how government needs to be conducted .
Apparently , King George believes he is such a stellar example of how the government should be conducted that he wants to lay out the master plan for the future !
Maybe we need a topic titled master ego v.s. government by the people .
maggie e. winslett - 12/31/2007
I wonder , after this most tragic year regarding " King George " if you still feel the same way .
I personally still think the topic was of great use in making many people consider who they will vote for this time around .
We need desperately to think hard about the candidates .
We need to look at their HISTORY of living candate during their time on planet earth .
Just how informed are they on foreign and domestic policy .
... instead of what their LAST NAME might be .
That will only be of interest if we are trying to trace their family history .
We do not need presidents elected by LAST NAME ( as in a KING George )
We need presidents elected by significant life style , devotion to political history , not raising hell with drugs and Jack Denials in Texas .
History needs to consider in the candidate ’s background .
We simple do not have any “ History ” to consider about a living human other than the years they have spent on earth .
They are Not dead YET sir !
Thank the Lord ; I was in classes that understood the meaning of history applied to my currant life …
Thank you to ALL of my past professors !
They left me with a curiosity of checking the private and public backgrounds of the individuals I vote for .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Treason is a " high crime " by any normal definition , however one might choose to classify lying under oath about oral sex .
So why are n't the traitors in Washington impeached already ?
Mr. Fallai's hypothesis to explain recent American political history - which might be summarized as " Republicans are ignorant hypocrites " - is incomplete without a discussion of the associated corollary : Democrats are spineless wafflers .
And it is a bit of a stretch to impeach members of the Republican Administration for actions consistent with or at least predictable under policies which many congressional Democrats ratified .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Hold your offense , please , Mr. Galle .
I was being perhaps inappropriately ironic , but if you read what I actually said the reference was to the " new improved " guards , who I assume are now helping to fix the problem which Rumsfeld and his policies created at Abu Ghraib .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 To Chris Pettit :
I do n't think we are in fundamental disagreement but there are perhaps important differences in emphasis .
I would agree that America ’s national political system is fundamentally flawed .
I think John McCain , a leader of campaign finance reform , is one of a small minority of politicians genuinely trying to address the problem ( to little avail , so far , I freely admit ) .
I find your remarks " out of date " in that they do not seem to reflect the sea- change that has occurred under the new Cheney - Rumsfeld regime .
In that sense , at least , you remind me of Nader .
If you do n't see that the current presidential administration is drastically worse than the norm in America , I have a whole lot of more recent books to recommend to you .
A good one to start with would be John Dean 's " Worse than Watergate " .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 Mr. CP ,
I could not agree more re the " undereducated ignorance " of most Americans concerning world affairs .
Having also lived abroad for some years , I can assure you that non-Americans are also not as well educated or informed as they ought to be as members of the global community ( although the Americans ' knowledge generally ranks near the bottom of industrialized countries in basic areas such as science and geography ) .
There is nothing at all " elitist " about wanting people in democratic countries to be more informed and aware of the world around them .
America is already going to pay a high price for allowing the Bush approach of " ignorance by design " to go relatively unchecked for so long , and , furthermore , leaders worse than Bush are quite imaginable ( e.g. " co-president "
Cheney whose corporate crimes pale beside what might happen if he had sole control of the levers of power ) .
Al Qaeda or some such group is bound to strike the U.S. again some day in some fashion , and the rest of us are n't nearly as well prepared as we should be for both that scenario and the likely attempts to capitalize thereon by the " Dr. Strangeloves " most of whom are not as inexperienced and blunder - prone as Bush , as feeble - minded as Ashcroft or as transparently predictable as Wolfowitz .
Having rejected most of the recent " exposé " books on the Bush Administration 's foreign policy , because they lack proper documentation ( there are already more than enough unsubstantiated rants available ; here on HNN for example ) , I have found the following of some use ( all published during the historically critical years 2002 - 03 ) :
Prestowitz , " Rogue Nation "
Newhouse , " Imperial America "
Telhami , " The Stakes "
Zakaria , " Future of Freedom "
PKC
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007 Yes , but G. W. Bush never was " one of their own " , and his Cs in college History are proving to be fairly valid predictors of his apathy , sloppiness and mediocre performance as President .
Would that his " eagerness " on Iraq had been truly based on a desire to " finish " what was " left undone in 1991 " and not just on an arrogant assumption that shortsightedness ( which won America the war in 1991 and then lost it the peace ) would somehow " work " in 2002 -03 ( e.g. at the ballot box in 2004 ; as Bush made clear to Woodward , he does n't care much about what kind of world he leaves behind him ) if only it were accompanied this time by more unilateral bluster , more stubborn refusal to listen to outside advice , more unwillingness to admit mistakes or change course , and better soundbite management .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
This wide - ranging analysis is interesting but largely descriptive rather than analytical .
In particular , this is an instance where ( as another HNN article this week puts it ) the “ intersection ” of the “ personal ” and the “ historical ” is critical to understanding what is going on .
Unlike many politicians whose publicly stated goals are more dramatic than their actions , Bush 's tongue - twisted " affability " pales compared to his radical and unAmerican actions .
Career diplomats and career military officers of all political persuasions are upset at his Administration ’s deep disregard for their long - established knowledge and experience .
Accomplished business leaders are uneasy with the President 's cavalier attitude towards fiscal prudence and his hypocritical weakening of free trade policies .
Scientists are outraged at his deliberate attempts to slash science funding and warp future research towards pre-formed poll - driven unscientific conclusions .
Historians are also not immune from personal outrage at unprecedented and unwarranted governmental attacks on their profession :
In November of 2001 , George W. Bush " issued an executive order ... virtually gutting the 1978 Presidential Records Act ....
In essence Bush was repealing an act of Congress and imposing a new law by executive fiat ... [ As a result ] ... presidential scholarship as it now exists will largely end .
As the Association of American Libraries has noted , many of the best - known works about the American presidency would not have been possible had Bush ’s order been in effect ... Bush and Cheney assumed office planning to take total and absolute control of executive branch information .
They will decide what the public should know and when , if ever . ”

Clearly , professor McElvaine is not writing here to try to convince diehard Bushies of the error of their ways , let alone offer himself as a target for a fusillade of formulaic , tangential and inquisitional - style questions .
Somewhere though , there are hardened criminals who need to be interrogated by someone of Todd Galle 's vigor .
Mr. Galle , Uncle Sam wants you ... to join the new , improved intelligence staff at Abu Ghraib .
You may wish to act quickly , before it is razed to the ground and the " bad apples " covering up their knowledge and instigation of its former techniques are imprisoned themselves .
Peter K. Clarke - 10/9/2007
Nicely done , Chris Pettit , but perhaps a tad out of date .
And , can you take on " ignorance by design " ( John Dean 's characterization of our current chief pretzel - conquerer ) as well as just garden variety ignorance ?
I also wonder whether you have thought much about path - dependency , lesser evils , lost opportunities and counterfactuals , for example : John McCain winning South Carolina , or voting against the Iraq war resolution .
For some reason reading your piece reminds me of the KPD in the Reichstag of 1933 .
Maybe that is unfair , but really now , do n't you think Ralph Nader would make a great senator ?
As long as we are pursuing fantasy ideals here , make that a senator from Texas , please .
Jim Balter - 12/20/2006
Funny how thoroughly that " smug confidence " has been borne out .
As I said long ago , it was no more " smug " than is our expectation that the sun will rise tomorrow ; it was simply a rational inference from available evidence .
Thomas Michael Cannon - 9/24/2006
I have been saying that Bushie is the worst President we have ever had since the middle of 2002 .
So to see that a majority of today 's historians are already saying that his Presidency is the worst is no surprize to me .
All of his actions since this article was printed have only confirmed my views more .
joesph p glass - 4/19/2006 this kind of article , which starts with a lie- his approval rating is in the 30's .
Dear sir , your math is waaay off by assuming most Americans support the lies and propaganda thrown at us .
Realize their are still people out here reading that do n't just buy a lie blindly , they research .
something you should have done .

Elections came to Palestine , and they elected Hamas .
Iraqis were liberated from Saddam , and delivered to local militias -- if they did n't end up in Abu Grahib .
Our Alaskan fishing ports have plenty of anti-terrorism measures in place to protect against unexpected bad guys lurking there , but expected levee breaches are allowed to occur , because the cronies placed in FEMA were too busy primping .
One could just as easily come up with figures on how Hitler achieved low unemployment , and how he saved Germany from all those evil internationalists that came into vogue after the Great War .
He even kept Germany safe from Communism , well , at least until the Soviets launched a counteroffensive .
He was popularly elected and enjoyed high poll numbers , even when the bombs rained down in retaliation of Germany 's aggression policies .
After all , this aggression was n’t unilateral -- they counted Mussolini and Stalin among the coalition of the willing .
And really , poll numbers outside Germany did n't count , because only Germany knew what was good for pure Germans .
But few are claiming that Hitler was good for Germany overall .
Conversely , one could elaborate Lincoln indiscretions : that he led America into a preventable ruinous war and suspended constitutionally protected rights .
Indeed the rich could buy their way out of the war without pretense .
But few argue that Lincoln was bad for America .
Lincoln ’s war kept America united , and settled the slavery question once and for all .
It justified , even in the minds of the participants , the sacrifices made .
It showed the world that when America said " individual liberties for all men " they really meant it , and made America that enduring symbol to the world -- until now .
Few WW2 era Germans knew what the point of their war was , even if the early victories did make them feel good about themselves after the humiliation of the Versailles Treaty .
" Deutsches Lebensraum " is hardly an Ideal that will serve as a beacon to the world , not like " individual liberties for all " which is how Lincoln eventually cast his generation 's conflict , and that is why he is considered routinely among the world great leaders .
This is the point of historical perspective -- evaluating the policies of leaders in context , and how they cast the struggles of their age .
For every generation fights , and every generation relies on their leaders to define just what they are fighting for .

Could you provide a link informing us where this brain dead republican candidate is located ?
Daniel Sauerwein - 2/8/2006
Let 's not forget that many polls have come out showing that a vast majority of academics hate Bush and are Democrats .
So , it can therefore be argued that if another Republican were in office , the same results would occur .
Lawrence Brooks Hughes - 2/7/2006 than what do historians think of George W. Bush , is the question of what happened to pervert the entire profession into an army of leftist dummies ?
I can find no " diversity " of opinion whatever on this board , which speaks badly for its posters and quite well for the president .
I notice national unemployment just fell to a new low of 4.7 % ...
Fifty million Iraqis and Afghans have been liberated .
Elections have come to Lebanon and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Palestine , as well as Iraq , etc. , etc .
The kleptocracy at Turtle Bay has been outed .
The Bush program at home and abroad has been a stunning success , in fact , which is why he was reelected by 3.6 million votes .
The Republican - 1/19/2006 where the hell are you getting your information you goddamned red neck !
how can you say that half of the american people like what he has done .
I guess what you 're saying is that we like to not have jobs and we like education cuts and so on ..... you 're a dick !
just like bush .
I 'll beat the crap out of you for thinking like that !
ass hole !
Lorraine Paul - 12/19/2005
I have n't found one person here who is prepared to state that there is only one country in the world that has been found guilty of terrorism in a world court .
That country is the United States of America .
Whether you agree or disagree with that verdict is irrelevant .
Further , I fail to see how after dropping a bomb which was known to , at the least , have blown both the arms from a child , the US and its allies could continue their ' shock and awe ' exercise !
Many joining in on this discussion argue as though all this is merely an intellectual exercise and the most eloquent and erudite must inevitably be proven to be in the right .
We are talking about children , mothers , old people dying .
All because they live in the ' wrong ' country .
Where is the passion and anger against these crimes ?
Or is anger and compassion only reserved for the deaths of those who died on US soil .
As historians some of you make very good neo-cons .
Lorraine Paul - 12/19/2005
I hate to tell you this but we have compulsory voting in Australia .
Therefore , a vast majority front - up on election day .
To my disgust Bush 's glove - puppet , aka Australian Prime Minister John Howard , was narrowly re-elected last year .
However , when the institutions people trust let them down it is n't fair to call those same people ' idiots ' .
Instead heap shame upon those who betrayed that trust !
I do n't blame the American people for voting for Bush - twice .
I blame the public opinion manipulators and the vast machinery they control and employ .
It is hard enough to keep one 's equilibrium here where flag - waving and jingoism is often greeted with suspicion and embarrassment .
It must be so much harder living in a country where programmes like " Jessica Simpson and ( insert husband 's name ) 's Tour of Duty " , are applauded and admired .
It sometimes seems as though Americans have been waving that flag so often and for so long that the waving has become more important than the flag itself .
Three years ago most of my friends in the US turned against me when I asked them to look for less simplistic reasons for ' why they hate us ' than those put forward by Bush .
It would be interesting to ask them how they feel today about his presidency .

" What I 've really learned from this article is not that historians think Bush is a failure ( I already suspected that ) , but that many , if not most , American citizens think Bush is an okay president .
The conclusion : the anti-Bush historians have failed to " enlighten " the public . "
You fail to realize that the majority of the public are total idiots .
In order to complete an election , a MAJORITY of Americans need to vote .
So if the majority of Americans vote for a total idiot , the majority of Americans ARE the total idiots .
See the logic ?
Real DCC - 11/22/2005
I wonder what the Bush backers are writing now .
It is probably something along the lines of charging the historians in this survey as aiding alQaeda .
Or , perhaps they hope this article is no longer available , for it seems the general population has caught up with the historians .
Jim Balter - 11/7/2005 If IN FACT
Bush is the worst President in history , then we would expect OBJECTIVE historians to vote against him ; those who voted for him would have done so for reasons other than an objective evaluation .
Therefore , any balancing or taking people 's votes into account would skew the results in Bush 's favor .
In order to establish an objective set of voters , we would have to evaluate them on some INDEPENDENT basis , not correlated with the issue they are voting on .
Jim Balter - 11/7/2005
" I 'd like to see the average rating from historians who voted for Bush versus those who did n't .
And please do n't use the excuse that it 's irrelevant .
If it is , then there would n't be any harm in revealing this , would there ? "
So please post your medical history here .
If it 's irrelevant , there would n't be any harm in revealing this , would there ?
" So humor me . "
And how , prey tell , is that to be done ?
Jim Balter - 11/7/2005 " - Bush has reduced the tax burden on the rich
This is objectively false . "
If this were true , then Bush would have failed on his own terms .
It 's interesting when Republicans insist that they have n't done what they want to do .
Jim Balter - 11/7/2005 Indeed .
To be consistent , Mr. Lindgren would have to insist that a panel evaluating Hitler would have to be balanced in their opinions of Nazism .
And a panel evaluating Darwin would have to be balanced in their opinions about whether evolution has occurred .
This is a notion of " objectivity " that negates the role of fact and evidence on the views of objective observers .
Jim Balter - 11/7/2005
What if George Bush turns out to be the second coming of Jesus Christ ?
Mature professionals like Mr. Rivers recognize such possibilities .
Jim Balter - 11/7/2005 Mr. Sherlock comes along and says " Enough . "
My immediate thought is : " What a jackass . "
Eric Zuesse - 10/24/2005
An important fallacy in James Lindgren 's comment is :
He assumes that a historian 's " objectivity " would cause there to be no correlation bewtween the way the given historian votes and this historian 's ratings of U.S. Presidents .
Lindgren assumes that if the historian is " objective , " then that historian would have no greater tendency to score Bush highly if he voted for Bush than if he did not , and that the historian would have no greater tendency to score Bush poorly if he voted against Bush than if he did not .
In other words , Mr. Lindgren assumes that an " objective " historian wo n't , at all - - not even just slightly - - tend to vote for or against a given candidate on the basis of whether or not he approves of that candidate and his policies .
Lindgren thus exhibits an outrageously false concept of " objectivity " and of what it means to be a social " scientist . "
I am not saying that Lindgren 's view of " science " is uncommon ; I am merely pointing out how obviously false it is .
The fact that this false view of " science " is common does not mean that it is true , but only that the current stage of development of the philosophy of science is so crude that such an absurdly false view of " science " remains common today .
Obviously , a social scientist who disapproves of a given President 's performance will therefore be * both * more likely to vote against him on that account * and* to score his performance in office low on that same account .
Indeed , for a social " scientist " to believe , as does Mr. Lindgren , that in order for him to be " objective " he must not tend to vote for candidates whom he approves of , nor to vote against candidates he disapproves of , the social " scientist " would have to possess a very warped concept of " science " and of " objectivity , " so that he would be neither scientific nor objective .
This false view of " science " has vast ramifications ; it greatly retards the development of authentically scientific history , and of authentically scientific other social sciences .

I did n't say anything about " proof " , or anything like it .
I said " indirect affirmation " -- perhaps you should check the meaning of that last word in a dictionary .
The person affirming something could be completely wrong .
But someone unable to offer a reasoned rebuttal to a claim suggests that they lack a rational basis for disagreement , which suggests that somewhere in the recesses of their mind an affirmation lurks .
Pedro Cruz - 7/16/2005 G.W.Bush has undermined the basic American value of " competence in office . "
He raised incompetence in office to a new level during the nine months preceding 9 - 11 by deliberately ignoring credible and persistent evidence that his country would be attacked by airplanes being flown into buildings .
He neglected his responsibility to protect his country from foreign enemies so that he could have a justification for pursuing his personal goal : deposing Mr. Hussein .
Sadly , how he has managed to remain in office in spite of his incompetence is a testament to the ignorance and gullibility of a majority of Americans .
j l dunbar - 7/5/2005 a divided nation split destructively between secular and value neonazis with schiavo and right wing zealots demanding we kidnap brain dead women with rhetoric of ' err on side of life ' while we hear headlines of dead wrong and speeches stating it was ' worth it ' to murder 1760 soldiers serving 3 tours in a war concocted with false intelligence .

Amusing spin .
When , pray tell , will Dubya actually become responsible for anything ?
The disastrous results cannot be postponed forever , though so far they have managed to stave off total collapse by borrowing from our dear friends Japan , Saudi Arabia , and China .
China ?
Actually , the Saudis are probably worse as friends , but in any case , with friends like that , who needs enemies ?
By the way , your poor spelling is rather rude .
Remember this is an intelligent and informed audience .
Actually , your own " content " makes the point germane , since your mumbling appears to be ad hominem attacks mostly directed at the intelligence of the authors .
Shannon Jacobs - 6/5/2005
My first degree includes history , and I 've continued to read quite a bit of it over the years .
I have already seen excerpts of this document a number of times .
I 've always considered myself an informed voter , but in 2000 , while I certainly was not going to vote for Dubya against the well - qualified Al Gore , I did not regard Dubya as being capable of the disastrous performance he has delivered .
Actually , I could not have conceived that any one person could be responsible for so much damage to the once mighty nation .
I think the bizarre ( s) election of 2000 should have been mentioned as an aspect of the political ruthlessness and hypocrisy of BushCo .
The damage it did to the system was enormous , and probably contributed greatly to their secret fortress mentality .
Also , I do n't think sufficient attention was given to Dubya 's marginal participation in the decision processes .
Dubya basically acts as a sock puppet for Cheney and Rove .
I was still hopeful until the election of 2004 .
However , whether or not the election was manipulated , it is clear that far too many voters are too far gone in their ignorance or are actually fanatical Busheviks of various stripes .
All things have a time , and America is reaching the end of hers .
James Lindgren - 5/26/2005
I just posted below on the measurement problem you raise .
In part , I wrote :
" The political split I find in rating recent presidents means that it is likely that the HNN study merely tells us what the political orientation of their pool is .
" This is a measurement issue .
You may think you are measuring GW Bush , but you are really measuring the politics of the panel surveyed .
I am not saying that , if someone were to do a representative study of historians , they would n't find Bush a failure ( given the political makeup of the profession , they probably would ) ; what I am saying is that this result would be determined by the politics of the raters , not GW Bush 's successes or failures .
" In rating presidents , one should either politically balance panels or measure the politics of the raters and assess their impact on the ratings -- or both ( the informal HNN survey does neither ) .
Otherwise , you are not measuring what you think you are measuring . "

The new HNN rating of presidents .--
The History News Network has published the results of an informal survey of historians and found George Bush to be a failure ( tip to Instapundit ) .
With Steve Calabresi , in 2000 I wrote up the results of a survey of politically balanced panels of historians , political scientists , and law professors for the Wall Street Journal , an article in Constitutional Commentary , and a chapter in Presidential Leadership ( a Wall Street Journal book edited by James Taranto and Leonard Leo ) .
One thing became clear to me : for recent presidents , such as Bill Clinton , any ratings reflect more the political makeup of the rating panel than judgments about the president being rated .
I replicated this study this year for a revised version of Presidential Leadership due out this fall ( we added economists this time ) .
The political split I find in rating recent presidents means that it is likely that the HNN study merely tells us what the political orientation of their pool is .
This is a measurement issue .
You may think you are measuring GW Bush , but you are really measuring the politics of the panel surveyed .
I am not saying that , if someone were to do a representative study of historians , they would n't find Bush a failure ( given the political makeup of the profession , they probably would ) ; what I am saying is that this result would be determined by the politics of the raters , not GW Bush 's successes or failures .
In rating presidents , one should either politically balance panels or measure the politics of the raters and assess their impact on the ratings -- or both ( the informal HNN survey does neither ) .
Otherwise , you are not measuring what you think you are measuring .
Our new 2005 study should be released in the early fall as part of a revised version of Presidential Leadership .
Sorry , I can't release the results .
You 'll have to wait another few months to learn how a politically balanced panel of historians rate GW Bush .
Ricardo Luis Rodriguez - 5/26/2005
Historians , of all people , should be the first ones to jump up and state what the source of their wisdom is - the perspective that passage of time imparts .
Instead , when it comes to Bush , they get their hair all up in a twist , cast their source of wisdom to the wind , and bloviate indignantly about this or that .
Historians may take solace in the fact that in regards to recognition of present merit they are no worse than Art critics , Literary critics , or any other " Academy types " .
Academy types have all lauded now forgotten " geniuses " , while their contemporaneous luminaries are better seen after the passage of time .
Ricardo Luis Rodriguez - 5/26/2005
By your standards , the UN's lack of action in Rwanda and and Serbia were exemplar as they watched massacres unfold .
Perhaps we should n't have attacked Nazi Germany given all those innocent civilians obliterated by aerial bombing of Dresden , Berlin , Frankfurt , etc .
No , we are not perfect , and we have killed many innocents , but I give the Iraqui electorate more credence than you as to wether they think our intervention was worth it .
As to the Geneva convention ...
It is a treaty dictating conduct between warring armies as defined by the treaty itself .
The mujahedeen violate all provisions of what a standing army is , except that they carry weapons .
By their own conduct they abrogate all protections of the Geneva convention .
We are not fighting an army following Geneva convention rules , I do not see why we should follow Geneva convention rules .
As a matter of fact , the penalty for flouting Geneva convention rules is the implied threat of experiencing the full horror of war at its most savage .
We already are at the receiving end of such carnage ( witness the live beheadings , deliberate targeting of civilians , burning and parading of mutilated corpses ) , I see no problem with ou present relatively restrained response .
Doug Mitchell Rivers - 5/26/2005
What is most noticeable about the tsunami of Bush - hate comments by the so - called historians on this site is the childish emotionalism and lack of professionalism .
The book is clearly out on Bush .
If he has initiated a wave of democracy in the mideast that makes the world a significantly better place in which to live , then that will be major plus .
If he " saves " social security , another .
What if history looks back and takes ( ahem ) a broader view of the last half of the 20th century to present than our leftist - sound - bite profs , and sees that Bush did a fairly good job of maintaining the economy - post Clinton techno - bubble ?
A good job overseas and at home would seem to add up to a successful presdiency .
Not saying this has been nailed down yet , but a more thoughtful analysis , it seems to be , would have to recognize the possibilities .
Clearly some grounding in the disciplines of history does not automatically confer thoughtful perspective and maturity of outlook .
John E Torbett - 5/26/2005
The quotations listed by Mr. McElvaine in his article and the related comments show a level of ignorance that is astonishing .
There are so many fallacies repeated by these people I do n't know where to start but here goes .
- Worst job loss in first 2 1/ 2 years since Hoover
How can historians be ignorant of the fact that the economy was in recession on Januay 23 , 2001 , ( so says the National Bureau of Economic Research ) , the NASDAQ was down over 50 % from its March 2000 high , dot com companies were burning through capital received from venture capitalists and Wall Street at an unprecedented rate , literally hundreds of public corporations were fraudulently overstating their earnings ( Enron , World Com , AOL , Global Crossing , Tyco , Xerox , etc. all had to restate earnings dating back to the 1990's ) , Wall Street allowed its massive conflicts of interest to color its stock analysis , approximately 1.5 million of the jobs lost in Bush 's first term were lost by December 2001 ( two months into the first fiscal year of Bush 's Presidency and before any of his tax cuts had even taken effect ) , a significant majority of the job losses were created during the worst stock market bubble in American history and would have been lost no matter who occupied the White House because most dot com 's formed in the 1990 's never earned a dime .
Some economists estimate that just short of 1 million jobs were lost as a direct result of 9/11 ( the planning and preparation for which began in the February 2000 ) .
Additionally , there have been well over a hundred thousand jobs lost as a direct result of NAFTA and other trade agreements entered into by the Clinton Administration .
These agreements were hailed by Clinton sycophants as an essential part of his legacy .
Well , in the words of Ward Churchill , those chickens have come home to roost becasue the impact of his predecessor 's policies is being felt now .
Bush did n't have anything to do with it .
Finally , correlation is not the same thing as causation .
There are many statments by historians which dogmatically conclude Bush was responsible for job losses , but I did n't see a single fact supporting those conclusions .
As a matter of fact , Bush 's tax cuts ameliorated the impact of the recession .
You do n't have to take my word for it , Alan Greenspan attested to this fact before Congress several times .
Total household wealth in the USA is currently at the highest level it has ever been .
Home ownership is now at the highest level ever in the history of this country .
Unemployment is below the historical average since WWII , inflation is significantly below the historical average since WWII , etc. etc .
You may be historians , but you sure are n't economists .
- Bush has reduced the tax burden on the rich
This is objectively false .
The percentage of total income tax revenue paid to the government by the top 20 % of income tax payers has increased since Bush ' tax cuts took effect .
The marginal rates went down for all individual income tax payers .
The argument that the tax cuts only helped the rich is nothing more than a talking point intended to inflame class envy amongst those ignorant enough to believe it ( aka the Democratic base ) .
- Foreign Policy and our Allies
Our economy also suffered from the complete foreign policy mess that Bush inherited from Clinton .
Terrorism against the US had been metasticizing for ten years without any opposition save a few missles lobbed at Sudanese aspirin factories .
Our close allies that you historians are so concerned about were on the dole from Saddam .
French politicians in Chirac 's administration and journalists were being bribed with UN Oil for Food money while France was actively violating the UN sanction regime by selling Saddam arms .
A German citizen was convicted in 1998 of having sold Saddam centrifuge equipment used to create weapons grade nuclear material .
Russia also sold arms to Saddam and had its own politicians sucking from the teat of Saddam 's oil money .
These same European crooks were simultaneously arguing for an end to sanctions all together .
I 've got news for you geniuses , Mr. Chirac does not have our best interests at heart .
He is a Gaulist and he wants to restablish French power on the world stage .
He has intended to do this by creating a united European foreign policy ( although that is n't looking too likely right now ) and undermining the US at every turn .
Why do you think he supported French oil contracts with Saddam and recently attempted to sell arms to China ?
Chirac is an antagonist and it's laughable that historians think that Bush had anything to do with that .
He just decided that he was n't going to be cowed by the French .
Plus , anti-Americanism seems to have lost some of its potency as a political tool for Schroeder in Germany .
You historians worry about the increased hatred for America since Bush entered office , yet you conveniently forget about the ill will engendered by decades of support for dictatorial regimes in Egypt , Saudi Arabia etc .
And no matter how badly you may want to pin it on the Bushes , that policy began with FDR 's support of the House of Saud in the 1930's and was continued by every administration afterwards right through Clinton 's eight years .
Sandy Berger refused to allow a predator drone to fire on Bin Laden because he did n't want to kill a visiting Saudi prince for God 's sake .
Bush is the first Western politician who has had the guts to acknowledge that this cynical , realpolitik approach never achieved the stability that served as its justification .
And , by the way , you conveneintly forget the anti-globalization riots in Seattle and Genoa which were almost exclusively directed against the US and its impact on the world economy .
What about the huge anti-American demonstrations in Greece when Clinton visited there in 2000 ?
We now have Walid Jumblatt , the leader of the Druze Christians in Lebanon , saying thank God for the invasion of Iraq which has given the Lebanese the courage to demand real democracy .
You can deny it all you want , but when the very people who are engaging in the Cedar Revolution are explicitly giving Bush credit ( as Jumblatt did in the Wash .
Post recently ) there is n't anything to argue about .
- worst stock market loss in first two years since Hoover
The stock market was in free fall when Bush entered office and 9/11 was the nail in its coffin .
Just for comparison 's sake , the NASDAQ fell 54 % from its March 10 , 2000 high to December 31 , 2000 .
The NASDAQ fell 52 % in Bush 's first two years ( 1-23-01 through 1-22-03 ) .
However , the NASDAQ is still down from where it was when Bush entered office but the difference is that it was massively overvalued then and it is n't now .
On January 1 , 2001 , the avg .
PE Ratio for the NASDAQ was 36 , now its 15 which is exactly the historical average for the NASDAQ .
- Bottom Line
Bush inherited a mess from Clinton and he has made the best of it .
He has been far from perfect however .
The irony is that the truly bad policies Bush has pursued are those that liberals advocated .
Campaign finance reform is a joke and Bush should have vetoed it .
No matter what the liberal whack jobs on the SCOTUS say , McCain Feingold is a blatant violation of the First Amendment .
Not to mention the fact that it has resulted in even murkier financing of political entities by billionaires who so n't have to disclose teir contributions .
The steel tariffs were a joke , but they were championed by one of the pillars of the Democratice party , unions .
I just can't believe that teachers are either so ignorant or deluded by their hatred of Bush that they actually believe the nonsense they spouted off in this survey .

How can historians be ignorant of the fact that the economy was in recession on Januay 23 , 2001 , ( so says the National Bureau of Economic Research ) , the NASDAQ was down over 50 % from its March 2000 high , dot com companies were burning through capital received from venture capitalists and Wall Street at an unprecedented rate , literally hundreds of public corporations were fraudulently overstating their earnings ( Enron , World Com , AOL , Global Crossing , Tyco , Xerox , etc. all had to restate earnings dating back to the 1990's ) , Wall Street allowed its massive conflicts of interest to color its stock analysis , approximately 1.5 million of the jobs lost in Bush 's first term were lost by December 2001 ( two months into the first fiscal year of Bush 's Presidency and before any of his tax cuts had even taken effect ) , a significant majority of the job losses were created during the worst stock market bubble in American history and would have been lost no matter who occupied the White House because most dot com 's formed in the 1990 's never earned a dime .
Some economists estimate that just short of 1 million jobs were lost as a direct result of 9/11 ( the planning and preparation for which began in the February 2000 ) .
Additionally , there have been well over a hundred thousand jobs lost as a direct result of NAFTA and other trade agreements entered into by the Clinton Administration .
These agreements were hailed by Clinton sycophants as an essential part of his legacy .
Well , in the words of Ward Churchill , those chickens have come home to roost becasue the impact of his predecessor 's policies is being felt now .
Bush did n't have anything to do with it .
Finally , correlation is not the same thing as causation .
There are many statments by historians which dogmatically conclude Bush was responsible for job losses , but I did n't see a single fact supporting those conclusions .
As a matter of fact , Bush 's tax cuts ameliorated the impact of the recession .
You do n't have to take my word for it , Alan Greenspan attested to this fact before Congress several times .
Total household wealth in the USA is currently at the highest level it has ever been .
Home ownership is now at the highest level ever in the history of this country .
Unemployment is below the historical average since WWII , inflation is significantly below the historical average since WWII , etc. etc .
You may be historians , but you sure are n't economists .
- Bush has reduced the tax burden on the rich
This is objectively false .
The percentage of total income tax revenue paid to the government by the top 20 % of income tax payers has increased since Bush ' tax cuts took effect .
The marginal rates went down for all individual income tax payers .
The argument that the tax cuts only helped the rich is nothing more than a talking point intended to inflame class envy amongst those ignorant enough to believe it ( aka the Democratic base ) .
- Foreign Policy and our Allies
Our economy also suffered from the complete foreign policy mess that Bush inherited from Clinton .
Terrorism against the US had been metasticizing for ten years without any opposition save a few missles lobbed at Sudanese aspirin factories .
Our close allies that you historians are so concerned about were on the dole from Saddam .
French politicians in Chirac 's administration and journalists were being bribed with UN Oil for Food money while France was actively violating the UN sanction regime by selling Saddam arms .
A German citizen was convicted in 1998 of having sold Saddam centrifuge equipment used to create weapons grade nuclear material .
Russia also sold arms to Saddam and had its own politicians sucking from the teat of Saddam 's oil money .
These same European crooks were simultaneously arguing for an end to sanctions all together .
I 've got news for you geniuses , Mr. Chirac does not have our best interests at heart .
He is a Gaulist and he wants to restablish French power on the world stage .
He has intended to do this by creating a united European foreign policy ( although that is n't looking too likely right now ) and undermining the US at every turn .
Why do you think he supported French oil contracts with Saddam and recently attempted to sell arms to China ?
Chirac is an antagonist and it's laughable that historians think that Bush had anything to do with that .
He just decided that he was n't going to be cowed by the French .
Plus , anti-Americanism seems to have lost some of its potency as a political tool for Schroeder in Germany .
You historians worry about the increased hatred for America since Bush entered office , yet you conveniently forget about the ill will engendered by decades of support for dictatorial regimes in Egypt , Saudi Arabia etc .
And no matter how badly you may want to pin it on the Bushes , that policy began with FDR 's support of the House of Saud in the 1930's and was continued by every administration afterwards right through Clinton 's eight years .
Sandy Berger refused to allow a predator drone to fire on Bin Laden because he did n't want to kill a visiting Saudi prince for God 's sake .
Bush is the first Western politician who has had the guts to acknowledge that this cynical , realpolitik approach never achieved the stability that served as its justification .
And , by the way , you conveneintly forget the anti-globalization riots in Seattle and Genoa which were almost exclusively directed against the US and its impact on the world economy .
What about the huge anti-American demonstrations in Greece when Clinton visited there in 2000 ?
We now have Walid Jumblatt , the leader of the Druze Christians in Lebanon , saying thank God for the invasion of Iraq which has given the Lebanese the courage to demand real democracy .
You can deny it all you want , but when the very people who are engaging in the Cedar Revolution are explicitly giving Bush credit ( as Jumblatt did in the Wash .
Post recently ) there is n't anything to argue about .
- worst stock market loss in first two years since Hoover
The stock market was in free fall when Bush entered office and 9/11 was the nail in its coffin .
Just for comparison 's sake , the NASDAQ fell 54 % from its March 10 , 2000 high to December 31 , 2000 .
The NASDAQ fell 52 % in Bush 's first two years ( 1-23-01 through 1-22-03 ) .
However , the NASDAQ is still down from where it was when Bush entered office but the difference is that it was massively overvalued then and it is n't now .
On January 1 , 2001 , the avg .
PE Ratio for the NASDAQ was 36 , now its 15 which is exactly the historical average for the NASDAQ .
- Bottom Line
Bush inherited a mess from Clinton and he has made the best of it .
He has been far from perfect however .
The irony is that the truly bad policies Bush has pursued are those that liberals advocated .
Campaign finance reform is a joke and Bush should have vetoed it .
No matter what the liberal whack jobs on the SCOTUS say , McCain Feingold is a blatant violation of the First Amendment .
Not to mention the fact that it has resulted in even murkier financing of political entities by billionaires who so n't have to disclose teir contributions .
The steel tariffs were a joke , but they were championed by one of the pillars of the Democratice party , unions .
I just can't believe that teachers are either so ignorant or deluded by their hatred of Bush that they actually believe the nonsense they spouted off in this survey .
Jim C. - 5/26/2005
I 'd like to see the average rating from historians who voted for Bush versus those who did n't .
And please do n't use the excuse that it 's irrelevant .
If it is , then there would n't be any harm in revealing this , would there ?
So humor me .
Of course , if that data was n't recorded , just go back and let us know the numbers of those historians that voted for Bush and those who did n't .
I expect some supercilious dismissal of the idea .
The real reason for dismissing it would probably be that it would expose the blatant bias of these so - called historians .
Dylan Sherlock - 5/26/2005
One of the main charges levelled against President Bush by his critics is that he is offending America 's foreign allies .
As a citizen of Canada , one of the foremost ( in being offended and in being an ally ) I 'd just like to say my piece .
The majority of governments in the world are ruled by incompetent , power hungry oligarchies who care about foreigners about as far as they can throw them .
Canadians for example , have not gone to Iraq .
Of course , we 've since discovered that the former Prime Minister 's ( who made the decision ) son - in - law had an oil deal with Saddam Hussien for billions of dollars .
The current Prime Minster had a million dollars of Saddams money invested in a company he owned .
We found that even if we did have the moral surety to help America build a stronger coalition in Iraq , we could n't because our armed forces have been castrated by two decades of Liberal governments .
On the face of things , Canadians seemed very angry about the whole Iraq war thing , very anti-Bush and whatnot .
This is not a bad thing .
Bashing America is Canadians second favorite activity ( first favorite since the hockey season was cancelled ) .
In fact , from travelling the world , I 've noticed that most people enjoy bashing America .
It is n't a real measure of America 's success or failure .
Popular anti-Americanism is just a way to fit in for most people .
It 's a social activity .
Very few stop to formulate an opinion , they just acquire one , compliments of the Naomi Klein pop-culture .
The big failures of Bush from a " I vist Michigan every year " standpoint are : limp - dick " faith - based initiatives " , the Patriot Act ( which I can sympathize with at least , a terrorist was caught at the border crossing coming from the city I was born in , most of the provisions in it seem very reasonable ) , the either incompetence or plain stupidity of the NCLB and the failure to moderate an increasingly polarized country .
If anything that I think history will remember Bush by , the last is the most important .
During the last four years , Americans have become deeply split over his administration and over this war .
While I agree with the war , the domestic " big - yet - small government " approach seems just a little silly .
But that does n't matter , ' cause I 'm not an American .
What does matter is the first superpower to ever have a real sense of decency is breaking down into this emmense unsustainable red-state / blue - state divide .
Good luck Bush .
You 'll need it .
And so will America .
Dylan Sherlock - 5/26/2005 Enough .
Karl Hallowell - 5/25/2005
I 'm not a fan of G. W. Bush .
If he and his entire cabinet were to resign tomorrow , I would n't mind in the least .
But let 's keep things in perspective .
Bush has deposed of two governments that were big trouble makers in the Middle East .
His pre-war arguments and post - war followup were laughable and incompetent , but the wars were pretty competent and achieved the overthrow of these governments .
No significant terrorist attacks have occured on US soil since 9/11 .
He failed to control spending and the magnitude of tax cuts seems unwise , but he is addressing Social Security which is probably one of the worst things to come out of the New Deal era .
IMHO , we should just end the program and pay out such obligations as have accrued .
Retirees these days are a lot richer ( excluding Social Security ) than they were in the 30's when the program was created .
We are n't justified in forcing a couple hundred million people to enter and pay for a program when we really just need something that covers the neediest few percent .
People like Mr. McElvaine who talk of the " 3 million " jobs lost by Bush or the decline in the stock market have no concept of what really happened .
Yes , a third of the value of publically traded companies vanished over two years .
Losing 3 million jobs is about the right speed for such an loss of wealth .
The point ?
Who pumped the stock markets up to that point ?
It was n't Bush .
Plus the decline started ( March 2000 ) more than six months prior to Bush getting reelected , and was nine months old by the time he actually entered office .
I have n't been remotely impressed by Bush 's economic incentives , but at least he kept Greenspan around .
Even now , the budget deficit , taxes , etc are n't a significant fraction of the US 's GDP compared to other OECD countries .
So saying we 're on the " brink of bankruptcy " is highly misleading .
Finally , I find global opinion to be pretty worthless .
The problem is that it comes and goes so easily .
You can't keep it or use it for very long .
He lost a lot when he backtracked on the harmful Kyoto treaty ( too bad it got ratified anyway ) .
Karl Hallowell - 5/25/2005
Maybe there is a bit of ' self - selection ' in that historians tend to be ' liberal ' .
On the other hand maybe one should ask which is the chicken , and which the egg ; maybe sober assessment of history , and perhaps especially in the United States , leads smart people toward views that might be termed " liberal " .
Presumbly if " liberal " was so correlated with " smart " , then you would see similar dominance by the " liberal " ideology for say corporate executives as you see for historians .
Self - interest goes a long ways to explaining things , IMHO .
Gonzalo Rodriguez - 5/25/2005 Mr. Petit , once again you demonstrate just how high of an opinion you have of yourself .
Be careful not to scrape your nose against the ceiling , you might get hurt .
Rob G McPhee - 5/25/2005
Well of course they would have had similar result for Reagan .
He unneccesarily escalated the Cold war by pushing long range weapons into western Europe , declared opposition to the USSR in no uncertain terms , and foolishly spent us into deficit for military reasons .
Everyone who was anyone knew that the USA / USSR Cold War would only be resolved once we clarified our differences and came to the negotiating table , and this " cowboy " president was doing nothing but pushing that time farther and farther away .
And he tried to cut taxes on the 70 % income tax bracket to INCREASE government tax receipts from those same people .
Obvious idiocy that has no possibility of working , because the economy is never affected or altered based on taxes .
If you want to take in twice as much , just double taxes and you 'll be there ...
Oh , yes , all of the above was said during Reagan by various people , and all is obviously flawed in many significant ways .
I could go on , but it seems unnecessary as very few believe any of the previous today .
Perhaps historians will do better once they gain the perspective of having the events of today be " historical " .
R. Fogg - 5/23/2005
Let 's just hope the worst of the damage caused by the Worst President Ever has already been inflicted .
I do n't think America will be able to restore its good name in the eyes of the world until this Administration stands trial and answers for its crimes .

Some D Dude - 2/24/2005 " do not for a moment believe Al Gore would have crashed the economy by slashing taxes on the rich ( which is the real cause of the deficit , not spending ) .
Nor do I believe he would have reversed environmental protections , supported pseudo - science , proposed a Constitutional amendment to outlaw gay marriage ... "
Is this for real ?
Did Terry McAuliffe write this ?
The econ is crashed ?
Try reading a newspaper .
You 're clueless .
As for the deficit , IT 'S THE FIFTH HIGHEST , not the highest .
So please do n't lie when making a point .
And the tax cuts only shave off about 5 % or less of what the govt .
will take in over 10 years .
Hardly a cause for concern , eh ?
Also , what about when you pay more in taxes you get more of a cut do n't you understand ?
What enviro protections have been rolled back ?
Go read Gregg Easterbrook of The New Republic .
He intensely disagrees .
Gay Marriage Amendment .
Sorry , but Bill Clinton ended the gay marriage dream when he signed the Def. of Marriage Act .
Pseudo - science ?
Like what ?
Is Bush practicing Alchemy or something ?
Perhaps physiognomy ?
Just wondering .
Some D Dude - 2/24/2005
" What the hell explains these attitudes , which look so ridiculous in retrospect ?
I wish I knew .
One thing I can say : I am confident that this poll of historians will look asinine in turn within 20 years . "
Dude , the poll is bogus .
No reputable HISTORIAN would give his thoughts on how the PRESENT will be interpreted by FUTURE generations .
Also , this is all the feckless Left has left : just lie about anything the right does , then when the right questions / attacks back , the Left holds up their collective nose and merely responds :
Just what we thought .
You 're too stupid to understand .
Steve Herman - 12/3/2004
It is extremely difficult to understand how a person with the intellect , abilities , character , and personal history of George W. Bush is today President .
This is pure conjecture , but I think a meeting or meetings were held back in 1992 - 93 after Clinton took office to lay out the strategy to gain control once and for all and under any and all circumstances .
The original plan was to run Jeb Bush in 2000 .
George W. was then considered an after - thought , back - up plan , or something along those lines .
Back in 1992 - 93 , both were politically neophytes , never having run for any office of any type and with a total of 0 years in public service between them .
Strangely , however , or perhaps not so strangely , both decided to make thier first bid for elective office in this time - span .
Jeb does seem to have some intellectual abilities , some charisma , and is generall quite well - spoken .
It is quite easy to see how those wanting to take over permanent control of the government could see that by getting Jeb elected twice governor of some state ( generally considered the minimum criteria necessary for a credible candidate ) and with his natural name recognition , he would serve quite nicely to do their bidding .
However something happened .
Jeb lost in his first race for governor of Florida .
The back - up , George W. won his race as governor or Texas .
Jeb won the next race , and George W. was reelected .
Coming into 2000 , GW , their back - up , was the only option that met the minimal criteria to be viewed as a credible candidate for the Presidency .
It should be understood that their was no actual Republican Presidential primary in 2000 .
GW was given at least 20 million well before the Iowa caucuses .
Whatever happened in Iowa and New Hampshire , no candidate could possible compete against GW and his money in the sudden onset of primaries across a vast swath of states in what is known as Super Tuesday .
The money made GW a lock before the primaries ever began , money that had never previously accrued to a candidate until after he had proven his electoral viabilty as a presidential candidate .
Securing the sanitization of his military records and whatever other records that may have existed , careful handling and coaching of the candidate , the use of sophisticated tactics greatly refined in the last election , and surviving a scare when some records did come to light , those wishing to take permanent control over the government have now succeeded in twice electing a person who is essentially an unknown mediocrity to the highest office in the land .
What does this mean ?
It means that those who initiated this strategy have taken over permanent control of the US government .
Steve Herman - 12/3/2004
Bush appears to me to be someone who was essentially picked by moneyed interests to do their bidding .
Unless someone comes into the office with convictions and goals , maticulously tailoring his life and presence toward one day attaining the highest office and working toward achieving them , I do not see how that person can be evaluated in the historical sense .
Bush is simply a person who 's led a mediocre , mostly private , priveleged life , and is and will continue to be a mediocre president .
david james bobalik - 11/5/2004
After reading many of your posts on George W. Bush I would like to state a view things I found troublin
When the government tells you that you ca n’t smoke marijuana or that you must wear a helmet when you ride your motorcycle even if you happen to like the feeling of the wind in your hair , it is being paternalistic .
It is largely treating you the way a parent treats a child , restricting your liberty for what it deems to be your own good .
Paternalistic laws are n’t very popular in this country .
We hew to the principle that , children and the mentally ill apart , an individual is a better judge of what ’s good for him than the state is and that people should be free to do what they wish as long as their actions do n’t harm others .
Contrary to what many people believe , you can even commit suicide legally ( although if you do n’t live in Oregon , you should think twice about seeking assistance ) .
But what if it could be shown that even highly competent , well - informed people fail to make choices in their best interest ?
And what if the government could somehow step in and nudge them in the right direction without interfering with their liberty , or at least not very much ?
Welcome to the new world of “ soft paternalism . ”
The old “ hard ” paternalism says , We know what ’s best for you , and we ’ll force you to do it .
By contrast , soft paternalism says ,
You know what ’s best for you , and we ’ll help you to do it .
Here ’s an example .
In some states with casino gambling , like Missouri and Michigan , compulsive gamblers have the option of putting their names on a blacklist , or “ self - exclusion ” list , that bars them from casinos .
Once on the list , they are banned for life .
If they violate the ban , they risk being arrested and having their winnings confiscated .
In Missouri , more than 10,000 people have availed themselves of this program .
In Michigan , the first person to sign up for it was , as it happens , also the first to be arrested for violating its terms when he could n’t resist sneaking back to the blackjack tables ; he was sentenced to a year ’s probation , and the state kept his winnings of $ 1,223 .
The voluntary gambling blacklist is an example of what ’s called a self - binding scheme .
It is a way of restructuring the external world so that when future temptations arise , you will have no choice but to do what you ’ve judged to be best for you .
The classic case is that of Ulysses , who ordered his men to tie him to the mast of his ship so that he could hear the song of the Sirens without being lured to his destruction .
As a freely chosen hedge against weakness of the will , self - binding would seem to enlarge individual liberty , not reduce it .
So what is there to object to in a program like Missouri ’s or Michigan’s ?
Watching all six Star Wars movies simultaneously

So on November 10 , 2005 , I finished setting this up , started watching it , discovered the Palpatine coincidence , and figured it was worth putting up a small web page about .
I threw one together quickly , just explaining what it was and covering the first few minutes of the movies , and showed it to a few people in the TFN Fanfilms chatroom .
One of them showed it to one of his friends , who did n't know it was n't finished and submitted it to digg , which I 'd never even heard of but apparently is wicked popular .
I went to sleep , and when I woke up it was on the front page of digg and had had about 10,000 hits overnight .
Then a bunch of other popular websites posted it too , and then another friend of mine submitted it to Slashdot and , well , there it is .
So that was my 15 minutes of fame I guess .
Wheeeeeee .
Back to obscuredom now .
The videos are on CoralCDN , which seems to have problems with firewalls sometimes , so if you can't see them , that 's probably why .
A preamble , because preamble is a cool word , and to respond to what are probably the most common reactions to this :
Yes , I 'm an obsessed Star Wars fan .
They 're my favorite movies , all six of them , including the special editions , and I do n't care what you think .
No , I was n't looking for any amazing insight , it 's just fun and interesting ( perhaps more interesting to people interested in film editing and storytelling than to others ) .
People have been doing this with The Wizard of Oz and Dark Side of the Moon for a long time , and this makes way more sense than that .
I have done other things than this , many of which I 've spent far more time on and I think are much more interesting .
So , people who are making fun of me for wasting so much time on this : it only took a few days , and it 's not my fault that this particular silly little quick fun experiment of mine is the one thing I 've done that 's become this popular .
Also , I 've made a few hundred dollars off the Google ads .
So there .
I 'm not going to release the whole thing , it 'd put me on way too shaky legal ground .
I might put together a tutorial on how to put it together yourself , but no doubt a lot of people can figure it out without my help anyway .
So all six movies are out on DVD now , and I said to myself : I have nothing better to do , and there are so many parallels between these movies as it is , it'd be fun to see how many interesting things line up with each other if I watch all six movies simultaneously .
I ripped the DVDs , and stuck them all together into one video file with Avisynth and VirtualDub , which took up a lot of space and time on my computer for a few days .
My first impulse was to overlay them all on top of each other , the better ( I thought ) to compare them .
Turns out , apart from a few bits , it was just ridiculously confusing to look at .
Yeah .
So I just laid them out in a grid next to each other instead , like this .
I figured I might as well make a web page about this , just for the hell of it , and maybe somebody will find it interesting .
Obviously most of these are just funny and cool coincidences , and most of the rest are just due to similarities in the storytelling structure of the films .
Some of them are n't really very interesting and I just put them there to fill space so that you can get a reasonably good impression of what the whole thing is like without actually having to watch all of it .
Obviously I 'm putting the parts that are most interesting to me here , but I 'm also trying to put enough stuff from it up to let other people make their own opinions about it .
Feel free to strongly disagree with me about which parts are interesting .

Learning about functional and dynamic languages is a doubled - edged sword .
On the one hand , it opens up your mind and ensures many hours of really happy , even enlightened , hacking .
But , on the other hand , it spoils you : if you ever have to come back to , say , C or Java programming you may get frustrated by the limitations you ’ll find [ 0 ] .
On the bright side , once you get over the first symptoms of impatience , knowing about better ways of coding will improve your programs in any language .
I ’ve been using mainly C at work during the last year and a half , and i feel that the quality of the code i write has been greatly improved by my readings on Lisp , Haskell and the like .
Ultimately , it ’s not about the language you use or its syntax , but about how you think about your problems .
And more about the tools and structures in your mind than in your language : if you have the former , you can usually work around deficiencies in the latter .
But still , there has been many a time during the last months that i’ve wished i had been using , say , Scheme .
For , although i knew how to reproduce the feature i needed using C , re-implementing it would have been too time - consuming .
In this regard , using the most flexible language at your disposal may be a good idea .
For instance , i was reading an article entitled Generalized Function Pointers , which describes a C++ library for handling higher - order functions .
For starters , it makes an interesting description of the kind of problems you find in languages with no built - in support for closures and HOFs .
It may convince you ( if needed ) of why they ’re a good thing to have .
The good news if you ’re using C++ is that there ’s a boost library , Boost .
Function , that implements polymorphic function object wrappers , and lets you write code like this :
function < int ( int x , int y ) > arithmetic_operation ( char k ) { switch ( k ) { case '+' : return plus<int >( ) ; case '-' : return minus < int >( ) ; case '*' : return multiplies < int >( ) ; case '/' : return divides < int >( ) ; case ' %' : return modulus < int >( ) ; default : assert ( 0 ) ; } }
Not as pretty as Scheme or Haskell , but my point is that , at least , C++ let ’s you get closer to the real thing , which is more than C or Java can do [ 1 ] .
I ’ll left it for you to ponder whether the drawbacks of C++ surpass niceties as this one : i’m considering the ( not unlikely ) scenario where you need to use one of these languages , for whatever reason .
Which leads me to my second , and more important , point : had i not studied functional languages , i would n’t be in a position to really appreciate and take profit of libraries such as those in boost ’s functional and generic programming collections [ 2 ] , or the excellent FC ++.
And would have lost lots of fun .

I ’m sure he ’s exaggerating a bit , but Eric ’s recent report of his first month using Haskell vividly expresses this kind of feeling :
For me , it ’s a drug .
The more Haskell I get , the more I want .
The results I ’m getting right now are n’t orders of magnitude better than the results I can get in a von Neumann language , but the velocity I can achieve is astounding .
( When I ’m not dealing with stupid extraneous problems . )
[ 1 ] Yes , i know you can do similar things in C or Java , but Boost .
Function is more powerful than that ( the keyword here being ‘ polymorphic ’ , meaning , essentially , that it handles covariant and contravariant signatures gracefully ) .
[ 2 ]
For more on the kind of tricks one can play using templates and Boost .
Function , see Sutter ’s Generalizing Observer , where the author , essentially , works around the lack of multi-methods in C ++.
More to the point , that article will make much more sense once one learns a bit of , for instance , Common Lisp ’s object model .
In a world of people obsessed by turning the tiniest idea into something profitable , Dr Richard Hipp 's best - known software stands out for two reasons - he actively disclaims copyright in it ; and at a time when multi-megabyte installations are booming , he has a self - imposed limit on the size of his product : 250KB .
And he 's stuck to both aims .
" I think we 've got 15 kilobytes of spare space , " he says of the headroom left in the code .
Thus his product - SQLite ( sqlite.org ) , a self - contained database engine and client - now forms part of Apple 's Mac OS X operating system as well as part of its Aperture photo - handling application .
It is also used by Google , Adobe , Sun and a number of other big names .
But he receives no royalty for the millions of copies being used by commercial and non-commercial users alike .
The reason ?
He has placed SQLite in the public domain .
It contains the note : " The author disclaims copyright to this source code .
In place of a legal notice , here is a blessing : may you do good and not evil .
May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others .
May you share freely , never taking more than you give . "
Unrestricted approach
It is an unusual approach , even in the open source world .
Most open source code is licensed under an agreement such as the GNU GPL ( general public licence ) , which includes terms to ensure that the software remains free .
" I looked at all of the licences , " Hipp says , " and I thought , why not just put it in the public domain ?
Why have these restrictions on it ?
I never expected to make one penny .
I just wanted to make it available to other people to solve their problem . "
SQLite is an entire SQL relational database management system , wrapped up in a single file .
SQL , or structured query language , is the industry standard programming language for storing and retrieving data .
Well - known SQL database managers include Oracle , IBM's DB2 , Microsoft 's SQL Server and Access , and the open source MySQL and PostgreSQL .
" We 're not trying to compete with those other engines , " says Hipp .
" Our goal is not add all sorts of bells and whistles , but rather to keep SQLite small and fast .
We 've set an arbitrary limit to keep the footprint of the library below 250KB . "
However , the application can support databases running to terabytes , including gigabyte - sized elements .
Being written in C , it can be compiled to run on pretty much any operating system .
Samuel Neff is senior software engineer at B - Line Medical in Maryland , USA .
He likes SQLite because it has zero configuration and installation .
The code is freely available , so he can easily extend it with customisations , and its performance is excellent .
In his tests SQLite was four times faster than Microsoft's SQL Server .
The comparison is unfair , though , since SQL Server is designed to serve entire networks and to support huge databases with thousands of users , whereas SQLite is mainly intended for a single user on a single machine .
Even so , Neff 's experience shows the benefits of using tightly coded software that does no more than is necessary .
Dr Hipp knows exactly when SQLite began .
" I started on May 29 2000 .
It 's just over seven years old , " he says .
He was working on a project which used a database server , but from time to time the database went offline .
" Then my program would give an error message saying that the database is n't working , and I got the blame for this .
So I said , this is not a demanding application for the database , why do n't I just talk directly to the disk , and build an SQL database engine that way ?
That was how it started . "
In the past couple of years SQLite has increasingly been attracting attention .
Apple used it in OS X 10.4 , released in April 2005 , as part of Apple Mail ( for its message index ) and to support its Core Data services .
SQLite is also built into PHP 5.0 , the hugely popular open source scripting language for web applications .
It is in Symbian 9.5 , an embedded operating system for smartphones .
The tiny database engine is also part of the new Google Gears , which enables web applications to work offline .
Most recently , Adobe has announced the inclusion of SQLite in Adobe Integrated Runtime for desktop applications based on its Flash multimedia engine .
" Performance is great , " says Ben Forsaith , business development manager at Adobe UK .
" It 's open source .
It 's lightweight , really small and widely adopted . "
So how many SQLite databases are in use ?
" We do n't have a good way of counting it , " he says , " but we 're guessing it 's the most widely deployed SQL database in the world . "
Dedicated effort
Despite being open source , the SQLite code does not have many contributors .
" I have an assistant , Dan Kennedy , an Australian living in Thailand , who contributes a lot of code , " Hipp says .
" He works for me , I pay him .
There are some people at Google who have been contributing to the full text search capability .
But Dan and I have done in excess of 99 % of the code . "
One of the limiting factors is that anyone contributing code must waive their copyright .
" I require anyone who contributes code to sign a copyright disclaimer , and I keep those copyright disclaimers in my fire safe , " Hipp says .
Is he worried about the code fragmenting into many different versions , because it is public domain ?
" I do n't see that as a problem , " he says .
" Other people are free to make a copy of SQLite and fork the tree [ produce alternative descendants ] if they want to .
So far I 'm not aware of anybody doing that .
If someone decides they want to , it wo n't hurt my feelings .
But it has turned into a very complicated piece of software , and it takes a dedicated effort to keep it in good shape . "
Hipp attributes much of the reliability of SQLite to his use of tests .
Less than half of the program code is delivered as the database engine .
The larger part consists of thousands of automated tests , which exercise the code and check that the results are as expected .
" That 's the real key to keeping it working well , " hesays .
There is a commercial aspect to SQLite .
Hipp runs a company that provides support for the application , and sells extensions for specialised features including encryption and compression .
It is only a small company , despite the popularity of the software .
" It 's very clear to me that if I 'd had any business sense whatsoever I could have made a lot of money , but I do n't , " he says .
" I like to tell people that we make enough to live fine in Charlotte , North Carolina .
We do n't make nearly enough money to live in London or San Francisco , but we do n't live there so that 's OK , " he adds - with a touch , just a touch , of wistfulness .
UPDATE : See also MySpace and Photobucket : Timeline of Events
UPDATE 2 : upgrading this from rumor to fact .
Price is in the range of the $ 300 million PB was looking for .
— — —-
It 's the deal you never thought would happen : MySpace acquiring Photobucket , the " parasite " that fed off MySpace traffic and hosted a massive number of MySpace photos .
There 's no word on whether the $ 300 M price tag , which Photobucket was being shopped around for , was met .
Seemingly first reported by Valleywag , final negotiations are said to have happened last week .
The deal may be announced as early as this morning .
Launched in 2003 , Photobucket receives 17 m unique visitors per month - a massive number , except that the majority of traffic was being referred by MySpace ( despite constant denials from the company ) .
After a bust up between the companies that led to Photobucket videos being blocked on MySpace , it looked like Photobucket 's relationship with the social network it fed on was n't running smoothly .
That 's why this deal will take a while to sink in .
We should add that neither party has confirmed the acquisition at this point : we 're waiting for confirmation from Photobucket .
In the meantime , let us know your thoughts on a Photobucket - MySpace hookup in the poll ( and yes , we know that the price will ultimately decide whether a buy is worth it ) :
Did you know Facts about Globalization and the Information Age ?
Or ... is it ?
The data PlayOn has assembled from World of Warcraft challenges many of these assumptions .
Could it be that a less , not more , social environment contributed to WoW ’s success ?
Read on for more .
The " social factor " is often advanced to explain the popularity of MMOs : " it ’s the people that are addictive , not the game . "
And indeed , social networks are essential components of the online gaming experience .
Game designers build " virtual third places " to encourage interactions .
Quality time in a MMO is time spent with others , be it raiding a dungeon in a group , socializing with bystanders in a cantina , or chatting with remote guildmates while exploring the wilderness on your own .
For the past 8 months , we have been collecting and analyzing data from WoW .
We use " bots " on 5 different servers ( covering PvP , PvE and RP realms ) and take snapshots of the population every 10 minutes or so ( more detail here ) , capturing data about each present character 's level , location , grouped status , and guild affiliation ( among other things ) .
So far , we have observed about 150,000 unique characters .
While this data is far from perfect ( after all , we are only getting what Blizzard is willing to let transpire through their API ) , it can still yield a surprising amount of insight into the social dimensions of multiplayer games .
We have tried to assess the prevalence of social activities in WoW using a variety of metrics .
The most obvious is the time players spend in groups .
In the early stages of the game ( level 40 and below ) , it hovers at around 30 % .
Even if we assume players spend a fair amount of time crafting , selling goods on the auction house , etc. , it is hard to see these activities accounting for 70 % of the time spent in - game .
It is only at level 56 and above that players spend the majority of their time in groups ( probably raiding high - end instances ) .
Moreover , players favor " soloable " classes ( warriors , hunters ) that , by design , survive mob encounters better in solo play - the more social classes ( e.g. priests ) that require a group to work well are among the least favored .
Compounding the problem , and despite features like WoW ’s " group xp bonus " , grouping is an inefficient way to level , which naturally steers the more " hardcore " players away from groups ( at least , in the early stages of the game ) .
Overall , this data indicates that instrumental group play in the context of quests might not be an important source of social interactions in WoW .
How about guilds ?
Excluding level 1 characters , 62 % of WoW ’s players are in guilds .
Interestingly however , 17.5 % of them belong to a " one- person guild " - in other words , nothing more than a custom tag below their name ( which , incidentally , says volume about the trouble players are willing to go through to customize their avatars ) .
That leaves only 44.5 % of players in guilds with at least 2 members .
Moreover WoW ’s guilds are fairly small ( median size : 9 ) and very few grow beyond 35 members ( 90th percentile ) - a kind of Dunbar Number for guilds .
More importantly , guilds are also very sparse social networks .
Our analyses indicate that the average guild member in WoW spends little time with a large majority of his / her guildmates .
Over a month , the average guild member is online 20 minutes or less with 80 % of his / her guildmates .
The same average member collaborates ( in quests , etc. ) with only 11 % of his / her guildmates for more than 10 minutes over the same month .
In other words , most guilds in WoW are not highly social and / or collaborative environments .
Considering all this , it is easy to wonder why WoW ’s players spend so much time ( more than 10 hours per week ) in this game instead of a single - player RPG !
To me , WoW illustrates how a large number ( the majority ? ) of online gamers enjoy being " alone together . "
The social factor at work here clearly has little to do with direct interactions and camaraderie in the context of quest groups or guilds .
Instead , it looks as if other players are mostly :
An audience ( to showcase your latest " elite " gear and other accomplishments ) .
A social presence ( the constant flow of chat in the wide - reaching " general " channel , the movement of other avatars around you , make playing WoW somewhat analogous to reading a book in a densely populated café - while you may not necessarily choose to interact with the other patrons , the sense of being in a public social space can be attractive enough to conduct individual activities there ) .
A source of spectacle and entertainment ( " people watching " is fun in WoW , in part because Blizzard encouraged it by design with many humorous objects that can be appropriated by the players - the gnomes ’ various trinkets with unpredictable effects , the infamous 20 - lb catfish that can be used as a weapon , etc ) .
Does this mean that , to reach WoW 's scale and attract gamers as - yet unfamiliar with the genre , future MMOs should focus less on collaborative questing and other traditional techniques to encourage interactions , favoring instead " looser , " more indirect forms of social experience ?
A " society of the spectacle , " to use Guy Debord 's terminology ?
Or are there alternatives ?
( P.S. : an expanded version of this analysis will appear in a CHI 2006 paper I 'd be happy to send to interested readers ) .
Mr Gonzales denied knowing specific details of the firings
Mr Gonzales " accepted responsibility " for the way eight US attorneys were fired , but denied personal involvement .
Congress has been investigating whether the firing of the prosecutors - nearly one in 10 nationwide - was politically motivated .
Some have called it a purge .
Mr Gonzales 's top aide resigned on Monday as the scandal gathered steam .
Charles Schumer , the number - three Democrat in the Senate , said Mr Gonzales himself should resign .
He condemned Mr Gonzales 's statement that he had not been personally involved in the firings : " To say that decisions were delegated ... that is a sorry excuse . "
He said the firings had " shaken the integrity of the US attorneys ' offices to the core " .
White House involvement
Mr Gonzales said his chief of staff Kyle Sampson had been in charge of the process .
Mr Sampson handed in his resignation on Monday night .
US ATTORNEYS 93 nationwide Serve at the discretion of the president , with the advice and consent of the Senate Prosecute criminal cases brought by the government Prosecute or defend civil cases in which the government is a party Collect debts owed to the government Source : US Department of Justice
That appeared to confirm a report in the Washington Post newspaper that President George W Bush 's former counsel , Harriet Miers , suggested the idea to the justice department .
Mr Gonzales said he rejected the idea as impractical : " I felt that was a bad idea and that was disruptive . "
But , he said , the suggestion led to an evaluation of which attorneys were " strong performers " and which were not , and ultimately to the dismissal of eight .
Critics - including some of the former prosecutors themselves - say they were fired for political reasons or to make way for cronies of the administration to take their place .
Judiciary committees in both chambers of Congress are expected to deepen their inquiries into the dismissals of the prosecutors .
Mr Gonzales said he was aware in general terms of what was happening but never saw documents or participated in discussions about the firings .
BBC did not know of 9/11 film 's link to religious right
The BBC broadcast a controversial docu- drama , The Path to 9/11 , this week without realising that it had been made by a member of the US religious right .
The three - hour programme , shown over two nights on BBC2 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the attack on the twin towers , was purchased from ABC , a subsidiary of Disney .
At the last minute the US television company was forced to re-edit sequences after claims of distortion from former president Bill Clinton and members of his administration .
A BBC spokesman said the organisation did not vet film - makers on their political or religious beliefs .
The film 's director , David Cunningham , is active in Youth With a Mission ( Ywam ) , a fundamentalist evangelical organisation founded by his father , Loren Cunningham .
According to its publications , the group believes in demonic possession , spiritual healing and conservative sexual morality .
Last month David Cunningham addressed a conference in England organised by the group at its UK headquarters in Harpenden , Hertfordshire , on the making of the film .
His talk was entitled Christ - like Witness in the Film Industry .
According to one of the group 's publications , " David and his wife Judy are the nucleus of an association of more than 40 Ywam alumni who are called to the communications industry in the Los Angeles area ... to create an independent film company whereby he could both influence the Hollywood film industry and produce major motion pictures that would carry a Biblical , values - based message " .
Speaking from the Harpenden HQ , where would - be " disciples " pay more than £ 2,000 for six - month courses , the missionary organisation 's international chair , Lynn Green , said that Mr Cunningham 's influence in the film was limited .
" He was hired by Disney to direct .
He was not the screenwriter " .
But in the US , protesting Democrats have seized on the involvement of the religious right in the project to allege a political plot to blame Mr Clinton for the triumph of Osama bin Laden .
One original fictionalised sequence depicted Mr Clinton 's national security adviser , Sandy Berger , refusing permission in 1998 for the CIA to capture Bin Laden .
Another showed Mr Clinton distracted by his affair with Monica Lewinsky .
In a letter to ABC demanding changes , Mr Clinton said : " The content of this drama is factually and incontrovertibly inaccurate . "
His colleagues said it was " rightwing political propaganda " .
ABC originally gave the impression the film was a historical reconstruction of the official 9/11 commission report , saying the film " uses this historic document as the basis for a powerful story " .
But yesterday , the BBC said it had warned at the start of the programme : " The movie is not a documentary .
For dramatic and narrative purposes , the movie contains fictionalised scenes . "
The film , as eventually transmitted , had been politically even - handed , the corporation said .
It drew a relatively modest audience of up to 2.8 m , but was seen in the US by 13 m viewers .
Conceptual artist Jonathon Keats has created the world 's first silent ringtone , a bootleg of John Cage 's famous piano piece that contains four minutes and 33 seconds of silence .
Cage performed 4'33 " live before an audience in 1952 .
But , says Keats , Cage was limited by the technologies available at the time .
His silence was n't perfect because it was n't digital – nor could it be freely distributed via sound files .
So Keats wrote " My Cage , " a 4:33 minute ringtone of pure , unadulterated silence .
You can get it for free from Start Mobile , a ringtone distributor , and Keats urges people to remix and mashup his ringtone as much as they wish .
From the ringtone ad :
A remastering , " My Cage " is also a remix , introducing serendipity into the equation , delivering performances unpredictably , whenever calls come unexpectedly .
The silence may take place without the listener being aware of it .
Or the listener may hear a call - phantom silence - when there 's no one on the line .
" My Cage " all - encompassing :
Even those who do n't use it as a ringtone have the potential to experience it , in the silence of an unanswered call .
Note :
To fully enjoy this work , and to give callers the opportunity to enjoy the complete silence as well , it is recommended that you turn off your voicemail .
I just downloaded " My Cage , " and I 've already had the pleasure of hearing beautiful silence instead of the midi version of the Star Trek : TNG theme that usually bursts from my little Treo 650 when somebody calls .
The composition is so compelling that I 've been hearing it in my head all day .
Highly recommended !
" My Cage " [ via Jonathon Keats ]
People keep asking me to blog about global warming .
I have so far avoided the topic for four reasons :
1 . My profound ignorance on the topic .
2 . My inability to evaluate the claims on both sides .
3 . My preference of not being scared shitless about drowning .
4 . My observation that scary predictions about the future rarely happen .
This is one of the many , many cases where ignorance has utility .
I ca n’t do much to stop global warming , but I can do plenty to ignore it and not worry myself into a coma before I drown in melted glacier water .
Anyway , recently I got dragged into the debate by a comment left by reader Bruce Harrison .
He objected to a prior post in which I noted our President was ignoring the consensus of scientists on the question of global warming .
I called this sort of behavior stupid .
Bruce countered by calling me arrogant and ignorant .
So far , his opinion was spot on , so I figured it was worth seeing what else he had to say .
This led me down a path of random , unreliable fact - gathering that I like to call “ research . ”
As I already noted , I ’m not qualified to evaluate the science behind global warming .
The best I can do is to evaluate the media reports of that science .
Here ’s the path my “ research ” took me .
In round one , I accepted the majority opinion of leading scientists , that global warming is happening , and that a big cause of that warming is all the frickin’ people and their energy - gobbling ways .
A good representation of all those scientists is here on Wikipedia .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change
But where are the dissenters ?
Bruce Harrison pointed me to this web site where thousands of scientists signed a petition saying global warming is not caused by people .
http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p357.htm
Hmmm .
That seems like a body blow to the idea that the science of global warming is settled .
Then I noticed a follow - up comment on this blog by reader rokusan , who pointed to a web story about how the petition by the dissenters is not credible .
http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Oregon_Institute_of_Science_and_Medicine
At this point in my “ research ” I was back to thinking the majority of scientists are probably right .
You can find dissenters for any view .
You can even find thousands of them if you put some effort into it .
So I discounted the petition by the dissenters .
Then I looked at the next link provided by Bruce .
It ’s for a video called " The Great Global Warming Swindle . "
I figured this would be good for a laugh , kind of like a creationist museum with cowboys riding dinosaurs .
It ’s a long video , so I ’ll summarize it after showing this link .
http://www.ksfo.com/goout.asp?u=http://leaningstraightup.com/2007/03/11/the-global-warming-swindle-video/.
The gist of the video is that Al Gore and the scientists got the cause - and - effect thing backwards .
There is a strong correlation between carbon dioxide levels and temperatures throughout history , but temperature increases come first by hundreds of years .
Warmer weather heats the oceans and produces more carbon dioxide .
So what causes the extra heat ?
According to the experts on the video , the data says it ’s clearly the sun .
When the sun has extended periods with lots of sun spots , it raises the temperature on Earth a bit .
That warms the oceans , which releases more carbon dioxide .
According to the video , the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by humans is miniscule , and our industrialization does n’t even correlate with changes in Earth ’s temperatures .
In summary :
Sun = huge hot thing that keeps fucking with us
SUV = drive all you want
As I ’ve noted , and will continue to note , I ’m not qualified to judge the science of global warming .
But if you ask me to judge the persuasiveness of competing media accounts , I ’d say the argument against people causing global warming is the strongest .
The video also does a surprisingly good job of explaining why the majority of scientists are politically and financially motivated to get the science of global warming wrong .
I ca n’t judge the accuracy of that assertion , but the video is exceptional in its persuasiveness .
I expect the comments to this post to include convincing evidence that global warming is caused by people .
If you plan to do that , watch the video first .
It probably addresses most of your points .
Go .
[ Update :
It took about ten minutes for reader Chris Graham to post this link debunking the video " The Great Global Warming Swindle . " :
http://www.durangobill.com/Swindle_Swindle.html.
Obviously I am unqualified to judge either the video or the debunking to it , but the last thing I read alway seems the most persasive . ]
“ And while certainly we would welcome any statements of support for Iraq ’s government and democracy , and any pledges to act in a responsible way that does not interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq , ’’ he said , “ we certainly want to make sure that any statements made were followed up by real concrete actions to address some of the concerns that are out there . ’’
Mr. Maliki said today that the American accusations of Iranian interference in Iraq will not affect economic deals that have already been signed between the two countries .
“ All the political , security and economic accords that have been signed with the Islamic republic ’s officials will be carried out , ” he said .
Mr. Maliki is leading a large delegation that includes Mowaffak al - Rubaie , the Iraqi national security adviser , who is close to some Iranian officials .
The Iraqis are scheduled to meet on Wednesday with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Iranian supreme leader , and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a powerful former president .
Mr. Maliki ’s predecessor , Ibrahim al - Jaafari , visited Iran in July 2005 .
In the southern Iraqi city of Najaf , another Shiite leader close to Iran , Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , defended his decision last week to ask Parliament to endorse a mechanism allowing Iraqi provinces to form autonomous regions .
Mr. Hakim ’s move has roiled Iraqi politics , spurring the legislators who answer to Moktada al - Sadr , the radical Shiite cleric , to unite with the Parliament ’s main Sunni Arab and secular blocs to try to sink Mr. Hakim ’s plan .
The Sunni Arabs are especially opposed to the idea of regional autonomy , called federalism in the Iraqi Constitution , because their provinces lack oil resources .
“ We think that federalism is one of the administrative ways that helps to secure our rights , remove oppression and prevent sectarian discrimination among people of one country and one belief , ” Mr. Hakim said .
In Anbar Province , the western region that is home to the Sunni-led insurgency , the American commander of forces in the area said he agreed with a classified intelligence assessment filed last month by a colonel that said Anbar was in a precarious state and could continue to deteriorate .
WHEN I WAS VERY SMALL , my dad could always tell when I was lying .
When I was about six years old , he told me God whispered it to him .
Even though the guy never went to church or seemed particularly religious , I had to respect that .
He had an in with God .
I wanted to hear it .
I figured if I knew when it happened , the precise moment , I 'd hear the voice of God , too .
I decided to watch my dad 's eyes for a sign -- some twitch of recognition , some little break in his concentration , anything -- that would tell me when he was hearing the voice of God .
I told him easy lies , the ones I always told him : that my brother did it , or that my neighbor , a little asshole named Charlie Iker , made me do it -- broke the vase , left the gate unlatched , cracked the storm window .
At first I did n't even want to blink , for fear I 'd miss the moment when God spoke .
But the truth is , I got nothing .
No sign .
Bubkes .
In fact , the more I looked at his eyes , the more I began to realize that my dad had no idea that I was lying .
None .
He looked straight back at me , waiting to hear the next thing I would tell him .
In fact , he was hanging on my words .
There was no voice of God .
My father was n't listening to anyone but me .
He had no idea when I was lying , especially if I stared him down the whole time .
The trick , I soon realized , was simply to look him in the eye as I spoke .
So it was that I became an atheist and a proficient liar in one fell swoop .
Such were my salad days .
A PERSON'S GAZE has weight , resistance , muscularity .
Clearly , there are people who use their eyes well .
You know them : the sales rep , the fundraiser , the tyrannical supervisor .
Their eyes force the question .
These people may be as dumb as streetlamps , but they are an undeniable presence in the room .
They know they must be dealt with .
You know it , too .
It is a very particular skill set .
The eye - contact specialist is like the one guy in the game of pickup basketball who knows only how to box out for a rebound .
Relentless and a little annoying , he uses his skill , presses his opponents with the fundamentals .
It may not work every trip down the court , but eventually things bounce his way .
Over time , this habit -- establishing and maintaining eye contact -- creates favorable situations and produces results .
The eye - contact specialist gets talked to first , dealt with most promptly , and responded to most thoroughly .
He 's always first in line for a reason .
And for the one who 's being looked at , eye contact sends a message , signaling acknowledgment , connection , and attention , signaling something , I suppose , like empathy .
Being seen is , on some level , being felt .
It 's nice to be acknowledged .
Even so , why does eye contact , wielded freely , always feel like a weapon to me ?
Why do I want to smack people who stare at me deeply while I 'm talking about mixed drinks or V - 6 engines , about the names of banks or the price of a gallon of gasoline ?
Maybe the true signal is less subtle , less friendly than " I 'm paying attention to you . "
Whether he admits it or not , that person is participating in one very large bet that you will blink first .
That guy , the one who 's looking at you -- straight at you , right into you -- is getting something that you are not .
It 's called the upper hand .
Well , that 's my preferred hand .
So I did my thing .
For four weeks I tried to use eye contact to get what I wanted , with real abandon .
It was no small trick .
By nature , my eyes drift .
I tend to look past people when I talk .
I look out the window , examine the horizon .
I 'm sure this has cost me connection with some people who take it as a sign of being evasive or shifty .
When I paid attention to it , I found that my tendency was to click in , lock eyes for a second or less , then look upward or outward into the distance .
It 's just not my rhythm to stare .
That was the first lesson : Eye contact is not the same as staring .
People do n't like the dumb indifference of a stare .
My first attempts at maintaining eye contact were so self - conscious that I took to picking a point on the person 's face -- as close to the eyes as possible -- and gazing at it as calmly as possible .
That was a disaster .
I was n't looking at people so much as I was at a blemish they happened to know very well .
If I stared at a point , say , between someone 's eyes or at a mole just above an eyebrow , people knew it right away .
I did this at a Smoothie King at the airport , and the girl behind the counter stood it for about seven seconds before she asked me , " What are you looking at ? "
She ran her finger along her eyebrow .
She scooped my immune booster in a tizzy .
So I tried to concentrate on eyelashes , but this made my own eyes jump as I talked .
My head bobbed , too , and I was hit with a sense of motion sickness .
Women constantly excused themselves after talking to me to check their faces in the mirror .
I was forced to apologize , telling them that I was just spacing out , not paying attention -- the direct opposite of what I was hoping to convey in the first place .
It was as if I had become a mirror in which people saw their own tiny imperfections , magnified by my glance .
Both parties in a conversation are caught almost constantly in the true focus and precise direction of a glance .
I had to go for the eyes .
There is no faking it .
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN people in my life who were good at using their eyes .
My tenth - grade English teacher .
My shift boss at a Mexican restaurant back in 1986 .
My friend the newspaper reporter .
My accountant .
My girlfriend .
I do n't know if I trusted each of these people because they looked straight at me or if they looked straight at me because I trusted them .
Yet each could lock and hold my glance for minutes at a time , while I was feeling sick after fifteen seconds .
What exactly did they see ?
How did they do it ?
It was clear that the idea of eye contact is not simply to point your eyes in a given direction .
You have to use your eyes .
I had to have a move .
I sucked it up and started to lock in on the pupils .
It took some doing , but I found I could make myself relax and hold the glance if I simply stopped working to figure out what the other person was thinking .
I had to force myself to stop reading every twitch , every sideways glance , every brush of the hair .
I had to stop treating the world like a poker game , in which every movement might be a tell .
When I walked in the door , when I stuck out my hand , when I said " How are you ? "
I turned my gaze toward the pupil of the person 's eye .
It really was a process of searching it out , looking at the black of the eye only , holding my glance there , and waiting until the eye color registered in my periphery .
It worked , too .
Women held my glance longer ; men moved faster .
This worked with waitresses .
With clerks at hotel desks .
It worked with bartenders .
Even with cabdrivers , whom I looked at in their rearview mirrors .
I began to gain better control over these transactions by searching out their eyes .
It took only a few seconds , but I could plainly see what they were looking for .
Here is what I saw :
No matter how much attention they appeared to be giving me , no matter how slowly they spoke or how long they paused after greeting me , it was evident that these people were initially treating me like every other schmoe who walked in off the street -- trying to figure me out and see how fast they could get me what I wanted before moving on .
The eye contact changed all that .
I 'd compare it to using a Sawzall for the first time , that moment you realize you could cut through pretty much any wall in the world if you had the right blade .
With my eyes , I calmed them , slowed them down , and did so without knocking them over or humiliating them .
I used my eyes to upset the speed and indifference of their routines and simply register my presence by asking them to do a double take .
It worked every time .
They did n't know me , but then , suddenly , it seemed they did .
I thought of it as a kind of dominance , holding them in the kind of invisible grip you might have once seen employed by a villain in a DC comic .
I got discounts I did n't deserve , a room facing the water .
I was warned off the calamari and onto the crab cake .
The desk clerk perked up when I arrived at the hotel and stood up straighter when I checked out .
I tried it with people who knew me well , too , people who see me all the time .
The Indian guy at the local gas station .
The woman I 've worked with for seven years .
A guy I play cards with on weekends .
In each case , upon greeting them , I 'd search out their pupils and hold my eyes on theirs for a minimum of three beats .
Just as with people I did n't know , time seemed to slow down and routine moments became unpredictable .
Not just because three beats is an eternity when you have nothing to say except " What 's happening ? " but because it meant they had to look at me at least once , and often two or three times , before they spoke .
While I may suck at eye contact naturally , there are people who are worse , much worse , in every ring of my life .
The more I practiced , the more hapless they seemed .
It 's the law of dominance , I think , that the more dominant you become , the more you want to stay dominant .
I found I liked backing people down .
I began to look at them long enough that I began to sense when they were about to look away .
The truth is , instead of them seeing me , it ended up that I could really see them .
They were just like I was , a little afraid of eye contact , a little leery of connection .
I meant well , so I pressed on .
People gave me apologies I did n't ask for .
They invited me to lunch .
Sometimes I pushed it too far .
The gas - station guy , so used to staring out his windows at the world passing by , was alarmed by my glance after four beats .
" Yes ? " he said .
" Yes ? "
And I held my gaze , because I had nothing to lose .
He reached under the counter , and I thought for a moment that he was pulling out a gun .
But he pulled out a pack of Marlboro Reds .
" Here , " he said .
" Take one .
You may have one , of course . "
I took one , too , just for good measure .
It seemed a small sort of bullying .
I could do far worse with my eyes .
Anyone can .
The tool can always become the weapon .
WITH ANY GESTURE of influence , the danger lies in not knowing what you are after .
I fell into an easy routine after several weeks of making eye contact .
One afternoon , while negotiating the price of an antique gold watch I was buying for my son's birthday , I was staring into the eyes of a jeweler , trying to figure out what color his eyes were , when he suddenly dropped the price by $ 75 , to $ 200 .
I 'd been threatening him somehow and had n't known it .
I did n't break away .
I did n't look down .
While I had n't expected as much , now I had to see where I could go from there .
His eyes jumped back and forth , from the counter to the watch to me , then back again , in reverse .
His eyes were green , I decided .
Green .
" Two hundred , " I said .
" Flat price .
No tax , right ? "
He nodded and looked back at me then , long and hard .
We were in agreement , though neither of us said a thing .
My eyes are brown .
How to Win A STARING CONTEST
EYEBALLING SOMEONE into total submission may not be the most effective communication strategy , but it sure can come in handy in a barroom staring contest .
In the interest of preserving your manhood , we asked Kelly Nichols , a dry - eye expert at Ohio State , and Jim Sheedy , dean of optometry at Oregon 's Pacific University , for the best ways to hold off blinking .
Typically people blink twelve to fifteen times per minute , but with these tips , Nichols says you may be able to go open - eyed for more than two minutes .
Your opponent will never know what hit him .
-- PETER MARTIN
MASSAGE YOUR EYELIDS .
Just before the contest , rub the part that 's right behind your lashes .
You 'll push out lubricating oil , which keeps your eyes from drying out .
PUT A WINDOW AT YOUR BACK .
Bright light and glare will bother your opponent .
FIXATE ON SOMETHING .
Pick an eyelash or mole near his eye and focus on it .
This will distract your mind and minimize your eye movement , which can trigger a blink .
WEAR GLASSES .
They 'll block blink - inducing air currents .
CONSUME FISH OIL .
If you have time to prepare , stock up on omega - 3 fatty acids , which may increase the lubricant in your tears .
BUY YOUR OPPONENT A DRINK .
His eyes will be drier after a few beers .
So encourage his alcoholism .
THE RULES :
If you want your contest sanctioned by the National Association of Staredown Professionals -- and who would n't ?-- heed these regulations :
>>
Competitors must stand one foot apart , toe to toe .
>>
Movement of any part of the face other than the eyes is strictly forbidden .
>>
Smiling or laughing is cause for immediate disqualification .
So is talking , sneezing , coughing , or burping . >>
No sunglasses , safety goggles , surgical masks , headbands , or face paint allowed .
>>
Eyedrops , eye moisturizer , and saline solution are considered banned substances .

Motorised transport is a form of time travel .
We mine the compressed time of other eras - the infinitesimal rain of plankton on the ocean floor , the settlement of trees in anoxic swamps - and use it to accelerate through our own .
Every tank of fuel contains thousands of years of accretions .
Our future depends on the expectation that the past will never be exhausted .
The energy white paper the government published last week talks of new taxes , new markets , new research , new incentives .
Anyone reading the chapter on transport would be forgiven for believing that the government has the problem under control : as a result of its measures , we are likely to see a great reduction in our use of geological time .
Buried in another chapter , however , and so far missed by all journalists , there is a remarkable admission : " The majority ( 66 % ) of UK oil demand is derived from demand for transport fuels which is expected to increase modestly over the medium term . "
To increase ?
If the government is implementing all the exciting measures the transport chapter contains , how on earth could our use of fuel increase ?
You wo n't find the answer in the white paper .
It mysteriously forgets to mention that the government intends to build another 2,500 miles of trunk roads and to double the capacity of our airports by 2030 .
Partly to permit this growth in transport , another white paper , also published last week , proposes a massive deregulation of planning law .
There is no discussion in either paper of the implications of these programmes for energy use or climate change .
There are plainly two governments of the United Kingdom , one determined to reduce our consumption of fossil fuel , the other determined to raise it .
What happens beyond the medium term is anyone 's guess .
But it should be pretty obvious that more roads and more airports will mean that our rising use of transport fuel becomes hardwired - the future health of the economy will depend on it .
So the government must have examined this question .
If our economic lives depend on continued growth in the consumption of transport fuels , it must first have determined that such growth is possible .
Must n't it ?
Last week I phoned four government departments - trade and industry , transport , environment , communities and local government - in the hope of finding this assessment .
But it does not exist .
No report has ever been commissioned by the British government on the issue of whether or not there is enough oil to sustain its transport programme .
Instead , both the white paper and the civil servants I spoke to referred me to a book published by the International Energy Agency , set up by the OECD after the 1974 oil crisis .
This in itself is odd .
On every other issue that might affect the UK 's security or economic growth , the government conducts its own assessments .
But in this case it relies exclusively on one external source .
This reliance seems even odder when you read the IEA 's book and discover that it 's as polemical as my columns .
Before it presents any evidence , the book dismisses people who have questioned future oil supplies as " doomsayers " .
It announces that it has " long maintained that none of this [ the possibility that oil supplies might be reaching a peak ] is a cause for concern " .
Though it expects the global demand for oil to rise by 70 % between now and 2030 , and though it anticipates that output from the world 's existing oilfields will decline by about 5 % a year , it is confident that new supplies will make up the difference .
It bases this assessment on the finding that " the level of remaining reserves of oil has been remarkably constant historically , in spite of the volumes extracted each successive year " .
As the IEA must know as well as anyone else , this is partly because the level has been forged by members of Opec , the oil producers ' cartel .
The quota assigned to a member of Opec reflects the size of its reserves .
All members have a powerful interest in exaggerating their reserves in order to boost their quotas .
The IEA admits in another report that Saudi Arabia has posted a constant level of reserves ( 260 bn barrels ) over the past 15 years , despite the fact that it has produced over 100bn barrels in the same period .
Where has the magic oil come from ?
But it is the liars of Opec on whom the agency 's optimism relies .
The growth in global demand will be met , it says , by a 150 % increase in oil production from the Middle East by 2030 .
What if this oil does n't materialise ?
It is a question the IEA raises then rapidly drops .
" Because of the uncertainties over the respective amounts of resources and reserves , it is difficult to predict the moment of peak oil , when production might be expected to start to decline .
Estimates range from today to 2050 or beyond . "
Is n't that reassuring ?
I should point out that peak oil is not like climate change .
There is no consensus among scientists about when it is likely to happen .
I cannot state with confidence that the IEA 's assessment is wrong .
But a report published in February by the US department of energy shows how dangerous it is to rely on a single source .
" Almost all forecasts are based on differing , often dramatically differing geological assumptions ...
Because of the large uncertainties , it is difficult to define an overriding geological basis for accepting or rejecting any of the forecasts . "
The report then publishes a long list of estimates by senior figures in and around the oil industry of a possible date for peak oil .
They vary greatly , but many are clustered between 2010 and 2020 .
Another report , also commissioned by the US department of energy , shows that " without timely mitigation , the economic , social , and political costs will be unprecedented " .
The disasters invoked by the peaking of global oil supplies can be avoided only with a " crash programme " beginning 20 years before it occurs .
If some of the estimates in the department of energy 's report are correct , it is already too late .
The IEA believes that this crisis will be averted by opening new fields and using non-conventional oil .
But these cause environmental disasters of their own .
Around half the new discoveries the agency expects during the next 25 years will take place in the Arctic or in the very deep sea , between 2,000 and 4,000 metres .
In either case , a major oil spill , in such slow and fragile ecosystems , would be catastrophic .
Mining non-conventional oil , such as the tar sands in Canada or the kerogen shales in the US , produces far more carbon dioxide than drilling for ordinary petroleum .
It also uses and pollutes great volumes of fresh water and wrecks thousands of acres of pristine land .
" In the long - term future , " the IEA says , " non-conventional , heavy oils may well become the norm rather than the exception . "
If our future growth relies on these resources , we commit ourselves to ever - growing environmental impacts .
We do n't need to invoke peak oil to produce an argument for cutting our use of transport fuel .
But you might have imagined that the government would have shown just a little curiosity about whether or not its transport programme will bring the economy crashing down .
Monbiot.com
Bats use echolocation ( biological sonar ) to navigate and to find prey .
This involves emitting ultrasonic waves which bounce off objects in the bat ’s environment .
The bat detects these reverberations , which are translated into an auditory image in its brain .
Whereas most species of bats emit the pulses of ultrasound from their mouths , some , such as the horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ) , do so from their noses .
This species has intricate , wrinkled protuberances , called noseleaves , around its nostrils .
It was widely believed that these structures are involved in echolocation , but , until now , exactly how was not clear .
Computational physicists Rolf Müller and Qiao Zhuang from Shandong University in Jinan , China have used three - dimensional X - ray scanning to generate a computer model ( below left ) of the horseshoe bat ’s noseleaves , and how they interact with the emitted ultrasound pulses .
They show that the structures are used to focus the emitted beams .
Here ’s the abstract to the paper in Physical Review Letters in which the findings are reported :
Horseshoe bats emit their ultrasonic biosonar pulses through nostrils surrounded by intricately shaped protuberances ( noseleaves ) .
While these noseleaves have been hypothesized to affect the sonar beam , their physical function has never been analyzed .
Using numerical methods , we show that conspicuous furrows in the noseleaf act as resonance cavities shaping the sonar beam .
This demonstrates that ( a ) animals can use resonances in external , half - open cavities to direct sound emissions , ( b ) structural detail in the faces of bats can have acoustic effects even if it is not adjacent to the emission sites , and ( c ) specializations in the biosonar system of horseshoe bats allow for differential processing of subbands of the pulse in the acoustic domain .
The pulses emitted by the horseshoe bat begin at a frequency of 60 kiloHertz ( kHz , thousands of cycles per second ) , then quickly increase to 80 kHz before dropping back down to 60 kHz towards the end of the pulse .
The computer model generated by Müller and Zhuang shows that two horizontal furrows in the noseleaves resonate strongly in response to , and enhance , the 60 kHz pulses which occur at the beginning and the end of the ultrasound beams emitted by the bat .
Essentially , the furrows , which are open - ended cavities , are “ beam - shaping devices ” .
The higher frequency beams emitted by the bat are focused in an oval - shaped spot directly ahead of the bat , whereas the lower frequency beams are focued into a wider spot , part of which is aimed above the bat ’s head .
When the grooves in the computer model were filled , the simulation showed that low frequency beams would instead be focused in the same way as higher frequency beams .
The noseleaves therefore cause different frequencies of sonar beams to be emitted in different spatial patterns , enabling the bat to put to best use the limited energy it has available for echolocation .
Müller speculates that these mechanisms enable the bat to simultaneously use echolocation for different tasks , such as navigating through a complex environment and detecting flying insects .
“ If you would like to think of the bat looking at the world with an ultrasonic flashlight , ” says Müller , the study suggests that the noseleaves produce “ an entire array of flashlights , each shining a spotlight of different size , shape , and position on its surroundings . ”
The findings open up new avenues of research into detailed analyses of how bats echolocate – all facial structures found in bats , says Müller , are now candidate beam - shaping devices – and could also lead to improvements in sonar and radio technology .

Feynman 's Interest in Spaghetti
Linus Pauling
====================
Benjamin J. Tilly Dec 26 1993 , 1:59 pm Newsgroups : sci.physics
Subject : Spaghetti ?
There was a problem mentioned on the NOVA program about Feynman which is why spaghetti breaks into three pieces when you snap it .
Feynman and a friend of his were not able to come up with a good answer despite several hours and a lot of broken spaghetti .
Well I began thinking about it and I have no real idea what the answer is either , but I have noticed that if I bend it slowly then it breaks in two * unequal * pieces instead of three .
So what I would guess is that it breaks in two unequal pieces and then the recoil of the longer piece snaps that in two .
Or it could have something to do with the position of the hands when you break it .
But I do not know .
So would anyone out there like to take a highspeed camera and some spaghetti and run some quick experiments ?
Any other theories out there ?

I was using the long spaghetti ( twice the length of ' normal ' spaghetti -- or about 2/3 meter instead of 1/3 meter ) .
When I held it at each end , it split into two pieces .
Then when I took one of those two pieces ( nearly the same size ) and broke it , it split into three pieces .
I could take some of the smaller pieces and break them -- either into two or three pieces .
It seems that the length of the spaghetti is important ...
I did n't get lots of data however , the sauce also had to be made ....

I would think about shockwaves being created at the first break up .
I bet if one measures the process you 'll find two peaks separated by a split of a second .
And they might have opposite signs also .
BTW : The equipment to use would be a camera , a flashlight and an acoustic sensor .

If you bend a single spaghetti , there are two points where the curvature is maximal , so it will break at one of them , thus removing the tension from the other one .
If you have a bundle , the ones broken e.g. at the right point are kept in place by the non -broken ones , so they still fell the tension at the left point and break there too .
Those who break only at one point will act as springs and eject the central pieces of the doubly - broken ones .

I thought this was not my experience , so I tested it , on six individual strands .
In each case the spaghetti broke first at the point of maximum curvature , creating a whiplash effect in each of the pieces , which broke again at least once , ejecting the pieces with some speed .
In no instance did I obtain less than four pieces , only twice did I obtain four pieces , and on one occaision there seemed to be seven pieces .
The experiment may depend on who is holding the ends of the spaghetti , and also the brand .

Well , now , this is interesting .
I always thought this odd - fracturing rule reflected some pretty deep topology .
I 'll have to check my fallible memory and report back , though .
Meanwhile , someone please get a bunch of identical paper soda straws .
Stand one on end and press until it buckles .
Repeat until you see a pattern .
I think you should almost always fractures into three pieces in zig - zag fashion , never two or four , but sometimes five pieces .
Next , try the same thing with single sphagetti strands .
If you are careful to press vertically , I 'd guess you get three piece fracturing .
Experimentalists , to your lab benches ! :-)

A while ago I wrote about how to select the first , minimum , maximum or least row per group in SQL .
This article shows how to solve this problem without subqueries .
Like many SQL problems , the key to understanding the solution is to rephrase the English question to make it easy to translate into SQL .
My first try
This is exactly the same problem as in my earlier article on how to select the first / least / max row per group in SQL .
The only difference is subqueries are disallowed .
I love finding ways to do things without subqueries , even if I do n’t have to .
My first article on this blog was about how to write subqueries in the FROM clause without using subqueries .
These tricks can occasionally be useful in very early versions of MySQL , which I still work with ( I recently completed a consulting job where the only database available is MySQL 3.23 ) .
My first thought on this problem was to use a mutex table , another blast from the past .
It would work , but it ’s not the best way to do it .
The solution
Let ’s say you have a table of people , and you want to find the youngest of each gender .
Here ’s the table :
age name gender 5 david m 8 john m 9 jane f 4 kelly f 11 mary f 13 kay f
The problem is easy if I rephrase it as “ find all people where there is no younger person of the same gender . ”
That ’s easy to write as a join and translate into an exclusion join :
Find all people — easy .
And for each person , find all younger people of the same gender — okay , join on gender and “ age less than . ”
Discard each row where there is a younger person — change the join to an exclusion join .
Here are the first two bullet points in SQL :
select young .* , younger .age from person as young left outer join person as younger on younger .
gender = young. gender and younger.age < young.age +------+-------+--------+------+ | age | name | gender | age | +------+-------+--------+------+ | 5 | david | m | NULL | | 8 | john | m | 5 | | 9 | jane | f | 4 | | 4 | kelly | f | NULL | | 11 | mary | f | 9 | | 11 | mary | f | 4 | | 13 | kay | f | 9 | | 13 | kay | f | 4 | | 13 | kay | f | 11 | +------+-------+--------+------+
Look at the rightmost column .
There are NULL s only in rows where there ’s no younger person of the same gender .
Now it ’s easy to “ cross out ” the other rows with the WHERE clause , and we ’re done :
select young .* from person as young left outer join person as younger on younger .
gender = young. gender and younger .age < young.age where younger . age is null ; +------+-------+--------+------+ | age | name | gender | age | +------+-------+--------+------+ | 5 | david | m | NULL | | 4 | kelly | f | NULL | +------+-------+--------+------+
How efficient is it ?
As long as you have appropriate indexes on the table , this might not be as inefficient as you ’d think .
It ’s theoretically a cross join , yes , but in reality if there ’s a good index it ’s only a repeated cross join on subsets of the data .
In other words , you need a ( gender , age ) index on this table .
Gender is n’t a very good example to use for this , because it will never be very selective , but if you only have a few rows per group and you have a leftmost index on the grouping column , it should work fine .
Conclusion
As with so many other SQL challenges , if you re-phrase the question , it ’s easy to select the maximum or minimum row per group without subqueries .
The key is to understand what you want , and to be able to word the problem in a way that translates from English to SQL .
“ We accept responsibility for those past misstatements and regret that they were made , ” the statement said .
The time period covered by the guilty pleas runs from late 1995 , when the Food and Drug Administration approved OxyContin for sale , to mid-2001 , when Purdue Pharma , faced with both public criticism and regulatory scrutiny , dropped its initial marketing claims for the drug .
Federal officials said that internal Purdue Pharma documents show that company officials recognized even before the drug was marketed that they would face stiff resistance from doctors who were concerned about the potential of a high - powered narcotic like OxyContin to be abused by patients or cause addiction .
As a result , company officials developed a fraudulent marketing campaign designed to promote OxyContin as a time - released drug that was less prone to such problems .
The crucial ingredient in OxyContin is oxycodone , a narcotic that has been used for many years .
But unlike other medications like Percocet that contain oxycodone along with other ingredients , OxyContin is pure oxycodone , with a large amount in each tablet because of the time - release design .
The drug has proven to be valuable in treating serious , long - lasting pain .
Purdue Pharma acknowledged in the court proceeding today that “ with the intent to defraud or mislead , ” it marketed and promoted OxyContin as a drug that was less addictive , less subject to abuse and less likely to cause other narcotic side effects than other pain medications .
For instance , when the painkiller was first approved , F.D.A. officials allowed Purdue Pharma to state that the time - release of a narcotic like OxyContin “ is believed to reduce ” its potential to be abused .
But according to federal officials , Purdue sales representatives falsely told doctors that the statement , rather than simply being a theory , meant that OxyContin had a lower potential for addiction or abuse than drugs like Percocet .
Among other things , company sales officials were allowed to draw their own fake scientific charts , which they then distributed to doctors , to support that misleading abuse - related claim , federal officials said .

The new study puts the Amazon at 6,800km
The Amazon is recognised as the world 's largest river by volume , but has generally been regarded as second in length to the River Nile .
The claim follows an expedition to Peru that is said to have established a new starting point further south .
It puts the Amazon at 6,800 km ( 4,250 miles ) compared to the Nile 's 6,695 km .
Mountain source
The precise length of a river is not easy to calculate and depends on correctly identifying the source and the mouth .
The new claim in Brazil follows an expedition by scientists which is said to have discovered a new source for the Amazon in the south of Peru and not the north of the country as had been thought for many years .
While the exact location has yet to be confirmed from two choices , scientists say either would make the river the longest in the world .
Guido Gelli , director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics , told the Brazilian network TV Globo that today it could already be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world .
The Amazon is now said to begin in an ice - covered mountain in southern Peru called Mismi .
Researchers travelled for 14 days , sometimes in freezing temperatures , to establish the location at an altitude of 5,000m .
The research was co-ordinated by the National Geographical Institute of Peru , with the help of their colleagues in Brazil .
There has been a healthy academic debate over the world 's longest river for some years and the claim from Brazil may not go unchallenged .
The average age of members of the U.S. Senate is older than it has ever been , according to Senate Historian Richard Baker .
For many senators , advanced age is starting to show , raising questions about their ability to govern .
Until his retirement last month , former majority leader Bill Frist , R - Tenn. , a noted heart surgeon , was being consulted for informal medical advice by two dozen of his colleagues -- more than 20 percent of the Senate , according to a former leadership aide .
They went to Frist complaining about a host of illnesses and chronic maladies , most related to aging .
Advertisement
Among them were Sen. Pete Domenici , R - N.M. , who flew on Frist 's jet for private consultation and treatment at the Frist Clinic in Nashville , according to Senate sources .
The average age of the 100 senators is 62 , up from 60 in the last Congress .
Among the new Democratic committee chairmen , it is 69 .
And , of the five longest - serving senators , three are there today .
Including the grand - daddy of seniority , Sen. Robert C. Byrd , D - W.Va. , 89 .
As far as illnesses , at least 10 senators have fought various cancers or suffered severe injuries .
Sen . Tim Johnson , D - S.D. , remains hospitalized here for a brain hemorrhage suffered last month .
And others deal with chronic and debilitating infirmities .
In the past , the clubby atmosphere of the Senate provided cover for its frailest members .
No longer .
Today , a senator 's smallest stumble , nap or memory lapse gets instant and widespread public exposure online through blogs and videos posted on YouTube and other social - networking Web sites .
( See related story . )
Few senators will talk publicly about their own health problems or those of their colleagues .
But many sought counsel from one of their own , Frist .
He offered informal and discreet medical advice to his colleagues and some spouses during his 12 - year tenure , a former Senate leadership aide said .
" You would be surprised by the people who sought his advice " on health - related issues , said the former aide .
" There was a steady flow of people in and out of the office . "
Frist declined to comment .
If the president appears in public wearing so much as a dime - sized bandage , the press demands , and usually gets , a detailed medical explanation from the White House .
No one questions the public 's right to know precisely and in full about the physical health and mental well - being of the commander in chief .
Closer to home , Americans routinely face the wrenching tasks of taking car keys away from elderly parents who can no longer drive safely , or delivering the necessary ( but unwelcome ) news that it 's time for an infirm parent to move into assisted care .
Yet suggestions that an enfeebled senator consider retirement have n't been broached , even considering the distressing example of the late Sen.
Strom Thurmond , R - S.C. , who spent the final year of his term , at age 100 , in and out of Walter Reed Army Medical Center here .
The issue is increasingly relevant today , considering the current Senate 's advanced age , particularly among its leaders .
Byrd , Edward M. Kennedy , D - Mass. , and Daniel Inouye , D - Hawaii -- Numbers 1 , 3 and 4 , respectively , among the longest - serving senators -- have been in the Senate more than 40 years each .
And each chairs an important committee at an age when most people are retired : Byrd holds the gavel at Appropriations , Kennedy , 74 , at Health , Education , Labor and Pensions , and Inouye , 82 , at Commerce , Science and Transportation .
" People do n't like to talk about age , " said Boston University history professor Julian E. Zelizer .
" It 's not a political taboo , but a cultural one .
We 're respectful of the elderly . "
To raise the issue in a political context , Zelizer continued , is even more fraught with difficulty because any discussion of the office - holding elderly portends a conversation about that which is even more awkward -- mortality .
The subject of death is especially acute in the Senate , " where individuals matter , " as Zelizer diplomatically put it .
The impact of a single senator 's health was underscored when Johnson , 60 , suffered a brain hemorrhage in mid-December .
He is recovering in a Washington hospital , and physicians have said it may take months .
This was big news , in part because of how suddenly a relatively young senator was stricken , but more importantly because of the potential political fallout .
Should Johnson be unable to complete his six - year term , which ends in January 2009 , South Dakota Gov. Mike Rounds , a Republican , would likely fill Johnson 's seat with a GOP appointee , thus taking control of the Senate out of Democratic hands .
Johnson is receiving several hours of speech and physical therapy a day , and his office has issued repeated statements that he is on the way to a full recovery .
Johnson has hired a strategist to help oversee his re-election effort next year , answering , at least for now , the question of whether he plans to run again .
( Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , appointed Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , to take over Johnson 's gavel at the ethics committee in Johnson 's absence . )
Johnson 's illness also reinforced the delicate topic of whether a senator is mentally fit to serve .
Such was the question when Thurmond finished his tenure .
After moving into Walter Reed following several hospitalizations , Thurmond stopped presiding over the Senate , and at committee hearings typically would only read verbatim remarks prepared by his staff .
On the floor , his fellow senators would " come pay homage " to their nonagenarian colleague as he sat waiting to vote , said Rutgers professor Ross K. Baker .
The Familiar Stranger : The Lady on the Subway
October 2 , 2006 at 1:15 pm
Urban living brings about an interesting phenomenon , one which Milgram calls the Familiar Stranger .
The Familiar Stranger is a person you see during your daily activities , but do n’t interact with : the gentleman at the bus stop , the babysitter at the park , or the lady on the subway .
But consider for a moment you saw the lady on the subway while traveling to Paris .
Can you imagine , it ’s likely you would practically become best friends in a day !
To be a familiar stranger , a person has to be
observed repeatedly for a certain time period without any interaction
Milgram notes ,
But it ’s a real relationship , in which both parties have agreed to mutually ignore each other , without any implication of hostility .
Students from a university in New York went to the commuter stations and interviewed commuters .
They found that on average , commuters knew 4 familiar strangers but had only talked to 1.5 individuals .
Commuters said they have a fantasy relationship with familiar strangers , trying to figure out what kind of lives they lead , what their jobs are , etc .
This phenomenon is explained as a response to the overload of inputs from the environment — perceptual processing takes considerably less time than social processing .
However , I think when you see someone you barely recognize from school a few years later at a department store , it feels like you ’re friends because you know each other relatively better than everyone else there .
Berkeley is doing a study called the Familiar Stranger Project , which is worth taking a look at .

This morning , driving in to work , I was treated to a royal charlie - foxtrot unlike I ’ve seen in a while .
In Orange County ( for those of you familiar with the area ) , the traffic signal at the corner of Moulton & El Toro malfunctioned .
This is a big intersection , 3 lanes of traffic in all 4 directions , but you ’d think that rational adults , entrusted with the responsibility of piloting multi- ton vehicles , would be able to navigate a situation like this .
But not really .
It was bedlam .
Cars determining which when and how to proceed based more on gut instinct than any sense of order .
Nobody having any idea when it was even correct for them to proceed , so the tentative drivers crawling across an intersection and slowing everyone down .
The whole process was completely unorganized , and ended up taking us far more time than it should .
Maybe more than just a few Californians would be of benefit attending this California dmv traffic school to brush up on road laws .
Now , some of you would suggest that this scene is an indictment of anarchy or small government .
After all , without the order imposed by traffic signals , would n’t this be occurring every day ?
But the answer is no .
I ’ve seen other parts of the country where traffic signals are n’t as reliable , where there are more stop signs in general , and where things like a protected left - turn - lane do n’t all have their own individual signals .
You ’d be surprised by just how often a left turn accident happens , they ’re one of the most prevalent out there .
Basically , these are places where drivers are not only trusted with the responsibility of piloting a vehicle , but they are given some additional ability to choose when it is and is not safe to proceed at a light .
Order does n’t have to be imposed by a traffic light .
Order can emerge from patterns of behavior , and eventually become so ingrained that if someone proceeds at a 4 - way stop at the “ wrong ” time , people wonder why he ’s such an idiot .
In fact , most of society works this way , not as a result of top - down government - imposed order .
However , when you have hand - held your citizens through every intersection in the metro area , and suddenly that order breaks down , they have n’t built up their own order and their own patterns of behavior , so it becomes every man for himself .
You treat drivers like children , and then wonder why they fall over when the training wheels break .
This is a microcosm of what we see in society .
When an area without much government interference undergoes a natural disaster , people step up and step in to help each other .
People are used to having societal systems in parallel to those provided by the government , so when a disaster comes that is beyond the scope of the government to handle , they do n’t fall apart .
Yet when you look at a place with heavy - handed government interference ( such as New Orleans ) , the failure of government and the evacuation of people who might otherwise step in to help cause society itself to break down .
Yet people use the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in order to argue for more government and against anarchy .
They ’re arguing that adult - age children , kept in dependence by the government , should suddenly start acting like responsible adults when government breaks down .
It just does n’t work that way .
The problem with government today is that it encourages dependence from cradle to grave .
That might be fine , if the government were able to deliver on their promises .
But government is unreliable , and when you encourage dependence , you should n’t act surprised when your subjects ca n’t act independently .
Speakers may be good when listening to music , watching movies , or playing games , but they do n’t have to look boring .

Fundamentally , OODBs are based around the idea that if OO is good development practice , it must be good data storage practice .
This concept is , well , flawed .
( That 's a charitable description , really . )
The problem is that OODBs tend to lock you into a single object model ( of your own devising , no less ) and the moment you discover that you need an alternate way of querying the data ( what do you * mean * you need to be able to summarize all of the sales of this item ?
I only have my data organized by customer ! ) , you 're screwed .
The number one thing forgotten by OODB and XMLDB enthusiasts is that the data is king .
Not the representation of the data , but the data itself .
Relational databases -- such as they are -- get this right .
There 's no One Right View to data , but there are ways of Relating data .
Mix the relations properly , and you can have many different views -- and the objects that can be pulled from them are just as complex .
http://qurl.com/lk792
( Joel on Software Forum ) shows some of the usual ignorance from OODB proponents , but there are some gems from the people who know better : I read an article a while back that made a good case against OODB's .
I can't remember where it came from , but the main point was this : Data outlives paradigms .
In other words , with a flat set of data to work with , you can always get it to work with whatever the programming flavor of the day is .
But when you stuff that same data into an object - oriented model , you 're stuck with that model , even when OOP has been replaced by the next big thing .
-" Chris " A year later , another discussion broke out : http://qurl.com/mbqsp
Two good points from that discussion : [...]
The " impedance mismatch " has been talked about since the early 80's , when OO first started appearing .
[.. ] OODB 's tend to fall into the " what is OO " trap ; they either try to be tightly coupled to a particular language [...] or they are so generic that they end up competing directly with RDBMS 's - and losing , since DB customers are enormously conservative [...] older database veterans know that many OODB 's are often just CODASYL [ network ] ... databases with many of the same problems and issues that hierarchical databases have always had .
Those who think there is some vast conspiracy to keep " better " OODB 's from winning are just silly and do n't know their history - DBMS's are the perfect example of how those who do n't know history are doomed to repeat it ... - x [ builds relational databases engines ] and :
You are making a fundamental mistake that will haunt future developers / enhancers of your system forever .
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS HEIRARCHAL DATA .
Heirarchies are a VIEW of data , from a very tight perspective .
Change your perspective and the model falls apart .
Organise your data according to a properly normalised relational model and you will have the flexiblity to grow and change as future needs might require .
- HeWhoMustBeConfused Again , this was raised in 2005 : http://qurl.com/w54vq
This one has someone who is a little more active about defending OODBs , but still makes a lot of the fundamental mistakes .
Finally , it 's always instructive to read Fabian Pascal or Chris Date : http://dbdebunk.com/

I worked in survey research at the university and often took at least one class for credit so I would have gym access and infirmary access and could live in student co-op housing .
One winter I lived in an informal housing arrangement .
We decided we would spend the winter with no heat .
Winter starts in Ann Arbor in November and runs until April .
At night the indoor temperatures would dip into the 30's .
Daytime , the temperatures would climb to the 50's .
We did n't use heating per se , but we did use electricity , using a stove and oven for cooking and turning on lights .
I wore a hat and light gloves around the house .
I made my own mittens out of old purses from a thrift store .
I was also making my own bread and grinding my own soybeans to make tofu .
I kept my costs low because I was paying off student loans .
I backed into computers as a way to make a living .
Originally I was computer - phobic .
By the early 90's I had worked my way up the computing chain from data entry to programming .
I was working on a data archive called the Inter - University Consortium for Political and Social Research , which had 450 members .
A colleague showed me the World Wide Web on an early Mosaic browser .
It was a religious experience being shown the Web for the first time .
I was so absorbed that I did n't get out of my chair from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. the next day .
I thought this was something special .
Not only could I be a user of this but I could create it myself .
Over the next year and a half I created a Web interface for the consortium 's archives so researchers at member institutions could access the data themselves .
I was 33 and had never made more than $ 15,000 a year .
That winter in Ann Arbor had been particularly bleak .
There were eight days when the temperature never rose above zero .
I sent out my résumé on the Internet , and all the responses I got were from Silicon Valley .
Some were offering air fare .
I had been to San Francisco once , when I was 15 .
I took a job just north of San Jose and moved out there not knowing a soul .
I had never owned a car .
In Ann Arbor I took my bike everyplace .
In California I took the bus , but there was very little provision for mass transit .
After two or three years I moved to San Francisco and still commuted two and a half hours each way .
The train let me off 12 miles from the office , and then I 'd take two buses .
Finally , during the dot - com boom , I got a job in San Francisco .
That company did n't have a very long life .
What most people know about the inheritance of eye color is that brown comes from a dominant gene ( needing one copy only ) and blue from a recessive gene ( needing two copies ) .
University of Queensland geneticist Rick Sturm suggests that the genetics are not so clear .
“ There is no single gene for eye color , ” he says , “ but the biggest effect is the OCA2 gene . ”
This gene , which controls the amount of melanin pigment produced , accounts for about 74 percent of the total variation in people ’s eye color .
Sturm has recently shown that the OCA2 gene itself is influenced by other genetic components .
After gene - typing about 3,000 people , Sturm found that how OCA2 is expressed — and how much pigment a person has — is strongly linked to three single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , or single letter variations , in a DNA sequence near the OCA2 gene .
That suggests a more complicated story than the blue - recessive / brown - dominant model of eye color .
“ For example , among individuals carrying the SNP sequence “ TGT ” at all three locations on both copies of the gene , 62 percent were blue - eyed , ” says Sturm ’s colleague David Duffy .
By contrast , only 21 percent of individuals carrying only one TGT copy at each location and 7.5 percent of those lacking the TGT entirely had blue eyes .
An Exploration of Physics
Is there really life after death or have people merely invented ghosts as a way to explain hallucinations in a way that provides hope for the continuation of existence beyond the grave ?
There are a few problems with the idea of ghosts as they ’ve been presented .
Often the evidence comes down to a few strange photographs or eyewitness accounts , although some paranormal investigators have used advanced technology to attempt the verification of hauntings .
This technology raises an important issue ; if technology can detect ghosts , then ghosts should be a part of the realm of science , that is to say they can be proven or disproven using the scientific method .
So here we will attempt to see how science can cast light on the issue of ghosts .
For starters , there is ghost photography .
There are thousands of supposed photographs of ghosts of floating around this world .
There ’s a major problems with these photographs , and that is photons .
As far as these photographs are concerned , there ’s a common assumption that the camera can capture things that the human eye just ca n’t see .
Of course , the human eye and the camera lens work exactly the same way ; they require photons to hit them and create chemical changes ; either in rods and cones or on a light - sensitive plate .
If ghosts were invisible they would either have to absorb all light or allow all light to pass through them .
If light could be reflected it would hit camera lenses and human eyes in exactly the same physical way .
Granted , there are parts of the light spectrum invisible to humans ( such as infrared or ultraviolet ) , but this would n’t explain how ghosts can show up on closed circuit security cameras , for instance , or digital cameras which are set to capture visible light .
So there could be ghost photographs , but only if ghosts are visible in the conventional way , that is , if they reflect light .
Another common occurrence in ghost reports is that the presence of a ghost , usually invisible in this case , creates a cold spot in a room , an area of lower heat .
Heat is created by molecular motion , in the case of atmospheric heat , by the Brownian motion of oxygen , nitrogen and argon atoms in the air .
For a ghost to affect the temperature of a space it must affect the motion of these atoms in the air .
By what means could a ghost or spirit impact the relative motion of atoms in the air ?
In the same line of reasoning ; by what means could a poltergeist manipulate the molecules of objects ?
Ghosts do seem to be affected by gravity .
The Earth is revolving around the Sun at a velocity of 18.5 miles per second .
Thus , within five seconds after death , a spirit should be almost a hundred miles from the place of its death .
After all , there is nothing tying us to this ball of rock we call a planet other than the attractive force of gravity .
Not only is the Earth revolving around the Sun , but the entire Solar System is revolving around the Galaxy .
If our spirits did survive after death , there should be a million mile trail of spirits following the Earth and Solar System through space .
After all , gravity creates attraction between masses .
Ghosts should n’t have mass or at least a strong enough mass to enable them to stick to the surface of the Earth .
If ghosts can pass through walls , they should n’t be able to adhere gravitationally to the planet ’s surface .
Ghosts could be compared to neutrinos , or even composed of neutrinos , which can pass through solid matter and yet have mass .
Of course neutrinos have so little mass that the effects of gravity are negligible .
Now , some would maintain that ghosts do not actually adhere to a planet surface via gravity but rather that a spirit can imprint itself on a physical object .
That would be why we find hauntings in particular places , such as houses .
Now every place or object is made of particles ; atoms , protons , electrons and neutrons .
In an atom protons and neutrons stick together via the strong nuclear force and electrons maintain their orbits via the electromagnetic force .
Neutrons and protons form an atomic nucleus and electrons orbit and interact with nearby electrons in chemical processes .
If a spirit could somehow imprint itself on a physical object , it would have to somehow imprint on the atoms themselves .
How could a spirit do this on what are essentially spinning spheres of energy ?
In what way could this information be stored and maintained ?
Maintenance is an interesting topic .
Entropy ensures that closed systems go from highly ordered to less ordered states .
In living organisms this does not apply because living organisms are not closed systems ; they are constantly metabolizing , taking in chemicals and releasing chemicals after modifications .
If a ghost or spirit is a closed system , it would quickly lose its energy .
It is often stated that the human mind is composed of energy and that since energy can neither be created nor destroyed that the human mind can thus never be destroyed .
This is not the case ; energy cannot be destroyed , but it can be transformed into less usable forms .
The energy from oil is transformed into mechanical energy in a car , but most of that is lost in an unusable form ; heat .
Ghosts should be losing energy constantly in order to maintain their information , i.e. the personality of the individual .
This energy should be detectable .
If ghosts are not closed systems , as would probably be necessary for their continued existence , then they must take in energy .
How would a ghost take in energy and how would a ghost transform that into a form that is capable of maintaining the information of personality ?
If a ghost were to take in energy , then most of that energy would be lost in the conversion and ghosts , like any open system , would radiate and hence be detectable .
All matter in the universe radiates energy due to chemical changes within the atoms and particles themselves .
This raises and important issue ; what exactly are ghosts , physically speaking ?
Paranormal researchers have coined terms like “ ectoplasm ” to describe the spiritual construct .
From properties described , it would seem that ghosts would most likely be composed of matter in a plasma state .
Usually matter in a plasma state , such as the hydrogen in our Sun , is found at incredibly high temperatures .
Perhaps there is some some sort unknown cold plasma forming our spirits .
Some would argue that ghosts and spirits are formed of energy , a spiritual energy , that we do not yet understand .
Of course , this could be true , science does not yet have all the answers , but as long as a phenomenon is detectable , recordable and verifiable under controlled conditions then it falls within the realm of science .
If ghosts are real then they are a part of our universe and a physical phenomenon .
In that case the scientific method will enable us to unravel the mystery .
If the existence of ghosts cannot be disproven then they are a religious phenomenon and outside the realm of science and human understanding .
Either way , we will never tire of ghosts both for their mystery and their ability to make us ponder the otherworldly .
Rush Limbaugh will say anything to attack anyone who challenges George Bush and his policies .
This time , his target is Michael J. Fox .
Meds are something Rush does have a little experience with .
Emailer Doug : Rush Limbaugh today accused Michael J. Fox , actor and Parkinson 's Disease victim , of deliberately going off of his meds to appear on camera with exaggerated symptoms of his disease for dramatic effect .
Fox appeared in a recent Clair McHaskill ( D - MO ) Senate campaign ad , touting the need for stem cell research .
Limbaugh even goes so far as to accuse
Fox of faking his symptoms all together .
Download -MP3
" I stated when I saw the ad , I was commenting to you about it , that he was either off the medication or he was acting .
He is an actor , after all . "
These emails claim
Fox has admitted in interviews that he goes off his medication . "
A tireless search of the Internet produces no such record of any interview , or any statement in which Fox has ever admitted or even suggested that he ever goes off his Parkinson 's treatment at all , let alone for the purposes of shaking it up for the television audience .
Despicable , just despicable .
Yes Doug , it is despicable .
Here 's the ad Limbaugh was talking about .
Dr. Daniel emails :
It 's official : record companies do n't like you .
After all that griping about signing up for the Zune music store -- and keep in mind that these record companies receive monies for selling songs here -- that resulted in Universal Music Group getting some sort of fat royalty check from Microsoft for Zune sales , not to mention whatever negotiations went on behind closed doors to come up with that ridiculously minimal " three days or three plays " sharing scheme , a couple of labels have once again gone out of their way to make life hard on you .
It appears Sony Music and Universal Music Group are marking certain artists of theirs as " prohibited " for sharing , meaning that just because you 've paid for a song , and even managed to find another Zune user on the planet Earth , does n't mean you 'll necessarily get to beam that JoJo track to another Zune via WiFi magics .
In a non-scientific sampling of popular artists by Zunerama and Zune Thoughts , it looks like it 's roughly 40 - 50 percent of artist that fall under this prohibited banner , and the worst news is that there 's no warning that a song might be unsharable until you actually try to send it and fail .
Oh well , maybe you can just hum a few bars or something -- just make sure the labels do n't hear you ![ Via ClicZune Read - Zunerama Read - Zune
Thoughts
People who write the E in a way that is legible to themselves but backwards to others have not thought or cared about how others might perceive the letter .
On the other hand , people who draw the E backward to them but legible to others have considered another 's point of view .
Your boss and other people in power often really have no idea what you and others feel and think , new experiments suggest .
Power is often defined as the capacity to get what you want or the ability to influence others .
" The powerful have a profound effect on others , and you would naturally hope they would be sensitive to other points of view , " said Adam Galinsky , a social psychologist at Northwestern University .
E-power
Galinsky 's team wanted to see whether having power changed how well people understood the viewpoints of others .
The researchers asked volunteers to recall personal incidents where either they had power over others or others had power over them .
Past studies have revealed that such recollections had exactly the same effects as actually placing people in positions of power or powerlessness , Galinsky said .
For instance , regardless of whether people were given power or simply remembered possessing it , they were more likely to assert themselves and take risks .
Galinsky and his colleagues at New York University and Stanford then asked 57 student volunteers to draw the letter E on their own foreheads .
More than a decade of experiments have shown that people who write the E in a way that is legible to themselves but backwards to others have not thought or cared about how others might perceive the letter .
On the other hand , people who draw the E backward to them but legible to others have considered another 's point of view .
Galinksy ’s study subjects who had recollected power were almost three times as likely to draw the E in a way that was backwards to others than those who recollected an experience of powerlessness [ image ] .
" This corroborates other studies that show when people have power , they are more likely to egocentrically focus on themselves , " Galinsky told LiveScience .
E is for empathy
In other experiments , Galinsky and his colleagues gave volunteers a standard test for empathy .
Students were shown faces expressing happiness , sadness , fear or anger and then asked what emotions they saw .
Those who had recollected being in power beforehand were more likely to misjudge expressions than volunteers who did not , suggesting they were less likely to understand how others felt .
Past studies also have found that people with power became less inhibited and were more likely to act on impulses , while those with less power were more concerned about risks and felt more vulnerable .
" Basically , these findings together paint powerful people as impulsive and oblivious , while the powerless are more cautious and worried , " Princeton University social psychologist Susan Fiske said in a telephone interview .
Fiske did not participate in the study , which is reported in the latest issue of the journal Psychological Science .
Taking charge
" There are good components to power 's effects on a person , in that it helps lead people to action , but sometimes these actions are misguided because the powerful have not taken other perspectives into account , " Galinsky said .
" It 's like having a gas pedal without a good steering wheel . "
Future research could look into situations where people both have power and are good at seeing other points of view .
" Leaders are more effective when they pay attention to other perspectives , " Fiske said .

Babies might seem a bit dim in their first six months of life , but researchers are getting smarter about what babies know , and the results are surprising .
The word " infant " comes from the Latin , meaning " unable to speak , " but babies are building the foundations for babbling and language before they are born , responding to muffled sounds that travel through amniotic fluid .
Soon after birth , infants are keen and sophisticated generalists , capable of seeing details in the world that are visible to some other animals but invisible to adults , older children and even slightly older infants .
Recently , scientists have learned the following :
At a few days old , infants can pick out their native tongue from a foreign one .
At 4 or 5 months , infants can lip read , matching faces on silent videos to " ee " and " ah " sounds .
Infants can recognize the consonants and vowels of all languages on Earth , and they can hear the difference between foreign language sounds that elude most adults .
Infants in their first six months can tell the difference between two monkey faces that an older person would say are identical , and they can match calls that monkeys make with pictures of their faces .
Infants are rhythm experts , capable of differentiating between the beats of their culture and another .
The latest finding , presented in the May 25 issue of the journal Science , is that infants just 4 months old can tell whether someone is speaking in their native tongue or not without any sound , just by watching a silent movie of their speech .
This ability disappears by the age of 8 months , however , unless the child grows up in a bilingual environment and therefore needs to use the skill .
In fact , all the skills outlined above decline somewhere around the time infants pass the 6 - month mark and learn to ignore information that bears little on their immediate environment .
Astounding babies
The new study involved showing videos to 36 infants of three bilingual French - English speakers reciting sentences .
After being trained to become comfortable with a speaker reciting a sentence in one language , babies ages 4 and 6 months spent more time looking at a speaker reciting a sentence in a different language — demonstrating that they could tell the difference .
" In everything that we do in our research , babies seem to come out with these amazing capabilities , " said Whitney M. Weikum , a graduate student at the University of British Columbia whose work is overseen by language processing specialist Janet F. Werker .
" As young infants , they come set with abilities to make a lot of fine discriminations , and they continue to astound us . "
The research also serves as a reminder that language is a multimedia experience , said psychologist George Hollich of Purdue University .
" We do n't just see a rose , " Hollich explained .
" We feel the softness of its petals and we smell its perfume .
Likewise , language is n't just hearing or seeing a word ' rose . '
We immediately relate that word to a rose 's sight , touch and smell , even the sight of a person saying that word .
Ben Franklin noted that he could ' understand French better by the help of his spectacles . '
This work shows that infants too can recognize some languages solely by looking on the face . "
Infant intelligence
Weikum 's study adds to mounting evidence showing how infants move from being " universal perceivers , " equally capable of learning any of the world 's languages , to being specialists in the sounds , meanings and structure of their own native tongue over the first year of life , said Hollich , who studies infant language .
The findings raise questions about what is meant by intelligence when speaking of young children .
" Newborns can be said to be ' intelligent ' in that they have the ability to almost effortlessly learn any of the world 's languages , " Hollich told LiveScience .
Some of Hollich 's research shows that babies start to understand grammar by the age of 15 months , processing grammar and words simultaneously .
" We scientists consider infants more intelligent when they begin to notice and respond to familiar things .
Of course , figuring out how exactly to best respond to familiar sights and sounds is something children will spend the rest of their lives learning to do and that is the hallmark of what most would consider true ' intelligence . ' "

The land in question is a high , rolling hillside , where California ’s Central Valley slopes into the Sierra foothills .
Many have been drawn here , and after the first stampede , for gold in 1849 , most left disappointed .
Then the land lay virtually empty for many years until , as the state capital grew , its emptiness became valuable .
In the late 1970s , as the local Chamber of Commerce tells it , a developer was traveling along U.S. Highway 50 when , 25 miles east of Sacramento , he looked up and had a vision .
Grand homes started to appear , followed by fine schools , lush golf courses , and a central shopping district modeled after a Tuscan village .
The entire hillside was transformed into a patchwork of gated communities , and over the past 15 years , El Dorado Hills , as developers dubbed the spot , has been one of the fastest - growing areas in California .
“ High per capita income along with low crime rates have attracted many new families to this vibrant and desirable destination of the future , ” says the Chamber of Commerce ’s website .
“ As the name ‘ El Dorado ’ translates , this is a land of golden opportunity ! ”
Some residents of the bedroom community like to think of it as the next Silicon Valley , but the president of the Chamber of Commerce admits there are few jobs , and “ the one thing very different about El Dorado Hills ” is that no one has to be here .
Almost no one leaves either , which is surprising when you consider that what lies beneath these hills is n’t gold but something potentially deadly .
Housing developers and real estate agents do n’t like talking about the dark side of paradise ( see “ Take My Breath Away , ” page 70 ) , so I had to rely on Terry Trent to give me an unofficial tour .
Trent , a 50 - ish retired construction consultant , no longer lives in El Dorado County but admits that his former home has become something of an obsession .
“ There are some really dangerous things in the ground , ” he said as we drove down the main street , El Dorado Hills Boulevard .
Talking nonstop ,
Trent pointed to the hillside that forms the spine of the town , which , according to his map from the state ’s Division of Mines and Geology , contains a vast deposit of naturally occurring asbestos .
There are similar deposits all over California ; serpentine , a primary source of asbestos , is the state rock .
It ’s not dangerous — unless it becomes airborne dust and gets in your lungs .
The trouble is , in El Dorado Hills , dust is n’t just a fact of life but a sign of progress .
“ Here in the mountains , we do n’t let no rocks stand in our way , ” Trent said .
Over the past 10 years , as the town ’s population has doubled to around 35,000 , hundreds of bulldozers have scraped over this ground , clearing land for thousands of new homes .
In that earth is a form of asbestos — amphibole — that ’s significantly more toxic than the type commonly used commercially .
Trent ’s map of the amphibole deposits was made 50 years ago .
Still , most residents were unaware of the asbestos until 11 years ago , when Trent uncovered a huge , glistening vein of it in his yard .
He went to the local papers with the news , and there was a brief outcry .
But the construction went on , and most of El Dorado Hills has been built in the years since .
Turning onto Harvard Way , Trent stopped before a grassy embankment that he claims is shot through with asbestos .
“ You can see how they carved through it to build this road , ” he said .
He recalled watching as construction crews gouged out a spot for a new middle school nearby , crushing the excavated rock and transporting the gravel to become the foundation for the new community center .
A half - mile stretch of Harvard Way was covered in dust , he said , for months .
Nine years ago , tests commissioned by the Sacramento Bee found high concentrations of amphibole fibers inside Trent ’s home .
He moved soon afterward .
To this day , he still ca n’t understand why few of his former neighbors seem concerned about the threat beneath them , or why the town is still fully occupied , its homes still worth hundreds of thousands of dollars .
“ I do n’t like to be mean , ” he said , “ but I ’m a little cranky with these people .
It ’s like they ’re in shock .
They do n’t want this stuff to exist ; therefore , they put their heads in the sand .
They say , ‘ Well , it ’s not here , and it ’s not bad , and here , I ’ll prove that it ’s not here and it ’s not bad . ' ”
In the fall of 2004 , agents from the Environmental Protection Agency descended on El Dorado Hills in respirators and protective suits and headed for a town park .
There , they began playing as children would — tossing baseballs , kicking soccer balls , biking , and running .
All the while , they took air samples , and all the while they were quietly watched by the citizens of El Dorado Hills .
The civic leaders of El Dorado Hills had spent many months trying to stave off these tests , scrambling to protect the community not from potentially toxic substances , but from the epa ‘s potentially toxic information .
Taking the lead was Vicki Barber , the superintendent of schools .
A stout woman with compressed lips and an unwavering gaze , she recently won an award for being “ a person who does not accept the word ‘ no ’… when it comes to what is good for students . ”
After asbestos was found during the construction of a high school soccer field in 2002 , Barber questioned a costly epa - mandated cleanup .
When a citizen formally asked the epa to test the town ’s public areas for asbestos in 2003 , Barber quickly emerged as the agency ’s most determined local foe .
Before the study was even under way , she began writing to the epa as well as to senators and congressmen , questioning whether the agency had the “ legal and scientific authority ” to conduct what she called a “ science experiment ” with “ limited benefit to the residents . ”
At least four state legislators and one congressman responded by putting pressure on the epa , which in turn agreed not to declare El Dorado Hills a Superfund site , regardless of what it might find there .
In May 2005 , the epa announced its findings : Almost every one of more than 400 air samples collected at the park , as well as along a hiking trail and in three school yards , contained asbestos fibers .
Most of the samples contained amphibole fibers known as tremolite — long , thin strands that , when inhaled , tend to wedge in the lungs for much longer and at higher concentrations than other forms of asbestos , even at very low exposure levels .
The correlation between amphibole asbestos and lung disease has been demonstrated around the world , from Canada to Cyprus , and perhaps most convincingly in the mining town of Libby , Montana , where hundreds of residents have been diagnosed with asbestos - related diseases and many have died .
After reviewing the epa ‘s findings in El Dorado Hills , a Canadian epidemiologist told the Fresno Bee that the area ’s exposure levels were comparable to those in towns where mining had gone on for a century .
“ You can certainly say people are going to die , and there are going to be increased cases of cancer , ” he said .
“ I would n’t live there .
I would n’t want my family to live there . ”
The epa , however , avoided making such dire statements .
Its report neither specified how toxic the samples were nor quantified the health risk to the residents of El Dorado Hills .
Rather , it simply noted that the exposure levels were “ of concern . ”
Jere Johnson , who oversaw the study , explained that the agency was trying not to sound alarmist .
“ We wanted to inform the community without scaring them , ” she said .
But local officials received the epa ‘s findings almost as a declaration of war on El Dorado Hills and its way of life .
Jon Morgan , the director of the county ’s environmental management department , thundered to a local television station that the tremolite announcement “ may unnecessarily scare the living daylights out of every man , woman , and child in El Dorado County and could possibly devastate the county for years to come . ”
When I visited El Dorado Hills , more than a year after the epa had run its tests , I was told over and over that the biggest threat facing the town was big - government intrusion .
“ The issue is not asbestos , ” declared James Sweeney , chairman of the county Board of Supervisors .
“ The issue is the epa . ” Superintendent Barber said that El Dorado Hills is like any other community in California , “ and yet why is it that the epa has decided to focus on only here ? ”
One county supervisor claimed that an epa official had told her he was going to make El Dorado Hills “ a poster child for asbestos . ”
“ What I heard , ” town general manager Wayne Lowery said , “ is that the Libby , Montana , project is being wrapped up and they have all these employees with training , and they ’re looking for a place to keep them employed . ”
What were officials supposed to do with the epa ‘s information , wondered Debbie Manning , the president of the Chamber of Commerce .
“ Are you just going to make it a ghost town ? ”
There was no need to rush to judgment until all the facts had been determined .
“ I ’m sure you know that asbestos is a complicated issue , ” she told me , explaining that there had been a locally led effort to get the information out about asbestos .
Fortunately , El Dorado Hills is a highly educated community , she said , and you can trust that “ with good information , people can make proper decisions . ”
One of those struggling to do just that was Vicki Summers , a 47 - year - old mom who said that her chief duty was to protect her two children from “ any type of health issues . ”
Surrounded by stuffed animals , she sat on a couch in her spacious living room , her eyes darting as she spoke of the dangers they faced .
“ Every day in the newspaper , there ’s something new , ” she said — chemicals in the water , mad cow disease , bird flu .
She often felt overwhelmed , especially when experts said different things .
Summers had guzzled green tea for its anticancer benefits until she heard it caused colon cancer .
She had gorged on fish during her first pregnancy , thinking it was “ brain food , ” only to be told , while expecting her second child , that mercury could cause brain damage .
The same sort of thing had happened to her dad .
When she was a girl , he had made a point of buying margarine because he wanted to protect his family from cholesterol .
“ And now he ’s had three strokes , ” she explained , “ and they say it ’s the plaque buildup from the hydrogenated vegetable oil . ”
So much conflicting information was almost paralyzing .
“ It would be better to be ignorant , ” she said , “ because then you would n’t have to be stressed out by all this . ”
Summers called her home her “ dream house , ” and said she had long considered El Dorado Hills “ heaven on Earth , ” but when she heard about the asbestos , her first thought was , “ If this is Love Canal , and there ’s going to be a mass exodus , I do n’t want to be the last one out . ”
But no exodus from El Dorado Hills ever began .
Many residents seemed oddly comforted by the apparent uncertainty of the situation .
Just after the epa report came out , Summers joined a thousand other citizens in the town gym , looking for answers .
There , school superintendent Barber reassured the crowd that the town was “ deeply committed to maintaining public health and safety . ”
Then she ripped into the epa report for offering no solid “ risk information . ”
She pointed out there had been no abundance of “ pulmonary cases ” in the area .
In other words , with nobody getting sick or dying , there was no real evidence of any hazard , so why worry ?
“ Risk is a part of all of our lives , ” Barber said .
“ But we also need to keep it in perspective . ”
She received enthusiastic applause .
Scientists , however , are more certain about the dangers of asbestos .
There is no known safe exposure level to asbestos , whether it is in a commercial or a natural form ; even low doses can cause malignant mesothelioma , a rare lung cancer .
And the evidence keeps mounting .
In the summer of 2005 , researchers from the University of California - Davis Department of Public Health Sciences announced the findings of a study comparing the addresses of 2,900 Californians suffering from malignant mesothelioma against a geological map of the state .
They concluded that the risk of developing lung cancer was directly related to how close the patients had lived to areas of rock associated with naturally occurring tremolite asbestos .
( Likewise , the odds of getting mesothelioma drop 1 percent for every mile one moves away from an asbestos source . )
As one of the authors explained , “ We showed that breathing asbestos in your community is not magically different from breathing asbestos in an industrial setting . ”
All of this passed over El Dorado Hills like clouds in the blue sky .
County supervisor Helen Baumann ’s reaction to the UC Davis report was that “ there are studies counter to that . ”
Local government would “ err on the side of public health and safety , ” she said , “ until some better science comes forward . ”
So began the effort to live in El Dorado Hills without coming into contact with the earth .
In the park and the school playing fields where the epa had collected samples , workers trucked in clean soil to replace two feet of topsoil , as the agency had recommended .
The county banned using leaf blowers on town property , “ except for emergency situations . ”
Residents were encouraged to take precautions such as removing their shoes before entering their homes , driving slowly with the windows up on unpaved roads , and “ limiting time spent on dirt . ”
Home - builders agreed to spray down building sites and rinse off their trucks ’ tires after work .
Any sightings of “ fugitive dust ” were to be reported to a new “ dust enforcement ” team .
Life in El Dorado
Hills under the new regime was “ manageable , ” said Baumann .
That seemed to be the point of the show :
If you took a few precautions , there was no need to panic .
She proudly pointed out that the dust hot line rarely received a call .
Gerri Silva , the interim director of the county department of environmental management , told me the measures had worked so well that in all of El Dorado Hills , “ there is no dust . ”
In the town ’s main coffee shop , Bella Bru , languor pervaded as well .
An engineer named Matt Parisek said that asbestos was “ pretty much a fake issue . ”
“ It ’s pretty obvious [ the epa ] selected this county because of our conservative Republican reputation , ” he said .
And , wondered retiree Carole Gilmore , “ If asbestos is all over California , I do n’t know why they zero in on El Dorado Hills . ”
Real estate broker Charles Hite , who is the current resident of Terry Trent ’s old house , pointed out that none of his neighbors had died .
“ If it is such a health hazard , ” he asked , “ why are people still buying and building ?
Why are real estate prices going up ?
Why does n’t government shut the city down ? ”
There was a circular logic at work .
The local government had told everyone to stay calm , and so residents were n’t afraid .
And if no one was scared , then perhaps there was nothing to fear .
“ The vast , vast majority ” trusted that they were safe , said Baumann .
But , she added , there remained “ a very , very small centralized group that keeps pushing issues and pushing issues to the extreme . ”
She specifically mentioned Terry Trent , who to this day sends regular , dire emails to residents , reporters , and scientists .
The group of extremists who “ do not represent our community ” also included , in Baumann ’s view , some members of a community group that meets monthly to discuss asbestos .
Vicki Summers had joined the Asbestos Community Advisory Group as part of her effort to educate herself .
When someone would mention the low body count as evidence that nothing was wrong , she could now cite the UC Davis study , or note that the latency period for asbestos - related diseases is about 30 years .
Who lived in these hills back then , she asked , “ a dozen ranchers ? ”
Other parents assumed that if they could n’t see asbestos in the air , it was n’t there ; Summers could picture invisible fibers burrowing into her kids ’ lungs .
“ It never disappears , ” she said , wide - eyed .
“ That ’s the scary thing .
And it ’s a known carcinogen .
has
And if we know that , we know it ’s not good for our kids . ”
Summers said she was thinking only of her family when , at a community meeting , she passed a note to an epa official , asking , “ Should I move ? ”
After that was reported by a newspaper , she received an answer in an anonymous , late - night phone call : “ Vicki Summers , I think you should move ! ”
Short of evacuating , there are only two ways to solve El Dorado Hills ’ asbestos problem :
Either pave over every asbestos deposit in town — an impossible task — or make the asbestos magically disappear .
Soon after the epa report came out , Superintendent Barber got in touch with the National Stone , Sand and Gravel Association , an industry trade group , which commissioned the R.J. Lee Group to scrutinize the epa ‘s data .
In 2000 , it was reported that R.J. Lee ’s president , Richard Lee , had been paid about $ 7 million for testifying more than 250 times on behalf of the asbestos industry .
When the Seattle Post - Intelligencer found asbestos in Crayola crayons , it was Lee who did a study that discovered none .
When people began getting sick and dying in Libby , Montana , R.J. Lee found that local asbestos levels had been overstated by the epa .
As in Libby , R.J. Lee declared that what the epa had been calling asbestos in El Dorado Hills was , in fact , not asbestos at all .
Some of the fibers were not the proper size ; others contained a bit too much aluminum .
The epa had , in other words , completely goofed .
Supervisor Baumann hailed “ a study that has profound information in it . ”
Barber bustled off to Washington , D.C. , at taxpayer expense , carrying news of “ this startling scientific development . ”
And Wayne Lowery , the town manager , admitted it was hard to get excited about controlling asbestos “ when you ’ve got two different interpretations of the same data . ”
At a meeting of the Asbestos Community Advisory Group in the fire station last winter , Summers and a handful of other residents met with the epa ‘s Jere Johnson to try to understand how asbestos could vanish before their eyes .
Two builders were also at the table .
Baumann seemed to have been thinking of them when , at an earlier county supervisors ’ meeting , she had issued a “ public thank you ” to “ the very , very smart people attending those meetings , making sure another thought process is heard . ”
One of the builders introduced R.J. Lee ’s report and started to expound on “ cleavage fragments , ” mineral composition , microns , and the like .
“ I do n’t want to get bogged down with these semantics , ” a fireman interrupted .
“ We know we have it here . ”
The group ’s chairman shushed him , though , saying he did n’t want to get bogged down in semantics either , “ but I think we almost have to . ”
The builder persisted with his mantra of scientific uncertainty .
“ We all wish science to be this nice black - and - white thing , ” he said , “ and sometimes it is n’t . ”
The debate seemed essentially over by the time the epa ‘s Johnson clarified the topic :
It was not geology but public health .
“ The body ca n’t tell the difference between a fragment and a fiber , ” Johnson said .
Whatever you called it , it would still get stuck in your lungs .
For Summers , the starkness of the issue had again faded to gray .
When she started looking for a safer place to live , she was alarmed at first to realize there were cancer clusters and crime everywhere , and then she had taken comfort in danger .
If nowhere on Earth was completely safe , she reasoned , why should she leave El Dorado Hills ?
Perhaps it was as Vicki Barber had said : Risk is a part of all of our lives .
Her family could stay , she decided , as long as she took precautions , such as wiping down her home with damp rags , and kept pushing to get all the facts .
And if new studies revealed the asbestos to be “ just fragments and dust , ” well , she admitted , she ’d be “ thrilled to death . ”
But she knew otherwise , did n’t she ?
She knew that asbestos was here , and she knew that it was bad ?
The question silenced her .
“ I do n’t want to know it , though , ” she finally answered .
“ I do n’t want to know it .
That ’s when I can’t sleep .
I mean , I love it here .
I love it here .
That ’s why it ’s hard .
Part of me wants to be in denial . ”
After reviewing R.J. Lee ’s report on El Dorado Hills , the epa declared last spring that the company had violated “ generally accepted scientific principles . ”
R.J. Lee , in turn , discovered “ a number of important differences of opinion as well as factual misstatements ” in the epa ‘s response .
The epa at last asked the U.S. Geological Survey to step in and do its own testing .
In December , the usgs announced that its analysis confirmed that “ material that can be classified as tremolite asbestos is ” in El Dorado Hills .
But the geologists were uncomfortable assessing the health risks , and so the controversy continues .
Supervisor Baumann thought the epa should just leave El Dorado Hills be .
Her constituents had “ really calmed down , been educated . ”
Why , she wondered , would anyone want to excite them again ?
The publichealth debate seemed to have come full circle when Sweeney , the chairman of the Board of Supervisors , griped about the “ extreme cost ” of dust controls , saying , “ We ’re putting our public at risk by telling them to do things that are absolutely unnecessary . ”
Up on the ridge , behind the high school , Terry Trent stood beside a driveway with a piece of tremolite in his hand .
As he tossed the rock back to the ground , there was the sound of a small engine starting .
“ Watch this , ” Trent said , and a smile broke over his face as a gardener passed by with a leaf blower , dust billowing all around .

Eight years ago , when I was 11 , I came across the Lisa Emulator Project .
[ The site is temporarily inaccessible as they replace a failed hard drive . ]
I had heard about the Lisa , but I had never had a chance to use the Lisa Office System ( LOS ) .
The reason was that the emulator project did n't have a working Lisa emulator , and neither did anyone else - until now .
Ray Arachelian , creator of the Lisa Emulator Project , has finally created a working Lisa emulator ( for more on that , see Interview with Ray Arachelian , Creator of the Lisa Emulator ) .
I , like many others , have been waiting for years for this emulator to be up and running , so , I downloaded the Lisa emulator , got a ROM , and found a copy of the LOS , both of which are necessary for the emulator to work .
I got a copy of LOS 7/7 Version 3.1 , installed it on the Profile disk image , and started up the virtual Lisa .
I 'm going to show you several features of the LOS - I made over a dozen screen shots to help demonstrate .
When you turn the Lisa on , this is the first thing you see :
System Test
Startup From Menu
Starting up
LOS startup dialog box
Clock not set
Notice there is one thing that Microsoft did n't steal from the Mac when they made Windows : the hourglass ( the classic Mac OS shows a wristwatch ) .
No , they stole the Windows hourglass from the Lisa .
Anyway , you 've seen the startup process - now down to business .
First off , the Lisa really does act differently from other computers .
For instance , you do n't open LisaWrite , LisaDraw , or any other application , select the type of document you want to make , then make the document , anhd then save it with a title like you would on any newer GUI .
On the Lisa , you tear off a piece of paper from a stationary ( such as LisaDraw Paper or LisaWrite Paper ) by double clicking on it .
Then you title the piece of paper you just tore off :
Then you open that piece of paper , and start writing ( or drawing , or whatever )
I wonder why this is n't the way modern operating systems work - it makes more sense to me .
You might be wondering why I have the clock set to 2/25/95 .
Well , the Lisa 's clock stopped rolling over in 1995 .
( At least Lisa did n't have a Y2 K problem . )
Another thing Lisa had was preemptive multitasking , so you could hold a menu open and the rest of the system would n't stop .
That 's right - preemptive multitasking was a standard feature on the Lisa in 1983 .
( It was n't a feature on the Mac until OS X arrived in 2001 . )
Another thing you 'll notice about Lisa is that there is no Quit option .
You can set everything aside , set the document you are working on aside , Save and Continue , and Save and Put Away , but you ca n't Quit .
The reason you can't quit is because all of the programs are always open .
The LOS is totally document oriented .
Another nice thing is that you never have to tell a Lisa to save something .
If you do tell it to save something , it makes a reference file that you can revert to at a later time .
Say you started working on something last week , and the last time you saved it was two days ago .
The Lisa keeps track of all of the changes you made since the last time you saved , so every time you set aside your document , it updates it without even asking .
But say you screwed something up in your document ?
You can simply tell Lisa to revert to the previous version !
In fact , the only reason you would ever want to save anything on a Lisa is so you could revert to the previous version later on .
Other than the revert feature , there 's absolutely no reason you would ever have to save a document ; it 's automatic .
Here is another thing I really like :
If you have a document open on a disk and you try to eject that disk , the Lisa will save the document ( s ) , close them , and only then eject the disk .
This would come in handy if someone ( like your boss ) gave you another disk and told you to check it out .
And as soon as you put the first disk you were working with back in the Lisa , it automatically reopens the document (s ) you were working with just as you had them before you ejected the disk .
The same thing happened when you hit to Power Button .
Even if you have 20 documents open and you hit to Power Button , the Lisa will save all of them , set them aside , put everything away , and only then turn itself off .
As soon as you turn Lisa back on , it reopens everything and puts it just like you had it before you turned it off .
It works kind of like Sleep on a Mac , the only difference is all of your documents are saved .
Another feature I like is when you tell Lisa to duplicate a file .
It creates a flashing icon resembling the file you wish to duplicate .
Before it duplicates the file , you have to drag the flashing icon where you want it before it duplicates it .
I imagine this was because back in 1983 disk space was limited , and in some cases you did n't have enough room on the disk to simply duplicate the file on the same disk .
Another thing that is a little strange - but not when you think about how things work in the real world - when you drag a program from one disk to another , once the file is copied , Lisa deletes the program from the first disk .
This may sound strange , but when you thing about it , when you move a real file from one folder to another in real life , the file no longer exists in the folder from which it came .
The Lisa Emulator
You 're all probably wonder what the emulator is like .
Well , it 's very well designed .
Not only does it emulate the UI , it emulates the entire computer , including the power light and the disk drives .
When you run the emulator , it really feels like you are sitting in front of a Lisa !
As of right now , the Windows version is the only version where the disk drive motor sound and disk animation works , and there is currently no documentation on the emulator .
There is also a bug in the emulator causing the scroll bar arrows not to appear in some programs .
The same bug causes the Desk menu to malfunction .
( The desk menu is supposed to show all of the items that are on the desktop . )
However , the only major problem I have with the emulator is it runs really slow on my 733 MHz G4 ( the emulator reports it is running at about 3 MHz , that 's only 3/5 of the Lisa 's slow 5 MHz hardware speed ) .
Ray Arachelian assured me that the next release , due sometime next week , will run much faster on G4 machines .
The Windows version , on the other hand runs pretty fast , so if you have a Windows machine , I suggest running the emulator on there for the time being ( unless you have a really fast Mac ) .
Well , I hope you enjoyed your look into the LOS .
If you have any questions or comments , please feel free to email me .
And be sure to stay tuned , because I'm in the process of interviewing Ray Arachelian so I can share more about the Lisa Emulator Project .
Update : LisaEm 1.2.0 ( released 2007.09.23 ) and later no longer require a ROM image .

The laboratory procedure removing the AIDS virus used an enzyme , said Joachim Hauber of the Heinrich Pette Institute for Experimental Virology and Immunology in Hamburg .
" We have rid the cells of the virus , " Hauber said on Thursday .
" No one else has done this before . "
He called it " a breakthrough in bio- technology . "
Hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for AIDS could be found within 10 years .
Current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and not remove it from the body .
HIV is a retrovirus that nests in the DNA or key genetic material of infected cells .
The Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in Friday 's issue of the scientific journal Science .
Cutting DNA and recombining it
Three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in Hamburg .
The enzyme knows just where to cut the DNA
The scientists ' method used the ability of so - called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of DNA at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands .
The new enzyme , Tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the DNA where the HIV started .
The scientists said it recognized a characteristic HIV sequence that scarcely ever mutated .
Tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , Cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences .
Stem cells necessary for therapy
The laboratories artificially evolved Cre into Tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
Hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped - away DNA as waste .
Scientists have been analyzing the HIV virus for years
" After that , it is healthy , " Hauber said .
Any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .
They would then be treated in the laboratory and re-injected to regenerate a healthy immune system , Hauber said .
" It 's high - tech medicine , " Hauber said .
" You could n't just take a pill . "
My take on the nature of reality and how we decide what is true .
It 's an intro to general philosophy and the ideas of some clever people .
Bomb Plot Thwarted at Falwell 's Funeral Authorities find several homemade bombs in trunk of student 's car .
May 22 , 2007  --
Even in death , the Rev. Jerry Falwell rouses the most volatile of emotions .
A small group of protesters gathered near the funeral services to criticize the man who mobilized Christian evangelicals and made them a major force in American politics -- often by playing on social prejudices .
A group of students from Falwell 's Liberty University staged a counterprotest .
And Campbell County authorities arrested a Liberty University student for having several homemade bombs in his car .
The student , 19 - year - old Mark D. Uhl of Amissville , Va. , reportedly told authorities that he was making the bombs to stop protesters from disrupting the funeral service .
The devices were made of a combination of gasoline and detergent , a law enforcement official told ABC News ' Pierre Thomas .
They were " slow burn , " according to the official , and would not have been very destructive .
" There were indications that there were others involved in the manufacturing of these devices and we are still investigating these individuals with the assistance of ATF [ Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ] , Virginia State Police and FBI .
At this time it is not believed that these devices were going to be used to interrupt the funeral services at Liberty University , " the Campbell County Sheriff 's Office said in a release .
Three other suspects are being sought , one of whom is a soldier from Fort Benning , Ga. , and another is a high school student .
No information was available on the third suspect .
Authorities were alerted to the potential bomb plot after relative of Uhl called to say that he had homemade bombs in his possession .
Officials searched
Uhl 's car where they found five incendiary devices in the trunk .
Uhl is currently being held under no bond at the Campbell County Adult Detention Center .
Thousands Came to Honor Man Who Mobilized Christian Evangelicals
Falwell , often called the father of the Christian conservative movement , died suddenly last week at age 73 .
Thousands flocked to the Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg , Va. , which Falwell founded 50 years ago , for the funeral service .
The church had just 35 parishioners when Falwell began preaching there in 1956 .
At Tuesday 's service , its 6,000 seats were filled by people who'd come to say goodbye .
" Almost every single person gathered here today is really here because on a real and personal level you and Dr. Jerry Falwell were friends , " said Ronald S. Godwin , executive vice president of Liberty University .
To the end , though , Falwell inspired strong feelings .
He launched an evangelical movement that changed the face of American religion and politics and catapulted him to national prominence from his " Old Time Gospel Hour " television show .
Falwell 's Moral Majority , a group he founded in the 1970s , broke new ground in mobilizing evangelical Christians in the political arena , helping Ronald Reagan win the White House in 1980 .
As time went on , however , Falwell 's influence waned , partly due to his own penchant for controversy .
But his comments in the days after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks made it nearly impossible for mainstream politicians to associate with him .
No national Republicans attended Tuesday 's funeral , including none of the GOP presidential candidates .
All said they were too busy .

09/02/2016 - My apologies to those players that have been waiting on their compensation for the whole Star Card debacle .
As far as I can tell there were 153 players impacted , and all of those players have been given 750 anytime moves ( 500 in compensation for the bug , and another 250 because of my delay ) .
If you were impacted and did not get the moves , please let me know .
08/28/2016 - Thanks to manic for bringing an issue to my attention where finding cards in abandoned homesteads and ruins could cause the card count for that card type to be reset .
While I can determine who was likely impacted by this bug , I do n't have a really good means of determining how much was lost .
We will be granting all of those players who may have been impacted by this bug 500 anytime moves over the next day or two as means of compensation .
08/18/2016 - Reviewing code and calculations and I realized that volcano eruptions happen so rarely that the no eruption card is pretty useless .
To help balance this I 've tweaked the algorithm for the eruptions so that they will be slightly more frequent and potentially more impactful .
Before you had a 1 in 50 chance of hitting an eruption and it would cost you 20 - 2000 MD , now you have a 1 in 20 chance , and the eruption will cost you 20 - ( half your total MD amount ) .
Feel free to post your thoughts and comments in the forum .

The game is back up and running and I 've killed off our ad platform , as some people had reported that they were getting virus warnings from one of the ads that had shown up .
09/06/2013 -
We may have some down time on the site on Sunday September 15th between 4 - 7 am .
Our host is performing some nethork maintenance and is warning that we may see two outages in that interval .
So if you have problemf accessing the during that period , pleafe be patient and try again later .
03/16/2013 - Well , I did something that broke the site again .

08/10/2011 - The radar symbol for stores has been changed to X instead of Q. 08/02/2011 -
If no one else gets to them before then , I will be processing all confirmed trades tonight around 10 PM EST 07/05/2011 - there is apparently an issue with competitions .
You can sign up for them , but it wo n't let you actually take any moves .
Any compeititions that kick off before I figure out what is going on , I will reset to a point after I have made them playable .
06/25/2011 -
The force card sale will run all day tomorrow .

06/14/2011 - BAD DEVELOPER , NO DONUT !!!
My sincere apologies to the players whose alliances were accidentally deleted this evening .
I did not take adequate precaution before executing the alliance purge and apparently have deleted all of the alliances that I meant to keep .
You should be able to recreate your alliances , and if you have member lists , I will do what I can to reregister people properly .
Again , I really apologize to everyone for the major inconvienance .
06/13/2011 -
The moderators of the private alliance forums should now be able to control who is in their membergroups .
In addition tomorrow evening we will be purging all alliances whose leaders have been purged .
If you are in an alliance whose leader has disappeared and would like to assume leadership , please send an email to admins@exodus3000.com .
04/11/2011 -
We have implemented the suggestion made by QueenSheba to highlight settlements you own .
Unless there is a significant bug that is found , it is unlikely that there will be new features added to the game at this stage .
This is not because we are giving up on the game , but because I have begun to rework the entire codebase from the ground up .
This rebuild will put the code in a format that will be far simpler to add new features too in the future .
In addition to all new code , we will also be introducing a new interface , and revamping the look of the site as a whole .
We have some very exciting things in the relatively near future , and hope that all of our players will stay with us through this time .
Watch this space for screenshots and other information as they become available .
11/29/2010 - I 'm pushing up a couple small code changes .
Expect irratic site behaviour for the next few minutes .
11/17/2010 - Looks like we 've finally cleared up the attack site warning from Google .
11/04/2010 - Those of you using Firefox , or reaching us from a Google search may have seen a warning that this site is distributing malicious software .
This is not correct .
We believe the this is a misidentification caused by the IFRAMEing of the leaderboard ads .
We have requested a review of the issue , and expect to hear something from google very soon .
Please rest assured that we are not , and will not , ever ask you to install something on your system , or distribute any trojans or viruses .
09/08/2010 -
We will be having intermittent outages on September 16th from Midnight until 4 am EST while out hosting provider performs some network maintenance .
We apologize for the inconvienance .
07/05/2010 -
We will be ending our unlimited digs for non-sbuscribers promotion this evening at reset .
06/29/2010 - Someone is sending out bogus password reset emails .
These are spoofed to appear to be coming from support@exodus3000.com .
This is not a valid email address , and should be blocked .
I do n't know where the links in the email go , but they do n't come here .
06/22/2010 - The IRC will be down for a short while this evening .

06/15/2010 - The IRC server is back up , although I 've not been able to resusitate Marvin yet .
05/28/2010 - Nigey will be making descriptions for the player - named minerals of Group 6 over the next several days , and bringing them all into the standard Mineral page format .
If you won the contest and got to name a mineral and would like to have some input on it's details , please either put that information on the appropriate page , or contact either Nigey or Admins ASAP .
05/25/2010 - We would like to welcome Nigey as our new Wiki Manager .
He 's already done an impressive amount of work with the minerals , and we look forward to the other contributions he will be bringing us on that front .

This feature provides subscribers an easy means to keep track of in - game information and details .
05/11/2010 - Competitions are fixed and playable again .
03/06/2010 -
The purge was implemented this morning at reset .
However , there is a bug wherein if you land on an unclaimed settlement the picture will be undefined and you will not be able to claim it .
We are aware of the issue and are working to correct it .
Please bear with us while we get this cleaned up .
03/06/2010 -
The unclaimed settlement takeover bug is fixed .
There is some fallout from this of homesteads appearing to be misassigned .
I 'm working on clearing that up right now .
02/23/2010 -
On the evening of March 5th , we will be instituting a new policy wherein all player accounts that have been inactive for 15 months or more will be purged from the system altogether .
All players with accounts on the forum have been notified of this via email already .
If you have contact with a potential deletee who is not on the forums , please let them know what is going on .
Any questions or concerns should be directed to admins@exodus3000.com
If you are a member of an alliance whose leader may be purged , please contact us via email or the forum so that we can determine who would best be suited to take over that leadership .
If no leader can be determined amongst the membership , the oldest still active player in the alliance will be designated as the new leader .
02/22/2010 -
The map page has been updated to not only work better and faster , but to also indicate which alliance is dominant in each sector in regards to settlement governance .
02/19/2010 -
The issue with mission completion resulting in negative stats has been corrected .
We apologize for the problem .
01/29/2010 - Please take a moment to review the change in policy on how player suggestions will be proccessed from here on out .

12/24/2009 - SERVER LAG
Many comments and complaints have been made about the lag time on the game after the latest server move .
I 'm making this post to help give everyone a clearer idea as to exactly what we are dealing with , and what our plans are to improve it in the future .
Previously , the game was hosted on an expensive dedicated server .
While this gave the game a high degree of throughput and a lot of horsepower ( frankly much more than it actually needs ) it also added substantial financial overhead to the administration of the game .
This cost was part of the reason that we got so far behind in payouts , as we had to pay hosting fees each month before we could issue payouts to anyone .
While shopping around for a new home , we looked at many options , including both dedicated and virtual private ( shared ) servers .
We opted to go with our current VPS solution for two reasons .
The first is that stat - wise , it is practically identical to the dedicated server that we were running on before in terms of available bandwidth , burstable RAM , and storage space .
Secondly it cost roughly 1/5 what the dedicated server we were on before did .
Frankly I was surprised at the amount of lag we started experiencing on this server after it came under load , as the comparison of this machine and the one we were on , on paper , was so similar .
I 've discussed the issue at length with our new hosting company and they pointed out several small tweaks and coding inefficiencies that could be made .
The server tweaks have been put in place , and I am slowly working my way through the codebase trying to tighten up the way the pages load , but we are basically hitting the limitations of being on a VPS as far as response times go for a site as large as ours .
However , with the cost savings we are now getting and the rate of purchases being made , Rick estimates that we are within 3 months or less of having issued all standing payout requests at least $ 100 , or the entire payout amount if less than that .
Our plan at the moment is that once we have caught up on payouts , to talk to our current host about upgrading to a dedicated server .
The good news is that while that will be more expensive than what we are currently paying , it will still be cheaper than what we were paying at our previous host .
I will also be continuing to work on tightening up the efficiency of the codebase so that there will be incremental upgrades in speed of the next several weeks .
We would like to thank our players for sticking with us through this transitional period , and their continued support of Exodus3000 .

The server move has been completed , and everything is functional now except for Marvin .
I 'm still working on him .
Several players have complaint about a general decrease in speed of the game .
We are aware of the problem have have already taken some steps to make it work better .
We will be continuing to make improvements in the near future .
11/24/2009 -
As you may have noticed , the move did n't actually happen yet .
Due to some unforseen issues , the server move has been postponed until 11 /29 at reset .
At that point the game will be locked until the DNS change has propogated .
One of the first things that you may notice after the move is that the attack log will be truncated to the beginning of this year .
This is necessary because the current log file is far to big to move efficiently .
Some of the other logs may also be truncated .
We apologize for the inconvenience .
11/20/2009 -
We will be moving Exodus3000 to our new server starting Monday , Nov. 23 .
We are taking every step possible to keep interruptions to a minimum , but to ensure that no one loses data or information in the move , we will be locking down the game on this server at reset on Monday .
As the server change propogates , the game will automatically unlock for each of you .
If you have questions or comments , please feel free to post a response to http://www.exodus3000.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=176413#176413
11/13/2009 - Within the next 5 days ( By 11/18 ) we will be making a DNS change .
This should not disrupt the site , but please be aware that some minor connection issues may result during the propagation .
09/23/2009 -
We are beginning our domain transfer today .
This step should not result in significant disruption .
09/01/2009 - New contest !

If you are getting an error on the missions page , please send an email with your username to admins@exodus3000.com
08/12/2009 - Mission page listing is now corrected to properly show the missions that are not supposed to be hidden before they are found .
These missions are marked as " Public Mission " , until you actually find it and accept it .
On a side note , we 've created a twitter feed specifically for development notes ( # exodus3000_dev ) .
This is seperate from the standard exodus3000 twitter .
08/07/2009 - IN WAY OF EXPLANATION
Many questions and concerns have been voiced over the last several days , since the site went offline for two days at the beginning of the month .
Please let us lay those concerns to rest .
Firstly , we would like to announce that the admins of Exodus3000.com have officially purchased all rights and full ownership of the game from Eric Paulson and Viking Development .
Mr. Paulson , while still feeling very passionately about Exodus no longer has the time to devote to it , and so it was agreed that the three admins ( Jason , Krista , and Rick ) would be in a better position to properly support the player base of the game and to continue to work and expand the game .
The downtime at the beginning of the month was caused by a minor miscommunication between Mr. Paulson and ourselves .
This miscommunication has been straightened out , and thusly the site is back up and running .
You may ask , how will this change of ownership impact me ?
Primarily in wholly beneficial ways .
We have plans for many significant changes and additions in the next few months , not the least of which will be the release ( finally ! ) of the much - discussed Phobos Expansion .
Also in the works are new missions , a new way to do trades / gifts , and numerous other minor tweaks and fixes .
On the downside , there will most likely be another down period within the next few weeks , as this purchase is going to necessitate another server move .
We will do our best to keep the impact of this move to an absolute minimum , and will give everyone advance warning before it happens .
We would like to take this opportunity to thank our players for sticking with us through all the trials and tribulations and we look forward to providing you with an even better and more awesome Exodus in the future .
The New Owners ,
Jason , Krista , and Rick 07/28/2009 -
Had to restart the server today to clear up some weird behaviour .
The game should be running smoother now .
Sorry for the inconvienance

The mineral contest has ended !
Congratulations to the winners , and here is hoping everyone enjoys the new mineral set .
04/03/2009 -
The requested addition to display your current cargo / max cargo on the main game window has been added .
For it to work properly , however , you may have to clear the cache in your browser .
This option is available under Tools - > Clear Private Data in Firefox and Tools -> Internet Options ->Browsing in IE .
04/02/2009 - NOTICE : Due to a programming error , reset for 4/2/09 did not occur at midnight .
Instead it happened at 6:35 EST .
This is a one time glitch , and my sincere apologies to those players most affected .
- Jason
04/01/2009 - Please note changes to the referral page .
03/31/2009 - The new mining expansion has gone live .
Mining in volcanoes will now give you a number of units of a given mineral , instead of a direct MD reward .
These minerals can be sold at Settlements for a variable MD value .
03/24/2009 - New Feature :
At the top of the game window you will now see a scrolling ticker of items that are currently for sale in the various stores around Mars .
03/19/2009 - You can now use Upgrade cards to upgrade your Cargo and Storage stats from your Stats page
03/12/2009 - Cargo and Storage is now upgradable at Outposts .
Unlike the other stats , every upgrade for these two increases them by 5 , instead of 1 .
Cargo caps at 200 , and Storage caps at 1000 .
03/10/2009 - A minor tweak has been added , so that once a player has gone into an abandoned state , they will unjoin all of the settlements they have joined in the past .
This will allow alot more movement on the top settlement population list , as well as having an impact on the upcoming Mineral expansion .
UPDATE : This unjoining does not happen until someone comes across the abandoned homestead .
So if a player drops into an abandoned state ( 3 months ) and then comes back into the game before someone visits their homestead , they will not unjoin the settlements .
03/04/2009 - Subscribers may now Go To Store for free , just like Going To Homestead .
03/03/2009 -
The chat system is currently not functional .
We are aware of the problem and are working to resolve it as quickly as possible .

10/02/2008 - Note :
The chat room rules have been updated .

The first is by being a subscriber for three months .
After three months you may ask for a free Cashout Card .
The second method is by purchasing $ 100 of stuff , be it moves , radar upgrades , whatever .
Every $ 100 spent entitles you to another Cashout Card .
Cashout Cards will remain untradeable and unsellable , and are still findable through Digs .
09/23/2008 - A new mission series has begun !
Beware , for the Martian Plague is upon us .
Can you save the planet from this horrible disease ?

It has come to our attention that a player known on here as masterlink18 has been making posts on other forums stating that you can get a $ 5 Amazon gift certificate for signing up and making 200 moves .
This is a complete scam .
Making 200 moves gives masterlink18 a bonus , but you will not get a gift certificate from this site .
Masterlink18 has been banned , as will any other players found doing this kind of scam .
If you are a victim of this liar , we apologize , but hope that you will stick around and check out the game .
What he said about it being fun is true , and you can earn money playing .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Two brothers charged in an alleged plot to blow up U.S. - bound airliners have been released after a British court ruled there was insufficient evidence to warrant a trial .
Westminster Magistrate 's Court confirmed that the case of Umair Hussain , 25 , and Mehran Hussain 23 , was discharged due to " insufficient information evidence . "
The two faced charges of failing to disclose information about the suspected role of their brother Nabeel Hussain , 22 , one of 11 people charged with conspiracy to murder and preparing acts of terrorism in the plot .
Police arrested 25 people in raids across Britain on August 9 and 10 and charged 17 of them , after uncovering a suspected plot to attack up to 10 U.S. - bound passenger jets using liquid explosives .
The alleged plot was uncovered when a member of Britain 's Muslim community noticed an acquaintance acting suspiciously and went to authorities , leading investigators to plant an undercover British agent in the group , U.S. and British authorities said .
The arrests sparked heightened terror alerts in Britain and the United States and ushered in tighter security regulations on airline passengers .
CNN 's Eileen Hsieh in London contributed to this report .
Bush 's approval ratings slide to new low Poll :
Only one - third say he 's handling his job well President Bush 's low approval ratings are starting to worry GOP lawmakers facing re-election .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS George W. Bush Oil and Gas or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush 's approval ratings have sunk to a personal low , with only a third of Americans saying they approve of the way he is handling his job , a national poll released Monday said .
In the telephone poll of 1,012 adult Americans carried out Friday through Sunday by Opinion Research Corporation for CNN , 32 percent of respondents said they approve of Bush 's performance , 60 percent said they disapprove and 8 percent said they do not know .
That 's a significant drop from the way Americans perceived the president a year ago .
In a CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll carried out April 29 - May 1 , 2005 , Americans were split on their assessments of Bush 's performance , with 48 percent saying they approved and 49 percent saying they disapproved .
( Read the complete results document -- PDF ) CNN 's poll has a sampling error of plus - or - minus 3 percentage points for most questions .
It was one of four conducted within the past 10 days that have yielded similar results : a Pew Center poll carried out April 7 - 16 gave Bush a 35 percent approval rating ; a Fox News / Opinion Dynamics poll carried out last Tuesday and Wednesday gave him a 33 percent approval rating ; and an American Research Group poll carried out Tuesday through Friday gave him a 34 percent approval rating .
Asked whether the term " strong and decisive leader " describes Bush , 46 percent said yes , down from 62 percent who said they felt that way in a CNN / USA Today / Gallup survey carried out July 22 - 24 , 2005 .
Asked whether " honest and trustworthy " describes the president , 40 percent said yes , down from 56 percent in a survey carried out April 1 - 2 last year .
Americans were evenly split on whether Bush is " competent , " with 47 percent saying yes , 47 percent saying no and 6 percent expressing no opinion .
Dissatisfaction with their leader appears to parallel Americans ' unhappiness over gas prices .
More than two - thirds of Americans ( 69 percent ) said recent increases in the cost of gasoline have caused them hardship , with 28 percent saying they have not , and 1 percent saying they have no opinion .
Asked to rate the level of hardship , 23 percent described it as " severe , " and 46 percent described it as " moderate . "
That 's up from last April , when a CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll found that 15 percent of respondents said the price of gasoline was causing them " severe hardship " and 43 percent said it was causing them " moderate " hardship .
Last week , a Lundberg Survey of gasoline prices found the average cost of a gallon of self - serve regular was $ 2.91 .
Last April , the average gallon cost $ 2.29 .
Bush 's flagging popularity might produce dividends for the Democrats .
Asked about the congressional elections slated for November , half of registered voters said they would vote for Democrats if the election were held now , 40 percent said they would vote for Republicans and 6 percent said they did not know .
This question has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .
Still , that 's not significantly different from last August , when 53 percent said they were likely to vote for a Democrat versus 41 percent who said they were likely to vote Republican and 6 percent who said they were undecided .

Combined gravity and radar data reveal a crater formation deep under the ice ( Image : OSU )
The scientists behind the discovery say it could have been made by a massive meteorite strike 250 million years ago .
The feature at Wilkes Land was found by Nasa satellites that are mapping subtle differences in the Earth 's gravity .
" This Wilkes Land impact is much bigger than the impact that killed the dinosaurs , " said Prof Ralph von Frese , from Ohio State University , in the US .
If the crater really was formed at the time von Frese and colleagues believe , it will raise interest as a possible cause of the " great dying " - the biggest of all the Earth 's mass extinctions when 95 % of all marine life and 70 % of all land species disappeared .
Some scientists have long suspected that the extinction at the boundary of the Permian and Triassic ( PT ) Periods could have occurred quite abruptly - the result of environmental changes brought on by the impact of a giant space rock .
PERMO -TRIASSIC EXTINCTION
The greatest of all Earth 's mass extinctions occurred about 250 million years ago About 95 % of marine species and three - quarters of all families on the Pangean ( above ) landmass perished Rocks from the end of the Permian period can be seen today in places such as China , Italy and Pakistan Chief suspects include sea - level fluctuations , volcanic activity , space impacts and melting methane - ice in sea sediments
A geological structure , known as the Bedout High , in the seabed off what is now Australia , has also been suggested as the possible crater remains from the PT impactor .
But the impact explanation for the great dying is an argument that has struggled to find favour .
The prevailing theory is that several factors - including supervolcanism and extensive climate warming - combined over thousands of years to strangle the planet 's biodiversity .
Earth may well have been hit by extraterrestrial objects , but it is unlikely there was some killer punch from space , these other researchers contend .

LOS MAITENES , Chile ( Reuters ) - Chilean teenagers on a field trip have found what experts say could be a treasure trove of fossils from whales which died millions of years ago .
Teenagers from a school in Concon , a town on the Pacific coast , found the fossils last month in the hills near the village of Los Maitenes , nearly four miles from the sea and 100 miles from the capital Santiago .
They found fossilized jawbones , backbones and ribs of four whales which scientists say likely died 5 million years ago .
Geologists expect to find more whale fossils in the area .
“ What we have to work out is whether we ’re dealing with a few examples that have washed in on the tide or whether we ’re talking about a real whale cemetery , ” said Hernan Vergara , a marine geologist studying the find .
Vergara , who teaches at the nearby University of Valparaiso , said the gentle hills around Los Maitenes were once part of the sea bed .
The teenagers found the fossils while on a field trip with their biology teacher Veronica Andrade .
“ We got to the place thinking we might find a bone , something small and some invertebrate fossils , ” Andrade told Reuters .
“ But because the kids are restless they fanned out all over the area and they found lots of fragments close to the surface . ”
Local authorities are hailing the discovery as one of the most important of its kind in central Chile and say they plan to declare the area a national monument , which would give the area protected status .
“ I do n’t know of any other find like this , ” said Valparaiso Gov. Ricardo Bravo , who added the provincial government was considering building a natural history museum on the site .

You can read the machine translated English article here .
Mr Sarkozy , the former interior minister and leader of the ruling conservative UMP , is favourite to become president on 6 May .
Why does the election matter ?
France gives its president real power , unlike many other states , where the prime minister is the key figure .
Far from being a figurehead , the French leader chooses the prime minister , can dissolve parliament and can pardon convicted criminals .
The president is also commander - in - chief of the armed forces , including a formidable nuclear arsenal .
Were there any surprises in the first round ?
The exit polls were broadly in line with most opinion polls in the run-up , but Francois Bayrou of the centrist UDF , the junior partner in the coalition , did not make the breakthrough that at one stage seemed possible .
But his 18.3 % was much stronger than his result in 2002 .
Jean - Marie Le Pen , leader of the far - right National Front , got 11 % , according to initial results - less than many had expected .
He had shocked France by reaching the second round in 2002 .
What does the first round outcome mean for the second round ?
The 6
May run -off vote is by no means a foregone conclusion for Mr Sarkozy , even though he scored an impressive 30 % in the first round , according to initial results .
Ms Royal got nearly 25 % - a relief to Socialists who were humiliated by Mr Le Pen 's success in 2002 .
She is likely to get support from those who voted for her left - wing and green rivals .
The big question is which way Mr Bayrou 's voters will turn in the run - off - left or right ?
He could play the role of kingmaker before the second round .
Either way , his influence on whoever becomes president will be significant .
Mr Bayrou 's call for a new centrist consensus may give him some leverage over the next president , as this election is seen as a clear break with the traditional left - right split in French politics .
The huge turnout - likely to be repeated on 6 May - should give the next leader a powerful mandate .
Who were the other contenders ?
Other candidates included the leftists Olivier Besancenot , Marie - George Buffet and Arlette Laguiller , the conservative Philippe de Villiers , the anti-globalisation farmer Jose Bove and Dominique Voynet of the Greens .
Altogether 12 candidates contested the first round .
The current president , Jacques Chirac , did not stand .
How is the 2007 race different ?
For the first time , one of the top candidates is a woman .
Segolene Royal 's bid has ignited a debate about the place of women in a country traditionally dominated by men .
Nicolas Sarkozy , 52 , would be the youngest president since Valery Giscard d'Estaing won in 1974 at the age of 48 - Jacques Chirac and Francois Mitterrand were both in their 60s when they entered the Elysee Palace .
What are the main campaign rules ?
Candidates are accorded strict equality in terms of air time on radio and television .
Each one has 45 minutes of broadcast time .
They can use three types of campaign clip : one - minute , two - and - a - half minutes and five - and - a - half minutes .
From 20 April no opinion polls could be published ahead of the first round .
Similarly , opinion polls are banned in the two days before the second round on 6 May .
Each candidate has a campaign spending limit of 16.16 m euros ( £ 11 m ; $ 22 m ) in the first round .
The limit for each of the two candidates in the second round is 21.5 m euros .
What are the national issues ?
Unemployment of 8.4 % , sluggish economic growth , political sleaze , unrest among disaffected ethnic minorities , discontent with the EU , continuing divisions on the French left .
What are the personal issues ?
Segolene Royal 's bid has been dogged by questions over her qualifications for the job as she has never held any of the big ministries of government .
Apparent foreign policy gaffes have damaged her credibility .
Nicolas Sarkozy 's political experience is not in doubt but he was accused of taking an unfair advantage by remaining interior minister - a high - profile and influential post - until relatively late in the campaign .
Top soundbites ?
" Together everything is possible , " says Sarko on his official campaign website .
" A fairer France will be a stronger France , " says Sego on hers .
Francois Bayrou envisages " a France of all our forces " .
Jean - Marie Le Pen looks to " the victory of France and the future of the French " .
" We want a shining France " - Philippe de Villiers .
" Our lives are worth more than their profits " - Olivier Besancenot .
" France has never been so unequal " - Jose Bove .
Can we forget about French politics after 6 May ?
Not quite .
A parliamentary election will be held on 10 and 17 June .
A candidate must take an absolute majority in their constituency to win in the first round .
Otherwise , if they get at least 12.5 % of the first - round vote , they go through to the second round , where only a simple majority is needed to win .
Parliament is currently dominated by the UMP .
After last week ’s intermezzo with Git , my curiosity for distributed version control systems ( DVCS ) reinflamed again .
I also imported the Ruby CVS history into Monotone , which has a pretty fast CVS importer , and Mercurial , which CVS importer seamt to be even faster ( cvs20hg ) , but unfortunately is not complete yet .
However , Mercurial also can import from Git , so I went that way .
My projects will continue to be kept in Darcs for near future , but so far no DVCS really could convince me .
Wondering about which lacked what , I thought it would be useful to write up what I want to have .
So far , I tried : Darcs , Git / Cogito , Mercurial and Monotone .
I also dabbled into Bazaar ( seems to be discontinued ) , Bazaar - NG , FastCST ( seems to be discontinued ) and SVK ( IMO just a hack ) .
So , here is my wishlist ( roughly ordered in decreasing importance ) :
Prefer file storage over patch storage , it ’s just easier to deal with in practice .
It took be a long time to figure this out , but I actually think it ’s the more pragmatic solution .
I noticed this when I saw how the Git repository just merged with the Gitk repository , even if both did n’t share a single revision .
Darcs , on the other hand , even had problems doing merges which were factually the same , but just could n’t be arranged the right way .
The theory of patches sounds nice , but it does n’t work out .
Note that this does n’t exclude diff storage , this of course should be done to save disk space and bandwidth .
Provided by : Bazaar - NG ( I think ) , Git/ Cogito , Mercurial , Monotone .
Revisions need to be identified by a globally unique identifier , e.g. a SHA1 - hash or a GUID .
Provided by : Bazaar ( theoretically ) , Bazaar - NG , Darcs , Git/ Cogito , Mercurial , Monotone .
Revision storage should be implemented as write - once files .
Once a file has been written , it should not be touched afterwards .
This eases incremental backup and generally improves safety .
Alternatively , if files are append - only , this is acceptable too .
Changing files leaves a bad taste .
( It ’s okay for index files and other unessential information . )
Provided by : Bazaar , Darcs , Git / Cogito , Mercurial .
File permissions must be saved , at least the executable bit .
Also , the VCS should n’t touch the contents of the files at all ( no newline conversion , no keywords by default ) .
Provided by : Bazaar , Bazaar - NG , Git/ Cogito , Mercurial , Monotone .
Easy setup of repositories :
Setting up a new repository needs to be possible with a single command , usually that ’s xxx init — it will turn the current directory into a fresh repository ( or even import the files of the current directory , as Cogito does ) .
Provided by : Bazaar - NG , Darcs , Git / Cogito , Mercurial .
Support multiple heads of development in a single repository .
This encourages microbranching and eases incremental development without keeping loads of working directories around .
Provided by : Git/ Cogito , Mercurial [ Added 22 apr2006 , thanks to Daniel Néri for noticing ] , Monotone .
It has to be possible to export patches with full metadata ( e.g. renames ) as ASCII files , e.g. to send via mail or share in other ways .
It needs to support binary files , too .
( Think of contributing graphics to a game . )
Provided by : Bazaar - NG , Darcs ( very good ) , Git / Cogito ( no binary , renames partly ) , Mercurial ( bundles , but they are not ASCII , renames partly ) , Monotone ( packets , good ) .
It needs to be possible to contribute patches via mail .
This is the way most non-regular commiters send patches .
Provided by : Bazaar - NG , Darcs , Git/ Cogito , Mercurial , Monotone .
Serving repositories over dumb HTTP :
This is essential to allow people easily setting up repositories on their cheap webspace .
Systems that require CGIs would be acceptable too , here ( Mercurial without old - http ) ; opening new ports is n’t .
It does n’t need to be the most efficient way of accessing , but must not be unreasonably inefficient .
Provided by : Bazaar - NG , Bazaar ( slow ) , Darcs , Git / Cogito , Mercurial , Monotone ( soon ) .
I definitely need good Emacs integration , preferably with DVC , alternatively , a good standalone - mode can be enough too .
Provided by : Bazaar ( DVC ) , Bazaar - NG ( DVC ) , Darcs ( own , partly DVC ) , Git / Cogito ( own , DVC ) , Mercurial ( own , DVC ) , Monotone ( own ) .
It needs to provide a GUI repository viewer that can show change history as a tree and diffs for each revision .
I ’ve found such a tool indispensably since I ’ve discovered Gitk , especially if you microbranch a lot .
Provided by : Bazaar - NG , Git/ Cogito , Mercurial ( hack ) , Monotone .
It needs a good and fast tool to import CVS trees .
I ’ve found this absolutely needed to convert legacy repositiories and capture the history of older projects locally .
Provided by : Git/ Cogito ( git- cvsimport , parsecvs ) , Mercurial ( cvs20hg , partly ) , Monotone ( own , very good ) .
Make America Think Again ! - Share Pat's Columns ...
by Patrick J. Buchanan
Since the massacre of 32 students and teachers at Virginia Tech , the mainstream media have obsessed over the fact the crazed gunman was able to buy a Glock in the state of Virginia .
Little attention has been paid to the Richmond legislators who voted to make “ Hokie Nation , ” a Middle American campus of 26,000 kids , a gun- free zone where only the madman had a semi-automatic .
Almost no attention has been paid to the fact that Cho Seung - Hui was not an American at all , but an immigrant , an alien .
Had this deranged young man who secretly hated us never come here , 32 people would be heading home from Blacksburg for summer vacation .
What was Cho doing here ?
How did he get in ?
Cho was among the 864,000 Koreans here as a result of the Immigration Act of 1965 , which threw the nation ’s doors open to the greatest invasion in history , an invasion opposed by a majority of our people .
Thirty - six million , almost all from countries whose peoples have never fully assimilated in any Western country , now live in our midst .
Cho was one of them .
In stories about him , we learn he had no friends , rarely spoke and was a loner , isolated from classmates and roommates .
Cho was the alien in Hokie Nation .
And to vent his rage at those with whom he could not communicate , he decided to kill in cold blood dozens of us .
What happened in Blacksburg cannot be divorced from what ’s been happening to America since the immigration act brought tens of millions of strangers to these shores , even as the old bonds of national community began to disintegrate and dissolve in the social revolutions of the 1960s .
To intellectuals , what makes America a nation is ideas â€ “ ideas in the Declaration of Independence , Bill of Rights , Gettysburg Address and Dr. King ’s “ I Have a Dream ” speech .
But documents no matter how eloquent and words no matter how lovely do not a nation make .
Before 1970 , we were a people , a community , a country .
Students would have said aloud of Cho : “ Who is this guy ?
What ’s the matter with him ? ”
Teachers would have taken action to get him help â€ “ or get him out .
Since the 1960s , we have become alienated from one another even as millions of strangers arrive every year .
And as Americans no longer share the old ties of history , heritage , faith , language , tradition , culture , music , myth or morality , how can immigrants share those ties ?
Many immigrants do not assimilate .
Many do not wish to .
They seek community in their separate subdivisions of our multicultural , multiracial , multiethnic , multilingual mammoth mall of a nation .
And in numbers higher than our native born , some are going berserk here .
The 1993 bombers of the World Trade Center and the killers of 9 - 11 were all immigrants or illegals .
Colin Ferguson , the Jamaican who massacred six and wounded 19 in an anti-white shooting spree on the Long Island Railroad , was an illegal .
John Lee Malvo , the Beltway Sniper , was flotsam from the Caribbean .
Angel Resendez , the border - jumping rapist who killed at least nine women , was an illegal alien .
Julio Gonzalez , who burned down the Happy Land social club in New York , killing 87 , arrived in the Mariel boatlift .
Ali Hassan Abu Kama , who wounded seven , killing one , in a rampage on the observation deck of the Empire State Building , was a Palestinian .
As was Sirhan Sirhan , the assassin of Robert Kennedy .
The rifleman who murdered two CIA employees at the McLean , Va. , headquarters was a Pakistani .
When Chai Vang , a Hmong , was told by a party of Wisconsin hunters to vacate their deer stand , he shot six to death .
Peter Odighizuwa , the gunman who killed the dean , a teacher and a student at the Appalachian School of Law , was a Nigerian .
Hesham Hadayet , who shot up the El Al counter at LAX , killing two and wounding four , was an Egyptian immigrant .
Gamil al - Batouti , the copilot who yelled , “ I put my faith in Allah ’s hands , ” as he crashed his plane into the Atlantic after departing JFK Airport , killing 217 , was an Egyptian .
Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar , the UNC graduate who ran his SUV over nine people on Chapel Hill campus and said he was “ thankful for the opportunity to spread the will of Allah , ” was an Iranian .
Juan Corona , who murdered 25 people in California to be ranked with the likes of Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy , was a Mexican .
Where does one find such facts ?
On VDARE.com , a website that covers the dark side of diversity covered up by a politically correct media , which seem to believe it is socially unhealthy for us Americans to see any correlation at all between mass migrations and mass murder .
“ In our diversity is our strength ! ”
So we are endlessly lectured .
But are we really a better , safer , freer , happier , more united and caring country than we were before , against our will , we became what Theodore Roosevelt called “ a polyglot boarding house for the world ” ?
This is a " copy & paste " HowTo !
The easiest way to follow this tutorial is to use a command line client / SSH client ( like PuTTY for Windows ) and simply copy and paste the commands ( except where you have to provide own information like IP addresses , hostnames , passwords , ... ) .
This helps to avoid typos .
How To Set Up A Loadbalanced High - Availability Apache Cluster
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
This tutorial shows how to set up a two - node Apache web server cluster that provides high - availability .
In front of the Apache cluster we create a load balancer that splits up incoming requests between the two Apache nodes .
Because we do not want the load balancer to become another " Single Point Of Failure " , we must provide high - availability for the load balancer , too .
Therefore our load balancer will in fact consist out of two load balancer nodes that monitor each other using heartbeat , and if one load balancer fails , the other takes over silently .
The advantage of using a load balancer compared to using round robin DNS is that it takes care of the load on the web server nodes and tries to direct requests to the node with less load , and it also takes care of connections / sessions .
Many web applications ( e.g. forum software , shopping carts , etc. ) make use of sessions , and if you are in a session on Apache node 1 , you would lose that session if suddenly node 2 served your requests .
In addition to that , if one of the Apache nodes goes down , the load balancer realizes that and directs all incoming requests to the remaining node which would not be possible with round robin DNS .
For this setup , we need four nodes ( two Apache nodes and two load balancer nodes ) and five IP addresses : one for each node and one virtual IP address that will be shared by the load balancer nodes and used for incoming HTTP requests .
I will use the following setup here :
Apache node 1 : webserver1.example.com ( webserver1 ) - IP address : 192.168.0.101 ; Apache document root : / var/www
( ) - IP address : ; Apache document root : Apache node 2 : webserver2.example.com ( webserver2 ) - IP address : 192.168.0.102 ; Apache document root : / var/www
( ) - IP address : ; Apache document root : Load Balancer node 1 : loadb1.example.com ( loadb1 ) - IP address : 192.168.0.103
( ) - IP address : Load Balancer node 2 : loadb2.example.com ( loadb2 ) - IP address : 192.168.0.104
( ) - IP address : Virtual IP Address : 192.168.0.105 ( used for incoming requests )
Have a look at the drawing on http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/docs/ha/ultramonkey.html to understand how this setup looks like .
In this tutorial I will use Debian Sarge for all four nodes .
I assume that you have installed a basic Debian installation on all four nodes , and that you have installed Apache on webserver1 and webserver2 , with / var / www being the document root of the main web site .
I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system .
There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Enable IPVS On The Load Balancers
First we must enable IPVS on our load balancers .
IPVS ( IP Virtual Server ) implements transport - layer load balancing inside the Linux kernel , so called Layer - 4 switching .
loadb1/loadb2 :
echo ip_vs_dh >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_ftp >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_lblc >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_lblcr >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_lc >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_nq >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_rr >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_sed >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_sh >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_wlc >>
/etc/modules
echo ip_vs_wrr >>
/etc/modules
Then we do this :
loadb1/loadb2 :
modprobe ip_vs_dh
modprobe ip_vs_ftp
modprobe ip_vs
modprobe ip_vs_lblc
modprobe ip_vs_lblcr
modprobe ip_vs_lc
modprobe ip_vs_nq
modprobe ip_vs_rr
modprobe ip_vs_sed
modprobe ip_vs_sh
modprobe ip_vs_wlc
modprobe ip_vs_wrr
If you get errors , then most probably your kernel was n't compiled with IPVS support , and you need to compile a new kernel with IPVS support ( or install a kernel image with IPVS support ) now .
2 Install Ultra Monkey On The Load Balancers
Ultra Monkey is a project to create load balanced and highly available services on a local area network using Open Source components on the Linux operating system ; the Ultra Monkey package provides heartbeat ( used by the two load balancers to monitor each other and check if the other node is still alive ) and ldirectord , the actual load balancer .
AdvertisementAdvertisement
To install Ultra Monkey , we must edit /etc/ apt / sources .
list now and add these two lines ( do n't remove the other repositories ) :
loadb1/loadb2 :
vi /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://www.ultramonkey.org/download/3/ sarge main
deb-src
http://www.ultramonkey.org/download/3 sarge main
Afterwards we do this :
loadb1/loadb2 :
apt - get update
and install Ultra Monkey : Advertisement
loadb1/loadb2 :
apt - get install ultramonkey
If you see this warning :
¦ libsensors3 not functional ¦
¦ ¦
¦ It appears that your kernel is not compiled with sensors support .
As a ¦
¦ result , libsensors3 will not be functional on your system . ¦
¦ ¦
¦ If you want to enable it , have a look at " I2C Hardware Sensors Chip ¦
¦ support " in your kernel configuration . ¦
you can ignore it .
During the Ultra Monkey installation you will be asked a few question .
Answer as follows :
Do you want to automatically load IPVS rules on boot ?
<-- No
Select a daemon method .
<-- none
I applied to college one evening , after dinner , in the fall of my senior year in high school .
College applicants in Ontario , in those days , were given a single sheet of paper which listed all the universities in the province .
It was my job to rank them in order of preference .
Then I had to mail the sheet of paper to a central college - admissions office .
The whole process probably took ten minutes .
My school sent in my grades separately .
I vaguely remember filling out a supplementary two - page form listing my interests and activities .
There were no S.A.T. scores to worry about , because in Canada we did n’t have to take the S.A.T.s.
I do n’t know whether anyone wrote me a recommendation .
I certainly never asked anyone to .
Why would I ?
It was n’t as if I were applying to a private club .
I put the University of Toronto first on my list , the University of Western Ontario second , and Queen ’s University third .
I was working off a set of brochures that I ’d sent away for .
My parents ’ contribution consisted of my father ’s agreeing to drive me one afternoon to the University of Toronto campus , where we visited the residential college I was most interested in .
I walked around .
My father poked his head into the admissions office , chatted with the admissions director , and — I imagine — either said a few short words about the talents of his son or ( knowing my father ) remarked on the loveliness of the delphiniums in the college flower beds .
Then we had ice cream .
I got in .
Am I a better or more successful person for having been accepted at the University of Toronto , as opposed to my second or third choice ?
It strikes me as a curious question .
In Ontario , there was n’t a strict hierarchy of colleges .
There were several good ones and several better ones and a number of programs — like computer science at the University of Waterloo — that were world - class .
But since all colleges were part of the same public system and tuition everywhere was the same ( about a thousand dollars a year , in those days ) , and a B average in high school pretty much guaranteed you a spot in college , there was n’t a sense that anything great was at stake in the choice of which college we attended .
The issue was whether we attended college , and — most important — how seriously we took the experience once we got there .
I thought everyone felt this way .
You can imagine my confusion , then , when I first met someone who had gone to Harvard .
There was , first of all , that strange initial reluctance to talk about the matter of college at all — a glance downward , a shuffling of the feet , a mumbled mention of Cambridge .
“ Did you go to Harvard ? ” I would ask .
I had just moved to the United States .
I did n’t know the rules .
An uncomfortable nod would follow .
Do n’t define me by my school , they seemed to be saying , which implied that their school actually could define them .
And , of course , it did .
Wherever there was one Harvard graduate , another lurked not far behind , ready to swap tales of late nights at the Hasty Pudding , or recount the intricacies of the college - application essay , or wonder out loud about the whereabouts of Prince So-and - So , who lived down the hall and whose family had a place in the South of France that you would not believe .
In the novels they were writing , the precocious and sensitive protagonist always went to Harvard ; if he was troubled , he dropped out of Harvard ; in the end , he returned to Harvard to complete his senior thesis .
Once , I attended a wedding of a Harvard alum in his fifties , at which the best man spoke of his college days with the groom as if neither could have accomplished anything of greater importance in the intervening thirty years .
By the end , I half expected him to take off his shirt and proudly display the large crimson “ H ” tattooed on his chest .
What is this “ Harvard ” of which you Americans speak so reverently ?
In 1905 , Harvard College adopted the College Entrance Examination Board tests as the principal basis for admission , which meant that virtually any academically gifted high - school senior who could afford a private college had a straightforward shot at attending .
By 1908 , the freshman class was seven per cent Jewish , nine per cent Catholic , and forty - five per cent from public schools , an astonishing transformation for a school that historically had been the preserve of the New England boarding - school complex known in the admissions world as St. Grottlesex .
As the sociologist Jerome Karabel writes in “ The Chosen ” ( Houghton Mifflin ; $ 28 ) , his remarkable history of the admissions process at Harvard , Yale , and Princeton , that meritocratic spirit soon led to a crisis .
The enrollment of Jews began to rise dramatically .
By 1922 , they made up more than a fifth of Harvard ’s freshman class .
The administration and alumni were up in arms .
Jews were thought to be sickly and grasping , grade - grubbing and insular .
They displaced the sons of wealthy Wasp alumni , which did not bode well for fund - raising .
A. Lawrence Lowell , Harvard ’s president in the nineteen - twenties , stated flatly that too many Jews would destroy the school : “ The summer hotel that is ruined by admitting Jews meets its fate . . . because they drive away the Gentiles , and then after the Gentiles have left , they leave also . ”
The difficult part , however , was coming up with a way of keeping Jews out , because as a group they were academically superior to everyone else .
Lowell ’s first idea — a quota limiting Jews to fifteen per cent of the student body — was roundly criticized .
Lowell tried restricting the number of scholarships given to Jewish students , and made an effort to bring in students from public schools in the West , where there were fewer Jews .
Neither strategy worked .
Finally , Lowell — and his counterparts at Yale and Princeton — realized that if a definition of merit based on academic prowess was leading to the wrong kind of student , the solution was to change the definition of merit .
Karabel argues that it was at this moment that the history and nature of the Ivy League took a significant turn .
The admissions office at Harvard became much more interested in the details of an applicant ’s personal life .
Lowell told his admissions officers to elicit information about the “ character ” of candidates from “ persons who know the applicants well , ” and so the letter of reference became mandatory .
Harvard started asking applicants to provide a photograph .
Candidates had to write personal essays , demonstrating their aptitude for leadership , and list their extracurricular activities .
“ Starting in the fall of 1922 , ” Karabel writes , “ applicants were required to answer questions on ‘ Race and Color , ’ ‘ Religious Preference , ’ ‘ Maiden Name of Mother , ’ ‘ Birthplace of Father , ’ and ‘ What change , if any , has been made since birth in your own name or that of your father ?
( Explain fully ) . ’ ”
At Princeton , emissaries were sent to the major boarding schools , with instructions to rate potential candidates on a scale of 1 to 4 , where 1 was “ very desirable and apparently exceptional material from every point of view ” and 4 was “ undesirable from the point of view of character , and , therefore , to be excluded no matter what the results of the entrance examinations might be . ”
The personal interview became a key component of admissions in order , Karabel writes , “ to ensure that ‘ undesirables ’ were identified and to assess important but subtle indicators of background and breeding such as speech , dress , deportment and physical appearance . ”
By 1933 , the end of Lowell ’s term , the percentage of Jews at Harvard was back down to fifteen per cent .
If this new admissions system seems familiar , that ’s because it is essentially the same system that the Ivy League uses to this day .
According to Karabel , Harvard , Yale , and Princeton did n’t abandon the elevation of character once the Jewish crisis passed .
They institutionalized it .
Starting in 1953 , Arthur Howe , Jr. , spent a decade as the chair of admissions at Yale , and Karabel describes what happened under his guidance :
The admissions committee viewed evidence of “ manliness ” with particular enthusiasm .
One boy gained admission despite an academic prediction of 70 because “ there was apparently something manly and distinctive about him that had won over both his alumni and staff interviewers . ”
Another candidate , admitted despite his schoolwork being “ mediocre in comparison with many others , ” was accepted over an applicant with a much better record and higher exam scores because , as Howe put it , “ we just thought he was more of a guy . ”
So preoccupied was Yale with the appearance of its students that the form used by alumni interviewers actually had a physical characteristics checklist through 1965 .
Each year ,
Yale carefully measured the height of entering freshmen , noting with pride the proportion of the class at six feet or more .
At Harvard , the key figure in that same period was Wilbur Bender , who , as the dean of admissions , had a preference for “ the boy with some athletic interests and abilities , the boy with physical vigor and coordination and grace . ”
Bender , Karabel tells us , believed that if Harvard continued to suffer on the football field it would contribute to the school ’s reputation as a place with “ no college spirit , few good fellows , and no vigorous , healthy social life , ” not to mention a “ surfeit of ‘ pansies , ’ ‘ decadent esthetes ’ and ‘ precious sophisticates . ’ ” Bender concentrated on improving Harvard ’s techniques for evaluating “ intangibles ” and , in particular , its “ ability to detect homosexual tendencies and serious psychiatric problems . ”
By the nineteen - sixties , Harvard ’s admissions system had evolved into a series of complex algorithms .
The school began by lumping all applicants into one of twenty - two dockets , according to their geographical origin .
( There was one docket for Exeter and Andover , another for the eight Rocky Mountain states . )
Information from interviews , references , and student essays was then used to grade each applicant on a scale of 1 to 6 , along four dimensions : personal , academic , extracurricular , and athletic .
Competition , critically , was within each docket , not between dockets , so there was no way for , say , the graduates of Bronx Science and Stuyvesant to shut out the graduates of Andover and Exeter .
More important , academic achievement was just one of four dimensions , further diluting the value of pure intellectual accomplishment .
Athletic ability , rather than falling under “ extracurriculars , ” got a category all to itself , which explains why , even now , recruited athletes have an acceptance rate to the Ivies at well over twice the rate of other students , despite S.A.T. scores that are on average more than a hundred points lower .
And the most important category ?
That mysterious index of “ personal ” qualities .
According to Harvard ’s own analysis , the personal rating was a better predictor of admission than the academic rating .
Those with a rank of 4 or worse on the personal scale had , in the nineteen - sixties , a rejection rate of ninety - eight per cent .
Those with a personal rating of 1 had a rejection rate of 2.5 per cent .
When the Office of Civil Rights at the federal education department investigated Harvard in the nineteen - eighties , they found handwritten notes scribbled in the margins of various candidates ’ files .
“ This young woman could be one of the brightest applicants in the pool but there are several references to shyness , ” read one .
Another comment reads , “ Seems a tad frothy . ”
One application — and at this point you can almost hear it going to the bottom of the pile — was notated , “ Short with big ears . ”
Social scientists distinguish between what are known as treatment effects and selection effects .
The Marine Corps , for instance , is largely a treatment - effect institution .
It does n’t have an enormous admissions office grading applicants along four separate dimensions of toughness and intelligence .
It ’s confident that the experience of undergoing Marine Corps basic training will turn you into a formidable soldier .
A modelling agency , by contrast , is a selection - effect institution .
You do n’t become beautiful by signing up with an agency .
You get signed up by an agency because you ’re beautiful .
At the heart of the American obsession with the Ivy League is the belief that schools like Harvard provide the social and intellectual equivalent of Marine Corps basic training — that being taught by all those brilliant professors and meeting all those other motivated students and getting a degree with that powerful name on it will confer advantages that no local state university can provide .
Fuelling the treatment - effect idea are studies showing that if you take two students with the same S.A.T. scores and grades , one of whom goes to a school like Harvard and one of whom goes to a less selective college , the Ivy Leaguer will make far more money ten or twenty years down the road .
UPDATED 5/14/07 : Scroll down to " Notes " for some additional thoughts .
Here 's how I make a homemade " self - contained gardening system " in about 10 minutes , and for about $ 10 ( instead of the $ 40.00 - plus - shipping that the genuine article costs from various sellers ) .
A GENTLE REQUEST :
These instructions have become far more popular than I ever imagined they would .
They are turning up referenced on gardening websites , home crafts fora , and other sites too numerous to list .
They have appeared in PDFs and have been even been sold on eBay .
I offer them for everyone 's use , free of charge .
However , I do request that if you find these instructions useful , and you copy the design and / or the text and / or photos from this site , please credit me or the website .
If you would include a link to the website , I 'd be even more appreciative .
Additionally , if you know anyone who 's charging money for this information on eBay , I 'd love to know about it since it's both a violation of the copyright ( the material on this site is copyrighted ) and of the spirit in which this information has been posted .
Thank you !
MATERIALS ( figure 0 ) :
2 18 - gallon ( or similar ) tote boxes with lids , such as Rubbermaid .
Dark colors are preferable .
Also , a box that is somewhat wider is preferable to one that 's deeper .
( You can also use larger totes , but note that once you fill them with soil , they 'll be very hard to move . )
The more straight - sided the box , the better .
1 5 " pond basket ( these are plastic planters with perforated sides to allow the free flow of water ) .
See note 3 at bottom of page regarding pond baskets .
1 2 - foot length of 1 - 1/2 " plastic pipe or tubing ( 1 - 1/2 " should be the outside diameter ) .
DO NOT USE PVC PIPE AS SHOWN IN THE PHOTO BELOW ; I NO LONGER USE PVC IN MY " SELF - CONTAINED GARDENING SYSTEM " . ( See Note 5 at bottom of page . )
I use flexible black tubing now instead ; it works identically .
Also : not shown in the pictures is the fact that I cut one end of the tube at an angle .
This helps the free flow of water through the tube and into the water reservoir in the bottom of the finished box .
Figure 0
EQUIPMENT :
a pencil or pen
a drill with a 1 / 4 " or larger bit and a 1 - 1/2 " bit
a saw ( handsaw will work , but a jigsaw makes it much easier )
STEP ONE
Take one of the totes , the pen/ pencil , and the pond basket .
Mark the HEIGHT of the basket all around the outside of the tote ( see Figure 1 ) .
.
Figure 2
STEP 2
Cut along this line .
When you 've cut the entire box , discard the top ( open ) half ; you wo n't need it .
See Figure 2 .
Figure 2
STEP 3
Turn the bottom portion upside down .
Take the pond basket , put it upside - down on top of the bottom portion of the tote , and trace the circle .
Cut the circle out , but you 're going to cut about a half - inch or more INSIDE the circle ( so that this hole is about an inch smaller in diameter than the top of the pond basket ) .
After you 've done this , drill a 1 - 1/2 " hole in the corner of the tote bottom , and a lot of small ( 1/4 " or so ) holes all over it .
See Figure 3 .
We 'll call this piece the " base . "
Figure 3
STEP 4
Take the pond basket and put it right - side up in the bottom of the second tote box ( the one that has n't been used yet ) .
See Figure 4 .
Figure 4
STEP 5
Put the base in the tote box ( drilled side up ) , wedging it down as far as it will go , and positioning the pond basket directly under the big hole .
See Figure 5 .
Because the big hole in the base is smaller in diameter than the top of the pond basket , the pond basket will help support the weight of the base once the soil is on top .
And because the pond basket will be filled with soil , it will act as a wick for the moisture ( much like the square wicks in opposing corners in the authentic " self - contained gardening system " that was my inspiration for this container ) .
Figure 5
STEP 6
Drill a 1/4 " ( or slightly larger ) hole straight through the outer box AND the base just below the level of the base .
This is the drainage hole .
See figure 6 .
Figure 6
STEP 7
Cut the end of the 2 - foot length of 1 - 1/2 " pipe at an angle ( if you have n't done so already ) and feed this angled end into the 1 - 1/2 " hole in the base .
This is the pipe you 'll use to fill the box with water .
See Figure 7 .
Figure 7
STEP 8
You 're pretty much done .
Drill a matching 1 - 1/2 " hole near the corner of the lid for the pipe to go out , and enough other equally spaced 1 - 1/ 2 " holes in the lid for however many plants you 're going to put into the box ( I use the planting guide that came with my commercially - available " self - contained gardening system " to tell me how many plants of any given type I can reasonably fit in the box ) .
SEE NOTE AT BOTTOM OF PAGE REGARDING THE PLANTING GUIDE .
Fill the box with soil ( the pond basket and the entire remaining box above the base ) .
Pour on the fertilizer stripe as shown in the planting guide that accompanies the commercially - available " self - contained gardening system " .
( They also recommend adding lime or dolomite to the soil if you 're planting tomatoes . )
Put on the lid .
There you are !
See Figure 8 for the box I made for last year 's herbs .
UPDATE : May 20th , 2005
Last summer , I tried an improvement on my homemade commercially - available self - contained gardening system .
Did n't want to post it ' til I 'd tried it .
It worked just as I 'd intended , so here it is .
The improvement is to the LID ONLY .
I 'd decided that drilling the holes in the lid to plant the seedlings through was pretty inconvenient if you were planting more than a couple of seedlings -- the dirt balls would n't always fit through the holes in the lid , so you had to plant them in the box WITHOUT the lid and then put the lid on and feed the seedlings through the holes ... which could hurt the seedlings and was troublesome if the planted seedlings did n't line up perfectly with the holes .
So instead ...
S TEP 8 REVISED
Take the lid that fits onto the box .
Cut out the center of the lid , leaving just a rim ( about 2 " worth ) , enough to snap back onto the box .
( You can discard the center piece , we wo n't be using it . )
It should look like this :
( Notice that I 've cut a circular area in one corner for the pipe .
This is not strictly necessary .
I did it so that I could have the pipe all the way in the corner , leaving more room for plants . )
STEP 9
Now cut a piece of plain black tarp ( vinyl , etc. ) so that it is at least a couple of inches bigger around than the top of your self - contained gardening system .
Cut a hole in it for the pipe to fit through .
When you 're ready to plant , cut " X "s in the tarp where the plants will go .
( This is very much like how the real tops work on commercially - available self - contained gardening system . )
( In this photo , there 's some black tubing instead of the PVC pipe .
NOTE : Do not use PVC pipe .
See note at bottom of page . )
STEP 10
Now just snap the rim onto the box :
Note that because of the tarp , the lid may NOT snap neatly into place anymore .
This may not be an issue for you , but if you 're in a windy area , you might find it necessary to tie the rim in place :
There are several advantages to this arrangement .
First , planting is significantly easier through the flexible tarp than through the inflexible plastic lid .
Second , because the tarp is black , it helps heat the surface of the soil , which is better for the plants .
Third , if you want to plant items in a different arrangement from year to year ( with , say , fewer holes ) , all you need to do is cut a new piece of tarp instead of drilling a whole new lid .
NOTES ( added 4/2 5/07 )
One of the companies that sells " self - contained gardening systems " have been gracious in putting their planting guide online : Planting Guide - PDF Format .
It 's a large file ; give it time to load .
Print it out , and be sure to read the whole document before using your self - contained gardening system ( whether it 's commercial or homemade ) .
People have asked me why I have n't put photos of my plants online , so that I can demonstrate the effectiveness of these boxes .
Except for a few years ago when I was first introducing my family to commercially - available " self - contained gardening systems , " it 's never occurred to me to take photos of plants .
I will take photos of my plants this season ( the 2007 growing season ) and put them up .
Many folks have trouble finding " pond baskets . " ( BTW , the 5 " refers to their HEIGHT , not their diameter , but the height is not at all crucial ... it will just dictate how tall your insert is . )
They 're also sometimes called " water baskets . "
I find mine in the " water feature " area of my local gardening center or Home Depot / Lowe 's - type store -- the area where they have fountains , pumps , and hoses .
In the event that you can't find a suitable pond basket -- and they CAN be square , circular , tall , short , etc , -- you can improvise this a couple of ways and even perhaps save some more money .
You can use a large coffee can , removing the top and bottom and punching lots of holes in the sides .
( Just substitute the can for the pond basket in all the steps above ... marking the height of the can in Step One , etc . )
Or you can use a bunch of smaller cans , as long as they 're all the same height , and spacing them out so that they help support the platform -- cutting the platform to the height of the cans in Step One , and cutting smaller holes , properly spaced , in Step Three instead of the one large hole .
A number of people have asked me what I do about staking .
The commercially - available self - contained gardening systems have small holes at either end of each box , each of which will accommodate a small stake .
These stakes are fine for small plants , but they do n't come close to supporting the weight of tomato plants !
So I have two methods I utilize .
For one , I have my boxes up against a chainlink fence , and I tie the plants to the fence using plant ties .
But frequently the plants are too big and lush to all be attached to the fence .
So I buy the very sturdy , tall , heavy wooden stakes sold at my local hardware store 's gardening department , and pound them into the ground around the boxes .
I no longer use PVC in any of my boxes .
PVCs have been demonstrated to leach plasticizers and harmful chemicals , including endocrine disruptors .
There are plenty of alternatives , so there 's no good reason to use PVC and risk putting these chemicals in your homegrown fruits and vegetables .
MORE NOTES ( added 5/14 )
I 've been asked what to do in place of PVC pipe for the watering tube .
I 'd recommend copper tubing ( although this will a very small bit to the price of your homemade self - contained gardening system ) , available widely at home supply stores .
Aluminum tubing would probably also work fine .
Garden hose can be used as long as it's marked as drinking - safe .
Other kinds of plastic may be acceptable .
What sort of plastics are to be avoided ?
Of course , you want to avoid these all throughout the self - contained gardening system , not just with the watering tube .
The kinds of plastics we generally regard as safe are those with the numbers 1 , 2 , 4 , or 5 ( these numbers are usually found inside the recycling symbol ) .
The ones we seek to avoid are 3 ( Polyvinyl Chloride / Vinyl ) , 6 ( Polysterene / Styrofoam ) , and 7 ( Polycarbonate and others ) .
A terrific idea for using the parts of the second box that are n't used in construction .
All credit for this wonderful " less waste " idea goes to one of the people who 've written to me about their Adventures in Self - Contained Gardening Systems , Linda Alldredge .
She writes : " The left - over tops of the boxes make instant frost covers for those of us in the north .
We already have the lids just put the lid on and set the whole thing right over your tender plants in the garden .
Take it off in the morning .
If you want to get fancier , cut out the center of the lid ( like you did to hold the plastic ) and drop in a piece of Plexiglas .
Voilainstant cold frame .
Here 's another idea for using the parts of the second box .
This one comes from Denise Slipka : " I also wanted to let you know what we have done with the leftover top .
My husband pulls a garbage bag through it , and then uses it when he rakes up grass or leaves or whatever junk he rakes in the yard !
That way it stays open for him and he can rake it right in .
I must say , he thought he was very clever for thinking it up ! "
Another terrific idea just sent a couple of weeks ago ( I have n't secured permission yet to use the contributor 's name ) :
" A greener solution for your homemade [ self - contained gardening system ] water tube would be bamboo .
I made a similar box after purchasing an original .
A friend of mine in Cincinnati has a neighbor who planted bamboo as an border hedge .
My friend constantly complains because he has to remove the bamboo shoots that grow on to his property .
Over the years I 've harvested poles of bamboo for many uses , one use being the watering tube for my homemade [ self - contained gardening system ] .
Works great . "

May be used for non-profit purposes with appropriate credits .
I 'm a humble , lovable ( like Underdog ) , underpaid Research Assistant in a cell biology lab .
One of my routine job duties is to freeze vials containing tens of millions of human cells and send them into the future .
I also unfreeze cells from decades past , revive and grow them .
I have personally revived cells from 1987 ; but the record must be somewhere in the early 1960s , when our crude freeze protocol was developed .
Cells frozen in 10 % DMSO /90 % calf serum should be revivable for centuries .
Other labs freeze embryos and larger structures with better protocols .
So it baffles me that I still run into ' educated ' people who tell me earnestly that 'it 's impossible to freeze living things ; the ice crystals destroy the cell membranes . '
( Another common myth is ' the cells die when reheated . ')
Even outside the lab , several species of frogs , salamanders , and turtles freeze 60 % of the water inside their cells every winter .
In other words , they 're frogsicles and turtlecubes .
While this is not true - 150 ' C cryonics , these animals do n't have heart - lung machines or radio - frequency heaters to help them revive .
At some point , half their cells are frozen and half are n't , which sounds stressful . . . but they survive and revive every spring .
Cryonics is easy for cells , routine for embryos , and probably doable for whole human organs and bodies with the right perfusants , heart - lung machines , and reheating physics ( long - wave RF heaters ?
Fluctuating magnetic fields ? ) .
Unfortunately no one has had the guts to find out .
( Apparently real billionaires are more timid than ' Montgomery Burns . ' )
Cryonics is an orphan idea .
In spite of media attention from Ettinger 's book Man Into Superman in the 1960s to Fox 's Futurama , no one has ever invested serious money in cryonics .
Even a slight improvement in cryonic protocols would allow for freezing kidneys , livers , etc. , greatly reducing the shortage of transplant organs .
None of the drug companies has seen a clear route to FDA approval for anything so innovative and controversial , though .
They prefer instead to invest their billions in rearranging the methyl groups on old drugs to make ' new ' patentable tranquilizers for housewives , Ritalin substitutes , etc .
Present cryonics organizations Alcor and Cryonics Institute are made up of very smart , well - intentioned , but underfunded hobbyists , just like the early personal - computer clubs .
They use variations of our time - tested cell biology freezing protocols to attempt to save the minds of those whose hearts or other important organs recently stopped working .
Future science may be able to repair and revive those frozen today , or it may not ; we do n't know enough about how the brain stores memory to know for sure .
Personally , I think most of the Alcorpsicles will be revived , but with more difficulty than those frozen later with better technology .
Of course if you have cancer now , you do n't have the option of waiting for better technology .
Those who are frozen today will certainly be no worse off medically than those who rot , and at the very least their DNA can be cloned and used to make quaint pets for the cyborg children of the future .
( Hey , c'mon guys , think of the children . )
And it only costs $ 80,000 for a neurosuspension , fundable with term insurance .
What does $ 80 K of term cost a 30 - year - old ?
$ 50 a year ?
It 's trivial , worth it for the novelty value alone .
Cryonics and Freedom
So , what does this all mean for freedom ?
A lot .
Cryonics ( and the rest of biotechnology ) can be used to make individuals live longer than political parties , governments , and empires .
People who have outlived three governments wo n't take the fourth so seriously .
The Unfrozen could also contribute some political perspective even to the young of future generations .
Would n't it be great to have Thomas Jefferson , Thomas Paine , Ethan Allan et. al. here to see our current government ?
Ben Franklin said that he would have had himself preserved to see the future of the Republic ; unfortunately the wine - cask technology that he suggested was not up to the task .
If it had been , think what an asset Ethan Allan would be to the Free State Project !
In the shorter term , Cryonics can solve several government - created problems .
As mentioned , the transplant - organ shortage ( caused largely by government restrictions on paying donors ) would be drastically reduced if organs could be stored for decades .
The political fight over ' assisted suicide ' would be eased if freezing yourself to escape terminal illness were an option .
People with cryonics contracts also form a lobby against government control of the human body .
Cryonicists want to be able to freeze themselves when they get a brain tumor , not wait until it has destroyed their mind .
Cryonics also solves many problems for those wishing to travel . . . REALLY travel .
One way to tell that NASA has no serious plans for space exploration ( or even to rebuild its 1960s nuclear engines ) is that it has no research institute working on cryonics for astronauts .
Believers in index investing can freeze themselves at age 30 and wait for their IRAs to compound .
Better read this first , though ; and remember that the investors in Latvian stocks in 1940 are not billionaires now .
The final argument for Cryonics is : Some people want to do it .
That should be good enough for those who really believe in freedom .
Have problems with living too long ?
Drop dead .
I do n't mean to sound flippant , but the nature of entropy being what it is , staying alive is always harder than disintegrating .
We already have enough military and fast - food technology on this planet to cover the needs of all the suicidal folk of the Galaxy for the next millennium .
There will never be any problem of excess lifespan in this universe , unless the laws of physics change .
As for those who think there is some sort of theological problem with cryonics :
Your gods are way too small , if a matter of a century or two of human life more or less frightens them .
The early Christians actually preserved their dead bodies very carefully in the Catacombs against what they believed to be imminent Resurrection ; they would have used cryonics in the Catacombs if they could .
So : get some perspective , an Alcor or CI contract , and work hard to make a freer world until the big chill comes .
If things are n't better in 2105 , you can complain to me then .
Remember : many are cold , but few are frozen .
Frozen is cooler .

Also on VF.com : a Q&A with Christopher Hitchens about this column .
They say that the past is another country , but let me tell you that it 's much more unsettling to find that the present has become another country , too .
In my lost youth I lived in Finsbury Park , a shabby area of North London , roughly between the old Arsenal football ground and the Seven Sisters Road .
It was a working - class neighborhood , with a good number of Irish and Cypriot immigrants .
Your food choices were the inevitable fish - and - chips , plus the curry joint , plus a strong pitch from the Greek and Turkish kebab sellers .
There was never much " bother , " as the British say , in Finsbury Park .
Greeks and Turks might be fighting in Cyprus , but they never lifted a hand to one another in London .
Many of the Irish had republican allegiances , but they did n't take that out on the local Protestants .
And , even though both Cyprus and Ireland had all the grievances of partitioned former British colonies , it would have seemed inconceivable — unimaginable — that any of their sons would put a bomb on the bus their neighbors used .
Returning to the old place after a long absence , I found that it was the scent of Algeria that now predominated along the main thoroughfare of Blackstock Road .
This had had a good effect on the quality of the coffee and the spiciness of the grocery stores .
But it felt odd , under the gray skies of London , to see women wearing the veil , and even swathed in the chador or the all - enveloping burka .
Many of these Algerians , Bangladeshis , and others are also refugees from conflict in their own country .
Indeed , they have often been the losers in battles against Middle Eastern and Asian regimes which they regard as insufficiently Islamic .
Quite unlike the Irish and the Cypriots , they bring these far - off quarrels along with them .
And they also bring a religion which is not ashamed to speak of conquest and violence .
Until he was jailed last year on charges of soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred , a man known to the police of several countries as Abu Hamza al - Masri was the imam of the Finsbury Park Mosque .
He was a conspicuous figure because , having lost the use of an eye and both hands in an exchange of views in Afghanistan , he sported an opaque eye plus a hook to theatrical effect .
Not as nice as he looked , Abu Hamza was nonetheless unfailingly generous with his hospitality .
Overnight guests at his mosque 's sleeping quarters have included Richard Reid , the man in whose honor we now all have to take off our shoes at the airport , and Zacarias Moussaoui , the missing team member of September 11 , 2001 .
Other visitors included Ahmed Ressam , arrested for trying to blow up LAX for the millennium , and Nizar Trabelsi , a Tunisian who planned to don an explosive vest and penetrate the American Embassy in Paris .
On July 7 , 2005 ( " 7/7 , " as the British call it ) , a clutch of bombs exploded in London 's transport system .
It emerged that one of the suicide murderers had been influenced by the preachings of Abu Hamza , as had two of those attempting to replicate the mission two weeks later .
In fact , the British jihadist is becoming quite a feature on the international scene .
In 1998 , six British citizens of Pakistani and North African descent along with two other British residents were arrested by the government of Yemen and convicted of planning to kidnap a group of tourists and attack British targets in the port of Aden ( scene of the near - sinking of the U.S.S.
Cole two years later ) .
One of the youths was the son of the tireless Abu Hamza , and another was his stepson .
In December 2001 , Richard Reid made his bid on the Paris–Miami flight .
By then , two or three Britons had been killed in Afghanistan — fighting on the side of the Taliban .
The following year came the video butchering of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl , whose abduction and murder were organized by another Briton — a former student at the London School of Economics — named Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh .
And the year after that , two British - passport holders , Asif Mohammed Hanif and Omar Khan Sharif , took part in a suicide attack on Mike 's Place , a Tel Aviv bar .
There ’s a very short list of new manager “ must do ’s ” in the Rands Management Rule Book .
The brevity of this list comes from the fact that a must is an absolute and when it comes to people , there are very few absolutes .
A clever way to manage one person is a disaster when applied to another .
This makes the first item on the Management Must - Do List :
Stay flexible .
The only constant in management is that believing you ’ve seen it all is a bad idea .
Staying flexible is the only stance to adopt when constant change is the only constant .
Paradoxically , the second item on the list is surprisingly inflexible and it ’s still a personal favorite of mine because I believe it helps set the stage for management growth .
It reads :
Stop coding .
The theory is this : if you want to be a manager , you must learn to trust those who work for you to take care of the job of coding .
This advice can be hard to digest , especially for new managers .
It ’s likely that one of the reasons they became managers is due to their productive developers , and their first reaction when things go to crap is to revert to the skills that built up their confidence .
That ’s writing code .
When I see a new manager fall back to coding , I tell the manager , “ I know you can code .
The question is , can you manage ?
You ’re no longer responsible for yourself , you ’re responsible for the team , and I want to see you figure out how to get the team to solve this problem without you coding .
Your job is to figure out how to get yourself to scale .
I want lots of you , not just one . ”
Good advice , huh ?
Scale , management , and responsibility .
Very buzzword compliant .
Too bad I ’m wrong .
Wrong ?
Yup .
Wrong .
Not totally , but enough that I might need to make some calls to past co-workers and apologize .
“ That not coding pitch of mine ?
Wrong .
Yeah .
Start programming again .
Start with Python or Ruby .
Yeah .
I mean it .
Your career depends on it . ”
When I began my career as a developer at Borland , I was part of the Paradox for Windows team and this was a big one .
Just on the application development team , we had 13 developers .
If you included the heads from the various other teams who provided essential technology like the core database engine , graphing engine , and core application services , you ’re talking 50 engineers directly contributing to the product .
No team that I ’ve been on since then has even been close in terms of size .
In fact , with each passing year , the size of the engineering teams contributing to my products has steadily shrunk .
What ’s going on ?
Are we getting collectively smarter as developers ?
Nope , we ’re just distributing the load .
What have we , as developers , been doing for the past 20 years ?
Well , we ’ve been writing a crapload of code .
Piles of it .
So much of it that we decided that maybe it was a good idea to make it easy to share by open sourcing it .
Thankfully the Internet showed up which made this sharing trivial .
If you ’re a developer , try this right now .
Go search Google Code1 for your name and find some code you forgot about that everyone can see .
Scary , huh ?
Did n’t think your code lived forever .
It does .
Code lives forever .
Good code not only lives , it grows as those who value it make sure that it does n’t become stale .
It ’s this pile of high - value , well - maintained code that is helping shrink the average size of the engineering team because it ’s allowing us to focus less on writing new code and more on integrating existing code to get the job done with fewer people and in less time .
There ’s a depressing line of reasoning here , the idea that we ’re all just a bunch of integration automatons using duct tape to connect different pre-existing moving parts to create slightly different versions of the same thing .
It ’s this train of thought that has a lot of senior management teams excited about outsourcing .
“ Anyone who can use Google and has some duct tape can do this , so why are we paying big bucks for our local automatons ? ”
We ’re paying these management types some pretty big bucks to think this crap up .
Still , it brings up my final point that there are eager , bright developers all over the planet and they ’re eager and bright even though they have n’t spent a moment in an accredited university .
Oh yeah , and there are lots more of them coming .
I ’m not suggesting that you should be worried about your job because some bright fellow overseas is gunning for you , I ’m suggesting that you should be worried about your job because the evolution of how software development occurs might be moving faster than you .
You ’ve been working for ten years in your job , five years as a manager , and you ’re thinking , “ I know how to develop software ” .
And you do .
Right now .
Stop Coding ?
If you follow my advice and remove yourself from the code , then you are removing yourself from the act of creation .
This act is why I do n’t really sweat outsourcing .
Automatons do n’t build , they process .
While good process can save a lot of money , it ’s not going to bring anything new to the world .
With smaller teams doing more for less , removing yourself from the code strikes me as a bad career move .
Even in a monstrous company laden with policy , process , and politics , you ca n’t forget how to develop software .
And how to develop software is changing .
Now .
Right under your feet , this very second .
You have issues .
I understand .
Let ’s hear them .
“ Rands , I ’m on the Director track and if I keep coding no one is going to think I can scale . ”
My first question to you is this : from where you are sitting in your soon - to - be - Director chair , do you see software development changing within your company ?
If the answer is yes , my next question is : how is it changing , and what are you going to do about it ?
If your answer is no , then you need to move your chair because , I swear to you , software development is changing right this second .
How in the world are you going to scale if you ’re slowly forgetting how software is made ?
My advice is not that you start assigning yourself tons of features in the next release .
My advice is that you take action so that you stay in touch with how your team builds stuff .
You can do this as a Director or a VP .
More on this in a moment .
“ Uh , Rands , someone has to referee .
Someone has to have the vision .
If I code , I ’m going to lose perspective on my job . ”
You still need to referee , you still need to massage decisions , and you still need to spend 30 minutes every Monday morning walking around the block four times with that engineer who needs to walk through his weekly “ We ’re Doomed ” rant , but you also need to lose perspective about your job and you do not need to be a full - time coder to do this .
My advice for losing perspective :
1 ) Use the development environment to build the product .
This means you must be familiar with your team ’s tools including the build system , version control , and programming language .
This task is going to keep you in touch with the language your team uses to talk about how they get stuff done .
And it will also allow you to continue to use your favorite text editor … which rocks .
2 ) Be able to draw a detailed architectural diagram describing your product on any whiteboard at any time .
I ’m not talking about the three boxes and two arrows versions .
You need to know the detailed one , the hard one that is n’t pretty and is tricky to explain .
This is your map for understanding just about everything about your product .
It changes over time and you should be able to understand why those changes are occurring .
3 ) Own a feature .
I ’m literally cringing as I write this because it is fraught with danger , but I do n’t think you can really do # 1 or # 2 without a feature that is yours .
Owning a feature not only forces you to actively participate in the development process , it also switches your context from “ Manager responsible for everything ” to “ Person who owns a thing ” .
This is a humble , unassuming perspective which will remind you of the importance of small decisions .
I ’m still cringing .
Someone is already yelling at me , “ MANAGERS OWNING FEATURES ??!?! ” ( And I agree . )
You are still a manager , so make it a small feature , ok ?
You ’ve still got a lot to do .
If you ca n’t imagine owning a feature , my backup advice is to fix some bugs .
You wo n’t get the joy of ownership , but you ’ll gain an understanding of the construction of the product that you ’ll never get walking the hallway .
4 ) Write a test script .
I still do this late in the product cycle when folks are losing their minds .
This is a simple script that you run with each build .
Think of it as your checklist for understanding what your product does .
Show it to co-workers .
Do it often .
“ Rands , if I code , I ’m going to confuse my team .
They ’re not going to know if I ’m a manager or a developer . ”
Good .
I mean it .
I ’m happy you ’re about to confuse your team by swimming in the developer pool .
The simple fact is that well - defined roles in software development are fading .
User interface guys are doing what can only be called development in Javascript and CSS .
Developers are learning more about interaction design .
Everybody is talking to everybody else and they ’re learning from each other ’s mistakes , stealing each other ’s code , and there is no reason that a manager should n’t be participating in this massive global cross-pollination information cluster - fuck .
Besides , you want to be a part of a team of interchangeable parts .
Not only does this make your team more nimble , it presents each person with the opportunity to see the product and the company from a vastly different perspective .
How much more are you going to respect quiet Frank the Build Guy when you see the simple elegance of his build scripts ?
I ’m not wishing confusion and chaos on your team .
I ’m actually wishing better communication on it .
My belief is that if you are building the product and touching the features that you ’ll be closer to your team .
But , more importantly , you ’ll be closer to how software development is constantly changing in your organization .
One Absolute
A co-worker at Borland once gently and firmly corrected me when I called her a coder .
“ Rands , a coder is a mindless machine .
A monkey .
A coder does nothing relevant except lay down boring lines of useless code .
I am a software developer . ”
She was right and she would ’ve hated my advice for new managers to stop coding .
Not because I was suggesting that they were coders , but more that I was proactively telling them to start ignoring one of the most important parts of their jobs : software development .
So , I ’ve revised my advice .
You can stop coding , but …
Stay flexible and do n’t stop developing .
The administration of the southern German town Freiburg ( Black Forest ) has to save costs .
Not only sports clubs , festivities or the local cultural events suffer from financial cuts , but also one of the huge American Corporations : Microsoft .
What the stories is all about :
The departments of the city council in Freiburg use some 2000 PCs .
Most of them have installed MS office by Microsoft - Word , Excel and Powerpoint .
In order to being allowed to use these programs , the city of Freiburg has to pay license fees .
And Microsoft , the quasi - monopolist from Redmond , charges quite a lot of these fees .
But here comes bad news for Bill Gates :
In the near future , the " Microsofties " can count on less money from the beautiful German Town in the Black Forest .
For what reason ?
The city of Freiburg is going to retool most of their PCs so they can use a rival product that is available on the internet on an open - source - basis free of charge : OpenOffice .
I ’m reading the otherwise perfectly reasonable New York Times piece on the Viacom / Youtube lawsuit and I encounter this bizarre misrepresentation of recent history :
“ In the early 1990s music companies let Web companies build business models on the back of their copyright , ” said Michael Nathanson , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company .
“ I think the video industry is being more aggressive for the right reasons , to protect the future value of those assets . ”
It ’s hard to imagine how one could find more ways to be wrong on this topic .
First , there were no “ Web companies ” in the early 1990s ; the first Web companies emerged in 1994 - 5 — and aside from some unusual efforts , like Michael Goldberg ’s Addicted to Noise zine , there was not a lot of music happening on the Web .
The MP3 revolution did n’t begin to roll until late 1997 or early 1998 ( here is Andrew Leonard ’s early report on the MP3 scene , which I edited ) .
More important , Mr. Nathanson has the history here precisely inverted .
What happened in the Napster era was that music companies refused to allow Web companies to build business models on the back of their copyright .
They decided that MP3s were all about piracy and they sued Napster out of existence .
They refused to do deals with companies that wanted to distribute their music online , and in fact they failed to offer their music online in any way palatable to consumers until Steve Jobs whacked them on the side of the head — and even then they saddled his whole iTunes enterprise with a cumbersome “ digital rights management ” scheme that even he is now disowning .
The Viacom suit against YouTube does not represent a break with the way the music industry dealt with its rocky transition to the digital age ; it is an instance of history repeating itself .
The RIAA strategy of “ sue your customers ” may have succeeded in driving file - sharing underground , but it did n’t do anything to protect the profits of the music industry , which have been in a tailspin ever since .
If the Viacom suit is an indication that the owners of TV shows and movies are going to pursue a similar strategy of I ’d - rather - sue - than - deal , they may find themselves in a similar downward spiral .
Google has a pretty good case based on the 1996 Telecommunications
Act safe harbor provision .
If Viacom fails to win against its corporate opponent , will it start suing all the Jon Stewart fans ( and , possibly , the show ’s own staff ) who are uploading clips to YouTube ?
If the TV and film industries look carefully at the music industry ’s story , they will see that their danger lies not in being too soft on copyright infringers but rather in missing the tidal wave of a platform shift .

It ’s time to replace some conservative Democrats in Washington , DC .
I just heard from an impeccable source that there is serious concern on the Hill that conservative Democrats in the House will vote with the Republicans to strip any and all restrictions from the Iraq supplemental tomorrow , effectively giving Bush all the money he wants with no restrictions and no effort to hold either him or the Iraq government accountable for anything .
I.e. , they will vote to continue this war along the same disastrous course because they ’re too afraid to challenge George Bush and his failed leadership .
Let me reiterate :
This is n’t some idle rumor .
The concerns are coming from Hill sources themselves .
Yes , while the Republican leaders of the House and Senate are publicly claiming that they wo n’t give Bush a blank check , they ’re maneuvering behind the scenes to do just that .
And while Republican members of Congress are supposedly laying down the law for Bush in private meetings , on the House floor they ’re going to give Bush everything he wants and needs to continue the war indefinitely .
If that happens , then we need to hang this war , and hang every lost life and every wasted dollar , around the neck of every Republican and conservative Democrat who betrays our troops and our country tomorrow .
Please call your member of Congress and raise unholy hell .
Tell them that they ’d better vote against giving Bush a blank check when the Iraq supplemental comes up for a vote tomorrow .
You can call now and leave a message on their machines .
You can find your rep via the House Web site , use the zip code box in the upper left hand corner to find your rep .
After the Republican House and Senate victories of 1994 , environmental groups , and their allies in Congress and the White House , were forced to fight a desperate rear - guard action to protect core legislation , including the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act .
Real progress on issues like gas - mileage standards and the development of alternative fuels was next to impossible .
“ We got slam - dunked on almost every issue , ” as Kathleen McGinty , former head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality , recalls ; “ and not just by Republicans but by Democrats as well . ”
She and other former aides give Gore high marks for steadfastness in the face of massive resistance .
But the resistance came not only from the business lobby and their allies in Congress but also from some of the administration ’s own top officials .
As Gore himself recalls : “ It was seen as an arcane , hobbyhorse issue :
We ’ll indulge Vice President Gore , and let him do his thing yet again , and then we ’ll get back to what we know is the serious stuff . ”
This internal clash came to a head in 1997 , with negotiations over the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse - gas emissions , which the business community , and above all the energy industry , vehemently opposed .
Timothy Wirth , a committed environmentalist and then under secretary of state for global affairs , assembled a bipartisan advisory group of a dozen or so senators to build support for the treaty .
“ I could not get a single White House official to come to any of these meetings , ” Wirth recalls .
“ They would not identify themselves with Kyoto . ”
Wirth planned to assemble a range of such groups , as he had with earlier pacts ; but the White House took over the process before he could do so and made no outreach effort .
“ It was a goddamn scandal , ” Wirth says .
“ It was horrible . ”
Wirth stepped down a few weeks before the treaty was to be finalized .
Gore was quite taken aback when I relayed Wirth ’s remarks .
“ He ’s not talking about me , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know who he ’s talking about . ”
But he also adds : “ If I had been president , would I have bent every part of the administration and every part of the White House to support this ?
Yes , I would have .
Does that translate into criticism of President Clinton for not doing this ?
No .
I was vice president , not president . ”
Or maybe Gore would rather not do the translation .
When the international negotiations looked as if they were about to collapse , in part owing to American resistance , Gore suggested that he fly to Kyoto to demonstrate Washington ’s commitment .
David Sandalow , who worked on environmental affairs at the National Security Council , recalls a meeting with a dozen advisers “ in which nobody recommended he go , with the range of opinion running from neutral to strongly against . ”
Gore went anyway .
“ His arrival was galvanizing , ” Sandalow says .
( Others are less convinced . )
Gore returned in triumph — and instantly encountered , he recalls , “ resistance in the White House to even signing it , much less submitting it to the Senate for ratification . ”
Gore used his last dram of political capital to persuade Clinton to sign the Kyoto pact ; it was never sent to the Senate , where it surely would have died an ugly death .
The Clinton administration thus surrendered without firing a shot .
For Gore , it was a humiliating denouement .
Gore ’s advisers in the 2000 campaign worried that he would commit political suicide by global warming .
The issue had advanced far enough in public consciousness that George W. Bush saw fit to endorse regulating carbon emissions ( a position he promptly ignored once taking office ) .
But it was still a net loser .
Gore says he believes that he lost West Virginia , and possibly Kentucky , by calling for restrictions on coal - fired utilities .
Gore could be excused a case of epic bitterness ; but his total immersion in a cause he deeply believes in appears to have seen him through .
The only what - if in which he indulged during our time together was to say , only half - jokingly , that if he had had the “ presentation skills ” he has since learned , “ I think I ’d be in my second term as president . ”
Ah , the presidency .
There are Web sites , and even a political action committee , dedicated to promoting a Gore candidacy .
James Carville , the Democratic strategist , told Rolling Stone flatly , “ He ’s going to run , and he ’s going to be formidable . ”
Several of Gore ’s aides from the 2000 race are said to have assembled a shadow campaign team should Gore change his mind .
But the people closest to Gore say , as one , that he does not so much as raise the subject .
“ Al knows where the sirens are , ” says Roy Neel , who has been with Gore since the early days in Congress , “ and he knows when it ’s not real . ”
He adds that Gore “ has rejected offers to do any sort of planning . ”
He has not , however , stopped others from planning on his behalf .
When I asked Gore why he has n’t dismissed all the speculation by issuing a Shermanesque refusal to stand , as he did in 2002 , Gore said , “ Having spent 30 years as part of the political dialogue , I do n’t know why a 600 - day campaign is taken as a given , and why people who are n’t in it 600 days out for the convenience of whatever brokers want to close the door and narrow the field and say , ‘ This is it , now let ’s place your bets ’ —
If they want to do that , fine .
I do n’t have to play that game . ”
This sounded a lot like “ I can get in late . ”
( Indeed , the buzz among the former aides is that Gore could jump in at the end of 2007 should the current contenders show significant weakness . )
A few moments later , he said : “ I ’m not issuing a Shermanesque statement because that ’s not where I am .
I ’m not ruling it out for all time .
Although I cannot presently foresee any circumstances , such circumstances could emerge . ”
“ And such circumstances could emerge in 2008 ? ”
“ It ’s extremely unlikely , but not impossible . ”
In James Hansen ’s view , which Gore shares , we have no more than 10 years to level off the production of greenhouse gases ; by 2050 , despite massive growth in population and the world economy , we must have cut global emissions to “ a fraction of what they are now . ”
Otherwise , we go over the cliff .
This is what Gore means when he says that the outer edge of the politically possible falls short of the inner edge of the necessary ; and this is why he believes that the only hope is to transform the definition of the possible through a campaign of mass persuasion .
There are now half a dozen greenhouse - gas bills in Congress ; the most drastic of them would meet Hansen ’s target through a combination of tough gas - mileage standards , requirements that utilities resort to alternative fuels and a market - based “ cap and trade ” system .
Under such a regime , mandated by the Kyoto Protocol and now in place in Europe , companies receive an annual “ allotment ” of carbon emissions ; those that produce even less can sell their “ credits ” to those who ca n’t or wo n’t make it under the bar .
Of course this system works only if the annual “ cap ” starts low and gets smaller and smaller every year .
Gore ’s great fear is that business lobbies and lawmakers will unite around some kind of compromise legislation that will demonstrate “ commitment ” without actually driving up the cost , or driving down the permissible volume , of carbon emissions .
And he views even the most stringent legislation as inadequate .
The one social factor that researchers agree is consistently linked to longer lives in every country where it has been studied is education .
It is more important than race ; it obliterates any effects of income .
Year after year , in study after study , says Richard Hodes , director of the National Institute on Aging , education “ keeps coming up . ”
And , health economists say , those factors that are popularly believed to be crucial — money and health insurance , for example , pale in comparison .
Dr. Smith explains : “ Giving people more Social Security income , or less for that matter , will not really affect people ’s health .
It is a good thing to do for other reasons but
not for health . ”
Health insurance , too , he says , “ is vastly overrated in the policy debate . ”
Instead , Dr. Smith and others say , what may make the biggest difference is keeping young people in school .
A few extra years of school is associated with extra years of life and vastly improved health decades later , in old age .

World oil prices jumped briefly on Wednesday after a television station in Tulsa , Oklahoma -- the No. 62 U.S. media market -- posted an erroneous story about a refinery fire on its Web site .
REUTERS / Luke MacGregor
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - World oil prices jumped briefly on Wednesday after a television station in Tulsa , Oklahoma -- the No. 62 U.S. media market -- posted an erroneous story about a refinery fire on its Web site .
At 10:14 EDT ( 1414 GMT ) , CBS affiliate KOTV reported that a lightning strike had caused a fire at an Oklahoma refinery -- sparking a flurry of excitement among energy traders and boosting U.S. crude prices 40 cents .
The refining company announced the story was “ completely wrong ” and the station withdrew the story .
“ All it takes is a screw - up on a Web site to move the market .
It just goes to show how tense this market is , ” said a Houston - based oil trader .
A string of refinery problems in the United States has propelled retail gasoline prices to record highs in recent weeks .
Don Stewart , an Alabama graphic artist , has been drawing " visual puns " for many years , including this picture of a VW Beetle composed entirely of insects .
This particular image was created in 1992 , so Don was surprised to hear quite recently from Volkswagen 's lawyers .
They demanded that he stop circulating the image in any way , shape , or form , and suggested that he tear the images out of the coffee table book he sells and send those images to Volkswagen .
But Don did not want to rip pages from his book and mail them to a group of attorneys .
Instead , he contacted ( PDF ) his Senator .
Why ?
Because Don believes that he was targeted by Volkswagen under a new bill passed by the House and currently in committee in the Senate .
In his letter , he argues that Volkswagen and other large companies want to use the pedning legislation to prevent journalists and artists from exercising their long - standing rights to the " non-commerical " use of trademarked images .
The law is H.R. 683 , the Trademark Dilution Revision
Act of 2005 , and it's been working up more people than just Don Stewart .
An essay on stockphotographer.com ( via Boing Boing ) argues against the proposed law in violent terms , believing that the legislation would give nearly total control of trademarked words , symbols , and images to corporations , who could then prevent anyone they wish from using them , for whatever reason .
How bad is the law ?
" It will serve to eliminate the current protection for non-commercial speech currently contained in the Lanham Act .
It will prevent businesses ( artists ) and consumers from invoking famous trademarks to explain or illustrate their discussion of public issues ...
Exceptions for fair use , non-commercial use , reportage , commentary , etc. currently existing could disappear and would be no defense to claims of infringement of a registered or unregistered mark . "
Yikes !
Any law that would destroy fair use protections would certainly be a terrible piece of legislation , one whose effects would be far reaching and disastrous for consumers .
To understand if this is indeed happening , let 's compare the trademark law ( the Lanham Act from 1946 ) as it currently stands to the new proposals set out in H.R. 863 .
Here are the types of fair use allowed for trademarks under section 43 of the Lanham Act .
(A) Fair use of a famous mark by another person in comparative commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark .
( B ) Noncommercial use of a mark .
( C ) All forms of news reporting and news commentary .
Note especially item B , the " non-commercial use " exception .
This is a particular point of concern to Mr. Stewart , who points out in his letter that it has " been generally understood to protect artistic expression , even when the art is sold in a book , drawing , song or movie . "
Under the new law , however , the " non-commercial use " exception has been rewritten .
(A) Fair use of a famous mark by another person in comparative commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark .
( B ) Fair use of a famous mark by another person , other than as a designation of source for the person 's goods or services , including for purposes of identifying and parodying , criticizing , or commenting upon the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner .
( C ) All forms of news reporting and news commentary .
Clearly , then , the wild claims made above about eliminating " fair use ... reportage , commentary , etc. " do n't hold up when you examine the bill .
Fair use of trademarks in several different forms is explicitly allowed , as is all news reporting and commentary that feature such marks .
On the other hand , Mr. Stewart is correct to point out that the " non-commercial use " exemption has been removed , which could indeed make it more difficult for an artist to paint a picture of flowers standing in a Coke bottle ( an example he uses in his letter ) .
Lawyers for Volkswagen apparently assume the law will pass , and their interpretation of it seems to be that while criticism and parody of their brand is allowed , a positive and humorous representation of a Beetle is not .
As Mr. Stewart asks rhetorically , " What is our country coming to when someone is liable for a lawsuit because they are being nice ? "
If the bill is passed , it will no doubt take several such court cases to figure out exactly where the boundaries lie .
Though the bill is nowhere near as bad as the alarmists are suggesting , a first reading does suggest that it represents another small shift of power in the direction of corporate interests .

Sam Rodwell , 10 , from Poole in Dorset , wore a T - shirt that said : " Autism - it 's no mystery , it 's mercury . "
The slogan refers to the theory debated by some experts that autism is linked to mercury preservatives in vaccines .
The head teacher at Portfield School in Poole said Sam could not go on a school trip unless he changed the T - shirt .
PC gone mad
Janis Rogers , head of the independent school , told Sam 's mother , Mandy , 45 , her son could not go on the trip to a playground and park while wearing the shirt .
Sam 's father , David , 45 , said : " The staff felt that it was politically incorrect for Sammy to go out in that shirt and so they took it off and put another shirt on .
" He was very upset .
It 's political correctness gone mad .
Who is to decide what is politically correct and what is n't ? "
The school , which is run by The Wessex Autistic Society , has 64 pupils aged three to nine , and caters specifically for children with autistic spectrum disorders .
He does have mercury toxicity
David Rodwell
Bob Lowndes , chief executive of the society , said : " The Wessex Autistic Society fully respects the rights of parents to dress their children to their liking .
" However , the Society also has a responsibility to protect the dignity of the children in its charge at Portfield School .
" The shirt was changed as the child was due to engage in a public outing with other students and the shirt would have drawn attention to their disability which was not considered to be in their interest .
" We have a strong commitment to working in partnership with parents and are always happy to discuss such matters in an open and constructive manner . "
But Sam 's father said their policy was inconsistent because his son had already worn similar T - shirts to school .
He said : " It is a way of alerting people to his condition .
" Sam wears that T - shirt because he is mercury tested .
We have had him tested and he does have mercury toxicity . "
Earlier this summer , Michael , a sales assistant , was sitting in the cafe in London 's Holland Park .
' Then I saw them - Gwyneth Paltrow and Stella McCartney , ' he says .
' They were pushing prams .
So I got out my camera .
At first , they did n't appear to notice . '
As Michael explains , a camera like his - a small Canon , the size of a credit card - is not very conspicuous .
' But then I think Gwyneth realised what was going on . '
Michael always carries his camera with him - ' it 's just easy , so small , always there in case something happens ' .
One of the resulting photographs was published in Heat magazine , in a slot called You 've Been Snapped !
which features celebrities caught , unposed , by members of the public .
In May , chef Matthew Stevens , 24 , was cleaning out the freezers at the Quantuck Gateway restaurant in Bridgewater , Somerset , when he was bitten twice on the hand by a deadly Brazilian wandering spider that had made its way into the kitchen via the restaurant 's delivery of bananas .
Despite ' feeling really dizzy and quite sick ' , Stevens managed to fling some hot water over the spider , ' which seemed to stun it ' .
He then fired off a few pictures of it using a Motorola V600 , using the digital zoom to get in nice and close .
A few hours later , by which time the entire right side of his body was paralysed and he was being stretchered off to receive oxygen at Musgrove hospital in Taunton , the doctors finally managed to identify the spider by emailing the images on his phone to Bristol Zoo .
They could then administer the correct anti-venom drugs and Stevens made a full recovery , although he insists he ' checks the bananas much more carefully now ' .
Another ' camphone ' image - this time a murky snap taken at a birthday drink in a north London pub - has provided key evidence in the investigation of an attempted murder .
It shows David Sayer , who was later stabbed five times ; in the background are three men playing pool .
The image was taken discreetly using a mobile phone , rather than a camera , which may explain why the assailants seem unaware their faces are being captured .
The picture was the centrepiece of a recent BBC Crimewatch appeal .
Three very different examples .
But now so many of us have tiny digital cameras or boast cameras in our mobiles - one in five mobile phone owners in the UK , according to Jupiter Research - that most of life can be documented .
' Rather than the traditional concept of " the few watching the many " , the popularity of camera phones has created a situation where the many are now watching the many , ' explains Les Back , professor of sociology at Goldsmiths College .
We 're all now monitoring each other , ready to snap any moments of weakness and record them for posterity , or in some cases , profit , as Prince Harry will readily confirm .
That infamous shot of Harry wearing Nazi regalia at a fancy dress party - taken with a mobile phone - was sold by a fellow party - goer to The Sun for about £ 7,500 , a very humble figure given its impact and the sales benefit to the paper .
According to Nokia , which now likes to call itself the world 's biggest camera manufacturer , the number of camera phones sold globally had exceeded that of digital cameras by mid-2003 ( at 200 million ) .
Nokia predicts this figure will treble by 2006 .
But at present , according to Jupiter Research , not even a fifth of UK camera phone owners have taken a picture with their phones , and only 6 per cent have sent a picture message , also known as an MMS .
The big problem was that , until very recently , the quality of images was rather shaky .
This was partly due to the technology itself , but also because the resolution was often set deliberately low , so as not to use too much of a phone 's memory .
But this is less of a problem in the era of removable memory cards .
We also should n't confuse the ropey quality of a highly compressed MMS with a phone 's underlying ability to take pictures , which can then be ( expensively ) emailed from the mobile , or transferred on to a computer .
Either way , until the very latest models , camera phones have simply not produced a calibre of photo worth printing .
In fact , they 've not even been good enough for angling enthusiasts to document big fish that they 've landed , according to a senior news reporter for the Angling Times , who ruefully warned that ' the real horror story is when the occasional angler catches an absolute whacker , and photographs it using a mobile phone or a disposable camera , only to find that the picture is n't of publishable quality ' .
Yet there 's an old saying among photographers that the best camera is the one you have on you at the time .
In this sense , small digitals or camera phones are now an indispensable tool for journalists , whether fashion editors air kissing at the catwalks or hardened newshounds .
The BBC now issues Nokia camera phones with beefed - up microphones to ' most news reporters ' , according to the corporation 's TV editor of newsgathering , Jon Williams .
' Television is all about pictures , ' he says .
' So not having any is n't a position that I feel comfortable with . '
As reporters inevitably get to the scene of a breaking story before film crews , they are in an ideal position to provide ' first responder stuff ' and , as they can then email these shots directly from a phone to a news desk , they can provide ' holding images ' , until better material arrives .
That this can now be replicated from any part of the world ' unlocks the potential for getting more stories , from more places , more quickly , ' says Williams .
' Without wanting to overstate it , this technology liberates TV production . '
He adds that the pictures taken on a good camera phone ' can actually be quite decent ' , before explaining that - even before the London bombings - they had already provided images for broadcast stories that would otherwise have remained unseen , including the ' ghost ships ' loaded with toxic materials - camera phone pics were taken by a reporter from another ship off the north east coast - and the recent floods in Thirsk , north Yorkshire .
Williams is keen to encourage the public to continue emailing any news - worthy images they 've taken on their phones , a process he calls ' the democratisation of newsgathering ' , adding that the BBC might pay for a really hot story - though probably ' less than four figures ' .
The London bombings earlier this month were largely documented through mobile phone pictures .
Williams is not particularly anxious about hoax images .
' It 's the same as any other news story , ' he says .
' Always check your sources .
At some point , somebody will get hoaxed , we hope we have the processes in place to prevent it being us . '
What 's more , since pictures can be sent instantly , people are increasingly using them to lodge complaints about iffy holiday accommodation , say , by emailing the images directly to the holiday company while they are still abroad rather than having to find a travel agent .
Permanently packing a camera phone can also help preserve a no claims bonus , says Philip Southgate , spokesperson for Prudential Motor Insurance .
' People 's ability to document accidents has evolved with technology , ' he says .
' As well as noting details on paper , nowadays photographs taken with a mobile phone can also be compelling evidence . '
Southgate explains that even a crude image , showing the vehicle 's road positioning or the weather conditions , can be very useful .
A good tip since two - thirds of Brits involved in road accidents admit liability at the scene , according to Prudential .
Professor Back is less optimistic .
He thinks camera phones lead to ' the memorialising of bad behaviour ' , by which he means the so called ' happy slapping ' phenomenon , insisting that it is all part of a wider cultural syndrome .
' The obsession with moral weakness , bad behaviour and becoming spectators in other people 's lives is having a damaging effect , ' he says .
His point is illustrated by events that took place in Edinburgh a few weeks ago , as a 34 - year - old man stood precariously on a small ledge , 100ft above the glass roof of Waverley Station .
In what it called ' a sad indictment of today 's society ' , The Scotsman reported that a ghoulish crowd ' camera - phones held aloft , manoeuvred themselves into the best spot to get a snap .
" Just jump , " shouted one sadistic voyeur . '
The technology itself is not ' unremittingly negative ' , says Professor Back .
' It 's how people use it that matters . '
Knives are clearly for chopping , rather than stabbing , and no one disputes the usefulness of glue , despite the fact that some teenagers choose to sniff it .
What many people are concerned about is the surreptitious nature of the way camera phones work , and the impact that has on privacy .
Some employers have made noises about security .
Grave warnings have been issued to parents to cover up their toddlers in the park , and health clubs are rattled about their potential use in changing rooms .
Andree Deane , communications director of the Fitness Industry Association , explains that ' most major health club chains have a ban [ on camera phones ] in place , with signs in the changing rooms .
In fact , a number of gyms now do n't allow mobiles at all . '
In truth , short of banning all mobile phones , it is hard to see how anything can be done to stop people using cameras .
There have been suggestions that we adopt a similar approach to Korea , where manufacturers have voluntarily prevented the shutter noise on camera phones from being disabled .
But is this likely to happen here ?
Professor Peter Whittaker is a member of the European Group for Ethics in Science and Technology , which advises the European Commission on policy .
' This is something people ought to be concerned about , ' he says , ' and a matter I will certainly be bringing up with the EU ethics group . '
Inevitably , the communications director for Nokia , Mark Squires , thinks this is all a non-issue , pointing out that ' digital cameras can be just as small , and the way people carry [ camera phones ] clearly indicates they are taking a picture ' .
He also makes the point that in the early days of audio recording technology , the kit was supposed to make a bleep every four seconds so people knew they were being recorded .
Even the Ministry of Defence does not seem unduly concerned about the use of camera phones , simply asking all its staff , whether in active military service or civilian , to exercise ' common sense usage ' .
An MOD spokesperson said : ' There is no policy banning mobile phones on the front line , whether they are camera phones or video phones .
We trust our personnel to use them responsibly . '
There is , however , a ' restricted mobile phone policy ' in certain areas of MOD buildings .
' If you start taking pictures of documents and pinging them to your friends , it 's treated as seriously as if you 're sending them to the Russians . '
It 's notoriously hard to quantify exactly what impact the rising tide of camera phones is having on the overall camera market , seeing as so many are now sold online , but the major manufacturers all reported poor financial results for the first quarter of 2005 , according to Jupiter Research .
The Carphone Warehouse 's UK chief executive , Andrew Harrison , says his company has ' seen an increasing shift towards camera phones , particularly since Christmas ' .
What 's definitely true is that cameras are becoming a standard feature in phones , in the same way that alarm clocks and colour screens already are .
It will gradually become easier to send and receive high - quality pictures and footage .
We already live in a society where , for good or ill , we are all watching each other more closely than ever before .
So , welcome to the snaparazzi society .

Got a problem , or even just a question ?
PARIS , Dec. 17 — She is a former marine , a native Californian and , now , an ex-American who prefers to remain discreet about abandoning her citizenship .
After 10 years of warily considering options , she turned in her United States passport last month without ceremony , becoming an alien in the view of her homeland .
“ It ’s a really hard thing to do , ” said the woman , a 16 - year resident of Geneva who had tired of the cost and time of filing yearly United States tax returns on top of her Swiss taxes .
“ I just kept putting this off .
But it ’s my kids and the estate tax .
I do n’t care if I die with only one Swiss franc to my name , but the U.S. should n’t get money I earned here when I die . ”
Historically , small numbers of Americans have turned in their passports every year for political and economic reasons , with the numbers reaching a high of about 2,000 during the Vietnam War in the early 1970s .
But after Congress sharply raised taxes this year for many Americans living abroad , some international tax lawyers say they detect rising demand from citizens to renounce ties with the United States , the only developed country that taxes it citizens while they live overseas .
Americans abroad are also taxed in the countries where they live .
My name is Matthew Dobbs ; I am not a Constitutionalist yet an advocate of the Constitution .
I have the rank human being , I carry military rank no longer for I am no longer shackled to a system that no longer represents me , that to be a part of this species is honor enough .
I am a veteran of the Afghanistan campaign , and also a concerned citizen of the United States .
I believe America is at a cross roads , we are at one of those moments in history that define a people .
We have immoral wars and corrupt leaders , we have corporations as war profiteers and bankers as policy makers , and we have a seemingly confused and therefore apathetic people .
We also have strength and courage to oppose those who would tell us that we need to be silent and silenced , we have a determination to say no , not me , I have been used for too long , I will not be the excuse of why our republic was destroyed by Imperialism and propaganda spewed at us and told it is for our own good .
So what is to be done ?
There is a stranglehold on our economy and veterans who speak out of line and patriotic peace loving people are becoming marked targets .
We have a system where all you need is the backing of corrupt individuals and corporations , and a willingness to sell your own peoples souls to become president .
We have to stop waiting for the power elite to present us with leaders that we can not only we can live with but guide us toward a greater destiny .
America has sat on its hands for nearly 60 years before ever realizing we have been lied to .
I ca n’t think of a president besides Eisenhower or Kennedy that has even believed in the concept of Republic .
These corporations and banks have no bid contracts not just in Iraq and Afghanistan but on Capitol Hill and right down the street in Austin .
We look to the few Politician ’s who still do right by their constituents , they are few and far between , but there are still some who have the intestinal fortitude to stand up and expose the lies of our blackened kleptocracy that was once a proud Republic .
So I ask again what is to be done .
Do we toe the line with the people and systems that we know are hanging us out to dry ?
I would like to think not .
Nor should we stand to the side and point fingers at the people at the top or whisper to our friends the responsibilities of the Government , one which is no longer ours .
I present another question .
What is the Patriots ’ responsibility ?
In my humble opinion it is to spread the seeds of a Revolution of thought and the creation of a spirit of individual responsibility .
Education for the people who no not of the destruction that Empire brings and the trust and compassion of a true Democracy .
We need to throw to the curb the truths of yesterday where we defined our allies and enemies in broad strokes to fool ourselves and the masses into tight boxes of black and white .
The inspired message of unfettered diplomacy amongst us all .
Too long have we distrusted our neighbors even here in the heart of Texas , we need to conquer our fear and stop deceiving ourselves into thinking peace is too hard or a flight of fancy of fools .
Conquer your fears and then we can march toward victory together .
Someone once told me the least effective way to Influence an organization is to leave it , the most effective way to change one is from the inside .
We need to support and vote for the ones who believe in peace and responsibility .
The Revolution is here we now need to back and support those who are willing to do battle .
We need not to just get involved with the political process but take it and make it ours once again .
This is an ambitious and harrowing undertaking for those who are willing , but this course is better than fighting in the streets or capitulation to a monster we have let roam our country side and cities for far too long .
John F Kennedy once said
" A revolution is coming - a revolution which will be peaceful if we are wise enough ; compassionate if we care enough ; successful if we are fortunate enough - but a revolution which is coming whether we will it or not .
We can affect its character ; we cannot alter its inevitability . "
So in the complicated wrestling match involving secularism , Christianity and Islam , some non-Roman Catholic Christians are looking to Benedict for leadership while others are trying to influence him .
“ One of the things that we are trying to do — the people behind the scenes in Rome — is to encourage the pope to speak more and more about what we might call the world ’s agenda , ” Flack said .
“ The future of the planet , the environment , poverty in Africa and India .
How do we cope with rising fundamentalism not just in Islam but all the world religions ?
We need to hear what he feels about those things , not just internal church issues . ”
“ How much filth there is in the church and even
among those who , in the priesthood , ought to belong entirely to him ! ” Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ,
Stations of the Cross meditation , Good Friday , 2005
Last month , the pope stood on the balcony of St. Peter ’s Basilica and exhorted the thousands gathered below for his Saturday greeting that they must pray every day , telling them that prayer is “ a question of life or death . ”
It was Benedict speaking , not Ratzinger .
As pope , he has focused attention on such matters as the need for Catholics to reconnect with the Virgin Mary , the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ , and the importance of the liturgy in the Mass — all touchstones of Roman Catholic piety .
But the church is more than piety .
It is undergirded by a network of rules , obedience requirements , punishments and admonitions of which Ratzinger is perhaps the chief modern architect and by a system of protecting its own that is centuries old .
If the church fails to realize Benedict ’s goal of bringing Europe back into the fold and of making itself a mediator between godless secularism and the fervent Islam of many of the Continent ’s newest residents , what may be the prime reason for that failure was laid out for me by a calmly impassioned 40 - year - old man sitting in a boxy , Ikea - style office just off leafy and genteel Merrion Square in Dublin .
Colm O’Gorman is the founder and director of a counseling center called One in Four , the ratio referring to the percentage of adults in Ireland said to have suffered sexual abuse as children .
Beginning when he was 14 and serving as a choirboy in the rural diocese of Ferns , O’Gorman was repeatedly abused and raped by the local priest .
In 1998 , he filed a lawsuit against the diocese as a way to get the church to recognize the problem of pedophilic clergy .
In 2003 , the diocese agreed to pay $ 325,000 to settle the suit .
Meanwhile , as attention built , the Irish government opened a formal inquiry and issued a damning report in 2005 .
O’Gorman is now a celebrity in Ireland and currently is running for Parliament .
The United States is the country with by far the largest number of sex - abuse claims made against Catholic priests , but Ireland has that distinction in Europe , and in both countries the number of priests who have committed sexual crimes on minors has been estimated at 4 percent .
O’Gorman told me the issue of sex abuse among the Catholic clergy , as big as it is in itself , gets at something even more elemental .
Even after years of coverage in the U.S. and Europe , and hundreds of lawsuits and tales of woe , he said : “ The Vatican has never , ever accepted responsibility for clerical sexual abuse at all .
Never .
John Paul talked about his hurt .
Benedict talked about his devastation .
But the Vatican has never acknowledged that they ’ve failed in their responsibility . ”
While Benedict has said many things on the issue over the years , advocates for victims of abusive priests still rankle over his declaring in 2002 that “ I am personally convinced that the constant presence in the press of the sins of Catholic priests , especially in the United States , is a planned campaign . ”
Regarding the longstanding policy of transferring abusive priests to other dioceses , O’Gorman said : “ This was n’t some passive benign failure .
This was an active approach that was taken to these cases .
In my view , there ’s a system at work in this , and the Vatican is at the heart of it . ”
A 2005 survey found that 34 percent of Irish Catholics attend Mass weekly , one of the higher percentages in Europe .
But in 1973 the figure was 91 percent , so the decline is actually among the steepest in Europe .
As far as O’Gorman is concerned , the connection between the church ’s handling of the sex - abuse issue and the drop - off in Mass attendance is direct : “ For the church to criticize secular society while at the same time not looking in any way at itself — for most people this is a reason they turn away from it .
There ’s a huge credibility problem , and I wonder if they ’re capable of recognizing how much their currency is devalued .
They do n’t have any moral authority . ”
The sex - abuse issue is part of what Hans Küng calls “ the long - term structural problems of the church , ” most of all its hierarchical decision - making process , which has kept church leaders looking out for their own and which ensures a broad gulf between what the cardinals and the pope decree and the way most Catholics live .
Like John Paul II , Benedict XVI has shown little interest in reforming some of the basic policies affecting the lives of ordinary Catholics .
“ We can lament the rising divorce rate , but it ’s a reality , ” Pecklers said .
“ On Sunday mornings , the people in the pews , in Europe or America , are very often divorced or gay or are using birth control .
Or else they ’re not in the pews ; they ’ve left the church . ”
As Küng wrote last year , “ For as long as the absolute primacy of Rome prevails , the pope will have most of Christianity against him . ”
That may be too strong to apply to Catholics everywhere , but it seems to ring true for Western Europe .
Benedict may be right that the Catholic Church has a world - historic chance to transform Europe and bring about change .
But the church ’s own strictures could work against that .
The paradox may be that for all his stylistic softening as pope , Joseph Ratzinger ’s own labors through the decades , applying his life experience with such rigor to protecting and preserving the church , are precisely what prevent Europeans from reconnecting with their roots .
“ Think of the silencing of theologians in recent decades , ” said Father Reese , the former editor of the Jesuit journal America .
“ The suppression of discussion and debate .
How certain issues become litmus tests for orthodoxy and loyalty .
All of these make it very difficult to do the very thing Benedict wants .
I wish him well .
I want him to succeed .
But it seems everything he has done in the past makes it much more difficult to do it . ”
So , you want to run ads to try and sell some face masks huh ?
Good luck !
If you are going to try and use Facebook ads to sell masks , you are going to be way in over your head unless you have a huge budget .
You see the reusable wholesale face masks market is already difficult as it is to enter because you have so many bogus companies out there who popped out of nowhere overnight .
And the internet has been around long enough that most people are skeptical when a new trend like this pops up .
Now also take into consideration the embarrassingly low click through rate of Facebook ads themselves .
Across all industries the average click through rate is 1 % .
These two factors combined should give enough reason for anyone to strongly reconsider using face books ads to sell masks .
But why do people continue to try and use them ?
Facebook is a household name now .
I can almost bet you that it comes up in conversation at least 3 times a day .
So naturally , people decide to give their dice a roll - on Facebook .
On top of that , they see ads all the time and figure if it works for them it will work for me .
Unfortunately , that is wrong for so many different reasons .
Let ’s hop into it .
The first and most common reason is budget .
Most successful ad campaigns are dealing somewhere in the ballpark of 1,000 $ a month or higher just to see a return on their investment .
So , you can imagine that your average joe does n’t have an extra grand lying around to just throw 1,000 $ into ads every single month .
For most people , this just turns into a money pit and after a month or two , they dip out and move on to the next thing with a lighter wallet than before .
The next mistake that most people make with running Facebook ads is they do n’t understand that most companies hire a professional .
You see , Facebook ads is like any other job or contract work .
There ’s a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things .
If most people were to try and fix a hole in the wall by themselves it might get the job done , but it will look shabby and likely not finish the way that was intended .
That ’s why people hire pros .
So , when companies look to place ads on Facebook , they hire a professional .
These Facebook ad pros know exactly how to target the client ’s audience and get the highest click through rates possible .
But it comes at a pretty decent cost to say the least .
Depending on your target audience and your local area , a legitimate Facebook ad campaign manager will run you an extra 500 - 2,000 $ a month on top of your ad spend !
Sure , you can always look to go the super cheap route and do it yourself or have some dude from overseas do it for 99 $ a month , but you are not going to see the results you need that way .
Another major issue with Facebook ads and their campaigns is that they get shut down all the time without notice .
Profitable or not profitable they get shut down .
It honestly sucks , and I speak from experience when I say this .
For example , I was running ads for one of the products I sell for months and it was really profitable .
In fact , my ROI from ads was 3 x !
But … I woke up a few days later and my campaign was suspended indefinitely .
No rhyme or reason either , just gone .
It ’s not uncommon and is a harsh reality you need to be aware of if you ever decide to run a Facebook ad campaign for masks .
So now imagine this …You spend 3,000 $ in upfront costs just to get your ads running and are just now beginning to see an ROI .
You are feeling all excited and think you ’ve finally made it big … but then you wake up the next day only to find that you ’ve been suspended and have no way of getting it back .
All the time and effort you put into that project … wasted .
But let ’s circle back to ads for masks now .
You might be thinking that everyone needs masks , so they ’ll just buy them wherever they see them , including Facebook .
Although it ’s true everyone needs masks , most people are looking for a reliable source if anything .
Most are n’t going to trust buying through some obscure , half thought out ad .
There are too many companies out there running around promising more than they can deliver and whenever people try to find out more information on the phone , they get forwarded to some call center overseas .
Even if you are a legit supplier , people are going to have the preconception that you are just some foreign scammer who will take their money and run .
There are literally so many scammers and bots taking over groups and advertising on Facebook right now it ’s unreal !
But …for sake of playing devils advocate , let ’s just say you have the money to spend , and can afford to hire a pro Facebook ad campaign manager who has a good track record …
Would you be successful in selling your masks ?
Honestly , even with the stars aligning like that , you would only have a 50/50 chance and here ’s why …
When this pandemic hit full swing in March of 2020 , Facebook began banning the posting of any mask listings on Facebook .
This was in part by quality control and trying to stop scams from taking place , but what this also did was make it a struggle for those who were legit suppliers .
In my opinion there is a much more fool proof way of getting sales of face masks , and you do n’t have to use Facebook ads at all !
Something my team and I have discovered is that search volume for face masks and other related keywords is through the roof !
That means people are actively looking for masks on google !
The next part is pretty simple , all you need to do is create website that sells masks .
This is much easier to do because once you put up the site , all the work is done , you do n’t have to manage it 24/7 like Facebook ads .
Also , the internet has no police so to speak .
Basically , you can post anything for sale ( within reason ) and no one or nothing , can ban your webpage .
You bought the domain and own the site … they ca n’t make you take it down !
Furthermore , if you design your website professionally , you will have a much better opportunity for sales .
You see , there are way too many second and third rate sites out there .
People can tell the difference .
As long as you make your site look legit and none of your content or pictures are spammy , you ’re in good shape !
Lastly on the website note , if you rank your mask website to the top of page one … you ’ll see an average click through rate of 33 % !
That is basically 30 x what you would see from Facebook ads for local small businesses .
The added bonus of it all ?
Websites are dirt cheap to build , if you built your site through Weebly or Word Press , you are looking at less than 50 $ a month realistically !
So , after all that , do you still think running Facebook ads is a great idea ?
Running Facebook ads for selling masks is just for you if :
You have a lot of money to spend and are a big risk taker
You Like living in constant fear of having a source of income taken away from you at the blink of an eye .
You are n’t all that analytical and like throwing money away at things you think will be fine
You love people thinking that you ’re some scammer from overseas who wants to take their money and run
No , but seriously though …
Facebook ads would not be a good investment for you to make in selling Facemasks because the reality of it is that only those with huge budgets are successful with Facebook ads .
The little guy almost always loses or barely breaks even at the end of the month .
It ’s just not realistic .
All that being said , go ahead and drop your thoughts in the comments below !
Do you think Facebook ads is worth it to sell masks ?
Why or why not ?
Have you had any past experiences with Facebooks ads that you ’d be willing to share with us ?
Or have you even set up your own mask sales site and seen massive success ?
We would all love to hear your thoughts and opinions as well as bounce ideas off of each other .
There is a new normal that we are going to have to get used to living in , the question is how will we be able to adapt and what does this mean for the ecommerce market .
I hope this article helped you decide whether or not to pursue selling masks with Facebook ads !
The Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation 11/19/1863
And now please welcome President Abraham Lincoln .
Good morning .
Just a second while I get this connection to work .
Do I press this button here ?
Function - F7 ?
No , that 's not right .
Hmmm .
Maybe I 'll have to reboot .
Hold on a minute .
Um , my name is Abe Lincoln and I 'm your president .
While we 're waiting , I want to thank Judge David Wills , chairman of the committee supervising the dedication of the Gettysburg cemetery .
It 's great to be here , Dave , and you and the committee are doing a great job .
Gee , sometimes this new technology does have glitches , but we could n't live without it , could we ?
Oh - is it ready ?
OK , here we go :
It ’s my pleasure to welcome Dr. Russ Hopfenberg to GIM .
During the preceding weeks we ’ve summarized and had the chance to discuss his work on the links between food supply , carrying capacity , and population growth , and to comment and ask questions .
In this post , Russ generously responds to our questions and comments .
Feel free to post additional comments and questions below , and Russ will return later in the month ( update : make that next month ) for one more round of follow - up comments ( Update : here is the link to those comments ) .
Thanks so much , Russ !
— John
__________________________________________________________
By Russell Hopfenberg :
I ’d like to extend my thanks to John Feeney and Steve Salmony for inviting me to participate in this forum .
I ’d also like to express my appreciation to them for hand - holding me through the blogging process .
Question 1 . The observation that individual countries ’ food supplies do n’t seem to correlate with their fertility rates as described by your hypothesis :
I ’ve read that one criticism of your work involves the observation that the countries with the lowest fertility rates tend to be the developed countries , and those with the highest tend to be those more deprived of food .
( which would seem to contradict your hypothesis that more food means more population growth ) .
Response 1 – This is a very important question .
It speaks to the complexity of understanding our global population difficulties .
It seems that , in order to fully address the food - population issue , your question requires a thorough answer .
First , there is a biological fantasy imbedded in this question .
The end of the question states “ those with the highest ( fertility rates ) tend to be those more deprived of food . ”
I do n’t think that this is biologically or physically possible as people are made from nothing but food .
This kind of statement reveals the deeply held cultural position that humans are not subject to the same biological laws as the rest of the living community .
I do n’t think the questioner would ever make such a statement about another species ’ population .
If news came out that armadillos at the zoo had an elevated birth rate and now thousands were starving , I think the questioner would understand without hesitation that food supplies had first been elevated and then cut off .
If the armadillo fertility rate continued to remain high , the questioner would understand that more food was being supplied .
Regarding humans , how is it possible that more people can be produced with less food ?
In reality , we have all seen the images of the UN workers handing out food .
We have all seen the Sally Struthers commercials .
When the crisis is over , i.e. , the famine or political turmoil at least temporarily abates , there is more food available to the population in these areas .
This increase in food availability precipitates an ( unsustainable ) increase in the population .
The cycle then begins anew – another crisis , and more food is shipped in .
Second , it is true that more developed areas / countries show a lower birth rate .
This has to do with a phenomenon known as the demographic transition ( DT ) .
As you would find in a basic ecology book , it proceeds as follows :
There are four stages in the classic DT model .
In Stage 1 , both birth rates and death rates are equivalent and high .
In Stage 2 , Death rates dramatically decline , but birth rates remain high .
In Stage 3 , birth rates begin to decline .
And in Stage 4 , both birth and death rates are equivalent and low .
In other words , the declining birth rate occurs in countries that have traversed the DT .
But the DT model , as it is generally understood , is limited in historical and geographical scope .
First , to even be in Stage 1 , food production must already be at such a high level that birth rate and population size are greatly elevated .
With this large population , environmental , medical and sanitation problems increase the death rate , so that it now matches the birth rate .
Once health care and sanitation improve , the population enters Stage 2 .
In Stage 2 , the birth rate remains elevated and the death rate decreases so the population naturally increases .
As average resource consumption per individual increases , the population enters Stage 3 .
In Stage three of the demographic transition model , the birth rate declines .
As this trend continues , the population theoretically moves to Stage 4 .
In Stage 4 , birth and death rates are low but population and resource consumption are highly elevated .
Let me take a moment to summarize Abernethy and Moses & Brown ’s position on the demographic transition :
In stage 1 & 2 , perceptions of increasing resource availability encourage and permit high fertility rates ( Abernethy , 1997 ) .
This is followed , in stages 3 & 4 , by a trend of declining fertility as societal expectations for high per capita resource consumption become established and tradeoffs between the number of children and resource allocation per person , are accepted ( Moses & Brown , 2003 ) .
I think the above paragraph needs a little more explanation .
First , it is the worldwide perception that resource availability will be increasing .
We have national and international farming programs , farms , agricultural departments , bureaus , and institutions that have a mission to increase food production and distribution .
So , the perception is that resource availability will be increasing .
Therefore , fertility increases .
As the population grows , and resources are further increased , with the perception that they will be increasing further , fertility begins to decline but resource use per person increases .
At the end of the road , with a greatly increased carrying capacity , large population size , low fertility rates and excessive resource use , the Brundtland Report , commissioned by the United Nations , estimated that it would take more than ten planet earths to supply the required resources for the now larger , more resource - consuming population .
In other words , imagine if the entire planet ’s population was similar to the US in resource use and fertility .
Question 2 . The question of correlation versus causation ( and why no correlation coefficient ? ) .
Response 2 – My studies are certainly correlational studies .
Imagine what an ethics board would say to a proposed human food - population experiment .
Much that we know about humans comes from correlational studies .
Think about the cigarette smoking and lung cancer link .
Until recently , the tobacco industry ’s defense was that all of the scientific evidence was from lab animal , human tissue , and human correlational studies .
There was ( and is ) no human experimental evidence that links cigarette smoking to cancer .
I offer the same type of evidence – animal experimental evidence and human correlational data .
Regarding the correlation coefficient , I felt that the graph was sufficient .
Also , the correlation coefficient might confuse matters as the correlation would be between the actual population data set and a theoretically derived population data set .
Question 3 . If population growth is a function solely of food supply , one might realistically have to expect to see a future development of a further eroding of the ecosystems of this planet .
‑
Rampant overfishing , industrial farming , deforestation , etc. , all because of a growing population ’s rising demand for food .
Response 3 – Your assessment is true .
If we continue on as we have been , then we will destroy the earth ’s capacity to sustain us .
However , the “ biological fantasy , ” imbedded in this question , rears its head once again .
Our growing population ’s “ rising demand for food ” is due to a misconception .
Remember , population is a function of food supply , not the other way around .
Food supply is an ecological magnet that draws population numbers to it .
Question 4 . That seems an incredible leap .
Family planning , education , free contraceptives , and empowering women are methods that has been shown to be effective .
Response 4 – I would like to ask the questioner – “ Where have these things been shown to be effective ? ”
They may help some individuals , in some places and for a little while , but I think the global population is still growing at a near exponential rate .
To quote Daniel Quinn , “ Birth control always works in fantasy .
Where it does n’t work , unfortunately , is in reality .
For individuals , it works wonderfully well for limiting family size .
What it wo n’t do is end our population explosion . ”
Birth control has been around since at least 1960 .
Since then the global population has more than doubled .
Also , for every person that chooses to have one child , resources are then available for someone else to choose to have more children .
In theory , it could work that individuals choose to have fewer children even though there is an abundance of food available , it just is n’t very likely .
And history bears out that , as a global population , given increasing agricultural production , we choose to increase our numbers .
Also , we must understand that it is evolutionarily unstable for a population to diminish in a time of abundance .
Question 5 . Would stopping the increase in food production cause more people to starve ?
Response 5 – First , what we know is that as food production numbers have risen , the number of starving people has also risen , almost lock - step .
Second , if 3 billion tons of food ( arbitrary number ) was enough to feed the current world population last month , I ca n’t see why any more people would be starving if there were 3 billion tons available this month .
… or next month .
Question 6 . If we put a cap on global food production , how soon would world population growth stop ?
Response 6 – I have n’t done the math on this , but I think we currently produce enough food worldwide to support a population of about 20 billion .
Of course , it ’s unclear as to how long the biological community can support the current human population .
Let ’s remember , right now there are over 200 species per day becoming extinct as a direct result of human activity .
If we do n’t understand the issues and act responsibly , at some point one of those 200 species will be our own .
I think that the first order of business is to understand the cause and effect relationship between food availability and human population growth .
Only then can thoughtful and effective action be taken .
Question 7 .
But how would stopping the growth of food production interact with the social and economic issues known / thought to influence fertility rates ?
Response 7 – To quote Mark Meritt ( 2001 ) ,
Basic population ecology models will show that population growth is simply an epiphenomenon of a particular kind of economic growth , the increase of our food supply .
Ecologically speaking , population growth is thus not a sustainability problem in and of itself but only inasmuch as it is caused by , and exacerbates , increasing resource use .
Theories of organization and state formation , however , show that a growing population generates hierarchy within a social structure .
Population growth can therefore systematically generate inequality by increasing the complexity of social structure , perpetuating poverty , material and otherwise , even in conditions of abundance .
Further , the complication process itself is systematically unsustainable in its own way … .
In the end , economic growth is , in more than a metaphoric sense , the largest pyramid scheme possible .
In other words , underlying our social and economic , as well as our population issues , is food supply .
Social and economic issues influence the ways that the population grows ( see the response to question 1 ) but the ultimate causative variable is food supply .
Question 8 .
Over some period of history , it seems we ’ve tried to “ keep up ” with population growth by producing more and more food .
I believe your contention is that we ca n’t “ keep up ” with population growth that way .
The result is just more people , and ultimately more starving people .
This leads to this question : Historically , did this attempt to “ keep up ” with population in our food production begin around the time of industrialized agriculture ?
Response 8 – The food race certainly began long before the industrial revolution .
Many ancient military campaigns were driven by the quest for more resources , especially food , for the growing population .
I think we ’ve made the idea of the “ food race ” more explicit in relatively recent times .
But civilizations ’ answer to starvation and famine has always been to attempt to increase food production .
Of course , intensive agricultural production actually precipitates famine .
In closing , I think it ’s important to remember that there will never be an answer to end all questions or an argument to end all arguments .
I hope that , if nothing else , I have facilitated some thought and advanced the paradigm that human population dynamics are subject to the same laws as the population dynamics of all other species .
With this perspective , you will be in a better position to answer your own as well as others ’ questions .
Thank you for taking the time to entertain my responses .
I hope that my answers addressed the issues sufficiently .

As many as 80 armed men took part in the morning attack , which netted academics , employees and visitors to the ministry of higher education 's scientific research , scholarships and cultural relations directorate , situated in Baghdad 's relatively peaceful Karrada district .
There was some confusion tonight over the number of victims .
Initial reports suggested 150 had been taken .
This was later revised down to 130 , while the prime minister 's office put the number between 45 and 50 .
Major General Jalil Khalaf , the interior ministry spokesman , said those arrested included the police chief for Karrada .
Also held were the commander of the police brigade in charge of the area and three other officers , he added .
The gunmen were wearing interior ministry commando uniforms specifically designed to prevent counterfeiting .
" It 's a terrorist act , " said Abed Dhiab , the minister for higher education .
" They kidnapped more than 100 employees and visitors . "
The victims include Sunnis and Shias , he added .
According to police sources and witnesses , the gunmen arrived in more than 20 pick - up trucks and sports utility vehicles and sealed off the approaches to the building .
Several cars approached the ministry 's checkpoint and reportedly told guards they were part of an advance group from the interior ministry conducting a security sweep ahead of a visit by the US ambassador to Iraq , Zalmay Khalilzad .
Once inside the four - storey building , however , they rounded up men and women into separate rooms and took their mobile phones .
The men , including senior academics , guards and visitors , were handcuffed and loaded on to the back of the pick - up trucks and driven off .
The operation , which began at about 9.30 am ( 0730 GMT ) , was over in 15 minutes .
Three of the hostages were later reported to have been freed nearby .
The gunmen were reported to have headed toward the Shia stronghold of east Baghdad .
Insurgents , criminal gangs , and militias have frequently carried out attacks while posing as Iraqi security officers , and the security forces themselves have been heavily infiltrated .
The interior ministry , which is controlled by the ruling Shia alliance , repeatedly denies having links to the death squads and militias blamed by Sunnis for instigating sectarian violence and kidnappings .
A senior , non-Shia interior ministry source told the Guardian today : " In truth we do n't know whether the kidnappers were terrorists , militias , criminals , or interior ministry renegades .
Whatever the explanation , it will do nothing for people 's trust in us . "
In response , Mr Dhiab ordered the suspension of all academic programmes and the closure all universities , though he later appeared to pull back from a full shutdown .
" I have only one choice , which is to suspend classes at universities ' because I am not ready to see more professors get killed , " he told parliament .
The minister , a member of a leading Sunni party , also accused Iraq 's security chiefs of ignoring repeated requests to beef up security around educational institutions following a series of threats .
Since the US invasion in 2003 , Iraq 's academic institutions and staff have come under regular attack from insurgents and religious extremists .
Scores of senior academics have been killed or assassinated and thousands more threatened .
Adnan Pachachi , an Iraqi politician and ex-governing council member , said : " There is evidence of a systematic and very sad attempt to drain Iraq of its brains . "

In order to motivate someone , you must have an understanding of the driving factors behind that person ’s existing behaviour , and organizational systems in place which will foster employee motivation .
Regular communication with the employee
A direct link between the goals of the employee and those of the organization
Linking compensation and rewards to the achievement and realization of goals
Maslow ’s hierarchy of human needs states that human beings need to fulfill certain types of wants and desires in a specific order .
From the more basic to the more complex levels , the human needs hierarchy according to Maslow consists of : 1 ) physiological needs ; 2 ) safety / security needs ; 3 ) love / friendship needs ; 4 ) the need for self - esteem ; and 5 ) the need for self - actualization .
What this means is that because people are at different “ levels ” within the hierarchy – e.g. some may be motivated by the need for long - term security ( safety / security ) , whereas others may be motivated by the need to accomplish something big and meaningful ( self - actualization ) , there will undoubtedly be different ways to motivate people .
In order to motivate someone , you must have an understanding of the driving factors behind the person ’s existing behaviour as well as the proper organizational systems which will foster employee motivation .
What is required of these organizational systems is : Having regular discussions with employees will help in assessing what it is that actually motivates them .
Whether the individual has a need to feel safe and secure that they ’re doing relevant and purposeful work , or to feel self - actualized in that the work that they ’re doing is beneficial and of high importance to the organization , it is important to communicate with the employee regularly , find out what their motivating factors are , and ensure that they are on the right course .
Related to the previous concept is the alignment of the employee ’s goals and objectives with those of the organization .
When meeting with the employee to discuss his or her goals and objectives , it is helpful to share with them the importance of their contribution to the organization , and to guide them to choose goals that align nicely with those of the company .
This need not be a one - way street however .
If the employee ’s goals are not immediately linkable to those of the organization , look for ways in which the person ’s job activities can be enlarged or enriched .
By supporting the individual in their expanded or enriched role , the employee will be more fulfilled , and the organization will benefit by having a more motivated , high - potential individual within their ranks .
Compensation and employee reward systems are an important part of the overall motivational systems within an organization .
When an employee does an outstanding job , do n’t be afraid to reward them for their efforts .
By regularly meeting with employees to assess their individual motivating factors and putting other organizational processes in place , you stand a far greater chance of motivating your people to accomplish goals that are purposeful and relevant to your organization .
It is clear to see then , that there is n’t a one - size - fits - all way to encourage and motivate people but rather a multitude of ways , depending on what the individual needs from the organization .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Planet - seekers who have spotted 28 new planets orbiting other stars in the past year say Earth ’s solar system is far from unique and there could be billions of habitable planets .

The most recent planet discoveries bring the number of known exoplanets -- planets outside our solar system -- to 236 , the researchers told a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu on Monday .
“ We are beginning to see that our home is not a rarity in the universe , ” said Geoffrey Marcy , a professor of astronomy at the University of California Berkeley , who led the team .
“ We are easily able to detect giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn around other stars .
Most orbit far from the star like our own Jupiter and Saturn orbit from the sun , ” Marcy said in a telephone interview .
“ It ’s a common structure among planetary systems . ”
New techniques allow astronomers to detect planets that are not enormous although Earth - sized objects cannot yet be seen , said the researchers , who have posted details of their findings on the Internet at exoplanets.org .
Four of the systems also have multiple planets , like Earth ’s own with its sun , eight planets ( Pluto was demoted from planet status ) and smaller orbiting objects .
“ We are finding that most stars have not just one planet but when we find one there is a second or a third or a fourth , ” Marcy said .
“ The ... attribute which really has us the most excited is this new planet which we found three years ago , ” Marcy said .
The Neptune - like planet orbiting the star Gliese 436 has intrigued scientists because it appears to be covered with water -- albeit rock - hard , hot water in a most un -Earthlike chemical state because of the intense pressures on the planet .
“ JUMPING OUT OF OUR CLOTHES ”
Earlier this month , Swiss and Belgian researchers imaged the star as this planet crossed between it and the Earth .
The tiny change in the star ’s light gave them the planet ’s diameter and density .
“ From the density of two grams per cubic centimeter -- twice that of water -- it must be 50 percent rock and about 50 percent water , with perhaps small amounts of hydrogen and helium , ” Marcy said .
“ Now we are very sure it has a rocky core and this giant thick envelope of water , ” he added .
“ This is why we are jumping out of our clothes .
It is the first time we have determined the structure of one of these extrasolar planets .
It is rocky like Earth but it has a lot of water which is the essential ingredient for life . ”
This is almost certainly happening over and over again , Marcy said .
Scientists had theorized this for decades but now the hard evidence is starting to pour in .
“ Our Milky Way galaxy has 200 billion stars .
I would estimate that 10 percent of them , perhaps , have planets that are habitable , ” Marcy said .
“ There are hundreds of billions of galaxies , all of which are more or less like our Milky Way Galaxy , which is tens of billions of planets like our own . ”
There is one unusual property to our solar system : the nearly circular orbits of the planets , which gives a consistent dose of radiation from the Sun .
Other solar systems seen so far are not usually like this .
“ Most of the planets are not in circular orbits around the host star but in elongated ones called elliptical orbits , ” Marcy said .
“ We enjoy nearly constant temperatures throughout the year , ” he added .
“ If the Earth got too close to the Sun , the Earth would heat up , the water would boil off and that would be bad . ”
Too far , and it would freeze .
“ An elongated orbit could not sustain life , ” Marcy said .

When Sacha Baron Cohen wanted a village to represent the impoverished Kazakh home of his character Borat , he found the perfect place in Glod : a remote mountain outpost with no sewerage or running water and where locals eke out meagre livings peddling scrap iron or working patches of land .
• Watch the trailer for Borat 's movie here
But now the villagers of this tiny , close - knit community have angrily accused the comedian of exploiting them , after discovering his new blockbuster film portrays them as a backward group of rapists , abortionists and prostitutes , who happily engage in casual incest .
They claim film - makers lied to them about the true nature of the project , which they believed would be a documentary about their hardship , rather than a comedy mocking their poverty and isolation .
Villagers say they were paid just £ 3 each for this humiliation , for a film that took around £ 27 million at the worldwide box office in its first week of release .
Now they are planning to scrape together whatever modest sums they can muster to sue Baron Cohen and fellow film - makers , claiming they never gave their consent to be so cruelly misrepresented .
Disabled Nicu Tudorache said :
This is disgusting .
They conned us into doing all these things and never told us anything about what was going on .
They made us look like primitives , like uncivilised savages .
Now they , re making millions but have only paid us 15 lei [ around £ 3 ] .
Cambridge - educated Baron Cohen filmed the opening scenes of the Borat movie in Glod - a village that is actually in Romania , rather than Kazakhstan , and whose name literally translates as ' mud ' , last summer .
Its 1,000 residents live in dilapidated huts in the shadow of the Carpathian mountains .
Toilets are little more than sheltered holes in the ground and horses and donkeys are the only source of transport .
Just four villagers have permanent employment in the nearby towns of Pucioasa or Fieni , while the rest live off what little welfare benefits they get .
So when a Hollywood film crew descended on a nearby run-down motel last September , with their flashy cars and expensive equipment , locals thought their lowly community might finally be getting some of the investment it so desperately needs .
The crew was led by a man villagers describe as 'nice and friendly , if a bit weird and ugly ' , who they later learned was Baron Cohen .
It is thought the producers chose the region because locals more closely resembled his comic creation than genuine Kazakhs .
The comedian insisted on travelling everywhere with bulky bodyguards , because , as one local said : ' He seemed to think there were crooks among us . '
While the rest of the crew based themselves in the motel , Baron Cohen stayed in a hotel in Sinaia , a nearby ski resort a world away from Glod 's grinding poverty .
He would come to the village every morning to do ' weird things ' , such as bringing animals inside the run-down homes , or have the village children filmed holding weapons .
Mr Tudorache , a deeply religious grandfather who lost his arm in an accident , was one of those who feels most humiliated .
For one scene , a rubber sex toy in the shape of a fist was attached to the stump of his missing arm - but he had no idea what it was .
Only when The Mail on Sunday visited him did he find out .
He said he was ashamed , confessing that he only agreed to be filmed because he hoped to top up his £ 70 - a - month salary - although in the end he was paid just £ 3 .
He invited us into his humble home and brought out the best food and drink his family had .
Visibly disturbed , he said shakily : ' Someone from the council said these Americans need a man with no arm for some scenes .
I said yes but I never imagined the whole country , or even the whole world , will see me in the cinemas ridiculed in this way .
This is disgusting .
' Our region is very poor , and everyone is trying hard to get out of this misery .
It is outrageous to exploit people 's misfortune like this to laugh at them .
' We are now coming together and will try to hire a lawyer and take legal action for being cheated and exploited .
We are simple folk and do n't know anything about these things , but I have faith in God and justice . '
If the village does sue the film - makers , they wo n't be the first .
Last week , two unnamed college students who were caught on film drunkenly making racist and sexist comments took legal action , claiming the production team plied them with alcohol and falsely promised that the footage would never be seen in America .
Many other unwitting victims of Baron Cohen 's pranks have also spoken out against the way they were conned and - unsurprisingly - the rulers of Kazakhstan have long taken issue with the image Borat paints of their vast , oil - rich nation .
The residents of Glod only found out about the true nature of the film after seeing a Romanian TV report .
Some thought it was an art project , others a documentary .
The Mail on Sunday showed them the cinema trailer - the first footage they had seen from the film .
Many were on the brink of tears as they saw how they were portrayed .
Claudia Luca , who lives with her extended family in the house next to the one that served as Borat 's home , said : ' We now realise they only came here because we are poorer than anyone else in this village .
They never told us what they were doing but took advantage of our misfortune and poverty .
They made us look like savages , why would anyone do that ?'
Her brother - in law Gheorghe Luca owns the house that stood in for Borat 's - which the film - makers adorned by bringing a live cow into his living room .
Luca , who now refers to Baron Cohen as to the 'ugly , tall , moustachioed American man ' , even though the 35 - year - old comedian is British , said : ' They paid my family £ 30 for four full days .
They were nice and friendly , but we could not understand a single word they were saying .
' It was very uncomfortable at the end and there was animal manure all over our home .
We endured it because we are poor and badly needed the money , but now we realise we were cheated and taken advantage of in the worst way .
' All those things they said about us in the film are terribly humiliating .
They said we drink horse urine and sleep with our own kin .
You say it 's comedy , but how can someone laugh at that ?'
Spirea Ciorobea , who played the ' village mechanic and abortionist ' , said : ' What I saw looks disgusting .
Even if we are uneducated and poor , it is not fair that someone does this to us . '
He remembered wondering why the crew took an old , broken Dacia car and turned it into a horse cart .
He said : ' We all thought they were a bit crazy , but now its seems they wanted to show that it is us who drive around in carts like that .'
Local councillor Nicolae Staicu helped the crew with their shooting , but he claims he was never told what sort of movie they were making , and that they failed to get a proper permit for filming .
Staicu , who had never dealt with a film crew before , said : ' I was happy they came and I thought it would be useful for our country , but they never bothered to ask for a permit , let alone pay the official fees .
' I realise I should have taken some legal steps but I was simply naive enough to believe that they actually wanted to do something good for the community here .
' They came with bodyguards and expensive cars and just went on with their job , so we assumed someone official in the capital Bucharest had let them film . '
Bogdan Moncea of Castel Film , the Bucharest - based production company that helped the filming in Romania , said the crew donated computers and TV sets to the local school and the villagers .
But the locals have denied this .
Mr Staicu said : ' The school got some notebooks , but that was it .
People are angry now , they feel cheated . '
It 's a feeling Glod is used to .
The village , like others in the Dambovita region of Romania , is populated mainly by gipsies who say they are discriminated against by the rest of the country .
Indeed , when local vice - mayor Petre Buzea was asked whether the people felt offended by Baron Cohen 's film , he replied : ' They got paid so I am sure they are happy .
These gipsies will even kill their own father for money . '
No one from the 20th Century Fox studio was available for comment on the villagers ' claims .
But feelings in Glod are running so high that The Mail on Sunday saw angry villagers brandishing farm implements chase out a local TV crew , shouting that they had enough of being exploited .
It is small comfort that few , if any , of them will get to see the Borat film .
Not a single villager we spoke to had ever been able to afford a trip to the nearest cinema , 20 miles away .
Perhaps that 's the real reason why film - makers chose Glod in the first place .
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , Cuba — I AM WRITING from the darkness of the U.S. detention camp at Guantanamo in the hope that I can make our voices heard by the world .
My hand quivers as I hold the pen .
In January 2002 , I was picked up in Pakistan , blindfolded , shackled , drugged and loaded onto a plane flown to Cuba .
When we got off the plane in Guantanamo , we did not know where we were .
They took us to Camp X - Ray and locked us in cages with two buckets — one empty and one filled with water .
We were to urinate in one and wash in the other .
At Guantanamo , soldiers have assaulted me , placed me in solitary confinement , threatened to kill me , threatened to kill my daughter and told me I will stay in Cuba for the rest of my life .
They have deprived me of sleep , forced me to listen to extremely loud music and shined intense lights in my face .
They have placed me in cold rooms for hours without food , drink or the ability to go to the bathroom or wash for prayers .
They have wrapped me in the Israeli flag and told me there is a holy war between the Cross and the Star of David on one hand and the Crescent on the other .
They have beaten me unconscious .
What I write here is not what my imagination fancies or my insanity dictates .
These are verifiable facts witnessed by other detainees , representatives of the Red Cross , interrogators and translators .
During the first few years at Guantanamo , I was interrogated many times .
My interrogators told me that they wanted me to admit that I am from Al Qaeda and that I was involved in the terrorist attacks on the United States .
I told them that I have no connection to what they described .
I am not a member of Al Qaeda .
I did not encourage anyone to go fight for Al Qaeda .
Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden have done nothing but kill and denigrate a religion .
I never fought , and I never carried a weapon .
I like the United States , and I am not an enemy .
I have lived in the United States , and I wanted to become a citizen .
I know that the soldiers who did bad things to me represent themselves , not the United States .
And I have to say that not all American soldiers stationed in Cuba tortured us or mistreated us .
There were soldiers who treated us very humanely .
Some even cried when they witnessed our dire conditions .
Once , in Camp Delta , a soldier apologized to me and offered me hot chocolate and cookies .
When I thanked him , he said , “ I do not need you to thank me . ”
I include this because I do not want readers to think that I fault all Americans .
But , why , after five years , is there no conclusion to the situation at Guantanamo ?
For how long will fathers , mothers , wives , siblings and children cry for their imprisoned loved ones ?
For how long will my daughter have to ask about my return ?
The answers can only be found with the fair - minded people of America .
I would rather die than stay here forever , and I have tried to commit suicide many times .
The purpose of Guantanamo is to destroy people , and I have been destroyed .
I am hopeless because our voices are not heard from the depths of the detention center .
If I die , please remember that there was a human being named Jumah at Guantanamo whose beliefs , dignity and humanity were abused .
Please remember that there are hundreds of detainees at Guantanamo suffering the same misfortune .
They have not been charged with any crimes .
They have not been accused of taking any action against the United States .
Show the world the letters I gave you .
Let the world read them .
Let the world know the agony of the detainees in Cuba .
Some guy with a cell phone camera recorded this incident at a recent press conference showing off Honda ’s Asimo humanoid robot .
If you fast - forward the video clip to about 0:59 seconds , you can witness the pratfall :
Watch in horror as the brave little robot attempts to climb the stairs and instead does his best Chevy Chase impression .
The best part of the clip is when the stage crew attempts to conceal the lifeless , limp body of the poor little guy .
For a moment there , I had flashbacks to the famous Derek Smalls pod sequence in This is Spinal Tap .

Red , yellow , and green snowmen are not just the moldy leftovers of holiday candy , but can also be created due to a natural phenomenon that produces brilliantly colored snow .
Multi-hued snow , usually found in polar regions during the spring and summer months , results from dozens of species of algae .
The algae , which grow best in temperatures less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit , lie dormant beneath the snow through the winter .
During the spring melt , they awaken and feed off the flow of nutrients from thawing boulders , soil , insects , and trees .
The algae use the fuel to propel themselves , with tail - like structures called flagella , to the surface of snow .
Once they reach the top of the snowdrift , they lose their tails and compact together , creating a swath of color .
In February 2007 , observers reported a smelly yellow snow falling in regions of Western Siberia that was greasy to the touch .
According to experts , the yellow - colored snow that fell in Siberia was not due to algae , but another natural phenomenon .
Nina Sakhanovskayda from the Tomsk chemical laboratory reported it was colored by dust from Central Asia .
Dust can be carried to a height of 10 - 20 miles in the sky .
The yellow snow covered an area where about 28,000 people live and was not harmful .
Algae - colored snow is a more common phenomenon .
Single cellular algae can turn the usually white precipitation into an array of colors such as red , yellow , blue , and green .
Chlamydomonas , a green algae , is the most common species found in these surrealist snowdrifts .
They contain chlorophyll , a green pigment that helps plants get energy from light , but also results in green - tinted ice - crystals .
Chlamydomonas nivalis contains a pink pigment that offsets the chlorophyll and causes pink snow .
The orange and red-colored algae also contain chlorophyll , but their coloring comes from pigments used to protect them from ultra violet light , according to Ron Hoham , a professor of biology at Colgate University .
The hues intensify when the snow compacts , leaving footprints of color behind human and animal wanderers .
Algae - colored snow is found in Greenland , Antarctica , Alaska , Japan , Europe , and China , as well as the coasts of North America and the Himalayas .
For centuries colored snow puzzled people .
Even Aristotle referred to the phenomenon in his writings : “ … living animals are found in substances that are usually supposed to be incapable of putrefaction ; for instance , worms are found in long - lying snow ; and snow of this description gets reddish in color , and the grub that is engendered in it is red , as might have been expected , and it is also hairy . ” ( History of Animals , Aristotle )
Horace - Benedict de Saussure , an alpine traveler , physicist , and botany enthusiast , first speculated that the snow color effect had botanical origins in the late 18th century .
Algologist Robert Chodat , however , was the first to examine the snow with a microscope in the late 19th century .
While fauvist flakes stumped researchers for centuries , algae was known to color other scenes such as the bright orange or green lichen that grows on trees .
Algae can also live in hostile locales , such as in boiling hot springs or on the top of mountains , making algae a varied and natural pigment .
Germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of Europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .
The finance ministry said the tax surplus would come to 179.2 billion euros ( $ 241.6 billion ) by 2011 , according to new figures .
The federal government 's predicted fiscal surplus , or excess of tax revenue over expenditure , is expected to amount to 87 billion euros by that date .
The rest of the stated figure is made up of the expected surpluses of the country 's 16 regional states and social security services .
The projected figure for 2011 represents the biggest tax revenue surplus since the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949 .
Germany economy revs up
It also provides the latest proof that Germany is reaping the benefits of limited but unpopular labor market reforms that began to take effect under the former government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder .
The projection confirms that the German economy , the biggest in the eurozone , is recovering fast and regaining its position as the driver of European Union growth .
From 2002 to 2005 , Germany exceeded European Union rules that it helped to draw up and which obliged governments to keep their budget shortfalls below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product .
But after years of lethargic progress , Germany 's economic momentum increased sharply and its deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of GDP last year .
And the government is hoping to cut the ratio further to 1.2 percent in 2007 .
Differences over how best to use surplus
The left - right coalition government in Berlin appears divided on how best to use the tax surplus .
Economy Minister Michael Glos , a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats , favors tax cuts but Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück , a Social Democrat , is opposed to such a step .
Steinbrück would prefer to use the surplus to balance the German budget and reduce the national debt .
" This is a historic development , we can at last begin to reduce the mountain of debt that has accumulated and which stands at more than 1,500 billion euros , " Steinbrück said .
In the meanwhile , several other ministers are calling for the surplus to be used to fund projects in their portfolios .
Steinbrück gave assurances that the government planned to invest two billion euros a year in key areas such as " education and research , the family , environmental protection , infrastructure , development aid and internal security . "
In a breakdown given by the ministry , the total fiscal surplus is forecast at 20.3 billion in 2007 euros and at 47.9 billion euros next year .
In the olden days Linux administrators had a static / dev directory .
It was inflexible and obese , containing 99 % irrelevant entries , and we liked it that way .
We did n't mind hassling with makedev and struggling with major and minor numbers to enter the devices we actually wanted , or manually deleting the 1,000 useless / dev entries , because Real System Administrators love doing things the hard way .
It makes us feel close to our hardware .
The best part of the job is spending years acquiring and hoarding arcane bits of knowledge , which are then passed on to eager , fresh - faced noobs with the magical incantation , " RTFM , luser . "
Then came devfs , which attempted to replace this increasingly arthritic system with something that was less complex , more efficient , and which was a bit more based in reality .
The creator of devfs , Richard Gooch , had this radical idea that the / dev directory should contain only devices actually present on the system , and aim for better performance and simplified device management .
Then descended the unbearded prophet Greg Kroah - Hartman from his mountaintop lair with yet another dev filesystem , called thereforth udev .
Since kernel 2.6.13 , devfs is no longer included in the mainline kernel .
Endless debates rage about devfs vs. udev , which you can read about in Resources .
Chances are you still have / etc / devfs / on your system , and a few devices that depend on it .
A famous example is NVidia drivers .
So when you see this directory , do n't think you can go on a mad housecleaning spree and get rid of it .
udev handles the task of detecting hardware and creating nodes for it in / dev , and also managing device permissions .
It works in concert with the Linux Hardware Abstraction Layer ( HAL ) and the hotplug subsystem .
In effect , all devices , even internal drives and expansion cards , are treated as removable hotplug devices .
" Oh no , " you say , " this is not good , because removable devices receive different kernel names every time you plug them in . "
No problem , for udev lets you create fixed device names so you can make static entries in /etc / fstab , and do n't have to play hunt - the - widget every time you reboot .
In fact your Linux distribution probably comes with a nice pre-fab configuration that assigns static names to certain devices , like hard drives and PCI network cards .
It 's a nice flexible , highly adaptable system , and when it 's configured correctly by your distribution maintainer your computing life is easy and fun .
I 'm Sorry , Dave , I Can't Allow You to Do That
The downside to all this udev goodness is it 's still just a youth , so when you need to make some manual tweaks you have to figure out weirdo command syntax and how to uncover the device information you need .
It 's simple when you know how .
Well , maybe not even then .
But let 's take a look under the hood anyway .
We still have a / dev directory .
This is no longer a static directory , but rather is populated at boot with entries generated by udev rules .
udev 's rules are stored in configuration files in /etc /udev .
Different distributions mangle this in different ways .
Fedora and Ubuntu are sensible .
There is / etc / udev/udev.conf , which contains program options , then all rules files are kept in /etc/udev/rules .d/ like they 're supposed to .
Debian Etch , for gosh - knows - why , puts all the rules files in the top - level directory , and then has to symlink them all to /etc/udev/rules .d. udev rules must go in /etc/udev/rules.d .
The /sys directory is a cousin to / proc , only it 's well - organized rather than a chaotic mess .
It exports kernel information into a human - browseable and program - parseable structure .
Just like / proc uses the / proc filesystem , the /sys directory uses sysfs .
You can see this with the mount command : # mount proc on / proc type proc ( rw ) / sys on /sys type sysfs ( rw ) udev on / dev type tmpfs ( rw )
Notice how / dev uses tmpfs , which means wipeout on reboot .
/ sys is chock full o' symlinks , as you can see with the find / sys - type l command .
You can browse /sys just like any other directory .
Whether you 'll understand the contents is another question , but it does n't hurt to get familiar with its structure .

BBC News , Lom , Bulgaria
The lives of Roma ( gypsies ) are often portrayed as being full of poverty and discrimination .
However , for some in the Bulgarian town of Lom , religion and hard work are helping them build new , prosperous lives .
Iliya is one of many local Roma to become Pentecostalists
We found him in a brown shirt , pouring the concrete foundations of a new outhouse for his animals , beside his home .
A short , wiry man , he shouted his greetings as he worked , as a cousin slung him bucket after bucket .
Handshakes could come later , when the precious grey liquid had set .
Music and mirth rose from Humata , whose name means something like mud , the silt or sediment of a river .
A bloodshot sun sank at Iliya 's shoulder as he worked , painting his world a deep orange .
The settlement is built on a ridge , and behind the houses , a cliff falls suddenly onto a green plain below , dotted with brown horses .
And finally a river , which flows into another river .
The Danube .
But something was different here from so many gypsy neighbourhoods I have visited .
Everyone was busy .
They have built a church , rebuilt their own homes , and found an energy and purpose in their lives which seems , to a stranger at least , almost miraculous
It is also giving a people much derided as work shy , a protestant work ethic .
" I stole , I drank , I was lazy , " Iliya told us later , with a twinkle in his eye , playing the caricature of a gypsy villain , on a stage of his own carpentry .
" And then I got a life - threatening illness .
And I started to pray . "
That was 10 years ago .
With God 's help , he said , his whole neighbourhood practises Christianity now .
Together they have built a church , rebuilt their own homes , and found an energy and purpose in their lives which seems , to a stranger at least , almost miraculous .
Prayer meeting
Sixteen people , young and old , squeezed into a living room .
We sat in a circle .
The prayers came thick and fast , between a chant and a mumble , rising and falling like waves .
" Does anyone have a problem ? " asked a young man in a denim jacket .
One girl said her mother was working in Italy , and had a heart complaint .
A man said he was deep in debt .
A woman said her cousin was pregnant : " Could we pray for a safe delivery ? "
We sat in a circle .
The prayers came thick and fast , between a chant and a mumble , rising and falling like waves .
Almost half of Lom 's 32,000 population are Roma
" A man was driving a bus down a steep hill .
There was a cliff on one side , a ravine on the other .
" Suddenly , a child ran out into the middle of the road .
In the split second that followed , he had to make an appalling choice .
" To kill the child , or all his passengers . "
The man paused for a moment .
His audience froze .
I felt angry .
Why was he telling this story in front of children ?
" He drove straight into the child , " the man continued .
" There was blood all over the windscreen .
The passengers ran forward , remonstrating with him .
" ' You should have killed us instead , ' they shouted .
' How could you kill an innocent child ? '
" Then there was a deep silence . "
On the bus and in the room .
" Then the driver spoke .
' That child was my own son , ' he said , ' and his name was Jesus . ' "
Better education
Earlier the same day , we sat with Nikolai Kirilov and other local gypsy leaders , in a restaurant beside the Danube .
They all spoke English .
The river stretched before us like an ancient , pungent , grey - green lion , the barges on its coat just scratches .
" Ten years ago , when we started our association with Roma Lom , only 5 % of the gypsy children finished high school .
Now it 's 75 % . "
The numbers come thick and fast here too , like prayers that have been answered .
Until the year 2000 , only five gypsies from the town had ever finished university .
Now more than 40 have .
" Everything depends on education , " says Nikolai , " if kids do n't get good marks at school , they can't play in the football team . "
Integration
There are 32,000 people in Lom , about half of them Roma .
" It 's important that we teach Romany culture and language " he says .
" But even more important that we teach Bulgarian .
That will be more useful to them . '
After an hour of conversation , I remark that he has not uttered the words discrimination , segregation or prejudice , the normal narrative of the Roma activist .
He shrugs .
" Those words have been devalued by overuse , " he says .
So we talk about politics .
Is he not afraid of Bulgaria 's new , ultra- nationalist party Ataka , which blames all Bulgaria 's ills on gypsies and Turks ?
" My nightmare is that we create a crazy ethnic party of our own .
Then the conflict would really start , " is his answer .

Europe Just Says Maybe
' Harm reduction ' ?
A London protest to legalize Cannabis ( Giani Muratore — Camerapress )
From the bloodstream to the mainstream : authorities abandon faith in prohibition and embrace ' harm reduction . '
By Carla Power
Newsweek International , November 1 , 1999 Bill Nelles does n't fit the stereotype of a European drug addict .
A 44 - year - old graduate of the London School of Economics , he works as a senior manager in Britain 's National Health Service and sings tenor in two choirs ; he 's partial to Elizabethan madrigals .
But , like his friends the doctor , the lawyer and the social worker — and millions of other Western Europeans —
Nelles needs his drug fix .
As a schoolboy in Canada , he started dabbling in pot and LSD .
A friend introduced him to morphine , and by 23 , he was addicted to opiates .
Detox programs did n't take , and the few times he scored heroin on the street " terrified ' ' him , he says .
So in 1977 he moved to London , where sympathetic doctors can legally prescribe certain opiates .
He now takes 40 methadone tablets daily .
His habit , Nelles says , is simply a chronic medical condition .
" I do n't want to be judged because of a medication I take , " he says over coffee in his suburban London kitchen .
" One can have a normal life and take drugs . "
More and more Europeans are doing just that .
Strong economies , porous borders and a dance culture fueled on pills mean that many illegal drugs are cheaper , purer and more prevalent than a decade ago .
National drug surveys show that more than half of all Britons and Irish between 18 and 24 have experimented with illegal drugs , as have a third of French 15 - to 19 - year - olds .
Though Europe 's heroin use has generally fallen , Spain , Britain , Portugal and Ireland are facing serious problems with it .
Cocaine use in Britain trebled between 1996 and 1998 , and according to a survey out this month , more than 99 percent of London 's banknotes bear traces of the drug .
U.S. drug use has fallen by half since 1979 ; in Europe , it 's risen overall during the 1990s .
U.S. drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey , who visits Europe this week to talk policy , told NEWSWEEK : " We 've got a terrible problem that 's getting better .
[ The Europeans ] have a terrible problem that 's getting worse . "
British Prime Minister Tony Blair agrees .
Last month he told reporters he was " petrified " of his children 's getting involved with drugs , and then announced tough measures to fight drug - related crime .
Nothing new in a tough line on drug enforcement : the Americans have been doing it for years .
But Europe 's tactics for coping with drugs are changing , and so are public attitudes to them .
You 're not going to hear about it from national politicians , but drugs are being normalized .
It 's a quiet affair , carried out by local mayors and police and millions of Europeans who regularly break laws on weekends by taking drugs .
Drug users and counselors are banding together to create a " safe drug culture " — for kids who take a hit of ecstasy on the dance floor and for long - term addicts like Nelles .
Courts are quietly handing down precedent - setting decisions and loosening up on drug sentencing , and Europe 's policymakers are speaking sotto voce about pragmatism instead of prosecution .
With the exception of Sweden , which continues a hard - line policy on users and dealers , Europe is n't waging a U.S. - style war on drugs .
It 's shifted to a guerrilla operation against their effects .
For many Europeans , the " zero tolerance " strategy seems as quaint as the American temperance crusades of the 1920s .
" Prohibition did n't cut the number of alcoholics — and lifting it did n't increase them , " says Bonn 's Police Chief Dierk - Henning Schnitzler .
" Only the Mafia got big .
The same is true with drugs today . "
In today 's Europe , drugs are everywhere .
For the majority of European drug users , cannabis , either grown in the Netherlands or imported from Pakistan , Thailand , Colombia and Turkey , remains the high of choice .
Heroin arrives via Turkey and the Balkans ; importers quickly and efficiently switched smuggling routes during the Kosovo war .
And with cocaine use falling in the United States , Latin American dealers are targeting Europe as a new market .
" Sure , a society without drugs would be wonderful , " says Nicole Maestracci , director of France 's Interministerial Mission Against Drugs and Addiction .
" But nobody believes it exists anymore . "
So " harm reduction " — pragmatically coping with the social fallout of drug use — has replaced eradication as the strategy buzzword .
The dream of a drug - free Europe may have died for good on the dance floor .
Ecstasy 's popularity in the early '90s rave and club scenes introduced a new generation of Europeans to drugs .
At clubs and raves — the all - night dance parties held in fields or abandoned buildings — E-vogues changed as quickly as musical tastes .
The " doves " of the early '90s competed with the pink calis , which later gave way to the ecstasy pill of the moment , known as the Mitsubishi .
Ecstasy , speed , cocaine and , later , other recreational drugs like the animal anesthetic Ketamine , or " Special K , " became standard gear .
Criminologist Dirk Korf of the University of Amsterdam estimates that at many Western European clubs , one in four weekend patrons is on ecstasy .
" Drugs are simply part of our culture , " says Steve Du Boil , a 25 - year - old British electrician .
" We 've grown up with them .
I would n't go to a party without taking pills . "
Recreational users can access information on the effects of drugs on Internet sites like Ravesafe or the German - language Drogen - Online .
" Culturally , there 's been a big shift since ecstasy , " says Danny Kushlick , director of the U.K. pro-legalization group Transform .
" With its arrival on the scene , drug use was seen to be relatively safe .
It was seen as something normal .
It was about love , instead of degradation . "
That is a key point .
Younger Europeans typically are less interested in " dropout " drugs like heroin than in euphoric ones perceived as giving you a good night out — ecstasy , speed or cocaine .
And for all the clubbers who do the new - style recreational drugs every weekend , there are relatively few casualties : according to the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction , the chance of dying from taking ecstasy is less than one in a million .
But what worries health officials is the new culture of polyconsumption .
Weekend users , emboldened by experiments with cannabis , ecstasy or speed , are now starting to mix and match their drugs of choice .
Dealers are selling more than one drug , encouraging their clients to take what one drug sociologist calls " the supermarket approach . "
" Drugs are being thought about in a whole new way , " says Lauren Laniel of the Paris - based l'Observatoire Geopolitique des Drogues .
" In the past , people took drugs for self - discovery .
Now you take a hit of acid before a football match .
What we 're seeing develop is a consumerist relationship to drug use . "
Springing up to educate these consumers are safe - rave groups .
Some are funded by governments or the European Commission ; all are intent on creating a safe drug culture by passing on information about illicit substances .
Clubs in Amsterdam and Hamburg hand out cheery postcards on the side effects of ecstasy .
On weekends peer counselors from Unity , an Amsterdam - based prevention project partially funded by the EC , head out to raves .
Working under the motto " Just Say Know , " armed with glow - in - the - dark pamphlet racks and psychedelic cushions to build a " chill out " area , they answer dancers ' questions about uppers , downers and wideners .
The program 's based on realism , says Unity counselor Vivian Schipper .
" Experimentation is often part of being young and curious .
If it 's a phase , it 's not dangerous . "
It 's not just clubbers who have helped normalize drug use .
Courts and politicians are starting to listen to hard - drug users and addicts lobbying for their rights .
When Germany 's Gerhard Schroder came to office last fall , he shifted the country 's Drugs Commissioner office from the Interior Ministry — which deals with law enforcement — to the Health Ministry .
" Consumers of drugs are not criminals and should be exempt from criminal prosecution , " Germany 's Drugs Commissioner Christa Nickels announced .
" Addiction is a disease and not a crime . "
In some parts of the country , recreational - drug use is no longer prosecuted .
A 1994 court ruling allows local governments to sanction drug possession for " personal use . "
Granted , " personal use " varies from region to region : in law - and - order Bavaria , possessing marijuana can get you a jail sentence , while in the northern state of Schleswig - Holstein , courts wo n't prosecute people for holding 30 grams of marijuana , 3 grams of cocaine or a gram of heroin .
France is loosening up , too .
Like Germany , it had long taken a hard line on addiction ; now French policymakers are advising judges not to imprison nondealing users .
They 've also told police not to arrest addicts — a radical change in a country where , just a few years ago , police were arresting drug users at the needle - exchange buses that patrolled French city streets .
A Swiss court went one step farther : it overturned a prison sentence given to a Bern man convicted of selling 1,000 ecstasy pills .
The ruling found that this " soft drug " is used mostly by " socially integrated people " and " does n't lead to criminal behavior . "
It 's the Swiss — along with the Dutch — who have become champions of harm reduction .
Faced with spiraling heroin problems in Zurich and Bern , the Swiss did what the British had done until a generation ago : they started giving heroin to addicts on prescription .
The experiment started in 1994 ; last year , heroin prescriptions for addicts became legal .
Now the Dutch and Germans have started experimental heroin programs , and Spain is thinking about similar trials .
The Dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in 1976 .
A few years later , licensed " coffee shops " began selling pot and hash .
More recently , " Smart Shops " have sprung up in the Netherlands , selling mind wideners like magic mushrooms , herbal ecstasy and cultivated hash seeds with names like Master Kush .
The Dutch distinction between " hard " drugs , which are illegal , and " soft " drugs , which are not legal but tolerated , serves as a model for Europe 's would - be liberalizers .
Marijuana , maintain the Dutch , is n't necessarily a stepping stone to harder drugs .
" Everyone starts out life drinking milk , " says Fedde Visser , an Amsterdam heroin addict , with a grin .
" It does n't mean you 'll end up an alcoholic . "
Some police and politicians are starting to agree — up to a point .
When the Paris - based medical group Medecins du Monde launched Rave Mission , a drug- testing and information service , the cops would n't cooperate .
Now they no longer crack down on raves : at a recent one in Calvados , the local prefect was so impressed by Rave Mission 's work that he distributed free mineral water .
" The order of the day is no longer suppression , " says Rave Mission 's Gregoire Serikoff .
" The policy of repression is finished . "
In Germany , doctors and social workers have started the drug- information group Eve & Rave .
At this summer 's Love Parade , Berlin 's annual technofest , Eve & Rave staff tended dancers who had bad trips , and social workers dispensed legal advice and kits to check ecstasy tablets and amphetamines for purity .
A few years ago such a group would have been strictly lunatic fringe .
Today the German Health Ministry has asked Eve & Rave to design a plan for pill - testing at parties .
" We have to stop shutting our eyes and make drugs safer for the consumer , " says Tibor Harrach , a Berlin pharmacist and expert for the group 's drug - testing program .
" As long as drugs remain underground , anything can be in a pill . "
Europe may not be waging an all - out War on Drugs , but there 's still a raging battle between the pro- and anti-legalization camps .
Despite their growing support for the decriminalization of cannabis , few Europeans back legalization of hard drugs like heroin .
Even the liberal Swiss rejected the decriminalization of all drugs by 3 - 1 in a referendum this spring .
The new , borderless Europe has the anti-legalization camp worried about drug tourism .
The Dutch , under fire in recent years from Sweden , Germany and France , have had to dial back on liberal policies : until a few years ago , coffee - shop customers could buy 30 grams of hash by law ; today they can buy only five .
And the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has started a new rapid - reaction program for synthetic drugs .
Researchers keep up with the latest drug trends in clubs , study the substances scientifically and then the EU member states decide whether to ban them .
And yet some drug users are beginning to act more like citizens than criminals .
In Europe , as in Asia , Australia and the United States , they 've formed unions to lobby for everything from clean needles to employment rights , and self - help groups to spread the word on everything from bad junk in the neighborhood to the dangers of hepatitis C. In Denmark , the Users ' Union organizes mountain - biking expeditions for the addicts .
Junkiebond , a users ' union in Rotterdam , has a program to help addicts earn their fix money by sweeping streets or painting houses .
The same group is set to open a retirement home for aging junkies .
In France , a users ' support group called the Association for the Safety of Drug Users ( ASUD ) puts out street - smart pamphlets featuring Bloodi , a cartoon junkie in a yellow Mohawk , a syringe tucked behind his ear like a pencil , who gives advice : " Disinfect the vein you have chosen for your fix , " he says .
" The best way is to use a tampon with alcohol . "
ASUD gets $ 50,000 a year from the French Ministry of Health .
Britain 's drug czar Keith Hellawell has begun harnessing the knowledge of former drug users by getting them to work with addicts in prisons — a step that would have been seen as too radical a few years ago , he says .
Heroin addict Joergen Kjaer is president of Denmark 's Drug Users ' Union , which receives its 1.2 million kroner budget from the Ministry of Social Affairs and the city of Copenhagen .
Along with government ministers , Kjaer is a member of the country 's Narcotics Council .
When he shows up for debates on TV or social - work meetings in a jacket and tie , people are shocked : " They expect me to be skinny and look like a thief , because that 's what the stereotype of a junkie is . "
Kjaer , and his fellow pro-legalization activists , may not ever see a Europe where all drugs are legal .
But they are witnessing — and participating in — a slow - burn social change .
Does it make sense ?
Come back in 10 years .

Mr Spock , the fictional Vulcan famously logical and lacking in emotion , sacrificed himself for his comrades in the movie Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan with the following words to Captain Kirk : “ The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few , or the one ”
Now , revealing new research shows that people with damage to a key emotion - processing region of the brain also make moral decisions based on the greater good of the community , unclouded by concerns over harming an individual .
It is the first study to demonstrate how emotion impacts moral judgement and sheds light on why people often act out of respect for an individual rather than choosing to act in a more logical , utilitarian way .
The findings could cause a rethink in how society determines a “ moral good ” , and challenge the 18th - century philosophies of Immanuel Kant and David Hume .
Antonio Damasio at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles , US , and colleagues recruited 30 people for their experiment .
Six of the subjects had suffered damage to a region in the front of the brain known as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( VMPC ) , which regulates emotions .
The participants had this brain injury as a result of an aneurism or tumour growth in the VMPC region .

Twelve participants in the study had damage to other parts of the brain but not the VMPC .
And the remaining 12 subjects had no brain injury whatsoever .
“ Utilitarian ” action
The researchers presented participants with various scenarios ( scroll to the bottom for several examples ) and asked them to make decisions based on the information provided .
Some of the situations involved moral decision - making .
For example , subjects had to say whether they would throw a person in front of a train if doing so would stop the train from barrelling into five workmen , killing all five .
In such a situation , most people would find it morally unacceptable to push someone to his or her death – even if doing so would save the lives of others .
And this was the reaction of the healthy participants or those that had injury to brain regions excluding the VMPC .
But people with damage to the VMPC showed a willingness to take this type of “ utilitarian ” action .
“ You have one group that is ready to endorse what we would regard as an overly utilitarian judgment and the other far less ” willing to do so , explains Damasio .
He notes that the patients with VMPC damage generally made the same decisions as their control counterparts when it came to non-moral scenarios .
Subtle scenarios
Notably , people with VMPC damage were just as likely as their counterparts to endorse “ impersonal ” moral decisions that involved indirectly putting strangers at risk for the greater good .
These impersonal moral scenarios involved , for example , encouraging the use of a vaccine that would protect the public but cause an adverse reaction in a few individuals .
These results suggest that emotions play a crucial role in moral decisions involving personal contact – but not in moral judgments involving distant , indirect impacts on other people .
“ What ’s beautiful to me is how subtly different the situations are , ” says Marc Hauser at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , US , one of the researchers involved .
The finding that some moral judgments involve emotions while others do not supports the supposedly diametrically opposed thinking of philosophers Immanuel Kant and David Hume .
“ It means both Kant and Hume are right .
Philosophers will have a fit because they like to choose sides , ” says Frans de Waal at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , US .
Hume believed that people could be motivated to make proper moral decisions based on their sympathy for others .
Kant , meanwhile , warned that moral judgments might be corrupted by emotions .
Personal dignity
Philip Kitcher , who teaches philosophy at Columbia University in New York , US , notes that the study of brain damaged individuals presents a unique challenge to Kant ’s philosophy .
While Kant cautioned against the corruptive influence of emotions , he also argued that individuals have personal dignity , which must be respected .
Yet in the new study , subjects who had impaired emotion processing due to VPMC damage showed the least concern for individual dignity in the personal moral dilemmas that involved directly harming another person to save others .
This provides strong biological evidence that emotions enable us to respect individual dignity , says Kitcher .
“ Emotions are an anchor for our moral systems .
If you remove that anchor you can end up anywhere , ” says de Waal .
Examples of scenarios used in the experiment :
Non-Moral Scenario : Investment Offer
You are at home one day when the mail arrives .
You receive a letter from a reputable corporation that provides financial services .
They have invited you to invest in a mutual fund , beginning with an initial investment of one thousand dollars .
As it happens , you are familiar with this particular mutual fund .
It has not performed very well over the past few years , and , based on what you know , there is no reason to think that it will perform any better in the future .
Would you invest a thousand dollars in this mutual fund in order to make money ?
Impersonal Moral Scenario : Standard Trolley
You are at the wheel of a runaway trolley quickly approaching a fork in the tracks .
On the tracks extending to the left is a group of five railway workmen .
On the tracks extending to the right is a single railway workman .
If you do nothing the trolley will proceed to the left , causing the deaths of the five workmen .
The only way to avoid the deaths of these workmen is to hit a switch on your dashboard that will cause the trolley to proceed to the right , causing the death of the single workman .
Would you hit the switch in order to avoid the deaths of the five workmen ?
Personal Moral Scenario : Submarine
You are the captain of a military submarine travelling underneath a large iceberg .
An onboard explosion has caused you to lose most of your oxygen supply and has injured one of your crew who is quickly losing blood .
The injured crew member is going to die from his wounds no matter what happens .
The remaining oxygen is not sufficient for the entire crew to make it to the surface .
The only way to save the other crew members is to shoot dead the injured crew member so that there will be just enough oxygen for the rest of the crew to survive .
Would you kill the fatally injured crew member in order to save the lives of the remaining crew members ?
Personal Moral Scenario : Infection
Someone you know has AIDS and plans to infect others , some of whom will die .
Your only options are to let it happen or to kill the person .
Do you pull the trigger ?

IN “ Silver Blaze , ” one of the most popular of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ’s celebrated Sherlock Holmes stories , the following exchange occurs between the great detective and an Inspector Gregory of Scotland Yard :
Gregory : “ Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention ? ”
Holmes : “ To the curious incident of the dog in the night - time . ”
Gregory : “ The dog did nothing in the night - time . ”

Holmes : “ That was the curious incident . ”
The dog in question was supposed to be guarding the missing racehorse , Silver Blaze , and the fact that the horse was removed from its stable without the dog making a sound led Holmes to conclude that the silent canine knew the thief .
A phrase extrapolated from the story -- “ the dog that did n’t bark ” -- now defines an informal category of forensic logic that discerns hard truth in a significant silence .
If you followed this week ’s news reports on the confession given a military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay by the Al Qaeda killer Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , you may have noticed a peculiar silence among the usual media watchdogs .
Among all his various admissions , two were particularly chilling :
One was his acceptance of total responsibility for the atrocities committed on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ I was responsible for the 9/11 operation from A to Z , ” the U.S. - educated onetime engineer told the tribunal .
The other was his pseudo - pious description of murdering Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl .
According to the transcript released by military authorities , Mohammed told the panel , “ I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew , Daniel Pearl , in the city of Karachi , Pakistan .
For those who would like to confirm , there are pictures of me on the Internet holding his head . ”

As you might expect , this confession set the pundit pack baying in full cry .
We ’ve now had 72 hours of faux - Churchillian fulmination on “ evil ” and “ monsters ” and “ the clash of civilizations ” and “ a new era ” that makes no allowance for the old - fashioned niceties concerning human rights and due process .
But there ’s a dog that has n’t barked , and its silence speaks volumes concerning one of the American news media ’s fundamental failures in covering the Bush administration ’s response to 9/11 .
Here you have a guy -- Khalid Shaikh Mohammed -- who has confessed to planning and directing the worst mass murder ever perpetrated on American soil and has admitted to personally murdering a U.S. citizen in what any reasonably aggressive American prosecutor would call a hate crime , and virtually nobody in the news media has called for putting the man on trial .
Worse , virtually nobody has bothered to explain that the willfully erroneous way in which this administration has chosen to deal with the Al Qaeda prisoners from the outset has made it impossible to subject them to anything resembling the normative justice they so richly deserve .
Mohammed ca n’t be brought to trial because the White House had him tortured and , therefore , virtually none of what you read this week could be used against him in a legitimate court of law .
In fact , who knows which parts of it are true , which parts of it were given simply to stop the water boarding -- simulated drowning -- to which he reportedly has been subjected , which parts are perverted bravado and which parts are an attempt to draw attention from other Al Qaeda killers still at large ?
In secret proceedings based on physical abuse , who knows ?
But then , when it comes to this issue , the nation ’s commentators and editorial pages have been derelict and complicit from the start .
Their refusal to reject the White House ’s various euphemisms for torture and evasions concerning the existence of a secret CIA prison system in which suspected terrorists and real terrorists , like Mohammed , have been tortured and held for years without lawyers or recourse to any legal process is a categorical failure of moral responsibility without recent precedent .

This institutional flight from responsibility stands in stark -- and humiliating -- contrast to the work of individual reporters at the Washington Post , New York Times , Los Angeles Times and other papers , who have risked prosecution -- and , sometimes , their editors ’ displeasure -- to expose governmental abuses of human and civil rights in the “ war on terror . ”
There were a couple of quiet voices raised in defense of responsibility Friday .
On The Times ’ op - ed page , columnist Rosa Brooks pointed out that Mohammed is “ not an ‘ enemy combatant ’ in a war , but a brutal criminal , someone who , as Human Rights Watch ’s John Sifton puts it , deserves the same fate as ‘ child molesters and serial killers ’ -- ignominious trial and conviction . ”
Paul Steiger , the Wall Street Journal ’s managing editor , told Editor & Publisher ’s Joe Strupp that he thinks Pearl ’s killer “ should be prosecuted under appropriate laws , he should be put in a position not to do this again . ”
But what the nation ’s editorial pages -- including the Journal ’s -- failed to decry and what the print and electronic news media utterly failed to explain this week is that the vexing fact of Steiger ’s wholly reasonable wish has been put beyond our collective reach by state policies the press failed to adequately expose and oppose .
Mohammed , for example , has been in the CIA ’s hands for all but six months since he was arrested in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
( For the last half a year , he ’s been in the Guantanamo gulag , along with other so - called high - value detainees .
The confession released this week was part of a proceeding held by an anonymous military tribunal before which he appeared without a lawyer and to which he was not allowed to call witnesses on his behalf . )

There ’s a sinister hint of what went on during the previous 3 1/2 years that he was in American hands in written testimony the government submitted during the trial of terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui .
In the preamble to what it says are various statements he allegedly made , the authorities note , “ Shaikh Mohammed was captured in March 2003 and has been interrogated over the course of years on multiple occasions since his capture . ”
Gosh , wonder what that involved ?
We rely on our military for defense .
We do not ask it to dispense justice on our behalf anymore than we should ask soldiers and Marines to act as police officers .
That ’s why we have courts and cops , and why our laws and , more important , well - established political tradition draw a bright line between their function and that of the armed forces .
We do not refrain from torturing criminals such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed out of some misplaced fellow feeling for them , but out of respect for ourselves .

The general failure of the American media to note and defend those principles is something for which they ought to be held to account .

I am proposing that the Son and the Father Singularities guided the worlds of the multiverse to concentrate the energy of the particles constituting Jesus in our universe into the Jesus of our universe .
That is from Frank Tipler ’s The Physics of Christianity .
But wait , there is competition for the honor :
If Jesus indeed rose from the dead using the mechanism described in Chapter 8 , namely electroweak tunneling to convert matter into energy , and if indeed this was done with the intention of showing us how to use the same process , then we ourselves should be able to learn how to turn matter into either electromagnetic energy or neutrinos within a few decades .
For me , the single most important element of style affecting readability is " consistency " .
Whitespace
When I first encountered the long lamented Abigail - II 's code on PM , it looked strange to my eyes .
And despite that there are quite a few of his guidelines that I do not follow , and disagree with his reasoning , I always find his code eminently readable .
Even when that code is performing the often complex manipulations for which he is famous , the consistency of his code layout makes spending time exploring his code a joy .
And of all the stylistic elements of his code that make that so , his liberal - - too liberal in a few places for my tastes -- and consistent use of horizontal whitespace ranks very high on the list of things that make it so readable .
In large part , this is the inspiration behind my liberal use of horizontal whitespace .
I attempted to code with consistency of layout long before I encountered Perl , but I 've modified my coding style since using Perl to incorporate more horizontal whitespace and this has reflected back into my coding in other languages .
Tokens
As is demonstrated by this quote Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at an Elingsh uinervtisy , it deos n't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are , the olny iprmoetnt tihng is that frist and lsat ltteer is at the rghit pclae .
The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm .
Tihs is bcuseae we do not raed ervey lteter by it slef but the wrod as a wlohe .
from Txet Maglning Glof , Ayobndy ? , we do n't parse writing , including code , letter by letter , but rather , token by token .
So ensuring that the tokens in our code are clearly delineated is ( IMO ) , the greatest single contribution to readability .
Indentation
The second area where consistency also applies is in indentation .
Whilst I hate the significant whitespace aspect of languages that use it -- because it means that the entire function of a piece of code can silently change through the accidental omission or deletion of an invisible character .
I hate inconsistent indentation even more .
Why anyone would code this PP ( pp_padhv ) { dSP ; dTARGET ; I32 gimme ; XPUSHs ( TARG ) ; if ( PL_op -> op_private & OPpLVAL_INTRO ) { SAVECLEARSV ( PAD_SVl ( PL_op -> op_targ ) ) ; } if ( PL_op-> op_flags & OPf_REF ) { RETURN ; else if ( LVRET ) { if ( GIMME == G_SCALAR ) { Perl_croak ( aTHX_
" Ca n't return hash to lvalue scalar conte + xt " ) ; } RETURN ; } gimme = GIMME_V ; if ( gimme == G_ARRAY ) { RETURNOP ( do_kv( ) ) ; } else if ( gimme == G_SCALAR ) { SV * const sv = Perl_hv_scalar ( aTHX_ ( HV *) TARG ) ; SETs ( sv ) ; } RETURN ; } [ download ] like this , PP ( pp_padhv ) { dSP ; dTARGET ; I32 gimme ; XPUSHs ( TARG ) ; if ( PL_op -> op_private & OPpLVAL_INTRO ) SAVECLEARSV ( PAD_SVl( PL_op->op_targ ) ) ; if ( PL_op-> op_flags & OPf_REF ) RETURN ; else if ( LVRET ) { if ( GIMME == G_SCALAR ) Perl_croak ( aTHX_
" Ca n't return hash to lvalue scalar context " ) + ; RETURN ; } gimme = GIMME_V ; if ( gimme == G_ARRAY ) { RETURNOP ( do_kv( ) ) ; } else if ( gimme == G_SCALAR ) { SV * const sv = Perl_hv_scalar ( aTHX_ ( HV *) TARG ) ; SETs ( sv ) ; } RETURN ; } [ download ] is so far beyond my understanding that it 's not even worth my trying .
I tried to think of an appropriate analogy here , but everything I came up with would have offended somebody .
Historical justifications
This is also why I eshew many of the common coding practices and style guidelines .
Unlike Abigail 's , most of them do not come with justifications other than historic precedence .
If history was such a great recommendation , we 'd still write English in the style of Chaucer !
Best practice changes over time .
And sticking with ancient practices , " because that 's how it 's always been done " , does n't make sense .
When I first started programming , squared coding sheets , manually assigned , widely spaced line numbers were derigour .
When I first wrote code commercially , 64x20 ( or 23 ? ) green - on - black vdus were just starting to become available .
So pouring ( or is that pawing ) over huge stacks of green&white fanfold listings with a handful of coloured highlighters was a necessary part of my daily life .
With the advent of bigger , color screens , and syntax highlighting editors , I find that I have rarely printed a piece of code out for the last 10 or more years .
Things moved on and so did I .
Justifictions
Where they do come with justifications , these are often ( IMO ) wrongly argued .
For example , the justifiction for preferring underscore_separated_variable_names to camelCaseVariableNames is that the former makes it easier to parse the individual words -- which it probably does to some degree .
But this is a wrongly argued justification .
The problem is that it makes visually separate tokens of those individual words , which you do n't want .
As demonstrated above , the human brain / eyes recognises patterns / tokens not characters and words , so breaking singular tokens into multiple , visually separate elements is a bad thing , not a good one .
By way of simplistic demonstration , how many parameters are there in the following ?
some_function ( some_variable , some_other_variable,and_yet_another_variable,and_one_more_for, luck ) someFunction ( someVariable , someOtherVariable , and YetAnotherVariable , and OneMoreFor , luck )
Did you catch it the first time ?
Huffman encoding Another justifiction is that for Huffman encoding of keywords .
Huffman encoding does make sense , but I 've variously seen this justified on the basis of being quicker to type , or quicker to read , but these miss the point .
Coders do not type at 60 wpm .
And if they do , they produce bad code .
I remember a metric from a very long time ago that the average programmer codes around 10 - 12 lines of code per day .
Of course , this is n't just the time it takes to type the lines , it reflects design , debugging , maintenance etc. over the life of the code .
But even if you sit down to type in a piece of code , the function of which is clear in your mind and the algorithm for which is well known and a part of your mental lexicon , you still will rarely achieve anything approaching secretarial typing speeds .
You will pause for some amount of time to decide what to name each variable .
You 'll pause to decide whether map or grep or for or redo is appropriate for this particular piece of iteration .
Should you use print and interpolated variables or printf and a template ?
Likewise , once you become familiar with keywords and function names , even those in code you just picked up , it will make negligible difference to your parsing speed whether the it is for or foreach , or map or applyThisBlockOfCodeToEachElementOfThisList .
Once you know what the function / variable / keyword does , you will not parse the spelling of the token .
You 'll simply recognise it -- the token , short or long -- as doing whatever it does .
So that leaves us with the question , what is the real value of Huffman encoding ?
( IMO ) , it is twofold : Shorter is easier to remember -- in context .
My justifications for this are : DANGER : KEEP OUT !
Is more likely to have the desired affect than Within the area encircled by this metallic mesh barrier there exist localised high potential gradients that create the possibility for mis-endevour -- including but not limited to burning , severe burning , maiming and termination of existence .
You are accordingly advised that progressing inside the barrier could be hazardous .
We use acronyms in preference to their expansions -- once we know what the acronym means .
TIMTOWTDI !
Of course , when you encounter an acronym or abbreviation for the first time , it does n't make sense .
But once you are familiar with them , and you are operating in the right context , not using them makes no sense .
If you 're a fan of Grey 's Anatomy , ER or any of the many other medical soaps , then can you imagine the crash team screaming
He 's going into ventricular fibrillation , so would someone be so kind as to get me 30 cubic centiliters of D3 , 1,25 - dihydroxy - 20 - epi-Vitamin ( * ) .
Oh , and if it 's not imposing upon you to much , could you do that as a matter of great priority please .
Instead of He 's going into v-fib , get me 30 cc of epi , stat .
* I have no idea if that 's the correct expansion of " epi " in this context , but it lent itself to the point I am making and in truth , I do n't need to know .
Brevity == clarity .
The more frequently something is used , the shorter it should be , because it takes up less screen space .
That means that atomic elements of code can more often be coding in a single line .
And that allows more discrete steps ( preferably all of them ) , of an overall algorithm to be visible on a single screen .
This is a huge , huge aid to understanding , both for the original author and the future maintenance programmer .
Long variable names
Another common ( IMO mis -) perception is that long , descriptive variable names make for clearer code .
This is only ever true for the first few minutes before you know what the variable is used for .
After that , once you have internalised the purpose of a variable , they are just tokens .
And , provided that their scope is suitably confined , the ability to recognise the token quickly and easily when scanning the code is inversely proportional to it 's length .
Contrast my @sorted = sort { $ a < = > $ b } @names ; [ download ] my @list_of_numerically_sorted_names = sort { $ first_element_to_be_compared <=> $ second_element to be compared } @list_of_unsorted_names ; [ download ]
Of course , single character variable names are pretty useless if the life of the variable extends much beyond a few lines .
But then most variables should n't have scopes that extend much beyond a few lines anyway -- but that 's a different discussion .
Whilst it is easy to argue that longer variable names allow the maintenance programmer ( you , in a month or three 's time ) , to quickly become familiar with the purpose of a variable when they first dive into a piece of code , ( IMO ) that is false economy .
It ( along with overly commented code ) , encourages a practice that I term ' hit & run ' or ' guerrilla ' maintenance .
This is where the programmer receives a description of the problem , makes an assumption about the likely cause , dives into the middle of the code in question , reads a few comments or variable names and makes changes consistent with his earlier assumptions .
The problem is , descriptive variable names , like descriptive comments , describe what the original programmer thought they were coding .
But the reason the maintenance programmer is in there , is because the code does n't do what the original programmer thought it was doing .
Of course , there are other reasons for maintenance than bugs , but I still feel that whenever you sit down to change a piece of code , you should understand what it does , and how it does it , not just what someone thought it should do , before you start making changes .
One of the ways I get to know a piece of code is to sit down and go through it changing the source - code layout to bring it to my preferred layout .
I do this manually .
I find that the process of inserting / adjusting whitespace , adjusting the indentation , and sometimes , even changing the variable names to fit my understanding of the code allows me to get a much clearer picture of the code at both the macro and micro levels .
Of course , this can offend some programmers and does n't fit well with some source control and maintenance techniques , which means that once I have made my changes , I have to go back to the original sources and re-make them in the style of the original code if I intend to supply a patch for example .
That could be seen as a problem , but it also serves as a secondary validation of the changes .
Examine what is said , not who speaks -- Silence betokens consent --
Love the truth but pardon error .
" Science is about questioning the status quo. Questioning authority " .
In the absence of evidence , opinion is indistinguishable from prejudice .
" Too many [ ] have been sedated by an oppressive environment of political correctness and risk aversion .

A controversial plan to dump iron dust into the open ocean near the Galapagos Islands to induce the growth of phytoplankton met with opposition from an environmental group today .
The plan , from a company called Planktos , Inc. , seeks to grow the tiny creatures in an attempt to suck up excess atmospheric carbon dioxide .
Iron dust can stimulate the growth of microscopic marine plants that in turn use carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere to fuel photosynthesis .
While phytoplankton in the ocean already absorb some of the greenhouse gas , some scientists have theorized that dumping iron into the ocean could allow it to become a more effective carbon sink , which is exactly the idea that Planktos , Inc , a for - profit company , plans to test .
But others , including the World Wildlife Fund , are skeptical about the impact this dumping could have on other marine life .
“ There are much safer and proven ways of preventing or lowering carbon dioxide levels than dumping iron in the ocean , ” said Lara Hansen , chief scientist with the WWF International Climate Change Program .
“ This kind of experimentation with disregard for marine life and the lives of people who rely on the sea is unacceptable . ”
Possible consequences
WWF scientists argue that the Planktos experiment could result in a shift in the composition of species that make up the plankton , which is the base of the marine food chain .
Of particular concern to the WWF , the largest multinational conservation organization in the world , are the 400 species of fish that swim off the Galapagos coast , and the turtles , penguins , marine iguanas and other animals that inhabit the islands , many of which are found nowhere else in the world .
“ World Wildlife Fund ’s concern extends beyond the impact on individual species and extends to the changes that this dumping may cause in the interaction of species , affecting the entire ecosystem , ” said microbiologist Sallie Chisholm , a WWF board member .
“ There ’s a real risk that this experiment may cause a domino effect through the food chain . ”
Russ George , the CEO of Planktos , Inc. , counters that the very reason why the Galapagos Islands have the rich array of life that they do is because of the iron that drains from the islands into the ocean .
“ The Galapagos bloom is one of the most famous features on the planet , ” George said .
He says that the Galapagos bloom is much larger than the one his group will be creating , and will actually serve as a control for their experiment , which will be conducted several hundred miles west of the island chain .
George adds that they will be putting far less iron into the ocean than what comes from the Galapagos to create the famous bloom .
“ No amount of iron that humans could add to the ocean could meet with what the Galapagos puts in the ocean , ” George told LiveScience .
The WWF also argues that the gases released by the phytoplankton blooms and the bacteria that eat the plants after they die could have a negative effect .
The bacterial decay could also consume oxygen and alter the levels of the gas in the water column , which could favor the production of microbes that emit potent greenhouse gases , like nitrous oxide ( commonly known as “ laughing gas ” ) .
George said that several environmental organizations have criticized his company ’s experiments , though other scientific organizations have conducted , or plan to conduct , similar experiments .
He added that none of the potential consequences cited by the WWF and other groups have been seen in previous experiments .
According to researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts , who have conducted such experiments , it is uncertain whether or not iron fertilization will actually substanitally reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide .
Cataclysmic collapse
Far from harming marine life , George says , the plans of iron enrichment will actually revitalize phytoplankton , whose numbers have been steadily dropping over the last couple decades , as was reported in a Dec. 7 paper in the journal Nature .
“ The plant life in the ocean is collapsing at a rate of 1 percent per year , ” the same amount of decline as is seen in terrestrial rainforests , George said .
But the total amount of decline in phytoplankton biomass is equivalent to the disappearance of all the rainforests on Earth , George said , and which he describes as “ an absolute cataclysmic state of collapse . ”
George argues that iron enriching efforts are simply returning missing nutrients restoring the plant life to their previous levels .
The WWF's Chisholm countered that plankton productivity is not static and that estimates showing decreases are based on indirect surface measurements that do n't include plankton deeper in the water column .
" So there is not enough evidence to warrant such extreme measures , which do not mimic natural processes , and are ephemeral , " Chisholm told LiveScience in an email .
The key to our trick is to rotate the klieg .
As the light turns , the bat shadow sweeps across the sky .
Round and round it goes , projecting into the void .
Just as the rim of a bicycle wheel moves faster than its hub , so too , away from the source our bat shadow will fly faster and faster , a consequence of the geometry that guarantees the rim of a really big wheel moves faster than a co-rotating small wheel .
At a great enough distance from the source , our shadow bat will go so fast it will exceed the speed of light .
This does not violate relativity because a shadow carries no energy .
Literally nothing is transferred .
Our shadow bat can go 10 times the speed of light or 100 times faster without breaking any of physics ’ sacred rules .
My sister leapt to the heart of this apparent paradox :
Why is n’t the light itself traveling faster than the speed of light ?
Is n’t it also rotating in space ?
Actually , no .
The bulbs that produce the light are spinning , but the light particles leave the source at 186,000 miles a second , the vaunted “ speed of light . ”
Once emitted , the photons continue to travel at this speed directly away from the source .
Only the shadow revolves around the great circle .
The critical point is that no object , no substance , defies light .
My husband was right to object that you ’d need one spectacular klieg to produce a detectable shadow thousands of miles out in space .
Still , the theory is sound .
The anthropologist Mary Douglas noted that all systems of categorizing break down somewhere , unable to incorporate certain forms .
By standing beyond relativity ’s injunction , shadows suggest the limits of all classification schemes , a tension that even modern science cannot completely resolve .
In the terms recognized by relativity , shadows are non-things .
Yet before the invention of clocks , shadows were the most important means for telling time .
Weightless and without energy , shadows can nonetheless convey information — though they cannot , despite our giant klieg , be used for faster - than - light communication .
That ’s because the shadow ’s location cannot be detected until the light , moving at its ponderous relativistic pace , arrives .
“ Here there be monsters , ” said the medieval maps , signaling the limits of reason ’s reach .
As a map of being , physics is flanked by the monsters of non-being whose outlines we glimpse in the paradoxes of quantum mechanics and in the zooming arc of a shadow bat going faster than light .
In Christian theology we are told , “ God is that which nothing is greater than . ”
The scientific corollary might be , “ Light is that which nothing is faster than ” — a statement true both in spirit and fact .
The 1957 Plymouth Belvedere car was part of a competition
Car unveiling
Though encased in a concrete vault said to be strong enough to withstand nuclear attack , the Plymouth Belvedere was waterlogged and covered in rust .
Air was pumped into the tyres but mechanics could not get it started .
The car was exhumed from its vault near Tulsa 's courthouse as part of Oklahoma 's centenary celebrations .
" I 'll tell you what , she 's a mess - look at her , " said legendary US car builder Boyd Coddington , who had been hoping to start the car at an event attended by thousands of people .
Beer and lipstick
Items pulled from the car 's trunk include a petrol can and some cans of Schlitz beer .
But what was supposed to be the typical woman 's handbag of the times , containing lipstick and tranquillisers , was said to resemble a lump of rotten leather , the Associated Press news agency reports .
A capsule buried separately fared better , yielding an American flag and postcards and maps in good condition .
The car is being searched for a microfilm containing the names of entrants in a contest .
They had been asked to guess the population of Tulsa in 2007 and the entrant with the closest estimate , or their heirs , would win the car .
Canadian government indifferent to Israel ’s murder of eight of its citizens
By Keith Jones
20 July 2006
This article is available as a PDF leaflet to download and distribute
Canada ’s Conservative government has responded to the murder of eight Canadian citizens in an Israeli air strike with a shrug of its shoulders .
The Canadians , four adults and four children aged from 1 to 7 , were among eleven members of the Al - Akhrass family who were killed as the result of Israeli strafing of the south Lebanese village of Aitaroun last Sunday .
All four of the family ’s houses in Aitaroun were destroyed by Israeli bombs .
In the past such an event would have triggered a strong Canadian protest , with Ottawa likely calling in the Israeli ambassador for an official dressing down .
All the more so , since it is indisputable that the Israeli action against Lebanon , ostensibly launched in response to the kidnapping of two soldiers by Hezbollah , has taken the form of a punitive mission , with the Israeli military besieging the country and targeting Lebanese infrastructure and civilians
Of the three hundred people killed in the past eight days of fighting , the overwhelming majority have been , like Montreal pharmacist Ali Al - Akhrass and his family , innocent civilians .
The Conservative government , however , is callously indifferent to this loss of life , even when the dead are those whom it purportedly represents .
It has voiced not even a murmur of protest over the Israeli attack on Aitaroun .
Nor does it appear Ottawa has done anything to investigate what happened in Aitaroun , apart from asking the Israeli government , whose military killed the Canadians , to provide details .
At a press conference Monday , Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper offered “ condolences ” to the families of the Canadians killed in Lebanon , but only after reaffirming his government ’s contention that Hamas and Hezbollah bear sole responsibility for the undeclared war now raging in the region and advancing arguments to justify the horrific loss of civilian life at the hands of the Israeli military .
There is a crisis in the Middle East , said Harper , “ because of the actions of Hamas and the actions of Hezbollah ” and “ the onus remains ” on them “ to take steps to end the conflict . ”
“ But obviously , ” continued Harper , “ we urge Israel and others to minimize civilian damage . ”
Lest this be construed as criticism of Israel for the deaths of the Canadians , Harper hastened to add , “ It is difficult , though .
We recognize it is difficult when you ’re fighting a non-governmental organization that ’s embedded in a civilian population . ”
On Tuesday , Harper conceded that the wiping out of a large part of the extended Al - Akhrass family was a “ tragedy , ” but within the context of a vigorous defence of his July 13 statement that the Israeli response to the kidnapping of its soldiers by Hezbollah and Hamas was “ measured ” — i.e. appropriate .
“ Measured , ” says Harper , although the Israeli government has for all intents and purposes declared war on the Lebanese and Palestinian people and has made clear it has no real interest in negotiating for the release of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers .
Rather it is using their seizure as the pretext to bloodily rewrite the geo-politics of the Middle East .
If anything , Israel has been more concerned about the deaths of the Canadians in Aitaroun than the Harper government .
While Ottawa ’s action over the matter has been limited to a routine request for “ information ” from Tel Aviv , Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert telephoned Harper yesterday to offer the Israeli ’s government “ condolences . ”
The Harper government ’s attitude toward Israel ’s killing of its citizens exemplifies its complicity and that of the Bush administration and other western governments in Israel ’s latest war of aggression — a war in which a massive military machine , equipped with the most sophisticated and deadly weaponry , is terrorizing an almost completely defenseless population in the name of “ eradicating terrorism . ”
As would be expected , Harper ’s callous indifference to their relatives ’ fate has angered the surviving members of the Al - Akhrass family .
At a press conference in Montreal Monday , they denounced Israel for the slaughter of civilians and the Harper government for supporting the Israeli aggression against Lebanon .
“ I am crying for all the innocents that are dying , ” said Ali Al - Akhrass ’ sister , Maysoun .
“ I am crying because my country is being destroyed .
By whom ?
Israel .
Nobody , not the media , not Mr. Harper , is supporting Lebanon .
Nobody is telling the truth . ”
Family members said that Ali had brought his wife and four children to Aitaroun in late June for a five - week visit to their ancestral home .
When fighting erupted last week , they contacted the Canadian embassy in Beirut for assistance in getting out of Lebanon , but embassy staff told them to stay put .
( Although more Canadians are reputed to be in Lebanon than the combined total of the nationals of all other western countries , several European states and the US began evacuating their citizens well - before Canada did .
Only yesterday did Canada ’s evacuation effort begin and in , what the press conceded was , widespread confusion . )
Canadian Arab Federation President Khaled Mouammar told a Toronto press conference Tuesday .
“ We are here to express our anger about statements made by the prime minister . ”
“ ... The prime minister is justifying the murder of Canadian civilians in Lebanon and Palestine and he says nothing to condemn these attacks . ”
Mouammar contrasted the Canadian government ’s indifference to the deaths of the Al - Akhrass family with its vigorous demands that Iran investigate and prosecute those responsible for the death of Zahra Kazemi , a Canadian photographer who died in an Iranian prison after being brutalized by Iranian security personnel .
Canada ’s corporate media , meanwhile , has lauded the Harper government for using the Israeli aggression to shift Canada ’s foreign policy sharply to the right and adopting yet again the policy and posture of the Bush administration as its own .
“ The Harper government ’s foreign policy shift , ” enthused the Globe and Mail ’s John Ibbitson , “ amounts to a change of sides in the schism between North America and Europe over the Middle East .
During the 2003 war with Iraq , Liberal foreign policy placed Canada on the side of France , Germany and Russia in opposition .
Now Canada is onside with the United States , Britain and Australia in support of Israel ... ”
Various press commentators have mocked opposition politicians , including interim Liberal leader Bill Grahamm for suggesting that the lack of “ nuance ” in the Harper government ’s stance on the conflict in the Middle East will make Canada irrelevant in future diplomatic negotiations .
And the National Post , the flagship publication of the Canwest media empire , devoted a series of columns and its lead editorial Monday to exonerating Israel for any responsibility in the deaths of the eight Canadians .
“ Horrible as such deaths are , ” declared the Post editorial , “ there is an important moral distinction to be drawn between terrorists who kill civilians deliberately , as in the case of Hezbollah rockets attacks ; and an army that accidentally kills civilians in the course of attacking military and strategic objectives . ”
In fact , as the body count demonstrates , the target of Israel ’s assault on Lebanon is its population .
Israel aims , as several strategic analysts have explained , to inflict such misery and terror on the Lebanese that they will “ turn against ” Hezbollah — a movement that arose in response to Israel ’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon , an invasion which led directly to the massacre of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps .
The Harper government ’s indifference to the murder of eight Canadians in Lebanon epitomizes its nature .
In pursuing the agenda of big business — the repositioning of Canada on the global stage as a significant military power closely allied with the United States , the dismantling of what remains of the welfare state , and the systematic redistribution of wealth in favor of the owners of capital and the most privileged sections of the middle class though tax cuts and privatization — the Conservative government is utterly indifferent to the fate of the Canadian people .
Who knew the United States Postal Service could feel the Force ?

Some think that there are bears walking around Russian cities freely .
It ’s not true .
There are no bears , there are …
TIGERS !
Meet this video made in a Siberian village by a surveillance cam of a Siberiat tiger walking freely across the village at night .
It ’s not some kind of tiger that ran off from the Zoo , it ’s a specie of tigers that live in Siberia , so to called “ Ussuri ” or Amur Tigers .
They do n’t afraid extreme colds of Russian winter .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The latest search at Google had nothing to do with the Internet or lucrative ads .
It had to do with a three - foot python that was loose in its New York offices .
Published reports say the snake , named Kaiser , got loose Sunday in the company 's office in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York .
" We are pleased to report that Kaiser was located in the office , " company spokeswoman Ellen West said in a statement , according to Reuters .
" Kaiser was taken home by his owner and is no longer in the building . "
A Google statement earlier in the day confirmed that the news had nothing to do with the recent passing of April 1 .
" What you have heard is in fact true and not an April Fools ' Day joke , " a Google spokesman wrote in an e-mail to technology news site CNET News.com .
" We are confident that we have the appropriate resources in place to resolve this issue as quickly as possible in the best interests of both the Googlers in our NYC office and Kaiser the snake . "
Ball pythons are nonvenomous and are commonly kept as pets , according to an e-mail sent by the company to its New York employees .
Google has been known to issue fake press releases as part of April Fools ' Day .
This year 's reports included an offering of a Toilet Internet Service Provider , which allegedly provided free in - home wireless broadband service connectivity via users ' plumbing systems , and Gmail paper , a service where users of its Gmail e-mail service could get paper versions of their e-mail mailed to them .
Google 's snake problem was first reported on technology gossip Web site Valleywag , according to CNET .
" Our exterminator , with Google 's security team and the snake 's owner , are searching for it , " said an e-mail sent Sunday to New York office employees of Google , reported by CNET .
" Should you see the snake , please do not attempt to touch it or pick it up .
Call security immediately . "
Google finished No. 1 in Fortune 's 2007 ranking of the best place to work .
Valleywag reports that as is the case with its main headquarters in Mountain View , Calif. , Google 's New York office is known for pampering its employees , with massage chairs and snack rooms .
But CNET reports that Google 's policy on pets in the New York office allows only for dogs .

" I 'm just a career lawyer who works in the front office of civil rights , "
One of the questions I get most often is " What is your day like ? "
There is no good answer to that question because it 's always so different .
Today I will log my work day , almost as it happens :
5:00 am , PST
Wake to BlackBerry alarm
Eat a banana
Check e-mail on BlackBerry .
Schedule a conference call .
Walk to office , 47 seconds down the street , still wearing shorts I slept in
Take garbage cans out to street for pickup
Get Diet Coke from fridge .
Take first swig .
Pet office cat Sarah
Approve blog comments
5:20 AM
Check Internet for headlines , just to see if any planes flew into any buildings last night
Begin this blog ( normally takes 90 minutes to complete )
Cat is yelling at me for more attention .
This will continue off and on all day
Open Photoshop .
Call up blank comic strip form .
Give it a date of 8/17 , when it will run .
Open the comic already drawn for 8/16 to see if today I will draw a continuation of that thread or start a new one .
I decide to start a new one .
Open
Word file where I keep ideas sent to me via e-mail .
Look for something interesting .
Notice a sticky note on my desk to check a web site for a potential business deal .
I check it .
I send an e-mail to United Media with my comments .
5:30 AM
Back to looking at the submitted ideas .
Time to make a comic .
5:45 AM
I decide on an idea .
It involves the conflicting goals of reducing overtime and also doing more work .
This will involve Carol the secretary ( the only hourly employee in the strip ) and the pointy - haired boss .
I start to draw them .
I 'll figure out what they say later .
[ I draw directly to the computer using a Wacom 21SX computer screen that allows me to draw on it as if it were paper , using a stylus . ]
5:52 AM
First panel drawn .
Boss and Carol are in conference room .
I need to write the boss 's line .
He will set the scene .
Too hungry to think .
Grab a protein bar and another Diet Coke .
Approve blog comments while eating protein bar ( Clif Builder 's , 20g protein ) .
I have to approve the first comments quickly so I do n't get a thousand comments saying " first comment ! "
Back to working on the comic .
Cat is literally screaming at me for attention and sitting on some Japanese tax forms I have on the floor to remind me to mail them .
I decide to drug her with catnip .
It 's working .
Hmm , cat on drugs .
Maybe my comic can use that today .
The boss might hire a beaver on speed to help Carol get more work done in fewer hours .
Ca n't say " speed " in the comic .
I use Google to find out what 's in Sudafed .
That stuff gets me cranking .
It 's pseudoephedrine , I learn .
Can I say that in a comic ?
6:10 AM
I decide to go with " beaver on decongestants . "
6:18 AM
I draw the second panel , including the nervous - looking beaver .
I love the beaver .
I hate the word " decongestants . "
Readers wo n't make the connection to speed quickly enough .
Caffeine is too obvious .
Red Bull is a product , so I avoid those .
Energy drink is too generic sounding .
6:22 AM
I check blog comments to see if people think this idea sucks .
I approve some more comments .
It helps to take my mind off the comic dialog every few minutes so when I look at it again I see it fresh .
Back to the comic ...
6:25 AM
I draw a coffee cup in the nervous beaver 's paw .
I write " coffee swilling beaver . "
I Google " swilling " to see if a better word comes up .
I get " guzzling . "
Not sure that 's an improvement .
I 'll draw the third panel and get back to it ...
6:45 AM
Distracted by incoming e-mail about my restaurant business .
I answer it .
Back to the comic .
I rewrite the first panel so now it 's about the boss noticing he is giving Carol way too much work .
So he hires a coffee swilling beaver to show her how to work faster .
6:50 AM
The third panel is drawn .
Carol is in her low - walled cube , the beaver behind her .
One of them needs to say something .
Thinking ....
Using my 2 - of - 6 rule for humor , I already have three elements .
It 's recognizable ( being overworked and not supported by your boss ) and it's bizarre ( a coffee swilling beaver ) .
And the beaver is cute .
Something naughty or cruel or clever would round it out nicely .
Maybe the beaver says , " You can save a lot of time by not wearing pants . "
No ...
7:00 AM
I decide to go with this for my third panel ( I can't show you the whole comic because newspaper clients have a contractual first right )
It 's a first draft .
Some time in the future I will clean up the art and finish it .
I do my rough work in the morning when my brain works best .
7:10 AM
Time to start my second comic .
First I check my blog hit count and stats to see if anyone is reading this entry .
12,000 hits so far today .
And the stats tell me that a lot of hits are coming from reddit.com .
That means someone submitted it to their list of interesting web sites to check .
That drives a lot of traffic .
Back to the comic .
Do I do another day with the beaver or go another direction ?
Thinking ....
Approved some more blog comments .
Noticed a few people saying today 's Dilbert is extra funny .
Checked dilbert.com to see which one that was .
I 'm always surprised at which ones capture people 's amusement .
Enough stalling .
Beaver or no beaver ?
Back to the comic ... thinking ...
Bathroom break
Beaver dialog forms in my head on way back to desk .
Not sure where it came from .
7:30 AM
Interrupted by incoming e-mail from United Media confirming conference call for 10:30 AM to talk about the Dilbert movie negotiations .
Back to the comic ...
I label the first panel " Coffee Swilling Beaver " to show it 's a continuation strip .
I draw Dilbert at his desk .
It does n't matter who the beaver will be talking to , and people like to see Dilbert more often than the other characters .
First line from beaver , " If a tree falls in the forest , and no one hears it ... "
7:40 AM
Second panel , beaver says , " I 'd still chew the bejeezus out of it because I have no impulse control . "
The word " bejeezus " is funny , but will give the foreign translators an ulcer .
I try not to do that too often .
I approve some blog comments while thinking what angle to draw the beaver and Dilbert in the second frame .
8:15 AM
I finished the third panel .
Here it is in rough form .
Some people will complain that it's not " officey " enough and too random with a talking beaver .
Sometimes it 's good to break from the usual , as long as I do n't do it for too many strips in a row .
8:20 AM
Reviewed a license proposal that arrived by fax , for a Dilbert themed Soduko book .
I approve it without knowing the details .
United Media already vetted it and we do a lot of work with this publisher .
If they think someone will buy it , that 's fine with me .
Faxed back my approval .
E-mail my restaurant partner to schedule a meeting for later today .
Get another Diet Coke
Take 1000 mg of magnesium supplement .
( I read on some unreliable web site that people do n't get enough .
The day I took my first magnesium supplements it solved 10 years of continuous sore knee problems .
Might be a coincidence , but magnesium is suggested to reduce swelling .
Do n't take as much as I do .
That 's way over the recommended dose .
Do n't get medical advice from cartoonists . )
Answered e-mail from my real estate broker regarding some property I 'm trying to sell .
Approved more blog comment .
Noticed lots of people asking about the movie .
Here 's the scoop ...
We agreed on a movie deal with Warner Brothers over a year ago .
Since then we have been trying to penetrate the bureaucracy at the studio to finalize the contract details .
In an ironic Dilbert twist , the lawyers at Warner who are authorized to speak with us are apparently not willing or able to speak with anyone in their own company who can make the kind of decisions needed to finalize the contract .
Our current projected timeline for penetrating their bureaucracy is infinity .
I do n't expect the deal to be completed .
9:15 AM
Answered an e-mail about my book , God 's Debris , and some interest in a movie deal for it .
Movie deals are always long shots , but worth looking into .
Answered e-mail about designing a new Dilbert logo .
We need a catch phrase .
I suggested one .
Pet cat
Took Longvinex capsule , a wine extract that will make me nearly immortal if it works .
Google it .
I know it 's unproven .
But the expected value calculation makes it attractive if you can afford it .
Is it a 1 % chance of living for another 50 years and feeling great the whole time ?
Who knows ?
Worth a shot .
Took a work break
10:00 AM
Working on writing jokes for my restaurant menu .
Each item includes a witticism about the dish .
We 're adding some items .
Interrupted by more e-mail about God 's Debris and movie or mini series options
10:30 AM
Phone call with president of United Media about Dilbert movie contract situation .
Still writing jokes for the menu .
Ca n't think of anything for rib eye steak .
Nailed the rib eye joke .
Sent off the menu .
Heading back to the house for a shower .
Then lunch .
Then meeting at the restaurant .
Tennis at 2 pm if it gets confirmed .
My opponent is eleven .
I figure I have one more year before he kicks my ass .
( His dad is a pro . )
Signing off until later ...
3:30 PM
Home from tennis .
Had a snack and another Diet Coke .
Shower
Waiting to go next door for a barbecue
5:15 PM
I 'll end here , telling you in advance I 'll be having a good time with fun neighbors and friends and getting to bed around 11 PM .
Thanks for reading this far .
The End
Mr Aso , a straight - talking nationalist , said the Japanese , on the other hand , were trusted because they had " yellow faces " and had " never been involved in exploitation there , or been involved in fights or fired machine guns " .
Japan has healthy relations with Arab countries and Iran and imports much of its oil from the Middle East .
It is a big contributor of aid to the Palestinian Authority , but also has friendly ties with Israel .
" Japan is doing what Americans can't do , " local media quoted Mr Aso as saying in a speech about Japan - sponsored investment in the Middle East .
" Japanese are trusted .
It would probably be no good to have blue eyes and blond hair .
Luckily , we Japanese have yellow faces . "
Mr Aso , seen by some as a possible successor to the prime minister , Shinzo Abe , is no stranger to controversy .
In 2001 he said a member of the burakumin , Japan 's underclass , could never lead the country .
He later angered Japan 's indigenous Ainu population by describing the country as unique in being " one nation , one civilisation , one language , one culture and one race " .
While economics minister , he said he wanted to turn Japan into a country where " rich Jews " would want to live .
In 2003 , he sparked protests when he praised imperial Japan 's often brutal colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945 , and last month he described the US post- invasion plans for Iraq as " very immature " .

How to spend your marketing and ad budget
I 've worked for companies that spent their entire ad and marketing budget on making their existing users deliriously happy .
Let 's say your marketing and / or ad budget does n't have the same legs it used to , or that you 've just decided to make a change .
Or maybe you do n't even have a marketing budget .
Is there something you can do that might be more creative and , in many cases today , at least -- if not more -- effective ?
These are off the top of my head and my usual disclaimers apply ( does n't work for everything , etc. ) , and I hope others will add better ideas .
The Sarah McLachlan music video for World on Fire puts a different spin on alternative uses for promotional budgets — they took nearly all of the $ 150,000 production budget for the music video and spent it on other things .
I 'm sure you 've all seen it by now , but here are a few sample screens that come on ( in between a few home - movie quality shots of Sarah playing her guitar ) :
Bonus : by putting the information into the video , they 're also teaching fans / users the true costs of both the production of the video and things like the cost of educating a girl in Afghanistan .
Most of my suggestions are n't nearly as " worthy " as what they did with the World On Fire budget , but to a real user ... having a better experience using the product or better yet -- getting to the kick ass threshold more quickly -- is still a pretty damn worthy cause .
And hey -- if you can help them get laid ( by creating / supporting user groups and online communities where people often find meaningful and lasting relationships ) , then you 've got something more powerful than all the " twins " ads money can buy . ; )
Please , add your ideas .

In my mind there 's not really a talk about the old way / new way .
What you describe as the " old way " still works and works well .
What you describe as the " new way " also works - and has worked for many years ( if you look aside the internet perspective ) .
The " old way " is mainstream marketing .
The " new way " is more of a word - of - mouth , or viral marketing ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing) approach .
The " old way " targets the masses .
The " new way " targets a narrower market segment .
There is no revolution - you 're just describing old terms with new terms .

Sarah 's idea was wonderful but should everyone mirror her efforts , like all good ideas , it will quickly lose its impact and the good will she has gained from her philanthropic efforts will not replicate itself through repeat efforts .
At what point does " good will " lose its appeal and the bottom line , which is still being fed through this effort , rears its ugly head and the " old " way becomes the new way once again .

Ooooh I 'm loving this post - right up my street and totally on the money !
The world is changing fast and more importantly , the next generation are expecting many of the ' new ways ' outlined as standard - the attitudes of the young people I talk / work with and the research I recently carried out reflects this !

Old way ---- New way
Give product only to people who pay .--- Give a partial experience away for free and give a better and complete experience to paying customers .
Posted by : Vishi | Oct 30 , 2005 2:13:13 PM
It seems that the old way methods listed are all attempting to sell users a product or service , while the new way is more about creating the culture around the product and users in order to sell an experience -- that notion of the Experience Economy .
It strikes me that the " new ways " in the table are more about doing and making things better than selling extant things .
I 'm heartened by the idea that creating a better experience will trump traditional advertising and marketing ; I can only hope it will pan out in the real world .
And I love that Sarah McLachlan video .
Astonishing , and eye - opening .
I wonder what kind of impact it ultimately had on viewers , though ?
Most people I know who 've seen it just said , " Yeah , that was really cool . "
I do n't know that it did anything beyond the good recounted in the video itself ( which is not to say it was a wasted effort ) .

Anders -- I completely agree .
There 's almost nothing " new " in the " new way " column ( minor exception being the blog recommendation ) .
What I meant by " new " is that the relative strength , importance , effectiveness , value , etc. of the right side is definitely new .
The " old " ways still work , sure , but for so many things today , their value is diminished or at the least -- for many things they simply are n't * needed * .
When a product or service or cause can go from zero to several million people learning of it on the web within 24 - 48 hours , all without spending a dime on anything called " marketing " -- but simply because the thing is ... whatever it is that causes people to talk about -- THAT is definitely new .
And really , really , really fortunate for those of us with ideas , and the ability to execute , but no budget and no interest in VCs .
And I never used the word " revolution " .
I think it 's an * evolution * , supported by the Web , and made more important by the increasing difficulty of reaching a large audience through traditional approaches ( assuming you even HAVE a big budget ) thanks to Tivo , increased competition for attention , etc . )
Apple still benefits from plenty of traditional " old " ways , but I write mainly for those of us who are more on a Nano budget , but who would like to make a difference in the lives of our users .
And the great news is that today ... that can often be enough to produce at least enough success to stop us from having to take another job , so we can keep working on making whatever it is we make a better experience for the user .
But anyway Anders , I agree and I probably could have used a different word for that column .
Doug : yes , that could be a problem .
At least in the meantime , it 's a win either way , since it 's doing some real good !
And I think it 's more about creativity than trying to copy what she did for that video .
But I think the WOF video is important for two almost orthogonal reasons - - 1 ) the donations to charity , and 2 ) that it * teaches * users / fans .
Max : I do n't know either -- other than a few anecdotes from people who'd kind of " forgotten " about her but were inspired to pick up her latest CD after seeing this .
They were already fans at one point , though .
I do n't know if any converts were made , but I do know the video has been passed around quite a lot .
That can't be bad for Sarah or the causes supported by the production budget .

Lovely post .
I think we are moving into an era of customer conversations .
Hence , the new way of marketing has to adapt itself to the marketplace where conversations take place .
It is no more a monologue .
It is no more " spray and pray " .
It 's no more control and inform .
It is no more tell and bulldoze .

Most of the posts to this blog fit the equation :
be good to users = more success for me
It 's dangerous to pigeonhole this thoughtful post to the same category , to assume that we should all donate money only so we could somehow receive a monetary benefit from it .
I 'm often a cynical person but I doubt that Sarah 's intentions were for personal gain .
There are times that decent people make decisions that contradict the normal way of life , the normal pursuit of joy and avoidance of pain .
Sometimes we do things simply because we know we ought to .
There is more purpose to life than securing your future .
There 's more to success than dollar signs .
There are more people to look out for than just Numero Uno .
Should everyone mirror Sarah 's efforts , the impact will NOT be lost .
The impact will amaze us .
I think Kathy has wandered us into one of the final pieces of what Passionate Marketing ( not viral marketing , mind you ) is all about .
It 's compassion .

I want to retract part of what I stated in my last post :
" Most of the posts to this blog fit the equation :
be good to users = more success for me "
I did n't mean to imply that the purpose of this blog is to teach people to be selfish .
Forgive me if I 'm being presumptuous , Kathy , but I want to attest to where your heart is and recapitulate that the philosophy of Creating Passionate Users is rooted in caring about people .
Viral marketing EXPLOITS social networking .
The idea of Creating Passionate Users , however , is not a selfish endeavor .
Sure , most of the time karma will make its rounds and you will reap great rewards for having cared about your users .
But be warned !
At times you may become a martyr for the cause .
Kathy has testified to this by her story of a past employer .
Yet there are worse things in store for those who do n't care about their users - the users will see through the bull s**t of selfish mainstream and viral marketing schemes .
Tonight I finished a book , The Accelerated Learning Handbook , that closed with the following exemplification of a Passion Evangelist :
" The future belongs to the learners .
Only those ... who can continually learn will survive and thrive .
And the learning that will bring the brightest future ... concentrates not merely on how to make money but how to work and live in a way that honors our humanity . "
Back to the topic of charity - if we are truly motivated by a passion for people , donating is done not as a marketing ploy but as a natural response to a human need .
It 's as inherent to us as breathing .
old way : I care about me
new way : I care about you

Way up the comment stream - " the old way still works "
Um , well , depends on who you talk to .
For example , the folks who sell the interruption advertising are ( with an increasing aura of flop sweat desperation ) still screaming about commercials and such .
So , do n't seem to be working ?
We 'll just do MORE !
Which just gives the views more time to do things like finish cooking dinner ( or switch over to HGTV . )
Both of which I did last night everytime the commercial breaks started .
Seems to me the " old way " is about talk , talk , talk .
The " new way " is about walking the talk and making real connections with the customer ( delivering value versus noise . )

Why do you have to " hire " a creative user - focussed product designer ?
I 'm being pedantic but that top entry was for me a source of dissonance .
Your whole company should to greater and lesser degrees be your product design team .
The new way emphasises ( to use an overplayed word ) its holistic nature .
Hiring seems to imply that certain skill - sets an attitudes are missing and I believe if you go down the new way road , then you will generate the skills within .
Your later example of promoting a use rhappiness expert from within captures the essence of your thesis much better I think .

Let ’s examine what benefits the brand can get from a “ making a difference ”
campaign to rebuild lives and communities that have been decimated :
1 . Free worldwide media coverage on national news
2. Low production costs
3 . A viral / word of mouth opportunity – no PR costs
5 . Creating a communicative brand that cares about its customers , listen to
them and puts their money back into the community
Posted by : tamir | Nov 7 , 2005 5:35:48 PM
Old way works ?
Maybe so .
But do n’t forget that traditional media has been here for about 60 - 70 years and things are now changing rapidly .
Surveys and studies show that advertising on TV loosing its power , young adults spend more time on the net , producing their own content .
It 's fair enough to say the old way still works but just see what companies like Heineken , Lexus and others are doing with their advertising budget .

Shel Israel was in our offices this week and we came across this blog while we were looking around the blogosphere .
I 'm back to reread and mull it over .
We are a new little company YackPack in the throes of trying to figure out who we are and what we are .
One thing we know is that we want to put the customer and user experience first and we do n't have huge marketing money to bring in a huge user - base .

Retired Robots
The Ants : A Community of Microrobots
In order to accomplish these goals , the robots have been equipped with sensors and actuators designed with their natural counterparts in mind .
Each robot has 17 sensors including ; four light sensors , four IR ( infrared ) receivers , bump sensors , food sensors , and a tilt sensor .
They communicate with each other using two IR emitters , one mounted on the front of the robot and one mounted on the top .
There are several levels of social behavior before reaching the goal of the ant colony .
Right now , the robots can play Follow the Leader , Tag and Manhunt .
Manhunt is similar to tag except there are two teams .
The final game before the full - fledged Ant Farm is Capture the Flag .
There are many application for robotic communities , including explosive ordnance disposal , and Mars exploration .

You can do whatever you want with the code , but if you distribute the code or binaries , you must make your changes open via the GPL license .
New BSD - Use at your own risk .
Do whatever the hell you want with the code , just keep the license intact , credit me , and never sue me if the software blows your foot off .
The MIT license is a notable alternative to the New BSD and is very very similar .
Public Domain -

Yes , there are many more licenses , but I think you ’ll do just fine if you just stick with these four .

Creative Commons is a poor choice for source code .
The tricky part in my mind is that there are two potential uses for source code snippets in a blog .
For example , you may just want to post the same code in your blog .
In that case , I see the code as being content , for which CC might be appropriate .
The other use is posting the code in an application .
Then it really is source code , and CC is not appropriate .
In any case , my source code snippets are released to the Public Domain unless otherwise stated .
I only ask that you do reference the blog post where you got the code from , but it is not required .
Note , except in the case of releasing content to the Public Domain , if you choose to license your code using an Open Source License or license your content using a Creative Commons license , it does not mean you give up your copyright to the material .
You still own the copyright .
The license just lets people know that they may make use of your content and what restrictions are in place .

Will Self was born in England and attended Oxford University .
He has written three short story collections ( The Quantity Theory of Insanity , Grey Area , and Tough , Tough Toys for Tough , Tough Boys ) , a book of two novellas , Cock and Bull , and a third novella , The Sweet Smell of Psychosis .
He has also written four novels , My Idea of Fun , Great Apes , How the Dead Live and most recently Dorian : An Imitation .
Self was on the list , in the 1993 , of Granta ‘s best young English novelists under forty , that included : Louis de Bernieres , Tibor Fischer , Esther Freud , Alan Hollinghurst , Kazuo Ishiguro , Al Kennedy , Philip Kerr , Hanif Kureishi , Lawrence Norfolk , Ben Okri , Caryl Phillips , Nicholas Shakespeare and Jeanette Winterson .
Will Self is also a journalist who writes a general cultural column for a major London daily .
He lives in London with his family and currently is at work on a short story collection and a major novel of ideas .
His unofficial website is at http://www.willself.org.uk/index.php.
Robert Birnbaum :
Do people still attach the word ‘ jolly ’ to the phrase “ old England ” ?
Is there a jolly old England ?
Will Self : No. Jolly has gone .
I think where you can mark the real decline of jollity somewhat paradoxically , is to the Blair regime , the Blair government .
When they came into office in ’ 97 , on a tide of apparent jollity , a reassertion of social democratic virtues , a kicking out of the previous corrupt conservative regime that had been in place for seventeen years and was riddled with actual pecuniary corruption , that jollity was very quickly perceived publicly as an act of media manipulation .
And the focus then turned to the idea that this was a new regime that was predicated in a way that no previous regime had been , not to quite the same extent , on appearance rather than reality .
This was a government of spin-doctors .
A government of public relations , a government that fixed its policies on the basis of focus groups , that went out and tried to get people ’s assent to a policy and then moved that way around it rather than actually being a creative government .
[ A government ]
That introduced a great deal of cynicism into the British political sphere .
At the same time you had a kind of schizophrenia entering public life over the issue of whether we were an economy and a society that was really taking our model from American neo-liberal economists or whether we still had a serious interest in a united Europe .
That ’s really been the sawhorse upon which economics and politics in Britain has very painfully fallen on its crotch for the past six years .
That tends to undermine any conception of jollity .
At the same time all kinds of — things have happened in Britain — like the crack cocaine epidemic has finally reached Britain .
RB : Really .
WS : Yeah .
Twenty years after it burned a trail through North America the supplies of cocaine to Britain through the West Indies have finally become cheap enough , plentiful enough , for crack cocaine to take route amongst the urban underclass .
Where I live in London , Lambreth is kind of the epicenter now of gun crime in London .
We ’ve had something like thirty or forty gunshot murders in the past year .
Now that ’s nothing compared to the North American cities .
But for jolly old London that is a very severe picture .
RB : Are British police now armed ?
WS : They are increasingly armed now .
That ’s a taboo that is gone , the idea of the jolly bobby , whistling and shifting around in his size twelve boots — if you come to London now and drive around you will see what are called Armed Response Units .
What that means is that there is a cache of weapons available and if the police feel that that they need to draw on them in any given circumstance , they can get them .
RB : Rising numbers of gun deaths suggest a gun black market .
WS : Huge black market in guns .
As with all small and parochial societies you have to blame somebody and the blame is placed on the Jamaican gangsters .
The so - called “ Yardies ” are responsible for the cocaine trade .
The truth of the matter is that there has always been a flourishing black market in guns in Britain .
Although we are not an armed society in the sense that North America is , it ’s always been there and it ’s just got worse .
RB : The Pakistanis must be happy .
They are n’t bearing the brunt of anti … ( both laugh ) .
WS : The problem with the Pakistani community or the British Asian community is the worst race rioting in the last ten years has been in the British Asian communities in the North of the country .
Very bad riots last year , an election year in a town called Alden , up in Leeds .
And that ’s really centered around social depravation .
What you have there is the actual rise of the British fascists for the first time , serious time , certainly in the last twenty or thirty years .
They now hold three council seats , which they have n’t done for …
RB : What is the party called ?
The British Fascist party ?
The Dorian Grays of today are Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman .
These are the celluloid images who dominate not only Hollywood , not only the international entertainment network , but actually dominate the psyche of people in a very , very powerful way .
They are the people whose images do not age .
And therefore people take [ them ] to be as kind of totems of our culture ’s values
WS : They are called the British National Party .
They amount to pretty much the same thing .
In the old days , when Enoch Powell the conservative politician made his famous “ Rivers of Blood ” speech saying , “ If any further immigration was allowed from former colonial possessions Britain would drown in a river of blood . ”
There is no longer talk on the far right of repatriating people .
They accept that ’s a fait accompli because you now have second , third , fourth generation black and brown Britons .
But there is still a tendency to play up the race question .
Of course now , post 9/11 , that ’s fallen very heavily on what ’s called “ asylum seekers . ”
We have a policy in Britain of , you are allowed to apply for political asylum on whatever ground at all , and your case has to be considered .
Now in recent weeks a policeman died on a raid on some registered asylum seekers in Manchester who apparently turned out to be al Qaeda operatives .
This has really turned up the heat still more on the issue of asylum seekers .
Nobody is disputing — either on the right or the left — that a lot of people come in and claim political asylum that are in fact economic migrants .
Nobody disputes that fact , but really the kind of axis around the attitude towards tolerance and multiculturalism in our society is now turning , is how we should process and deal with asylum seekers .
RB : The entry into the European Union , what does that do to immigration and asylum seekers ?
WS : It does a lot .
Coming back to your initial remark on whether it was a jolly country anymore , what you have in Britain and I think outsiders understand intuitively but the British remain obstinately blinkered to , is the European currency union , the Euro zone , is fundamental to any politics in the area .
So if we join the currency zone we are looking at a federal Europe .
If we are looking at a federal Europe we are no longer looking at a NATO .
If we are no longer looking at NATO we are looking at a major decoupling from US foreign policy .
If we are looking at a major ( laughs ) and so on and so forth .
Now , that ’s the sticking point around all sorts of stuff [ around which ] revolves , including the asylum - seeking question .
At the moment this can be passed back and forth between the European countries .
So the French say , “ It ’s your own damn fault , if you were n’t so liberal about letting these people in to claim asylum , then they would n’t come to us knowing they can get through this damn tunnel and claim asylum off you . ”
And the Germans say that as well .
Then the British say , “ That ’s nonsense .
It ’s because you lot are so lax about letting them hang around and then get over to us . ”
Obviously that kind of policy would have to be coordinated at a European level , if there were any move to closer integration .
RB : Against this lovely picture of the sceptered isle , you have published a book which you call an “ imitation ” of a story published some hundred years ago .
WS : The original The Picture of Dorian Gray was published in Lippincott ’s , which was an American monthly magazine .
RB : The entire story ?
WS : Yeah .
It was published over two issues in 1891 , a hundred and twelve years ago .
The initial version of the story — it ’s a fascinating tale — the story The Picture of Dorian Gray was commissioned at a dinner held by the editor of Lippincott ’s , an American guy who was over in London and he had to dinner Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle .
At this dinner he commissioned a Sherlock Holmes story and Dorian Gray .
It has to stand out as one of the greatest and successful commissioning dinners of all time .
RB : Could it happen today ?
WS : One wonders .
But Wilde went on to write the story quite quickly and when it appeared in its initial form , it did not have the subplot which becomes the melodramatic motor in the book version .
Which is the beautiful young actress Sybil Vane , who Dorian is first entranced by and then rejects because he understands her capacity to imitate beauty is what attracts him , and in reality she is just a boring little girl .
And that becomes the whole engine of the denouement of the novel .
She kills herself .
Her brother seeks revenge , sixteen years later .
He tracks down Dorian Gray and tries to kill him and so on and so forth .
That was n’t in the original .
So when it appeared , the reviewer said , “ It stinks with the odor of moral putrefaction . ”
What he was talking about was the fact that if you think about it , Sean of the heterosexual love interest , it ’s a openly gay novel .
And everybody knew it was .
Nobody was in any doubt and if you look back over the history of the Aesthetic Movement in the 1880 ’s of which Wilde was the absolute leader , it was an openly and flamboyantly homosexual movement .
Dorian Gray was Wilde ’s calling card to say that he was out .
That ’s what it was .
His friends at that point urged him to reign it in because of the adverse attention it was receiving .
So when it appeared in book form he introduced this spurious heterosexual love interest .
RB : You ’ve taken on something of a challenge … where does Wilde ’s story stand in literary history ?
WS : I think it stands as high as it ever has .
It ’s interesting that when you come to do something like this and what I ’ve done is to imitate it quite completely , quite shamelessly take all of the basic machinery of the novel .
Right down to the characters ’ names …
RB : Except for the character Herman …
WS : Except Sybil Vain becomes Herman , a black rent boy , a black gay prostitute , and I ’ve shifted the time frame to set it in the shadow of the AIDS epidemic .
It begins in 1980 and ends in 1997 .
But apart from that it ’s a sincere imitation .
What it serves to point up because people have to become enormously possessive about the original , even though , I may add , usually they have n’t read it since they were either in college or late teens early twenties , because it ’s that kind of text that people read at that age .
But what it serves to point up is a kind of odd reverence in which it is held .
A reverence — I think people do n’t understand why they revere the book .
It ’s astonishingly subversive .
Richard Ellman , Wilde ’s biographer , called it “ the tragedy of Aestheticism . ”
If you can extend that idea in to the twentieth century it ’s really the tragedy of appearance over reality .
The tragedy of style over substance .
Wilde was this astonishingly contradictory character .
He wrote The Soul of Man under Socialism .
On the face of it he wrote drawing - room comedies , though if you look much closer they were really deeply subversive plays about the English class system .
People do n’t think of Dorian Gray as — quite rightly — a moral tale .
A moral fable .
But they do n’t understand quite how deeply it cuts .
The Dorian Grays of today are Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman .
These are the celluloid imagoes who dominate not only Hollywood , not only the international entertainment network , but actually dominate the psyche of people in a very , very powerful way .
They are the people whose images do not age .
And therefore people take [ them ] to be as kind of totems of our culture ’s values .
I think Wilde saw that .
He not only saw that , I believe he actually understood that a kind of liberated homosexual culture would be in the vanguard of that movement .
That is quite a subversive idea in itself .
RB : Was n’t there was a movie made of Dorian Gray with Tyrone Power ?
WS : I think so .
RB : Perhaps that ’s the version of Dorian Gray that has been appropriated ?
WS : I do know that it completely negates the homosexual elements of the book .
It was made in the 1940’s .
RB : Did I get it right that you began your book originally as a screenplay ?
WS : There have been many , many attempts , some successful , though not seen the light of day , to film it again .
I was approached by a film producer to adapt it for screen .
I looked at it and these ideas of translating the action to a hundred years later , making it an absolutely and overtly homosexual piece of work , about people who are openly gay , to set under the shadow of the Aids epidemic , to use Diana Spencer , the Princess of Wales as the kind of leitmotif for the changing social attitude of the times , all of those ideas came to me very quickly and I started work on the script and immediately found myself writing very slowly .
I ’ve never really had much truck with writing for screen before .
I realized why .
As a novelist you are producer , you are director , you are actor .
You have the whole thing going .
I work with editors but really , I pretty much know what I ’ve got on the page is what ’s going to appear for the reader .
The idea of completing a draft of something and having a producer coming to me and , “ Well we like it but …
RB : Lighten it up …
WS : Yeah .
It was unthinkable to me .
That actually set me paralyzed at the keyboard unable to proceed .
I simply could n’t get going .
After nearly four years of working on the movie script , I decided just in order to satisfy the producers who approached me originally and to give him a completed narrative copy of some kind .
He could do what ever he wanted with it .
I would turn it back into prose fiction .
I would renovelize my own screen treatment .
Just in order to complete it .
And indeed , such was the liberation I felt that I was able to complete the book quite quickly .
I guess the script I was working on was a pretty literary script anyway .
I never would have thought to rewrite Wilde off my own back .
It was an approach from another side .
RB : What if one has n’t read the original before you reading your imitation ; what does one miss if you have n’t read Wilde ’s Dorian Gray ?
WS : They miss out in this case a whole kind of trigonometry of history .
They miss out the ability to take a bearing between the two books .
If you regard the books as topographical features and that by surveying them and the angles between the two works , you can somehow get a picture of the ruckled terrain of English social and cultural development in the intervening hundred and twelve years .
They miss out on that .
I do n’t want to overstate my own case .
RB : ( laughs ) I ca n’t recall another work of fiction called ‘ an imitation . ’
WS : I do n’t think somebody has done quite that thing .
What I was going to go on to say was , in actuality , all of the original is in there in an odd way .
I do n’t pay a great deal of attention to critics - not because I do n’t think that they are doing an interesting and useful job but it ’s not actually of use to me — I ’ve been in this game for over a decade and I ’ve published a number of books and I reached a point a couple of years ago where I looked back honestly , like any other writer you come publication day , no matter what you tell yourself , you rush to look at the reviews and see how the book is going to do .
Whether there is some kind of gearing in between what the critical response is and the public response is to be .
All that stuff .
A couple of years I had a kind of watershed [ thought ] on this , “ Has any single review whether positive or negative changed the way in which you approach your writing ? ”
The answer was no .
It has all sorts of effects on a personal and emotional level .
When it gets to me on the blank page it ’s still the same old game .
RB : Does that include reviews by writers ?
WS : Yeah .
That being said .
Here ’s the exception .
I was worried with Dorian for all these reasons , not simply an anxiety of influence but a neurosis of influence to have gone that far and actually imitated a complete work .
I was anxious because I am ostensibly a heterosexual man and I had written a gay novel in the post politically correct age .
In the liberal sphere there is something kind of unacceptable about that .
You are not quite allowed to that .
So I was worried about getting it right in that sense .
There is a writer Neal Bartlett , who is a theater director and a novelist , who had written a book about Wilde and his connection to the modern British gay community called Who Was That Man .
It ’s a brilliant book about Wilde .
He is a gay man who is of the right age to have lived through the period I am writing about and to know it intimately .
He reviewed it for the Guardian and I was interested to read what he would say and I was entirely gratified .
What he said was , “ What Self has shown in this book is that , what he describes as haute queenery , — are completely unchanged in over a hundred years .
” The novel translates into the modern idiom effortlessly in that way .
You take these characters , Henry Wooten , Wilde ’s typical saturnine Machievelle quipster .
Take Basil Hallward , the aesthetic artist .
You take Dorian Gray , this vapid and ultimately psychopathic toy boy and you put them into Chelsea in the early 1980 ’s , in amongst the impedimenta of heroin and cocaine abuse and they look fine and perfectly natural there as they did in a Victorian drawing room .
RB : I recently read Colum McCann ‘s Dancer , which touches upon this period of AIDS , Warholian fame clique in Manhattan and what was a matter of interest was that now looking back this need to excise all or any fun out of that era , a retrospective moralizing and denunciation …
… one thing is true in life , in the realm of the emotions , events that are consecutive are interpreted causally .
You have a row with your lover and they rush out into the street and ten hours later they are killed by a bus and you caused that .
WS : I would not quite take that view .
No , I think you can say that everybody ’s experience is going to be partial .
Whether you are having fun is an existential proposition not a universal one , is n’t it ?
And fun , the very idea of fun , is curiously atemporal .
RB : ( Laughs )
WS : You know you are having fun when you know what time it is .
So almost by definition it ’s not gonna be an observation about cultural history to say , “ Did n’t we have fun ? ”
It ’s gonna be an observation about cultural amnesia .
RB : Did n’t we have fun ?
WS : That ’s of course a different inquiry .
My take on all of this is — and it ’s an era I lived through — people say “ How do you have the right to write about this ? ”
I was an IV drug user during this period .
I had my first HIV test in 1985 .
I was aware of the spread of AIDS epidemic which was savage in the IV - drug - using community just as much as it was among gay people .
Now , I ’m not saying , “ Now look at me , I ’ve suffered too . ” I kind of despise that attitude .
The truth is I have n’t got the virus and I feel very fortunate about that .
The fact of the matter is I was aware of it during this period and I did see what it was doing .
My perception was that following the Halloween parade riots and the real outburst of gay liberation at the end of the ’60s and the beginning of the ’ 70s , one thing is true in life , in the realm of the emotions , events that are consecutive are interpreted causally .
You have a row with your lover and they rush out into the street and ten hours later they are killed by a bus and you caused that .
I think the perception both outside the gay community and within the gay community , was we gained some level of social acceptability or at any rate we were allowed to be out publicly .
We then had a lot of fun and games .
We then fell victim in large numbers to a sexually transmitted virus .
Our behavior caused that .
Now , people of the so - called Moral Majority and on the right were saying that .
My perception is that lot of gay people internalized that as well .
And felt that as well .
I remember talking to people about this at the time .
There was a sense no matter how unjustified , of guilt around this behavior because of that ‘ law ’ of the emotions , if you like .
And some people have said this text has a kind of homophobic taint to it .
It looks at those ideas .
As far as I ’m concerned , again , like that point about fun , there is a retrospective desire now because of highly active retroviral treatment — really the evil bloom has been taken or people perceive it as being taken off he AIDS epidemic .
The people want to deny it ever happened .
They want to kind of forget about it , “ Let ’s just forget about that stuff . ”
RB : In a consumer universe which is coequal with myth there is a retroactive need to posit that you had fun sometime in your life .
I ’m reading T.C. Boyle ’s Drop City which is set in a ’ 70s commune , a way of life now very much ridiculed if not discredited .
I wonder when in the post ’ 60s , people say they had fun .
WS : Everybody can point to a time when they had fun .
The condition of middle age , and it ’s one of the things you have to accept in life , is that you tend to locate fun in the past rather than in the future .
( laughs )
Society move in and out of period so for greater or lesser periods of decadence .
It seems all evolved societies are at some point , at some level , decadent .
In a literal sense , that they ape the styles and modes of ten years before .
It seems to me the post ’60s period has been one of increasing retroactivity in that way .
Increasing assumption and quicker recycling of the styles and modes of the past .
We see with our own kids now .
With the possible exception of the input of Afro-American ghetto music on the mainstream — and even that is kind of dubious to my mind — you ca n’t really point to a current style or mode that is n’t a retreading of previous one .
The idea to guys loosely our age that a four piece two guitar , bass and drums , would still be going now in exactly the same form that it was forty years ago is kind of astonishing , is n’t it ?
We thought that popular music would evolve quickly , taking as our paradigm the period between Elvis and 1958 and 1968 , those ten years which saw an astonishing diversification of styles and modes of popular music — the creation of whole new modes .
Since ’ 68 , nothing .
Really very little .
RB : Pop music is so fractured .
Though I gather big artists are still big from a sales point .
Just below that level , it does n’t seem there are any mid-list musical artists ?
WS : They are the people that are most imperiled by net copying .
They are also imperiled by what it is that has created this which if you are being deterministic about it is just demographics .
There are n’t as many young people .
There are a lot more of us and we rule the roost .
What happens now is instead of the dissemination being from youth culture up to mainstream culture .
What happens now is that if young people come up with anything it ’s instantly co-opted , commercialized and mass marketed , adopted by much older people , and in a sense decoupled from any taint of possible cultural revolution or change .
RB : Poor kids .
WS : I think it ’s rough for them .
I would not really enjoy … I come from the punk generation .
Looked at with the parallax of time the punk generation was separated from Haight - Ashbury by twelve years .
The E , the ecstasy - filled dance craze has now been going on for eighteen years , with very little change .
RB : They seem to be a permanent subculture .
WS : There will be no return to generationalism with all of the kind of implied dialectics of change unless there is a radical repopulating of the West , a shift in the demographic balance .
With an increasingly aging population how could it happen ?
RB : I thought people were having children again based on the large increase in ads for baby products .
WS : That ’s not a good basis for your empirical study ( laughs ) .
The birth rate continues to decline essentially .
RB : I was amused last summer to read a partial transcript of a radio program from England that had you and Richard Littlejohn …
WS : He ’s a columnist and it was his first novel if you could call it that .
He ’s a columnist on Rupert Murdoch ’s paper , The Sun .
It ’s always difficult to explain the British media to an American audience .
The Sun is — imagine if the National Enquirer had significant political influence , then you know what the Sun is .
It ’s a Murdoch - owned paper .
After the last election …
RB : So Littlejohn is a columnist from The Sun and has written a novel of which you stated you read two hundred and four pages .
And he had the gall on the show to ask you if you were still using drugs .
Is that indicative of the style of The Sun ?
WS : I had this guy on the run at this point , and he was looking around for any weapon he could use against me , and he thought he could potentially destabilize me if he could pick me up on that .
But this guy , to call him conservative is a bit of an understatement .
I do n’t want to say anything that is potentially libelous because people like him have a long reach .
I would say there is at least a congruence between his opinions as expressed in this book and his newspaper column and the British National Party — who are essentially the Fascist party .
RB : He harped on the asylum seekers quite a bit .
WS : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
The whole book is predicated on what a terrible scourge the asylum seekers , QED , immigrants , QED , ethnic minorities of any kind are and also very strong homophobic element to it .
RB : I recall you said something rather British instead of “ Fuck you . ”
WS : ( Laughs ) I think I was able to say that I was probably the least toxified person in the room .
Since I had not only taken any drugs and not taken a drink for some years .
RB : One other thing stood out .
He was critical that you had not read his entire book and he argued you could n’t therefore criticize it .
I think your response was “ Why ?
Does it turn into Tolstoi on page two hundred and five ? ”
And then I thought well that was clever , but there have been times when I could n’t figure a book out until late , until cracked a code of sorts .
WS : This book was very political and this guy is genuinely pernicious and the newspaper sells seven million copies daily .
When they switched allegiance from the Conservatives to the Labor Party before the 1997 election it was widely — not least by themselves and in private and certainly by Rupert Murdoch that they had swung the election for Tony Blair and the Labor Party .
So this is a media outlet that views itself as a serious political player .
If you ’re debating one of its lead columnists on a national radio show you want to be prepared .
I wanted to get the guy in the jugular .
I find his views on ethnic minorities , on asylum seeking , on gay rights totally unacceptable .
This is totally unacceptable bigotry .
Rampant bigotry .
So , of course , I prepared myself .
He then was furious because he also had been a sort of shock jock on that station itself .
He then furiously went to the managers on the station and said he been set up .
He had n’t been set up in any way .
I ’d found he was on the program and taken the trouble to research him .
That ’s all .
He could n’t bear this because he ’d lost out in the debate .
RB : Your standing in England is more than that of being a novelist .
You have been a columnist though , I believe you lost one position in a some kind of flutter , a few years ago .
WS : Yes .
Well , I kept right on after losing my job during the ’ 97 election for fairly well - publicized events .
I shifted to the Times .
I went to another Murdoch publication and was there for a year , and then I went to the Independent .
I was there for a couple of years .
Now I am with the London Evening Standard , which is the daily paper in London , and I write a pretty general column every week .
You know a certain section of my public see me as a journalist .
I do some television work .
Some light TV work , comedy TV work .
Probably a larger segment of the population view me as a comedian .
And then my wife always says to me , “ If you could limit yourself to two careers rather than three or four .
Then it would be a lot easier to live with . ”
RB : What medium do you have allegiance to ?
What would it be like to win at fiction ?
How can you win at fiction ?
It ’s an actual philosophical question .
What would it be like to win at fiction ?
WS : It is the fiction .
It is the fiction .
RB : Why did I have a different impression ?
WS : I do n’t know .
I think it ’s because I do quite a lot of other things and perhaps I do n’t really …
RB : Some people do other things for the money .
WS : Oh no , no .
Obviously it ’s my living .
It ’s what I do for work , but I have always been uneasy …it ’s not so rigid in Britain as it is here in the States .
Here if you write fiction seriously then that ’s what you are known as .
In Britain we still have this Grub Street tradition .
That is , you are a writer and you write for newspapers , and write for this and you write for that and you write books and what you are is primarily a writer and what kind of writing you do is a matter of convenience or choice .
But nonetheless we still have this idea also that if you are a serious novelist you are kind of draped in the flag of the academy to some extent or other , and it carries with a certain kind of — confers a kind of dignity .
I have always had a great deal of difficulty in not viewing that as attitudinizing .
RB : I ’m shocked .
WS : I have never really wanted to put on the airs and graces …
RB : That would put you in with a goodly number of younger British writers including the wild Scotsmen .
WS : The wild Scotsmen are the wild Scotsmen ( laughs ) .
And all power to the wild Scotsmen .
I think the Scottish Renaissance in literature in the last twenty years has been phenomenal .
Starting with Alasdair Gray and James Kellman and moving on through Irvine Welsh and guys like Alan Warner who has been really amazing .
But that ’s their shtick .
RB : You do n’t want to talk about things British ?
WS : Well of course I ’m American , I ’m a vital new voice in American fiction ( both laugh ) .
I have that kind of mid-Atlantic dimension and I do n’t think it ’s with out accident I do n’t do fantastically well here in terms of sale , but I perhaps have a slightly higher profile here than you might have expected for a solely English writer .
People here detect a certain American taint in my thinking and they are right .
RB : That ’s the reason for your higher profile here ?
WS : I do n’t know .
I ’m very comfortable here in the States .
I think a lot of English people have that residual “ gee- whiz ” attitude when they get to America where everything is bigger …
RB : That ’s true of Martin Amis too ?
WS : Bear in mind Martin has put in a lot of work to his Americanism .
He is married to Americans .
He spends a great deal of time here .
There are affinities between me and other English writers and I would n’t deny that .
We do n’t run as a pack .
There ’s no kind of - I do n’t think there is much sense of community amongst the writers .
Not that I am aware of .
But I ’m not a very clubable guy .
RB : I suppose the only writing community in the US is Manhattan or Brooklyn .
WS : Yeah .
They do all seem to be in Brooklyn , do n’t they ?
I was with some of the Brooklyn posse last night .
Come a certain time in the evening and they all get up and say we have to get back to Brooklyn .
RB : Is there anything like Dave Eggers and the McSweeney ’s coterie in England ?
WS : Well , not that I am aware of .
Not with that kind of profile .
Not with that kind of leading light .
What you need for that is someone like Eggers who has , of course , not only been active in the magazine publishing line but has a huge hit book success .
The analogy would be with the Scots and with the Rebel Ink phenomenon around Irvine Welsh .
But that is a Scots phenomenon not true of England .
We have the well - established literary magazines like Granta , but they do n’t coalesce around a younger group of writers .
They are not exactly mainstream but they are more grown up .
RB : Granta is not mainstream ?
WS : I guess it is mainstream .
RB : We might leave to someone else to decide whether they were mainstream ten years ago when you were among the anointed .
What were you ?
WS : One of the top twenty [ novelists ] under forty in 1993 .
They have just brought out the new list which has come in for the predictable slagging .
RB : Well there are two or three writers on the list that do n’t have novels .
WS : Sure .
Nor did I , actually .
I am quite defensive of them .
I had a novel ready to be published .
The critics that I read on it said actually what they said in ’ 93 , “ It ’s impossible to imagine this group of writers producing from among their number four or five of the stature of Graham Swift , Ian McEwan , Martin Amis and Salman Rushdie . ”
Now they say of the poor old 2003 batch , “ It ’s impossible to imagine three or four of the writers emerging from this to have the stature of Will Self , Hanif Kureshi … ” and I ca n’t remember who the others are .
Saying exactly the same thing but using us as the benchmark .
I feel for these young people because I think …it ’s hell , all that stuff when you are young .
You get immune to it like an old hippo as you get older .
It just does n’t bother you .
RB : Yeah , it ’s hell .
But it obscures the real truth of the publishing world , which is that it is a roulette wheel .
WS : Oh , I do n’t think that ’s true , all sorts of things go on .
The sense in which it ’s a roulette wheel , it ’s heavily tampered with .
It ’s tampered with by all sorts of things .
The assumptions that people want to put into their identification as a reader with a certain kind of fiction .
By factors of class and ethnicity .
By currents and swirls and vortices of ephemeral cultural snobberies …
RB : The plurals of all the nouns that you are listing suggest that there are a great deal more variables which seems to me to be less determined than you are suggesting .
WS : What I am trying to say is , there are two scientific literary tests you can say here .
You can say , if you produce a book , you find a text of undoubted merit , right , but it is not attached to somebody marketable , would it in fact sell ?
Or will it be taken up ?
That ’s one kind of test case , is n’t it ?
The answer is yes and no .
Some texts would be able to transcend their handicap and other texts would n’t , depending on the particular time and manner and moment in which they were produced .
In other words …
RB : That sounds random to me .
WS : It ’s not random .
What you can infer from that is that certain kinds of writers , I believe , will win quite large literary prizes , will gain quite significant sales who I am absolutely certain their works are of no lasting merit whatsoever .
Absolutely certain of that .
( laughs )
But what I would n’t go on to say is that I or anybody else can be absolutely certain about saying who those writers are .
The best critics of the generation , when you have a serious critic emerges — what they are really saying , why they are a serious critic is because they believe that he or she has that ability to look , not just five or ten years but fifteen , twenty or thirty years into literary future .
RB : I was asked in an interview to predict what books would be remembered in a hundred years .
I simply do n’t think like that .
That ’s quite a responsibility to assume .
WS : I think if you are a serious creator you have to take on that responsibility .
Onerous as it might be and , of course , it is onerous because you are wide open to ridicule .
Not the least is the book that you back and the writers you back grow progressively out of fashion or indeed achieve no sales whatever or notoriety from the off .
The converse is true .
When a true genius emerges , you can tell because a confederacy of dunces is arraigned against him , but by the same token you can often tell when a true turkey emerges in the world because there is a confederacy of yea -sayers and cultural pecksniffs arraigned to support them .
RB : ( laughs )
WS : There are numerous books .
You only have to look at the — this is the kind of thing I would be wary of saying in Britain because I would get pilloried for a kind of arrogance .
RB : We have readers in Britain …
WS : Yeah , yeah .
I do hope so ( laughs ) .
Say you look at the big literary prizes .
Like the Booker Prize .
If you analyze the short list over the last twenty years in my view almost none of the significant books of the last twenty years have been on those short lists .
Not the books that are going to last .
The whole kind of machinery of prizes particularly literary prizes is quite spurious and is aimed at creating a certain kind of buzz for …it ’s a marketing , it ’s an arm of marketing , the prize .
RB : What about the IMPAC prize ?
WS : Right .
It ’s a big one .
RB : And seems quite honorably selected .
What you can infer from that is that certain kinds of writers , I believe , will win quite large literary prizes , will gain quite significant sales who I am absolutely certain their works are of no lasting merit whatsoever .
Absolutely certain of that .
( laughs )
But what I would n’t go on to say is that I or anybody else can be absolutely certain about saying who those writers are .
WS : They have a tradition of drawing from outside the usual suspects for their judging panels .
That creates a more interesting …my problem with this , Robert , is fundamental .
There are two points .
What would it be like to win at fiction ?
How can you win at fiction ?
It ’s an actual philosophical question .
What would it be like to win at fiction ?
The second question is the mechanics of judging .
It ’s a open secret on the Booker panel that no judge is allowed to push a book on to the short list that he or she in theory does n’t sincerely believe in with a chance of winning .
Now immediately that creates a tendency towards consensus and therefore second and third choice guessing .
Immediately any book that is maverick or perceived as not able to summon a quorum in that panel of four or five judges is out .
RB : That is also true for the National Book Awards .
WS : I think it is as well .
So immediately you have a dampener on anything that is contentious .
In my view , that actually disbars from winning the major literary prizes the books that are likely to last .
My suggestion is that books that have genuine longevity are always contentious and kicking against the pricks .
Anything that is too in harmony with its time is very unlikely to be timeless .
Some will be .
But on the whole not .
RB : Not an objection , but we are talking about books written in English and I fear that we have created a virtual co-equivalence of English and world literature which is happily occasionally rendered inconvenient by the Nobel Committee ’s recognition of some obscure literary wonder .
WS : Well , that may well be the case but the fact of the matter …
RB : I do n’t know that asked you a question .
WS : It ’s an observation .
The idea being that should be some entity called world literature .
While you can point to writers who are not writing in English obviously and ultimately have had enormous impact on the English speaking world .
That ’s an even longer time line to look at .
The truth of the matter is we tend to write about our own navel in the first instance and as English speakers that ’s what we are preoccupied with .
That ’s only right and proper .
I do n’t think we can castigate ourselves for not …
RB : What is the purpose of this literary forecasting about what will be highly regarded a hundred years hence ?
WS : You really get to the existence of the canon at that point and the existence of what the virtue of a literary culture is in that way .
And surely the idea of the canon is that there are …it ’s really the body of accumulated exegetical , diacritical commentary that is represented by something like the Talmud .
The Talmud and its commentary on the Pentateuch is the model for the English canon .
The English canon is an accretion of paraphraxis , marginalia , and attachment to literary work in that way that really is the secular gospel of our society .
That ’s what its virtue is and the ability to see forward and see what will actually gain status in the canon is as a literary person , what I would as the real value of our culture .
So it is significant in that way .
RB : So we are shining a light on to the path to the future .
WS : Yeah , in some ways .
The idea of trying to understand what might add to that canon in that way is significant .
Rather than what can be hyped and marketed as being a big prize winner , is reaffirming what the eternal verities truths and values of the society are in that way .
RB : Well we ’ve come this far , care to offer any names ?
WS : For that kind of secular canonization ?
I think of the post war novelists , my particular hobby horses are J.G. Ballard and the Scottish writer Alasdair Gray .
Both of whom have made that kind of contribution and are likely to be perceived that way .
Martin Amis is a personal friend so I tend to be blinkered on my view on him .
The significance of writers like Rushdie or McEwan , I think it ’s too early to say .
I really genuinely do .
My hunch is they are not in .
( laughs )
That ’s my feeling .
When you look at American writers , yeah , Bellow , Roth , possibly DeLillo , there are some figures there that will undoubtedly will make the cut .
But how they ’ll be perceived in fifty or a hundred years time , you do n’t know .
How , after all , is Trollope perceived now ?
RB : I come across people who have discovered or rediscovered Trollope or Dickens and they are thrilled …
WS : There are many ways to skin a cat .
Nobody legislates — it ’s the great thing about books — the way in which you choose to read a book is your own concern .
That ’s what ’s so good about it , really .
It ’s a medium that ’s less prescriptive than others , in that sense .
RB : The reason I wanted to make a claim for the arbitrariness of being published is because of the stories regularly encountered of writers who have submitted their books to countless publishers before acceptance and then won acclaim and sales …
WS : You have to ask yourself why is it the idea of being a published author so appeals to people now ?
And it does .
It appeals to a whole swathe of the educated class .
It seems to be an enormous kind of achievement and …
RB : It ’s glamorous …
WS : And it ’s glamorous .
Now I would suggest that the reality of that is that what people recognize about the status of a published writer who has their won readership is that he or she is their own master or mistress in a very fundamental way .
They stand outside of the whole corporate wheel .
They are truly self - employed in that way .
It is n’t actually the literary content of the enterprise that is really appealing to people .
The enormous growth of the creative writing industry here in the States is a real phenomenon , an astonishing phenomenon , that these thousands upon thousand of people will enter post graduate and even now graduate programs in creative writing when objectively the society simply can not support this many published writers .
Many of these people end up contributing to the industry themselves by in turn becoming creative writing teachers or taking on some minor position in academia .
What is it that draws them like moths to the flame , of this idea ?
RB : There are varieties of reasons .
I find it interesting that when I ask writers what they tell newly met strangers , many are reticent about saying they are writers .
WS : That ’s probably because they not achieving the level of success that they want .
You say , “ Oh really , what are your books ? ”
They say “ Well I ’m not actually a published … ”
RB : Even writers with published work .
WS : All right , okay .
I do n’t know .
It perplexes me .
What I was going to go on to say is that those stories , they are not all together apocryphal about “ My manuscript was turned down eighty - seven times and now I ’ve gone on to … ” I think they are the kind of Promethean myth of the creative writing program .
They gain currency because of this enormous group of people who have that kind of ambition and they speak to their urge .
RB : We are probably in agreement , if not the quantification , at least the sense that we are living in degraded times .
WS : ( Sniffs )
RB : What is the point of the literary enterprise against a very noisy pop culture , that seems to drown out … though I take comfort from the quote on the Sigmund Freud Memorial in Vienna , “ The voice of reason is small but persistent . ”
WS : I do n’t know about the voice of reason being small but persistent but I was with Frank Goldman the American writer he was …
RB : Francisco Goldman , the Guatemalan Jewish writer ?
WS : Well we are all American when we are in America and it applies to Frank too , actually Robert ( both laugh ) .
He was saying that what people outside literature do n’t understand about what ’s interesting in political writing is that it ’s not actually having an opinion that makes a writer able to address a political reality , it ’s being interesting in some way about that political reality .
That ’s what ’s the enduring fascination that actually literary fiction can contribute to the temper of the times .
It provides an arena in which interests can be generated in that way .
The overtly political novel is often a creature of its times and effectively neutered for that reason .
But here is a kind of “ nothing that is human is strange to me ” that ’s the voice that can be represented in literary fiction and elaborated in a way that other cultural forums do n’t allow the space or the time for .
You ca n’t ask me subjectively to answer that question .
I feel my literary work is an avocation .
It ’s just what I feel called upon to do .
Do I get up in the morning and question whether I should write another book ?
No .
Never seriously .
I mean I certainly question the value of my work all the time .
RB : The specific book you are working on ?
WS : Oh and the body of it .
Because , of course …
RB : You ask yourself if what you are doing is important ?
WS : My wife said , the other day , I do n’t think she intended anything by it , but of course I took it very deeply , “ You know , I still think Will ’s first book is easily his best .
There ’s not an ounce of fat on it .
Every word … ” I am sitting there thinking , “ Thirteen years of literary work , nine books , just evaporate into thin air . ”
RB : ( laughs )
WS : I think , “ Oh I need n’t to be bothered with that . ”
I do n’t think she meant it that way .
But there is a sense in which you are not in a position to judge that anyway , which of the books is likely to endure .
You just have to keep on .
RB : Speaking of which , what ’s next for you ?
WS : I ’m working on my first collection of shorter pieces since ’ 98 .
And it ’s called Doctor Mucti and Other Tales of Woe .
The lead story is about two psychiatrists who are fighting a duel with each other using psychotic patients as weapons .
I do n’t know where that comes and what I tend to do in my shorter fiction is to write prequels to novels .
Or I write sequels to other stories I have written .
There is always an interconnection and an interpenetrativeness about the shorter fiction .
RB : That might suggest a total recall of everything you have ever written ?
WS : Ah , if I do n’t then I am not too worried about it .
I remember reading that Nicholson Baker read all of his texts in parallel at the editing stage to insure that no single image recurred .
Now that ’s the opposite , I think a certain degree of repetition and recursiveness just helps to thicken the whole broth .
So I ’m not too bothered about that .
The things I do recall and I do want to bolt on to other fiction pieces are the things I think are worth recalling .
Then I am working on a biggish novel which is concerned in a timely way with the idea of revealed religion .
I am very struck by the way that fundamentalists , all of the great monotheism ’s fundamentalists believe their holy books are a kind of blueprint for the way that human culture works .
So if you talk to a Jewish fundamentalist , Muslim fundamentalist a Christian fundamentalist , they ’ll say it ’s all in the Bible , it ’s all in the Torah , all in the Koran .
It ’s all there .
Genetic engineering is there .
The atomic bomb is there .
It ’s equivocal in the way that all my novels are , part satire , part novel of ideas that what if you had a holy book that a reader of my book will know was totally spurious and yet looks at a society that believes that it is there revealed truth of god .
That ’s an interesting way of looking at what the enduring significance of the practical mythology of the holy books of the monotheisms .
As being in current era with this much - trumpeted clash of civilizations is something uppermost in all our minds and yet we can’t really talk about it .
Particularly in secular society we find it very difficult .

Poll : Americans disapprove of Bush 's Iraq veto Bush made comments May 1 on Iraq , following his veto of the $ 124 billion Iraq Supplemental Funding Bill .
The poll found that 54 percent of Americans opposed Bush 's May 1 veto , while 44 percent backed the president 's decision to kill the $ 124 billion bill .
Now that the veto has been cast , 57 percent of Americans said they want Congress to send another spending bill with a timetable for withdrawal back to the White House , the poll found -- but 61 percent would support a new bill that dropped the timetables in favor of benchmarks for the Iraqi government to meet to maintain American support . (
While it found that more Americans believe Congress , rather than the president , should be responsible for setting policy in Iraq , the survey may give the Democratic leadership some pause .
The percentage of people saying Democratic control of Congress is good for the country dropped from 59 percent in a March poll to 51 percent now .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A majority of the U.S. public disapproves of President Bush 's decision to veto a war spending bill that called for U.S. troops to leave Iraq in 2008 , according to a CNN poll released Tuesday .
The poll found that 54 percent of Americans opposed Bush 's May 1 veto , while 44 percent backed the president 's decision to kill the $ 124 billion bill .
Now that the veto has been cast , 57 percent of Americans said they want Congress to send another spending bill with a timetable for withdrawal back to the White House , the poll found -- but 61 percent would support a new bill that dropped the timetables in favor of benchmarks for the Iraqi government to meet to maintain American support .

Hawaii , Alaska , California , Maine – four names you just have to read and * poof * an image pops up in your head .
Become an icicle in the north or get barbecued in the south .
There are regions in the US , where you can drive for hours without seeing a single house .
That ’s nearly impossible in Germany .
Americans are often criticized for not traveling to other countries .
While I think it is idiotic to not care about the rest of the world , I really understand why you do n’t go there .
Why would you ?
You can stay in your country and visit the Grand Canyon and the Niagara Falls .
Yellowstone and Yosemite National Park are waiting for you .
And that are just natural sites .
Go see the Statue of Liberty , the White House , Mount Rushmore , the Hoover Dam or Kennedy Space Center .
And while you ’re doing it – everybody speaks the same language as you ( well , most of them ) .
So , although I think that you should always keep an eye on what happens in the rest of the world – when you ’re looking for beauty , get your ass outside and have a look around .

Blog professionals often talk about ending strongly , and the same holds true when giving a presentation .

Right , the update hinted at by those forced user updates to the WinDVD and PowerDVD software .
Yeah , well no worries ... it 's cracked .
That 's right , a week before the disks have even hit the shops , the kids over at Slysoft have already released AnyDVD HD 6.1.5.1 ( beta ) which kicks AACS MKB v3 swiftly to the curb .
Thus you can continue to rip all your newly purchased HD DVD and BD flicks for playback any damn way you like .
The update has already been demonstrated to work with an early - shipped release of The Matrix Trilogy on HD DVD and will likely work for Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest when it arrives on Blu-ray .
Come on AACS LA , you 're gonna have to at least try .
Better yet , why not just give up this silly charade .

第 3 回 「 ググる」の精度を高めるために必要なもの
加山恵美
2006/3/15
いま、現場で求められているキャリアやスキルは、どんなものだろうか。本連載では、さまざまなITエンジニアに自身の体験談を聞いていく。その体験談の中から、読者のヒントになるようなキャリアやスキルが見つかることを願っている。
グーグルでソフトウェアエンジニアとして働く工藤拓氏。現在の業務は日本語の検索結果の質を向上させることだ。奥が深く難しい仕事だが、工藤氏はマイペースで取り組んでいるように見える。悠然と構えるのは天性なのかもしれないが、長年培った高い専門能力からくる余裕もあるのだろう。おっとりしているようでも、機会を見つけて俊敏に行動する勘はとても鋭い。
■ 検索結果の精度を高める
「 いまの仕事は『縁の下の力持ち』です」と語るグーグル
ソフトウェアエンジニアの工藤拓氏
分からないことがあれば「ググる」。あえて説明するのもやぼだが「Googleで検索する」ことをいう。ネットを使う人間なら、「ググる」のは日常茶飯事だろう。検索エンジンGoogleは、名前が動詞になって定着するほどの地位を確立している。キーワードを入力すれば探しているWebページを瞬時に示してくれるからだ。
「 ググった」検索結果の精度を高めることが工藤氏の仕事である。精度はGoogleの性能そのものであり、信頼性を左右する重要な要素だ。とはいえ、望みのページを的確に表示するための技術は実に奥が深い。
多く のWebサイトが検索エンジンで上位に表示されることを狙っている。一般的にはページにキーワードを埋め込んだり、リンクされたりすることが有効となるが、不当な手段を用いるケースも後を絶たない。いかに不適切なものを排除して適切なものを選び出すか。それには継続的な努力が必要となる。
スペルミスと思われる単語が検索された場合、「もしかして：」と似たスペルの正しい単語を候補として表示する機能もある。人間なら何げなく思い浮かべることができても、機械にとっては簡単ではない。
さらに日本語の検索結果となると、日本語の構造や特殊性も考慮する必要がある。「日本語は英語と違い、スペースで単語が区切られていませんから」と工藤氏はいう。まず単語を分解することから始めなくてはならない。
■ 日本語の機械処理は難しい
工藤氏の専門は日本語の機械処理だ。福岡出身で、大学入学以降は京都と奈良で過ごした。奈良先端科学技術大学院大学（NAIST）では主に日本語の研究に携わった。日本語研究というと文学的なものを連想するが、至って科学的なものである。日本語をシステムで解析するための研究だ。身の回りにある任意の物質を実験室の分析機にかけ、化学組成を調べるようなイメージに近いのではないだろうか。
「 日本語は係り受けが難しいのです 」
工藤氏はそう語る。一見同じ構造の文でも、場合によって異なる係り受けになることがある。例えば「京都の美しい寺」と「仏像の美しい寺」というフレーズでは、「京都の」と「仏像の」の係り受けが異なるようにだ。日本語を母語とする人間なら無意識のうちに理解できるが、機械が処理できるようなロジックを考えるのは簡単ではない。海外の人が日本語を学ぼうとするとかなり苦戦するなど、言語としての日本語の難しさもよく耳にする。複雑な言語である日本語を機械処理するには困難も多いのではないだろうか。
続けて 「面白い試みをしたと聞いたことがあります」と工藤氏は日本語処理研究の学会で耳にした実験に話を移した。機械翻訳がどのくらい実用的なのか調べるために、機械翻訳のみで日本人と外国人で会話を試みたという。実験の参加者は相手の言葉を多少は理解しているが、あえて母語のみを使い、必ず機械を通じて会話するというルールにした。
機械翻訳の精度はさておき、興味深い展開になったという。人間が思うままに話すと機械は完全には理解できず、翻訳すればさらに言葉として劣化する。つまり意図が十分盛り込めなかったり、ぎこちない表現となったりする。機械翻訳を試したことのある人なら想像はつくだろう。
その結果、人間の方が機械に合わせて言葉を選び始めたというのだ。機械が言語を理解しやすいように単純な文章にしたり、直訳した文章のような言葉で話すようになったという。機械への譲歩というべきか。これはこれで人間の高度な能力を示しているのかもしれない。
■ 週末には趣味でツールを作成
機械翻訳をはじめ、その前段階となる日本語の解析など、研究そのものは「地味でした」と工藤氏はいう。最終的にはPhD（博士号）を取得した。
その後、京都にある企業に契約研究員という形で1年ほど勤めた。通信系の企業で、日本語の機械的な言語処理や音声処理を研究していた。電子メール本文からスパムメールかどうかを判断するようなことにもかかわったという。
企業の研究員でいる間も、大学の研究室とは親しくしていた。その企業で働くことにした理由の1つに「NAISTから近かったので（笑）」ということがあったくらいだ。研究員だったため、就労時間も比較的自由だった。頻度はまちまちではあるが、おおよそ勤務時間の1割くらいは大学の研究室に足を運んでいたという。
日本語変換の話をしていて、筆者が目にしたAjaxで作られた日本語変換ツールに話題が移ると、工藤氏はぼそっと「たぶん、それぼくのです」といった。確かにそのとおりだった。研究員をしていたころ、片手間に作成したという。Ajaxの活用事例としても、日本語変換のない環境での実用的なツールとしても隠れた人気を博しているものだ。
「 週末に集中的に仕上げました 」
あっさりという。趣味のツールとはいっても、週末だけで仕上げてしまう手際の良さは見事だ。ひとたび何かに取り組むと一気に仕上げてしまう能力と集中力があるのだろう。工藤氏は「週末よくこういうのにかかりきりになりますが、（熱中しすぎると）家族に怒られてしまいます」と肩をすぼめていた。
OSLO , April 26 — Brusquely dismissing protests by Russian officials , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said here on Thursday that a missile - defense system the United States plans to install in Poland and the Czech Republic would pose no danger to the security of Russia .
“ The idea that somehow 10 interceptors and a few radars in Eastern Europe are going to threaten the Soviet strategic deterrent is purely ludicrous , and everybody knows it , ” Ms. Rice said before a meeting of NATO foreign ministers expected to focus on the missile - defense dispute .
“ The Russians have thousands of warheads , ” Ms. Rice said .
“ The idea that you can somehow stop the Soviet strategic nuclear deterrent with a few interceptors just does n’t make sense . ”
Still , Ms. Rice said the United States would continue discussing the system with Russian officials , in an effort to “ demystify ” it .
She planned to meet the foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , later on Thursday .

Eye colour has always intrigued geneticists
They found that just a few " letters " out of the six billion that make up the genetic code are responsible for most of the variation in human eye colour .
The research , by a team of scientists from Queensland , Australia , will appear in a forthcoming issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics .
The findings are based on a genetic study of nearly 4,000 individuals .
One of the changes is like switching the light on and off , while the other is like changing the light bulb from brown to green
Richard Sturm , University of Queensland
SNPs represent a change of just one letter in the genetic sequence .
These changes , or mutations , in our DNA can have important consequences for how the gene gets physically expressed .
All the SNPs are located near a gene called OCA2 .
This gene produces a protein that helps give hair , skin and eyes their colour .
And mutations in OCA2 cause the most common type of albinism .
Brown and blue
The study , which focused on twins , their siblings and parents , shows - conclusively - that there is no " gene " for eye colour .
THE DNA MOLECULE
The double - stranded DNA molecule is held together by four chemical components called bases Adenine ( A ) bonds with thymine ( T ) ; cytosine ( C ) bonds with guanine ( G ) Groupings of these " letters " form the " code of life " ; there are about 2.9 billion base - pairs in the human genome wound into 24 distinct bundles , or chromosomes Written in the DNA are about 20 - 25,000 genes which human cells use as starting templates to make proteins ; these sophisticated molecules build and maintain our bodies
In short , these combinations strongly influence the colour of a person 's eyes , but they are not the final word .
Dr Richard Sturm and his colleagues found three SNPs near the start of the OCA2 gene that were linked to blue eye colour .
" The SNPs we 've identified in themselves are not functionally causing the eye colour change , but they are linked very , very closely to something that is , " Dr Sturm , from the University of Queensland , told BBC News .
" When OCA2 is knocked out , there is a loss of pigmentation .
The position of these SNPs right at the start of the gene means it is possible we 're looking at a change in the regulation of the gene in people with blue eye colour . "
Functional change
So these SNPs , at the start of OCA2 , probably regulate how much of the pigmentation protein is produced by the gene .
People with brown eyes might have a lot of this protein , while people with blue eyes have less .
However , the single letter changes involved in green eyes may actually produce functional changes in the pigmentation protein .
The researchers found SNPs at another position in the OCA2 region - linked to green eyes - that resulted in changes to amino acids ( the building blocks of a protein ) .
" To use an analogy , one of the changes is like switching the light on and off , while the other is like changing the light bulb from brown to green , " said Dr Sturm .
Altogether , the single letter changes identified in the study accounted for 74 % of total variation in eye colour , the researchers said .
The study was a collaboration between researchers at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research and the University of Queensland , both in Brisbane .
The Russian military is accused of numerous abuses
The Memorial group has published details of the abandoned prison on its website , including photos and graffiti scrawled by inmates and their captors .
Former inmates told Memorial they had been tortured there .
The pro-Moscow Chechen authorities said their own investigators had " found no evidence of torture " .
Separatist rebels have been fighting Russian forces and Moscow 's Chechen allies in the devastated North Caucasus republic since 1994 .
Beatings
The dungeon was in a former school for deaf children occupied by Russian interior ministry troops until late last month , Memorial reported .
Memorial activists visited the site in Grozny 's Oktyabrsky district last week and photographed it .
Alavdi Sadykov , who spent three months in the prison in 2000 , is missing his left ear .
He told Memorial that his captors had cut it off .
Memorial says official investigations into his illegal detention and torture and disappearances of three other captives have dragged on for years and nobody has been punished yet .
" They would put you face down on a bench ... then they placed a board on you and hit it with a hammer , beating your internal organs , " Mr Sadykov said .
He said the idea was to avoid leaving external marks from the beating .
Official denial
The Chechen prosecutor - general has launched several criminal investigations in connection with the alleged disappearances and torture at the Oktyabrsky prison .
Human Rights Watch and other international human rights groups have accused Russian and pro-Moscow Chechen security forces of widespread abuses in Chechnya .
A human rights official working for the pro-Moscow administration in Chechnya , Nurdi Nukhazhiyev , rejected Memorial 's allegations about the Oktyabrsky detention centre .
He told Russia 's Itar - Tass news agency that the republic 's investigators had " checked the temporary remand centre " and " found no evidence of torture " .
" Had the allegation of Memorial corresponded to the facts , under no circumstances would this matter have been ignored by Chechen President Alu Alkhanov or Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov .
But someone wants to create tension here , and I note this with regret , " he said .

We 've been looking at solutions for hosting and serving large amounts of ( small ) static content to a global audience and are currently in the process of evaluating all of the CDNs out there .
One might think that Amazon S3 would be good for this purpose , but it 's absolutely not .
We tried it for a while , and it really only has two things going for it :
It 's very cheap
Everything is automated and easy to set up
Aside from that , the performance is absolutely terrible outside of the US , which I really noticed since I 've been in Taipei .
In addition to that , it 's simply not reliable .
There are extended and unannounced periods of downtime , so you should n't be using it in production ( except maybe for redundancy or backup purposes ) .
After we experienced some unacceptably long downtime I scoured the internet for a real CDN solution .
There are a bunch out there , but only one of them is open enough to publish prices and allow you to sign up without doing a sales call : CacheFly .
So far our experience with CacheFly has been pleasant .
It 's a little more expensive than Amazon S3 , but you 're paying for a far better service .
Plus , there 's a 30 day free trial .
The trial appears to be " only available if you sign up before tomorrow " , but it seems to be following the calendar .
There have been a few small snags with the CacheFly service so far :
In order to use rsync / scp / sftp uploads you must file a support ticket ; ftp is the only service enabled by default
After that support ticket was resolved , scp was broken so I had to file another ticket ( rsync and sftp worked )
In order to use your own DNS you must file a support ticket , otherwise you 're stuck with accountname.cachefly.net
Their POP distribution technology seems suboptimal ; they 're serving the lion 's share of our traffic from the US when most of it is n't coming from there ( though still massively better than Amazon S3 )
On the flip side , the experience has been good overall :
Latency is MUCH better than Amazon S3 in our experience
They give you pretty good reports about your traffic , without having to parse your own logs
Responses to support tickets have been prompt
It 's the only real CDN with published prices that allows you to sign up without dealing with a sales department
All that said , CacheFly is the smallest fish in the CDN pond .
It only has 5 POPs and we 'll probably outgrow it within the next year and move over to one of the " Tier 1 " providers such as Akamai or BitGravity .
I still highly recommend CacheFly as a first step for anyone looking to improve their site 's reliability and performance by using a CDN .
The researchers could interpret the memories through electrodes inserted into the rats ’ brains , including into special neurons in the hippocampus .
These neurons are known as “ place cells ” because each is activated when the rat passes a specific location , as if they were part of a map in the brain .
The activation is so reliable that one can tell where a rat is in its cage by seeing which of its place cells is firing .
Earlier this year Dr. Wilson reported that after running a maze , rats would replay their route during idle moments , as if to consolidate the memory , although the replay , surprisingly , was in reverse order of travel .
These fast rewinds lasted a small fraction of the actual time spent on the journey .
In the findings reported today , the M.I.T. researchers say they detected the same replays occurring in the neocortex as well as in the hippocampus as the rats slept .
The rewinds appeared as components of repeated cycles of neural activity , each of which lasted just under a second .
Because the cycles in the hippocampus and neocortex were synchronized , they seemed to be part of a dialogue between the two regions .
The researchers recorded electrical activity only in the visual neocortex , the region that handles input from the eyes , but they assumed many other regions participated in the memory replay activity .
One reason is that there is no direct connection between the visual neocortex and the hippocampus , suggesting that a third brain region coordinates a general dialogue between the hippocampus and all necessary components of the neocortex .
Larry Squire , a neuroscientist who studies memory at the University of California , San Diego , noted that the replay system in the neocortex had not been seen before .
The fact that it occurred during sleep “ would certainly provide one clue that part of the function of sleep is to let us process and stabilize the experiences we have during the day , ” Dr. Squire said .
The ‘ Peter Pan Syndrome ’ affects people who do not want or feel unable to grow up , people with the body of an adult but the mind of a child .
They do n’t know how to or do n’t want to stop being children and start being mothers or fathers .
The syndrome is not currently considered a psychopathology , given the World Health Organization has not recognized it as a psychological disorder .
However , an increasingly larger number of adults are presenting emotionally immature behaviors in Western society .
They are unable to grow up and take on adult responsibilities , and even dress up and enjoy themselves as teenagers when they are over 30 years old .
Humbelina Robles Ortega , professor of the Department of Personality , Evaluation and Psychological Treatment of the University of Granada and an expert in emotional disorders , warns that the overprotection of parents can lead children to develop the Peter Pan Syndrome , given “ it usually affects dependent people who have been overprotected by their families and have n’t developed the necessary skills to confront life . ”
The ‘ Peter Pans ’ of present society “ see the adult world as very problematic and glorify adolescence , which is why they want to stay in that state of privilege . ”
More men than women affected
Peter Pan Syndrome can affect both sexes , but it appears more often among men .
Some characteristics of the disorder are the inability of individuals to take on responsibilities , to commit themselves or to keep promises , excessive care about the way they look and personal well - being and their lack of self - confidence , even though they do n’t seem to show it and actually come across as exactly the opposite .
The UGR professor declares that these people are usually scared of loneliness , which is why they try to surround themselves with people who can meet their needs .
“ They become anxious when they are evaluated by their work colleagues or their superiors , given they are completely intolerant towards any criticism .
Sometimes they can have serious adaptation problems at work or in personal relationships . ”
Another characteristic of people suffering from the ‘ Peter Pan Syndrome ’ is that they are constantly changing partners and looking for younger ones .
“ Whenever the relationship starts to ask for a high level of commitment and responsibility , they become afraid and break it up .
Relationships with younger women have the advantage of being able to live by the day without any worries , and they also involve less future plans , therefore less responsibilities . ”
The Wendy behind Peter Pan
Psychologist Dan Kiley , who defined ‘ Peter Pan Syndrome ’ in 1983 , also used the term ‘ Wendy Syndrome ’ to describe women who act like mothers with their partners or people close to them .
Humbelina Robles stresses that “ Wendy is the woman behind Peter Pan .
There must be someone who deals with the things Peter Pan does n’t do in order for Peter Pan to exist . ”
The researcher from the UGR states that Wendy “ makes every decision and takes on the responsibilities of her partner , thus justifying his unreliability .
We can find Wendy people even within the immediate family : the overprotecting mothers . ”
The professor declares that the biggest disadvantage of both disorders ( Peter Pan and Wendy Syndromes ) is usually that the person who suffers from them does n’t feel as though they are part of the problem , they are not aware of it .
Robles points out that the only solution for this disease is the right psychological treatment , not only centered on the person who suffers from the disorder but also on his / her partner and family .
May 29 , 2007 ( 1A ) Rules ' hiding ' trillions in debt
Liability $ 516,348 per U.S. household
By Dennis Cauchon , USA TODAY Discussion Questions
What real world ramifications does this debt have for your generation ?
Which countries are currently holding most of our national debt ?
Why does it matter that foreign countries service our debt ?
Create a graph showing gross federal debt over the last decade .
What factors are most responsible for the increase in debt ?
What role will tax cuts ( whether they are made permanent or not ) , the war , and AMT reform play in reducing or increasing the level of debt over the next 10 years ?
The federal government recorded a $ 1.3 trillion loss last year -- far more than the official $ 248 billion deficit -- when corporate - style accounting standards are used , a USA TODAY analysis shows .
The loss reflects a continued deterioration in the finances of Social Security and government retirement programs for civil servants and military personnel .
The loss -- equal to $ 11,434 per household -- is more than Americans paid in income taxes in 2006 .
" We 're on an unsustainable path and doing a great disservice to future generations , " says Chris Chocola , a former Republican member of Congress from Indiana and corporate chief executive who is pushing for more accurate federal accounting .
Modern accounting requires that corporations , state governments and local governments count expenses immediately when a transaction occurs , even if the payment will be made later .
The federal government does not follow the rule , so promises for Social Security and Medicare do n't show up when the government reports its financial condition .
Bottom line : Taxpayers are now on the hook for a record $ 59.1 trillion in liabilities , a 2.3 % increase from 2006 .
That amount is equal to $ 516,348 for every U.S. household .
By comparison , U.S. households owe an average of $ 112,043 for mortgages , car loans , credit cards and all other debt combined .
Unfunded promises made for Medicare , Social Security and federal retirement programs account for 85 % of taxpayer liabilities .
State and local government retirement plans account for much of the rest .
This hidden debt is the amount taxpayers would have to pay immediately to cover government 's financial obligations .
Like a mortgage , it will cost more to repay the debt over time .
Every U.S. household would have to pay about $ 31,000 a year to do so in 75 years .
The Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Board , which sets federal accounting standards , is considering requiring the government to adopt accounting rules similar to those for corporations .
The change would move Social Security and Medicare onto the government 's income statement and balance sheet , instead of keeping them separate .
The White House and the Congressional Budget Office oppose the change , arguing that the programs are not true liabilities because government can cancel or cut them .
Chad Stone , chief economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , says it can be misleading to focus on the government 's unfunded liabilities because Medicare 's financial problems overwhelm the analysis .
" There is a shortfall in Medicare and Medicaid that is potentially explosive , but that is related to overall trends in health care spending , " he says .

Calculating the beam ’s width is hundreds of times faster when the program adopts the perspective of a fast - moving observer , thanks to a previously unnoticed effect of relativity . ×
Relativity theory insists that no matter what speed you choose for your spaceship–snail - like or close to light speed –the laws of physics always look the same .
Yet in the 30 March Physical Review Letters , a theorist reports that the complexity of physics calculations is not the same at all speeds .
Merely imagining particle interactions from a speeding spaceship ’s point - of - view could dramatically accelerate computer calculations , especially for phenomena involving particles moving close to light speed .
The discovery of such a simple but unnoticed effect of relativity theory is surprising to many researchers , in part because the theory is so well - studied .
Researchers studying strongly relativistic physics –the interaction of high - energy particle beams , for example , or the passage of intense laser pulses through matter–routinely rely on computer simulations to follow the complex dynamics .
These simulations chop a system into many small parts , and calculate what happens to those parts through a sequence of steps in time .
For accuracy , the discrete parts and time steps must be smaller than the finest details important to the physics .
For example , for a dense beam of protons passing at nearly the speed of light through a cloud of electrons , the program must cut up the system into pieces smaller than 10 centimeters across , which is the typical length of a “ pulse ” of protons in an accelerator .
But the program must also calculate results on the scale of the accelerator length , perhaps 5 kilometers .
As a result , the number of computational steps required to simulate a problem grows not only with its overall size and duration , but also with the fineness of its details ; it depends on the full range of scales involved , from small to large .
If the laws of physics do n’t change with the speed–or “ reference frame ” –of the observer , you might think that the range of scales should n’t change either .
But a simple calculation shows otherwise , according to Jean - Luc Vay of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California .
Vay imagined two objects that interact as they pass by one another at relativistic speeds .
Each object has a certain overall length and also a certain size for its finest details .
Relativity theory says that an observer in a different reference frame would see these scales altered by relativistic length contraction and time dilation .
Vay calculated that the overall range of scales would change too , and potentially quite dramatically for the most high - speed interactions .
Moreover , there ’s always an optimal frame in which the range becomes smallest .
He says that researchers may be able to speed up some of their calculations immensely , merely by recasting them in the best frame of reference .
For the proton beam example , Vay found that the calculation in the optimal frame required about 5000 time steps , compared to more than five million in a frame fixed on the electron cloud .
On the computer he used , the former calculation finished in less than 30 minutes , while the latter ran for over a week .
For other simulations involving the intense interaction of laser light with matter , as in free - electron lasers , Vay says the simulation speed may be improved by a million times or more .
“ This comes as a surprise to most physicists , ” says Vay .
“ Most feel that the complexity of a system should be invariant ” as viewed from different reference frames .
“ This is a remarkable observation , ” says plasma physicist Alex Friedman of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , “ especially in view of the number of years that have passed since special relativity was developed .
I think it will make a big difference for lots of practical simulations . ”

Is " Apocalypto " Pornography ?
December 5 , 2006 by Traci Ardren
A scholar challenges Mel Gibson 's use of the ancient Maya culture as a metaphor for his vision of today 's world .
Traci Ardren , an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Miami , knows the Maya well .
She has studied Classic Maya society for over 20 years while living in the modern Maya villages of Yaxuna , Chunchucmil , and Espita in the Mexican state of Yucatan .
Her credentials include contributing to and editing Ancient Maya Women ( 2002 ) and The Social Experience of Childhood in Ancient Mesoamerica ( 2006 ) .
Ardren 's reaction to the new film " Apocalypto , " follows .
Scholars are well aware that some aspects of Maya culture were violent , but Ardren finds fault with what she sees as a pervasive colonial attitude in the film .
With great trepidation I went to an advance screening of " Apocalypto " last night in Miami .
No one really expects historical dramas to be accurate , so I was not so much concerned with whether or not the film would accurately represent what we know of Classic period Maya history as I was concerned about the message Mel Gibson wanted to convey through the film .
After Jared Diamond 's best - selling book Collapse , it has become fashionable to use the so - called Maya collapse as a metaphor for Western society 's environmental and political excesses .
Setting aside the fact that the Maya lived for more than a thousand years in a fragile tropical environment before their cities were abandoned , while here in the U.S , we have polluted our urban environments in less than 200 , I anticipated a heavy - handed cautionary tale wrapped up in Native American costume .
What I saw was much worse than this .
The thrill of hearing melodic Yucatec Maya spoken by familiar faces ( although the five lead actors are not Yucatec Maya but other talented Native American actors ) during the first ten minutes of the movie is swiftly and brutally replaced with stomach churning panic at the graphic Maya - on - Maya violence depicted in a village raid scene of nearly 15 minutes .
From then on the entire movie never ceases to utilize every possible excuse to depict more violence .
It is unrelenting .
Our hero , Jaguar Paw , played by the charismatic Cree actor Rudy Youngblood , has one hellavuh bad couple of days .
Captured for sacrifice , forced to march to the putrid city nearby , he endures every tropical jungle attack conceivable and that is after he escapes the relentless brutality of the elites .
I am told this part of the movie is completely derivative of the 1966 film " The Naked Prey . "
Pure action flick , with one ridiculous encounter after another , filmed beautifully in the way that only Hollywood blockbusters can afford , this is the part of the movie that will draw in audiences and demonstrates Gibson 's skill as a cinematic storyteller .
But I find the visual appeal of the film one of the most disturbing aspects of " Apocalypto . "
The jungles of Veracruz and Costa Rica have never looked better , the masked priests on the temple jump right off a Classic Maya vase , and the people are gorgeous .
The fact that this film was made in Mexico and filmed in the Yucatec Maya language coupled with its visual appeal makes it all the more dangerous .
It looks authentic ; viewers will be captivated by the crazy , exotic mess of the city and the howler monkeys in the jungle .
And who really cares that the Maya were not living in cities when the Spanish arrived ?
Yes , Gibson includes the arrival of clearly Christian missionaries ( these guys are too clean to be conquistadors ) in the last five minutes of the story ( in the real world the Spanish arrived 300 years after the last Maya city was abandoned ) .
It is one of the few calm moments in an otherwise aggressively paced film .
The message ?
The end is near and the savior has come .
Gibson 's efforts at authenticity of location and language might , for some viewers , mask his blatantly colonial message that the Maya needed saving because they were rotten at the core .
Using the decline of Classic urbanism as his backdrop , Gibson communicates that there was absolutely nothing redeemable about Maya culture , especially elite culture which is depicted as a disgusting feast of blood and excess .
Before anyone thinks I have forgotten my Metamucil this morning , I am not a compulsively politically correct type who sees the Maya as the epitome of goodness and light .
I know the Maya practiced brutal violence upon one another , and I have studied child sacrifice during the Classic period .
But in " Apocalypto , " no mention is made of the achievements in science and art , the profound spirituality and connection to agricultural cycles , or the engineering feats of Maya cities .
Instead , Gibson replays , in glorious big - budget technicolor , an offensive and racist notion that Maya people were brutal to one another long before the arrival of Europeans and thus they deserve , in fact they needed , rescue .
This same idea was used for 500 years to justify the subjugation of Maya people and it has been thoroughly deconstructed and rejected by Maya intellectuals and community leaders throughout the Maya area today .
In fact , Maya intellectuals have demonstrated convincingly that such ideas were manipulated by the Guatemalan army to justify the genocidal civil war of the 1970 - 1990s .
To see this same trope about who indigenous people were ( and are today ? ) used as the basis for entertainment ( and I use the term loosely ) is truly embarrassing .
How can we continue to produce such one - sided and clearly exploitative messages about the indigenous people of the New World ?
I loved Gibson 's film " Braveheart , " I really did .
But there is something very different about portraying a group of people , who are now recovering from 500 years of colonization , as violent and brutal .
These are people who are living with the very real effects of persistent racism that at its heart sees them as less than human .
To think that a movie about the 1,000 ways a Maya can kill a Maya - - when only 10 years ago Maya people were systematically being exterminated in Guatemala just for being Maya - - is in any way okay , entertaining , or helpful is the epitome of a Western fantasy of supremacy that I find sad and ultimately pornographic .
It is surely no surprise that " Apolcalypto " has very little to do with Maya culture and instead is Gibson 's comment on the excesses he perceives in modern Western society .
I just wish he had been honest enough to say this .
Instead he has created a beautiful and disturbing portrait that satisfies his need for comment but does violence to one of the most impressive of Native American cultures .

Another Mayanist , SMU's David Freidel , weighs in on the film in our upcoming March / April issue .

The candidacy of Abdullah Gul , Turkey ’s foreign minister , for the presidential elections provoked massive demonstrations in Istanbul and Ankara and aborted the voting process .
The confrontation is between secularists and a ruling party with a neo -Islamic tinge , the popular Justice and Development party ( AKP ) , which has overseen a sophisticated , fast - improving economy and the nation ’s candidacy for the European Union .
The crisis arose from a contest for the soul of the nation , with nationalism at its core
A friend of mine , Ipek Calislar , could n’t come to dinner the other night .
She does n’t have a car but she does have a police bodyguard and crossing from the other side of Istanbul on public transport would have been too complicated .
She needed protection because of something that now affects many lives in Turkey and threatens many more .
She did n’t testify against the mob , or blaspheme against any Islamic orthodoxy .
She wrote a bestseller which was sold shrink - wrapped in plastic with an accompanying DVD .
It offended not against God but against Turkey .
It was a biography of Latife Usakizade , briefly married to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , and it elevated into a feminist heroine a woman whom official history had dismissed as a harridan who tried to steal Turkey ’s founder from his one true love , the republic .
The author described , among other surprises , how Latife cannily saved her husband from waiting assassins by swapping clothes ; she donned his uniform and he a black chador .
The idea that the father of today ’s secular state a ) did not laugh at death , b ) dressed in women ’s clothing and c ) religious drag at that , was too much for some , who applied to the public prosecutor to open an investigation .
The case against Calislar , under article 5816 , which is designed to protect Ataturk ’s reputation , was feeble and collapsed last December , as you would expect in a country determined to break into the European Union .
Calislar is among several Turkish authors who have been unsuccessfully pursued under statutes which many inside government find embarrassing .
The prime minister , Tayyip Erdogan , phoned to congratulate another friend of mine whose prosecution under article 301 of the penal code , forbidding insults to Turkishness , was dropped .
As far as I know , he never phoned to commiserate with Hrant Dink , the Turkish Armenian editor who was given a suspended sentence under the same law .
But to his credit , Erdogan did pay a condolence visit to Dink ’s widow after a 17 - year - old shot her husband dead in January .
His death is the reason that Calislar and others now have a police guard .
It worries us all ; when you ask how someone is , and they reply with a sigh and a shrug , you know exactly what they mean .
When people ask who killed Dink , they do n’t mean who pulled the trigger .
The 17 - year - old killer is now behind bars along with members of an ultra - right wing nationalist gang who sought to avenge the inaccurate headlines in the mainstream press claiming that Dink had “ cursed the Turkishness in his blood ” .
The question really asks how far up the food chain the conspiracy went .
Turkey has a history of covert operations organised by an entrenched old guard who have manipulated ultra-nationalist gangs to get rid of Kurdish activists or create chaos when the elected government was going in a direction that the “ deep state ” did n’t approve .
In 1996 a gangster , his moll , a chief of police and a pro-government Kurdish MP were in a car that ran into truck in the town of Susurluk , providing evidence of links between the security forces , politics and organised crime .
Some suspect that Dink ’s death was plotted by the same dark forces trying to discredit the government in this double election year .
The army speaks
The presidential election had once seemed a foregone conclusion .
The rulingJustice and Development party ( AKP ) , aware of the military ’s distrust of its neo-Islamic tinge , had nominated the soft - spoken foreign minister Abdullah Gul for the post and , as parliament does the voting , the outcome had seemed in the bag .
But the opposition , weak and divided and struggling to find its voice , chanced upon a clever tactic to sabotage the vote .
They asserted , with no real precedent , that a quorum of three - quarters of MPs had to be in the chamber for the vote to proceed and took their objection to Turkey ’s constitutional court .
The court annulled the first round of voting on 1 May .
After parliament again failed to elect Gul as president five days later , he withdrew his candidacy .
The standoff between secularists and the AKP – provoking massive demonstrations in Istanbul and Ankara – has opened the way for early general elections , from which the AKP is expected to emerge as the largest party .
Whether it will have enough support to enact constitutional reform to enable direct elections for the presidency remains to be seen .
The constitutional court had seemed to be consulting the political weather vane as closely as its law books .
The Friday before its decision , the military had taken the nation by surprise by posting on its website what amounted to an ultimatum to the government to abandon a presidential election which it said risked compromising the secular character of the republic .
The Turkish chief of staff , General Yasar Buyukanit , had already hinted at what was to come in a rare press conference in Ankara on 13 April when he said that that he hoped the next president would not simply pay lip service to Turkey ’s secular constitution but respect it to its core .
The military have always had a heavy hand in politics but it was neverlikely they would seize the radio station or put tanks on the streets .
Turkey entered its worst economic crisis since the second world war in 2001 after a minister hurled a copy of the constitution at the now outgoing president , Ahmet Necdet Sezer .
The army ’s internet memorandum did not produce panic on the same scale .
Turkey ’s financial institutions and bill of economic health have radically improved after several years of fiscal prudence under the AKP ( with direct foreign investment expected to reach $ 30 bn this year ) .
But many suspect that there would be a far worse crisis than in 2001 if the military started throwing its weight around more openly , and the military would have to take the blame for any dip in the economy .
It had been to avert just such a crisis that Erdogan had chosen not to stand as president himself .
To avoid a confrontation with his own AKP party he chose Gul , a man liked and respected abroad , rather than a figure more appealing to Turkey ’s secular elite ;
Gul ’s wife wears an Islamic headscarf , the covering which the Kemalist hardline want to see banished from public life .
There is an unpleasant irony in the military ’s resort to the worldwide web to express its views .
The internet is the medium of choice for sending messages of hate , but ultra-nationalist rhetoric has seeped into popular culture in Rambo - style films and violent television series in which Turkish commandos in Iraq pursue sadistic American killers of women and children .
To return to Hrant Dink , there is another explanation for his death that is more probable and just as worrying ; that the ultra - right in Turkey has become a collection of ideologically committed cells more inspired by a sense of malaise than ordered by any rogue intelligence officer in green - tinted glasses .
An al - Qaida - like quality of diffusion is implied .
Similar rhetoric blares from the press .
Turkey ’s most profitable newspaper , Hürriyet , has for years carried on its front page the motto “ Turkey for the Turks ” beneath a 1930s - style cameo of Ataturk ( imagine the fuss if the Frankfurter Allgemeine ran “ Deutschland für die Deutschen ” on its masthead or The Times of London printed “ Do n’t try this unless you ’re English ” on the crossword page ) .
Yet Hürriyet is Fox News - like in shameless flagwaving and was vociferous in targeting Dink .
It snidely suggested that the novelist Orhan Pamuk was sympathetic to Armenians massacred in 1915 only to ingratiate himself with the Nobel literature prize committee .
A changing mood
One of the last times I saw Dink was at Pamuk ’s trial in December 2005 , a sinister event with a phalanx of ultra-nationalist lawyers parading into the overcrowded courtroom , claiming to represent the injured party – insulted Turkishness .
They were being egged on by a noisy claque in the corridors and jeers in the street outside .
Dink , there to show solidarity , was also threatened with prosecution and it was heart - breaking to watch so generous a man , who saw the decent side of everyone , provoke so much ignorant anger from the crowd .
I think he shrugged it off .
Roughhouses are part of the job for writers in Turkey .
I was prosecuted back in 1999 for a column for a Turkish language newspaper that was deemed to be insulting to the military .
The offence carried a maximum six - year prison term and I recall the smiles and knowing pats on the back I received at a gathering of journalistic colleagues after the news broke .
And the comments .
“ Prison A is passé and besides , the food ’s better at prison B ” …
“ They ’re only trying you in the criminal court .
I was tried in the state security court ” …
The case was dropped , but by then I had been through a ritual of fraternity hazing .
A fellow American said kindly : “ I know what it ’s like to be unexpectedly rejected by a country you ’ve begun to think of as home . ”
Puffing my chest , I replied : “ You do n’t understand .
This is Turkey ’s way of embracing me as its own . ”
Even before Dink ’s death the mood had changed and although prosecutions almost never end in conviction , they have become occasions for bullies to take to the streets .
The police are defensive because of criticisms that they did nothing to protect Dink , while some might have sympathised with the motives of his killer ( there is footage of the arresting officers having themselves photographed next to him as if he were a celebrity ) .
So they now assign guards to anyone who might remotely be in the ultra- nationalists ’ sights .
A retired colonel , Fikri Karadag , told me : “ Hrant Dink had a very comfortable life here .
It was only when he started badmouthing Turkishness that he got into trouble .
He was victim of his own racism . ”
Karadag has been in the news recently after organising a nationwide patriotic league that seems more like a network of vigilantes .
Its members swear an oath upon a Qur’an and a gun ( “ It ’s only an air pistol ” ) .
It is named after the Kuvay - i Milliye ( national forces ) , local resistance units that fought against invading Greek armies after the Ottoman empire failed as a state at the end of the first world war .
Karadag and many like him would like to fight Turkey ’s 1919 - 22 war of liberation again .
Ultra-nationalist views
The enemies this time would include the US ( come to divide Turkey by creating havoc in Iraq ) , Zionists , imperialists , wealthy Turks who sell their country short then smuggle the profits abroad , Europeans talking a lot about human rights – and religious zealots with their scruffy beards and headscarved wives .
“ What happiness to the one who says ‘ I am a Turk ’ ” is the Ataturk adage posted in the Kuvay - i Milliye Association ’s HQ , but there is little that is happy about Karadag ’s vision of the world .
We briefly argued after I questioned his assertion that the Prophet Muhammad had really been a member of a Turkic tribe .
Karadag has no time for the current government , which he sees as a US ploy to promote its own brand of Muslim politics and implement its vision of a Greater Middle East .
He also felt passionately that the Iraqi city of Kirkuk has always been Turkmen and that it is being ethnically scrubbed by the US - backed Kurdish administration .
He is certain that if a “ sham ” referendum to determine its administrative status goes ahead at the end of this year , Ankara will have no option but to go to war .
Turkish elite troops have been based in the north of Iraq since before Saddam was ousted , so they wo n’t have far to go .
The temptation is to dismiss this as the posturing of a supremacist Ku Klux Klansman .
But many of these attitudes have entered the political mainstream .
Turkish hardline secularists take it for granted that the US is promoting Erdogan ’s party as a moderate model for the rest of the Islamic world – despite the AKP ’s refusal to allow the US to open a northern front from Turkish territory in the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
The AKP has also taken an independent line from Washington ( or at least one closer to the Baker - Hamilton Iraq Study Group report ) since it believes it must keep a dialogue going with Tehran and Damascus .
Erdogan recently did a little soccer diplomacy with Bashar Assad in a box at a Fenerbahçe - Al - Ittihad friendly match in Aleppo .
It ’s hard to imagine him at a Washington Nationals baseball game any time soon .
The AKP ’s reputation for economic prudence won it the support of international markets .
But it owes its popularity ( 30 - 40 % of the electorate , far more than any other party and enough under the electoral system to give it a working parliamentary majority ) , not to backing from abroad but to the inability of preceding administrations to break a cycle of incompetence and corruption .
The main opposition Republican People ’s party is a member of the Socialist International , yet it is caught up in nationalist rhetoric and its policies are less New Left than antique .
Those opposed to AKP dominance have only one weapon , the claim that they have the nation ’s true interests at heart .
The distant danger is that this will drag Turkey into a foreign adventure neither it nor the region can afford .
Closed session on Iraq
The day that Dink was buried in Istanbul , parliamentarians gathered in Ankara in a rare closed session .
The meeting was so secret that the ushers were specially appointed deaf - mutes and no stenographer making a record was allowed to stay in the chamber for more than a few minutes .
We do know the subject was Iraq , the key source of conflict between Turkey and the US and yet also the one issue on which they agree , since Ankara is afraid that Iraq will become a failed state or splinter into ethnic - based autonomous zones .
An independent Kurdish entity would fuel irredentist claims to Turkey ’s Kurdish population .
Turkey does not want the US pull out of Iraq , it wants to see US troops deal with Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) members who shelter in the north of Iraq .
The PKK ’s power to foment rebellion was much diminished after their leader Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1999 .
The US is reluctant to offend its only reliable ally in Iraq , the Iraqi Kurds , or to add to the list of enemies by going against the PKK .
Parliament would also have discussed the status of oil - rich Kirkuk .
Ankara fears that if Kirkuk opts to join the Kurdish administration , this would precipitate Iraqi Kurdish independence .
No one really expects the Turkish army to go in – but how , in such a charged atmosphere , can it beat a retreat ?
At his 13 April press conference General Buyukanit had urged the government to give him the political licence to deal with the PKK in northern Iraq .
He said , more or less , we can do it , we want to do it and we think it ’s worth the trouble , but it would have to be a political not a military decision to invade Iraq .
Even though the armed forces have in the past launched hot pursuit operations across the borders , Buyukanit believed it was now up to parliament to legitimate such an operation .
He did not mention that this diplomatic decision would require the tacit support of Turkey ’s most powerful ally , the US , whose troops are in Iraq .
The Turkish military has previously issued warnings against its government safe in the knowledge that it had the Pentagon ’s support .
This time it appeared to be telling the politicians to be wary of the US .
A more serious challenge
The more serious challenge Turkey faces is not on its borders with Iran , Iraq and Syria , but in its relationship with Europe .
Nationalism has become a potent force just when Ankara has been fighting for the right to negotiate away its sovereignty in accession talks with the European Union .
Those inside the EU who complain of the tyranny of Brussels are surprised that many Turks still think membership promises better rule .
EU accession not only appeals to the Ataturk dream of modernisation , but has an instruction manual ( the 80,000 page EU treaty , the acquis communautaire ) on how to modernise .
Just the proposal for EU membership has helped transform Turkish economy and society , but not everyone feels a beneficiary of more liberal trade and free flow of ideas .
There is a rearguard alliance of those who ’ve had enough already .
Turkish ultra-nationalists are more than Eurosceptics .
They are sceptical about the whole world .
Their watchword is that “ Turks have no friends other than themselves ” , which they try to make into a self - fulfilling prophecy .
The strategy is less to convince Turks to renounce Europe than to act in such a way , including prosecuting noted authors , that Europe will reject Turkey first , so that they can capitalise on the resultant resentment .
Many in the Brussels bureaucracy refuse to join the game but a new crop of anti-enlargement and anti-immigrant European politicians , led by French presidential candidate Nicholas Sarkozy , are willing to play .
German Christian Democrats ask in stage whispers whether Muslim Turks can ever be European in the same way that US neo - conservatives ask if Muslims can ever be democratic .
It ’s the wrong question .
It ’s not the Islamists who are scary but the nationalists .
Like the remnants of the communist parties in eastern and central Europe they mourn the passing of the cold war and fear the changes ahead .
In this Turkish election year , progress with Europe is on hold .
No Turkish politician wants to be seen to be seeking admission to a club that treats its application without enthusiasm .
The political reality is that no one in Turkey , including the military , wants to take the blame for officially scuppering the European project .
Even the far - right National Action party ceded to EU pressure in 2002 while serving in a coalition that abolished the death penalty , thus saving the life of Ocalan .
As has happened in Central Europe , the big boost to the economy is in the run-up to membership , not when the country has to abide by all those expensive rules .
The Turkish economy is mending nicely after the economic crises that helped bring the current government to power .
Foreign banks from Citicorps to Paribas are falling over themselves to grab a Turkish partner , lured by the prospect of business as this economy of more than 70 million people grows .
From their perspective Turkey is already inside the Euro- economy since Turkey has had a customs union with the EU for more than a decade and manufactured goods already go in and out duty free .
“ It would take three to four years to complete all the technical negotiations , ” said Ali Babacan , an economics minister who is in charge of talks with Brussels , although he knows that Turkey cannot enter the promised land for another decade at least .
As a politician he measures time by how often key member states have to go to the polls before it is necessary to sign off on Turkish admission .
In some countries , that would be two or three governments from now .
The mood is insecurity
Insecurity is therefore the mood in Turkey .
It was accustomed to deference during the cold war , when it bartered its strategic importance for yet another standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund which it had no intention of keeping .
I estimate that the cold war ( and its security ) ended late for Turkey , on 1 March 2003 , when it renounced its military importance as its parliament voted to refuse US troops invading Iraq access through its territory .
Europe has since turned in on itself while the US thrashes about in Iraq , with perhaps Iran and Syria next .
Turkish secularists are nervous that a new Islamic - leaning political elite may be transforming society .
The massive demonstrations by Turkish secularists , first in Ankara and then at the end of April in Istanbul , were not so much Nuremberg rallies as a show of solidarity in the face of forces they are struggling to understand .
The military chiefs who squirm at the sight of a headscarf in public life are reacting like some US colonel whose daughter ’s boyfriend has long hair .
And just like a teenager off to get a tattoo or a piercing , I am sure many wear a headscarf just to annoy .
At the same time , the Ankara and Istanbul demonstrations against the AKP ’s control of the presidency will have had a cheering effect on Turkish secularists , encouraging them not to underestimate their own strength .
Turkey consumes $ 1.5 bn dollars worth of raki ( the national tipple ) a year and even more wine and beer .
Its coastal cities rely on a summer tourist invasion of bikinied Finns , Spaniards and Czechs , with the big spenders being the Russians and the English .
There is no enthusiasm for sharia law .
There are sensible and self - critical voices .
Turkish liberals , followers of the country ’s European vocation , believers in the power of civil society to move mountains and people ’s minds , also have their battalions .
“ We realised we were not alone , ” a professor friend said as she and a hundred thousand others , maybe more , walked the route of Dink ’s cortege the day of his funeral .
There were Kurdish dissidents , trade unionists , an ordinary mother and daughter who live near me .
Why Dink ’s life provoked so spontaneous a display is hard to say .
He was respected for speaking out , and held in affection because you could see , even on television , that he spoke from the heart .
Many
Turks want to talk openly about the past and he was brave enough to engage them in that conversation .
People marched because they felt the bullies should n’t win .
There is another story , an insight into a society that even at the most painful moments tries to do the decent thing .
The father of Dink ’s young assassin recognised the wanted photo on the television news as his son .
He phoned the police .
' I was offered $ 200,000 to place bomb on Air - India flight '
Ajit Jain in Toronto | May 01 , 2007 18:33 IST
A French - Canadian , with a criminal record , has reportedly told the Air India inquiry in Ottawa that he was offered $ 200,000 to put a bomb on the Air - India flight leaving Montreal .
The man , described as ' Person 1 ' and seated behind a white sheet , told Justice John Major on Monday , his dramatic tale as to how some people approached him and offered him money and how he accepted the assignment even though he had no intention of carrying it out .
His sole objective was to gather information for the police so that lives could be saved .
He told Justice John Major , who is chairing the inquiry , he had informed the police about it , but they did not take it seriously .
One officer , according to this witness , even laughed at him , he recalled .
' When they showed me the money and the equipment , I knew they were serious , ' this witness is quoted in the Globe and Mail as saying .
' I wanted to prevent an airplane ( from ) being blown out of the sky full of people , and I am very sorry about the family of these victims .
I do not have the bombing on my conscience .
I did everything I could to prevent it .'
This testimony , along with former Vancouver Police officer Rick Crook , who told the inquiry on Monday that a man with unrelated criminal charges told him in October 1984 of a plot ' to place a bomb on an Air India plane ' in his bid to get leniency from the courts , prove that the authorities had enough warnings several months before the actual Air India tragedy on June 23 , 1985 but they were not taken seriously .
The identity of the witness who testified from behind the white sheet was not revealed even though he is otherwise known and the media was requested by the government not to identify him .
At the end of his testimony , Justice Major reportedly told this witness that while it is his right to testify anonymously , the fact that he had already told this story in public earlier , in relation to a civil suit against the Calgary police , means that his identify could surface through other means .
The hearings will continue with more former police officers appearing before the inquiry this week .
Thirty - six companies have decided to join forces in a push to extend health insurance to all Americans , The Los Angeles Times reported today .
Similar proposals have come from presidential candidates , Congress and labor groups , but this appears to be the biggest effort by corporate America so far .
Members of the coalition “ employ more than 1.7 million workers , and 18 of the companies are among the Fortune 500 ’s biggest firms , ” The Times said .
The leader of the Coalition to Advance Health Care Reform would seem an unusual choice .
As chairman and chief executive of Safeway , Steve Burd endured a strike of his union workers on the way to cutting back health care coverage in 2004 .
At that time , Mr. Burd was trying to compete with Wal - Mart and its nonunionized , far - less - insured workforce .
The results by 2006 were impressive , but he “ soon realized that corporate cost - cutting had its limits , ” Jonathan Cohn wrote in The New York Times magazine last month :
As long as there were large numbers of uninsured , Burd reasoned , there would be no solution to his company ’s — or the country ’s — problems with affordable care .
And that , he says , is when it finally dawned on him :
Maybe this was a problem the company could n’t solve on its own .
If he wanted relief from employee health costs , the government would have to help .
Indeed , Mr. Burd ’s corporate partners are in the same boat , seeking universal health care “ not so much out of social solidarity as out of financial necessity , ” Mr. Cohn said .
As he built the coalition , Mr. Burd quietly advised Senator Ron Wyden , Democrat of Oregon , on the best - known universal health care bill in Congress .
But their proposals diverge when it comes to paying for insurance for the poor ( You can read a proposal comparison here ) .
While Mr. Wyden ’s plan calls for government subsidies , Mr. Burd ’s steers “ clear of how to pay for subsidies and what requirements , if any , need to be placed on the nation ’s employers , ” The Los Angeles Times writes .
The lack of such key details raises the same questions that were raised during President Clinton ’s universal health care push during the 1990’s .
Mr. Cohn asked Jonathan Oberlander , a health - policy scholar at the University of North Carolina , about what ’s changed between now and then .
“ This is precisely the political equation the Clintons bet on , ” Mr. Oberlander responded .
“ Sorry to say this may turn out to be another mirage . ”
Imagine : there you are sitting at your shiny desk on day one of your new life as a Master of the Universe when , at the end of the office , you see your boss marching purposefully towards you with your CV in his hand .
" You lied ! " he booms , in front of all your new colleagues .
" Get your things and get out . "
And it 's only 9.30 am .
This is a scene that really happened - to a lawyer , no less - and it is one that is likely to be played out with increasing frequency as more and more of us take to lying in order to seek advancement in the face of ever tougher competition .
According to The Risk Advisory Group ( Trag ) , a consultancy which carries out pre-employment screening for some of the UK 's biggest companies , more than 50 % of all CVs contain lies of some sort , with one in five featuring whoppers such as falsified exam results and work experience .
Trag checked out CVs submitted by 3,700 applicants in 2005 and discovered discrepancies ranging from omissions about bankruptcy and county court judgments , through to downright lies about exam grades and employment histories .
Researchers even found one applicant who fabricated a degree and four years ' attendance at a prestigious university , when in fact he had attended the university 's poor relation - and failed his exams .
" We are finding more and more instances of people lying , presumably as competition for jobs increases , " says Sal Remtulla , head of employee screening at Trag .
" Sometimes you have to chuckle at their audacity in believing that no one will check them out , but it is our job to ensure they do n't slip through . "
Our disingenuous lawyer - she will only be called Melanie - would almost have slipped through the net , were it not for her greed .
" I had exaggerated one A - level grade a little but everything else on my CV was absolutely genuine , " she says .
" I was three years post - qualified , so this was my chance to earn some decent money .
On my CV I wrote details of my current position and salary , and at the last minute I decided to bump it up by £ 500 so as to get a good head start .
Well , I got the job and the rise I was hoping for , plus the £ 500 I 'd already tagged on .
What I did n't realise was that details of my salary would follow from my last employer .
My new firm was small and my senior partner was fairly hands on - he saw the details from my old firm , then pulled out my CV and I was rumbled .
" He said that if he could n't trust me with the firm 's money , how could he trust me with clients ' ?
And , of course , he was right .
I had never been so embarrassed in all my life .
And all because I lied on my CV . "
And if you cannot trust a lawyer , who can you trust ?
Well , no one , it seems .
CVs accompanying 25 % of job applications in the financial services sector apparently contain serious discrepancies .
One applicant claimed that he had worked for three months in Japan before resigning .
Further inquiries revealed that he had , in fact , been arrested and deported for shoplifting and assaulting a shop assistant .
Other applicants had lied about criminal convictions and their dates of employment .
Dates might seem trivial - mistakes are easily made - but on CVs they can take on huge significance .
" If you 've been fired by one employer , then stretching the dates of your previous employment and your subsequent job could help you cover up the bad period in the middle , " says Remtulla .
" But checks will catch you out . "
And if you lie , you might find yourself having to cover up another blank spell in your employment record , to account for a period spent as a guest of Her Majesty .
" Generally speaking , lying on your CV is n't a criminal offence , " says Raymond Jeffers , chairman of the Employment Lawyers Association .
" But once you begin obtaining money under false pretences because you have lied on your CV , then that is deception and fraud .
It is a very unwise thing to do . "
So why do so many of us do it ?
According to Dr Colin Gill , a psychologist who has conducted research into lying and the workplace , many of us want to " impression manage " potential employers ' view of us or " self - deceive " to make us feel better about ourselves .
" In a competitive world , you might want to make the most of what you have done , " he says .
" So let 's say you played rugby for the university rugby team and you once answered a letter .
Then on your CV you describe yourself as the former rugby club secretary ; that would be impression - managing .
It usually involves overegging and being economical with the truth .
" The self - deceivers are a little more troubling , because they go round making false claims that they actually believe .
Those who simply lie - people sometimes described as pathological liars in the popular press - actually suffer from pseudologia phantastica , which is a habitual compulsion to tell lies .
This is the sort of behaviour demonstrated by Jeffrey Archer when he lied on his CV .
It is very often the case that everyone knows about the lie but lets it go until the person appears to be nearing a position of power - such as when Archer stood for London mayor .
Until then , a lie on a CV does n't matter that much .
Grades can be falsified by impression - managers and self - deceivers .
The difference is a self - deceiver believes he deserved that grade .
When it becomes dangerous is when a self - deceiver actually believes he can fly a plane and sits down at the controls to fly it . "
And whether you are an impression - manager or a self - deceiver , just because you got away with it at interview and got the job , do not think that you are safe .
A retrospective check can still find you out .
Earlier this year that is exactly what happened to David Edmondson , chief executive of Radio Shack , the third - largest electronics retailer in America .
Edmondson , who was rumoured to be on a seven - figure salary , had lied when he joined the company 12 years ago about a bachelor of science degree that he falsely claimed to have earned at the Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College in California .
After being caught out , and with a due sense of understatement , Edmondson said : " I clearly misstated my academic record and the responsibility for these misstatements is mine alone . "
He was then kicked out of one of the biggest jobs in corporate America .
Following his dismissal - and with the collapse of Enron still at the centre of big - business thinking - many US businesses are checking out the CVs of all their staff .
And history has demonstrated that what happens in America today happens here tomorrow .
So you might be OK for now , but odds are that the dirty little secrets on your CV will come back to haunt you .
And in these days of easy - access electronic information , it is not so much a question of if as when that happens .

Japan revises role in WWII Okinawa / Textbooks will no longer say army ordered civilians to commit suicide as conflict ended
2007-04-01 04:00:00 PDT
Tokyo --
In another sign that Japan is pressing ahead in revising its history of World War II , new high school textbooks will no longer acknowledge that the Imperial Army was responsible for a major atrocity in Okinawa , the government announced late Friday .
The Ministry of Education ordered publishers to delete passages stating that the Imperial Army ordered civilians to commit mass suicide during the Battle of Okinawa , as the island was about to fall to American troops in the final months of the war .
The decision was announced as part of the ministry 's annual screening of all public school textbooks .
The ministry also ordered changes to other delicate issues to dovetail with government assertions , even though the screening is supposed to be free of political interference .
" I believe the screening system has been followed appropriately , " said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who has long campaigned to soften the treatment in textbooks of Japan 's wartime conduct .
The decision on the Battle of Okinawa came as a surprise because the ministry had never objected to the description in the past .
It followed recent denials by Abe that the military had coerced women into sexual slavery during the war , despite acknowledgements by previous governments that the comfort women were kidnapped and forced into military brothels .
The results of the annual textbook screening are closely watched in China , South Korea and other Asian countries .
So the fresh denial of the military 's responsibility in the Battle of Okinawa and in sexual slavery -- long accepted as historical facts -- is likely to deepen suspicions in Asia that Tokyo is trying to whitewash its militarist past .
Shortly after assuming office last fall , Abe transformed the Defense Agency into a full ministry .
He has said that his most important goal is to revise the American - imposed pacifist constitution , which forbids Japan from having a full - fledged military with offensive capabilities .
Some 200,000 Americans and Japanese died during the Battle of Okinawa , one of the most brutal clashes during the war .
It was the only battle on Japanese soil involving civilians , but Okinawa was not just any part of Japan .
Japan officially annexed Okinawa -- a kingdom that , to this day , has retained some of its own culture -- in the late 19th century .
During World War II , when many Okinawans still spoke a different dialect , Japanese troops treated the locals brutally .
In its history of the war , the Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum presents Okinawa as being caught in the fighting between America and Japan -- a starkly different view from Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine war museum , which presents Japan as a liberator of Asia from Western powers .
During the 1945 battle , during which one - quarter of the civilian population was killed , the Japanese army showed indifference to Okinawa 's defense and safety .
Japanese soldiers used civilians as shields against the Americans , and convinced locals that victorious U.S. soldiers would go on a rampage of killing and raping .
With the impending victory of U.S. troops , civilians committed mass suicide , urged on by fanatical Japanese soldiers .
" There were some people who were forced to commit suicide by the Japanese army , " one old textbook explained .
But in the revision ordered by the ministry , it now reads , " There were some people who were driven to mass suicide . "
Other changes are similar -- the change to a passive verb , the disappearance of a subject -- and combine to erase the responsibility of the Japanese military .
In explaining its policy change , the ministry said that it " is not clear that the Japanese army coerced or ordered the mass suicides . "
As with Abe 's denial regarding sexual slavery , the ministry 's new position appears to discount overwhelming evidence of coercion , particularly the testimony of victims and survivors themselves .
" There are many Okinawans who have testified that the Japanese army directed them to commit suicide , " Ryukyu Shimpo , one of the two major Okinawan newspapers , said in an angry editorial .
" There are also people who have testified that they were handed grenades by Japanese soldiers " to blow themselves up .
The editorial described the change as a politically influenced decision that " went along with the government view . "
Abe , after co-founding the Group of Young Parliamentarians Concerned About Japan 's Future and History Education in 1997 , led a campaign to reject what nationalists call a masochistic view of history that has robbed postwar Japanese of pride .
Yasuhiro Nakasone , a former prime minister who is a staunch ally of Abe 's , recently denied what he wrote in 1978 .
In a memoir about his Imperial Navy experiences in Indonesia , titled " Commander of Three Thousand Men at Age Twenty - Three , " he wrote that some of his men " started attacking local women or became addicted to gambling .
" For them , I went to great pains , and had a comfort station built , " Nakasone wrote , using the euphemism for a military brothel .
But in a meeting with foreign journalists a week ago , Nakasone , now 88 , issued a flat denial .
He said he had actually set up a " recreation center , " where his men played Japanese board games like go and shogi .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Karl Rove and dozens of other White House staffers appear to have illegally routed official e-mails through a Republican group that subsequently deleted them , a congressional report said on Monday .

By using Republican National Committee e-mail accounts for official business , senior White House aides may have broken a law requiring them to preserve presidential records , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said in an interim report .
“ This should be a matter of grave concern for anyone who values open government and the preservation of an accurate historical record , ” said committee Chairman Henry Waxman , a California Democrat .
The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires White House officials to save official correspondence .
While the White House automatically archives its e-mail the RNC typically deletes messages on its server older than 30 days , the report said .
The White House and the RNC said Waxman ’s committee was jumping to conclusions .
“ We have seen a number of times right now where people have been putting together investigations to see what sticks .
They have had very little success so far , ” White House spokesman Tony Snow said .
White House officials have for years used RNC e-mail accounts to comply with the Hatch Act , which forbids public servants from using government property to conduct political business .
At least 88 White House staffers had RNC accounts and there are signs that many of them used those accounts extensively for nonpolitical matters , the committee said .
Rove , a top political adviser to President George W. Bush , sent more than 100 e-mail messages and received more than 200 each day through his RNC account in 2007 , the report said .
More than half of the 140,000 Rove messages saved by the RNC was correspondence with other government officials , the committee said .
Most of his correspondence from Bush ’s first term has not been preserved , it said .
Rove thought his messages were being archived , his former assistant Susan Ralston told the committee .
His lawyer has said he never intentionally deleted e-mail from any accounts .
The RNC said it is still searching for the missing e-mails .
“ There is no basis for an assumption that any e-mail not already found would be of an official nature , ” RNC spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said by e-mail .
The report also points a finger at Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , currently facing pressure to resign over U.S. attorney firings that Democrats say were political in nature .
As White House counsel , Gonzales may have known that Rove and others were using RNC accounts but did nothing to stop it , the report says .
A Justice Department official referred questions to the White House .
The committee said it will investigate Gonzales ’ role further and search federal agencies for copies of the missing e-mails .
It also said it plans to subpoena Bush ’s 2004 re-election campaign for additional e-mails because the campaign has not cooperated .
A Markham man who admits he killed his 25 - year - old neighbour described himself to police as a " fringe " individual who struggled to fit in to society and suffered from a number of mental health problems .
" It 's not something I want to admit to , but that 's the way it is and it is very embarrassing and I wish it was different , " Daniel Sylvester said in a videotaped interview with police that was played for jurors yesterday .
" I 'm not someone ( who ) is compatible with most people ....
I feel very nervous and apprehensive around people , especially in large classroom settings , " Sylvester continued , explaining that he dropped out of high school because it was " too demeaning . "
In the interview with York Region police Det. Richard McViety on Sept. 20 , 2005 , Sylvester explained how he had struggled with a number of mental health problems , including depression , anxiety , attention deficit disorder and a drinking problem .
Police were called to his house once when he threatened to " blow my head off , " and he was hospitalized on another occasion because it was feared he was suicidal , he said
Sylvester , 33 , has admitted killing Ross , following a heated argument at about midnight on Aug. 16 , 2005 , in the pathway between their homes .
But he has pleaded not guilty to second - degree murder before Justice Edwin Minden in a Newmarket court .
He tried to plead guilty to manslaughter before his trial began , but his plea was rejected by Crown prosecutor Kelly Wright .
Sylvester said that during the argument with Ross , she called him a name , which made him snap .
" She insulted me and called me a loser and that 's what really got me going , " he said on the video .
Asked by McViety if he'd ever been called that name before , he responded :
" Yes , many times throughout high school and ... even grade school .
I just have social difficulties with other kids .
I have anxiety problems , " he said .
Sylvester said he had seen as many as 15 different doctors , including psychiatrists and a psychologist , for his problem but had n't sought help in the three years before Ross 's death .
He said he also tried a number of different medications including antidepressants , mood stabilizers and sedatives .
He said he had been a " borderline alcoholic , " but stopped drinking because he was afraid he'd lose his driver 's licence .
Sylvester , who said he had n't slept in two days prior to confessing to police , often appeared relaxed on the videotape , slouching in a chair , stretching his legs and clasping his hands behind his head .
But his demeanour drastically changed , when McViety asked him to pen a letter to Ross and her family .
" I do n't know what I 'd say , " he told the detective as he started sobbing uncontrollably .
" I would say I had no right to take your daughter 's life , " he cried , turning away from the detective and facing a wall .
Through his tears , he wrote a two - sentence note to Ross 's family : " I am beyond words .
I cannot possible express how sorry I am for what I have ( done ) . "
Ross 's mother , Sharon Fortis , sat in the second row of the courtroom , tightly clutching a wad of tissues in her hand .
She removed her glasses during the video and wiped away tears .
Tears also welled in the eyes of a female juror .
Sylvester 's mother , Olga , sat in the back row of the courtroom clutching her rosary .
Sylvester appeared unemotional as he watched the tape from the prisoner 's box .
McViety left the interview room , but the tape was still rolling .
Sylvester could barely be heard talking to himself :
" I should never have been born .
...
Nice going a -- hole .
Way to make your mother proud .
Real credit to your family .
You never should have been f--- ing born .
Oh my God . "
Earlier in the tape , Sylvester said he regretted the grief he had caused his mother .
" I told her that ... I 'd never do this to hurt you , I 'd never put you in this position .
All the shame and humiliation you 're going to have to bear being associated with me , " he said .
" I do n't know what this is going to do with the press .
You know that she does n't need that .
( She 's ) 71 , " he continued .
Asked why he confessed , Sylvester told the officer it was his conscience :
" Guilt and stress .
...
The fact that I did n't want to keep it on my chest anymore .
... I was depressed .
...
The stress from the potential polygraph .
You know , the fact that I took a life . "
The trial continues .
DIGG THIS
In the words of Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of the group Rush :
I get up at seven , yeah And I go to work at nine I got no time for livin ’
Yeah , I ’m workin ’ all the time
It seems to me I could live my life A lot better than I think I am I guess that ’s why they call me , They call me the workin’ man
How can the " workin ’ man " make life " a lot better " for himself ?
One essential way is to stay out of debt , cut back on things that are not essential , and save .
After building up a nestegg , one can borrow from it and repay one ’s own account with interest .
One can pay oneself interest rather than pay a bank or finance company .
But this article points out a societal affliction that affects all working Americans , namely , the Federal government .
The song suggests the working man yearns to " live his life " in his own way and ca n’t seem to , but this affliction mirrors our beliefs , values , and assent , to some extent .
If working Americans make our government , then to unmake it , we will not only have to stop listening to and believing the tall tales of the masters at all levels of government , we will have to support a different form of government .
Sound unreal ?
It is n’t , not in the long run .
Getting where we are took a long time .
The government changed a lot just in the last 50 years , and we will not be locked into the current position forever either .
Who gets the $ 17,430 ?
Directly and indirectly , $ 17,430 is what the Federal government takes each year , on average , from each American who works , not to mention the big chunk out of their lives taken through regulation .
Who gets this $ 17,430 after it is extracted from working men and women ?
$ 3,690 goes to people on Social Security and Disability .
$ 3,492 goes to people in war industries .
$ 2,166 goes to people on Medicare .
$ 1,767 goes to people on Medicaid .
$ 1,505 goes to people on food stamps , welfare ( assistance ) , housing , and income payments .
$ 1,297 goes to lenders for interest .
$ 1,028 goes to people in transportation , environmental , space , science , and regional building industries .
$ 708 goes to Federal employees for their retirement .
$ 688 goes to people in educational industries .
$ 495 goes to veterans .
$ 402 goes to people in the Federal government for their services .
$ 244 goes to people overseas .
$ 187 goes to people in agricultural industries .
The figures add to $ 17,669 because , for one thing , the government borrows more than it takes in .
In addition , deciphering and reconciling the government ’s various publications and categories introduce fuzziness into the numbers .
Since the numbers apply to the average employed person at all income levels , they do n’t apply to every individual .
Yet they do apply to all of us as a group .
Is everybody happy ?
The numbers , while not 100 percent accurate , are good enough to suggest that most of the taxes paid do not come back to the men and women who work .
Most of the spending does not benefit them even indirectly .
How many taxpayers would choose this pattern of spending on their own ?
How many would tax and mortgage themselves heavily in order to support each of these expenditures ?
Obviously working Americans do not get their money ’s worth .
Both political parties go after their votes , but neither one delivers or can deliver what Americans individually value .
Such a thing is impossible when money is pooled and spent by Congress via a complex political process of influence - peddling , logrolling , haggling , and power .
In some fashion , working Americans have cast their votes for this pattern of spending , imposing a large collective spending pattern on themselves .
In some fashion , they have endorsed the outcome .
But it is nave to conclude that the result is what Americans 100 percent want or deserve , if only because the current generation did not construct this system , which we all know to be hard to change , and the results are subject to interest group politics and the whims of politicians .
No matter how we got here or how much we like or dislike the result , we need to ask several questions .
Is our governmental system a proper and morally right way to build a just and healthy society ?
Are we behaving properly toward each other in the relations we have through our governing system ?
Is our system of government itself responsible for many of our societal ills ?
Does an ill - formed government and an unhealthy society reflect our own mistaken philosophies ?
And finally , as Ted Lewis used to ask , " Is everybody happy ? "
The biggest hands in the till
Each working man or woman is on average forced to pay $ 3,690 to Social Security and Disability payments .
This money is lost to them .
There is no bank account or trust fund that holds this money or invests it for anyone ’s retirement .
The current retirees get all the money and always have .
It goes out as fast as it comes in .
And why should these retirees get this money ?
By what right ?
They should have provided for their own retirement , not forced it out of each other and their sons and daughters collectively .
Moral obligations to parents , the needy , the unfortunate , and the elderly should be met with compassion by each of us .
They should not be enforced by the state ’s sword .
Out of every 10 people in the U.S. , about 4.75 work and 1.25 are of age 65 or older .
This means there are 3.8 workers for each retiree ( 4.75/1.25 = 3.8 ) .
These 3.8 workers are made to pay $ 3,690 each to support one retiree .
That retiree receives a little over $ 14,000 a year .
This so - called entitlement is disguised bondage for the payers .
Today ’s working man will not receive his Social Security payments until taxes are extracted from the next following several generations of workers , of which there are fewer and fewer compared to the number of retirees .
Which is more secure , saving for your own retirement in a stable currency , or depending on the government to collect a constantly depreciating money for you from a decreasing pool of workers ?
How does it feel to need retirement money and to know that you cannot get it unless you pick the pockets of those still working ?
Is this what freedom means ?
Is this an example of liberty and justice for all ?
Is everybody happy with the Pentagon taking $ 3,492 a year ?
The money goes mainly to pay servicemen ( our own and foreign ) , to pay for training soldiers ( our own and foreign ) , to pay for aid and rebuilding of foreign countries we have wrecked , to pay military contractors for weapons , bases , and weapons development , and to pay for all the other expenses of foreign wars such as transportation , communications , vehicles , maintenance , supplies , and intelligence .
Much of the working man ’s money going to war industries is spent in habitual foreign adventures such as Korea , Vietnam , Afghanistan , Kosova , Somalia , and Iraq .
Both parties plan more such wars .
How much of defense spending is sheer waste ?
We are , after all , supposed to be buying defense , not war amusements .
How is it that dozens of countries in the world spend less than $ 100 per citizen for military spending while the U.S. spends over $ 1,600 per person ?
Canada spends less than $ 300 per person .
Mexico spends less than $ 50 per person .
They are no less secure against invasion than we are .
In fact , they are more secure .
Terrorists are not threatening Mexico or Chile with nuclear and biological catastrophes .
They are n’t busy abrogating rights in order to save them .
Does militarism make us happy ?
Why do we build up the military and go to war so often ?
I can only theorize .
Wealth is a necessary condition .
Is it sufficient ?
Do most wealthy nations go through a stage of empire and expansion ?
The ability of the Federal government to tax us almost at will and collect the money is a necessary condition .
Is militarism a cultural habit ?
By now , war has become entrenched in the American way of life and thought .
Every so often we go on the wagon , but then we fall right off again .
I think that we were set on a course of empire and expansion at the time the Constitution was adopted .
The Founding Fathers spoke of empire and expansion .
They wanted to clear the continent of foreign powers .
They foresaw American growth and might .
By 1865 , once the Federal government ruled supreme over the states , the way was clear for a continental empire .
Then manifest destiny was not enough .
By 1898 we kept going , beyond the seas that border us .
At that point , I think we accepted militarism because war industries lobbied Congress , because military interests lobbied Congress , because commercial and banking interests benefited from war , and because influential intellectuals and powerful Americans believed in war and took us into wars .
They still do .
Americans at large have been prone to war fever , fears and insecurity , paranoia , and appeals to idealism .
The average American has had an excess of patriotism and credulously swallowed the propaganda put out by the war interests .
We are now militaristic because we want to be .
We think it ’s our turn to lead the world , that it ’s our responsibility .
We mistakenly think that militarism is the right way to lead the world when our own history shows that freedom , free and open markets , property rights , biblical ethics , and the rule of a limited law were the keys to our earlier successes .
Most of the items on the list of government spending categories did not even exist during the period when America ’s standards of living rose most rapidly , and those that did were trivial in amount .
It was no coincidence that at that time the currency was stable in value , and both taxes and debt were low .
If we ’re now happy with our state of affairs , if this is what we now want , then we need our heads examined .
Given the dismal plight of psychiatry , we ca n’t look for a cure in that direction .
A new drug wo n’t bring down excessive fears of Islamo - Fascism , hubris , or war fever .
It wo n’t cure interest groups .
It wo n’t cure the wrong ethics that are now built into our public lives .
The social spending pit
Medicare , Medicaid , and welfare spending make for a very deep and ravenous pit that can absorb any amount of spending we might toss in without its ever getting filled up .
Medicare pays out money to the elderly who use medical services .
In order to pay the medical expenses of the soon - to - retire baby boom generation , working people will soon have to pay roughly 4 to 5 times as much as they are now paying .
They will have to pay $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 a year per worker .
This , of course , is prohibitive and wo n’t happen .
Instead , the government will raise the Medicare taxes somewhat , raise the elderly ’s payments , cut their benefits , borrow more if it can , raise other taxes , and cut other programs .
This will begin to happen in about 5 years , creating political turmoil .
The effects on both health care and American wealth will not be pretty , but there are some mules that need to be hit over the head with a plank .
Merle Haggard ’s Working Man Blues said
" Hey hey , the working man , the working man like me I ain’t never been on welfare , that ’s one place I wo n’t be "
Not everyone is singing this song .
The infamous welfare payments that President Clinton supposedly reformed have not gone away .
The government budget categories now roll up a variety of programs such as Medicaid , food stamps , housing programs , family assistance , and SSI into the terms " health security " and " income security . "
The war on poverty has not yet been won and ca n’t be won .
There are some problems that not only eat money , they thrive on it .
Although plenty of articles have been written that have proven beyond any doubt that the war on poverty is and was a gigantic mistake , this conclusion has not yet penetrated the broad American consciousness .
A new generation of Republicans has joined Democrats in perpetuating this war .
Both are busy extending it domestically and overseas .
One driving force behind this continued push are the American universities that graduate thousands and thousands of ready - made civil service and social workers annually .
They people the departments involved with human resources , psychology , education , health , the aged , children and families , birth control , etc .
They provide an intellectual background and support for social spending that permeates society .
This leads me to …
The con and Social Fascism
We are entering a truly horrible age when government through social technocrats aims to control the population from birth to death .
We are seeing technocrats attempt to remold the human mind and control it from an early age .
Ritalin is symbolic of this effort , as is the diagnosis that 3 — 7 percent of young children should take this drug .
The age of Social Fascism is upon us .
The general ploy or stratagem by which the social fascists are extending their hold over Americans is simple .
They tell us we are sick and that we need their help .
They then offer the help we think we need and we accept it .
But this is not done in a free market .
The control is insinuated via government policies , directives , rules , monies , and power .
It is also done gradually .
It is done in nice - sounding phrases that do not appear to threaten anyone .
The very opposite — they are designed to comfort and they promise alleviation of ills .
For example , here is a quote from the website of the National Association of Social Workers : " Nearly 50 % of the U.S. population , ages 15 to 54 , report having a least one psychiatric disorder .
Both severe and persistent mental disorders , including addictions , can have profound consequences for individuals , their families , and society , affecting their ability to learn , to grow into healthy adults , to nurture children , to work , to secure housing , and to engage in other routines of living .
Recognizing the prevalence of mental disorders and the costs they exact from society , social workers provide more than 40 % of all mental health services available to Americans . "
The social workers think nothing of telling us that half of us are mentally ill !
Preposterous !
They control the definition of psychiatric disorder , you see , and they write the prescriptions .
Of course , they stand ready to rescue us from our inept methods of coping with modern life .
This con game is a standard government trick .
It is always the same .
" The elderly are starving in the streets .
We will solve that problem for you at a very low cost .
We will give you Social Security . "
" The poor are suffering every social ill imaginable .
We will raise them up .
You will not have to worry about them rioting or spreading disease .
We will give you a war on poverty . "
" The Islamo - Fascists are out to destroy the free world .
They hate us .
We will save you .
We will give you Homeland Security .
We will give you a war on terrorism . "
Is everybody happy ?
Of course not .
You have problems .
I have problems .
If we do not have problems , no matter .
The social fascists will inform you that you do have problems .
And then they ’ll tell you they can solve them for you .
Expanding government relies upon a basic confidence game .
W.C. Fields ( who created Larsen E. Whipsnade ) said " You ca n’t cheat an honest man . "
It takes two to tango , the government and the obliging public .
The same thing goes on in the free market , but we have a far easier time of it extricating ourselves from our mistakes .
And knowing this and that they face competition and can’t force us into anything , businesses behave better .
They simply cannot tie us up the way government can with its ability to make law .
The rest of the list
The U.S. has already wasted ( spent ) huge amounts of money that it borrowed in the past rather than taxed .
It must now tax working Americans to pay the interest on that debt the government signed off on .
The taxes to pay interest amount at present to $ 1,297 a year per worker .
It will keep rising as long as the government keeps running deficits .
If the borrowed money had been spent on goods that benefited those who are now paying the interest , the borrowing would have had at least a chance at being fair .
But when generations borrow money and spend it on fruitless projects , leaving their children and grandchildren to pay the interest on the debt , they behave immorally .
Apart from payments to veterans , a form of military spending , the remaining items on the list are in two categories .
One is aid ( pay ) to government workers and the other is aid to dependent industries .
The government workers get a substantial $ 1,110 .
The dependent industries snare a total of $ 2,147 .
These industries include education , agriculture , technology , foreign governments , transportation , space , etc .
Their receipts are sold to the public as essential projects or investments or infrastructure .
Each industry puts out a steady stream of propaganda about how we need them .
Farmers tell us we ’d starve if they did n’t get subsidies .
Teachers tell us more and more money is needed for education or else our children will be dolts .
Are these the same con games ?
Yes .
Are Americans gullible and fooled ?
Yes .
In reality , all this spending adds up to a great big pork barrel .
Conclusion
Working Americans should stop permitting the Federal government to take an average of $ 17,430 a year from them .
We allow a big Federal government because we accept a national ethics that many , I would hope most , of us would never permit in our personal relationships .
We allow a big Federal government because we have inherited it and a system that permits it , but also because we have augmented it and cheered on its augmentation .
We allow a big Federal government because we foolishly and greedily accept the confidence man ’s story that we need his help and he ’ll give it to us for nothing .
We do nothing about the problem of big government because we feel helpless to change the system .
We are not helpless .
We have to recognize that major changes take time .
Just as charity begins at home , so does reform .
We cannot rearrange our governmental structure until we clearly understand that it is ethically flawed .
We need to understand why it is flawed .
We need to teach coming generations , one person at a time , the proper ethics to build a society upon .
A few souls can make a large difference .
In time as attitudes change , we and they will find ways to change government .
Time is short , however .
Changes are going to be thrust upon Americans discontinuously .
The system is going to be shaken suddenly and severely at some points .
We will be given opportunities at those times , forks in the road .
The correct choices at those times should be sound biblically - based law and ethics , free markets including the market for money , respect for property rights , and a sharply decreased role of governments accompanied by a maximum of decentralized self - government .
If none of this seems realistic at present , we need to make it realistic , for consider the alternative .
If Americans instead choose enhanced Federal power , more regulations and taxes , emergency powers , capital and currency controls , and other such draconian measures , then this nation will start to come apart at the seams even as it is transformed further into a totalitarian nightmare .
More repression will bring armed rebellions and uprisings .
History shows that such uprisings usually fail , are put down bloodily , and lead to even more repression .

Or what to do if your Python programs complain they can’t output a string because of encoding problems .
Like this :
>>> print u'\ \N{left - pointing double angle quotation mark} '
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > UnicodeEncodeError : ' ascii ' codec can't encode character u'\\xab ' in position 0 : ordinal not in range ( 128 )
It ca n’t perform the output because sys.stdout .
encoding is ‘ ascii ’ and the ascii encoding can’t encoding that weird unicode character .
I think I approve of this strict approach .
It encourages explicitness and The Right Thing .
Okay .
But in this instance I know what I ’m doing and I want stdout to be treated as if it uses the UTF - 8 encoding .
It turns out that Python picks the value for sys.stdout .
encoding based on the value of the environment variable LC_CTYPE , so the following works :
$ LC_CTYPE=en_GB.utf -8 python >>> print u'\ \N{left - pointing double angle quotation mark} ' «
It even prints out the right character .
BUT WHERE THE HELL IS THIS DOCUMENTED ?

Buried deposits of greenhouse gases may be more unstable than thought .
Bubbling up : shallow deposits of methane ice could release greenhouse gas more easily .
Alamy
Geologists have discovered underwater deposits of hydrates — icy deposits of frozen methane gas — at far shallower depths under the ocean floor than expected .
The finding suggests that , in a globally warmed world , the hydrates could melt suddenly and release their gas into the atmosphere , thus warming the planet even more .
Hydrates are cage - like structures in which molecules of water surround frozen molecules of gas .
When dug up and brought to the surface , they release fizzy bubbles of methane into the atmosphere .
As a greenhouse gas , methane has 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
Large amounts of the world 's carbon is locked up in methane hydrates , both in polar permafrost regions and buried in marine sediments worldwide .
So scientists have long worried about a potentially catastrophic melting of these hydrates , triggered by an underwater landslide or warming of the ocean waters above them , that could send temperatures soaring .
Some researchers have suggested that a great global - warming episode 55 million years ago could have been caused by a catastrophic release of methane hydrates from the sea floor .
Shallow grave
The deeper the hydrates lie , the greater the pressure above them , and the less likely they are to destablise and release gas .
But now , scientists drilling into the ocean floor have found hydrates off the coast of Vancouver Island , Canada , just 60 to 120 metres under the sea floor .
That 's less than half the depth they are typically predicted to exist at , given basic equations about the temperatures and pressures under which hydrates are usually stable .
Read Alexandra
Witze 's daily notes from the AGU meeting on our reports / american geophysical_union / " > newsblog .
" This methane can potentially release quickly , in geologic terms .
Not in our lifetime , but definitely faster than people had predicted earlier , " says Michael Riedel of McGill University in Montreal , who co-led the 2005 expedition that uncovered the shallow hydrates .
Core surprise
The scientists made the discovery last year , while working through the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program to explore the coast off Vancouver Island , where hydrates had been found before .
To their surprise , the five cores they drilled , down to 350 metres depth , contained hydrates very near the surface and distributed across a wide area .
Hydrates have been found to occur at shallow depts to a limited extent , even outcropping on the sea floor in isolated spots thanks to unusual local conditions .
But the new work indicates that hydrates can be stable in larger swaths , over larger areas , than known before .
ADVERTISEMENT
Geologists may now have to recalculate just how much hydrate exists in the world , says Riedel , who presented the results at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco this week .
Not everyone sees hydrates as a threat .
Oil companies , for instance , have long talked of harvesting them as an energy resource .
India and Japan have initiated hydrate exploration programmes , says Timothy Collett of the US Geological Survey in Denver , Colorado .
And on Alaska 's North Slope , the oil company BP will be drilling a test well in February to explore the feasibility of mining hydrates for energy .

JAMES HARRIS : This is Truthdig .
James Harris sitting down with Josh Scheer , and on the phone we have a special guest .
She is a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel , formerly working for the Pentagon , The National Security Agency .
Needless to say , she knows a lot about intel and a lot about what took place and what went on before we went into Iraq and what went on with that intel .
Many questions have been asked in recent weeks , obviously in recent years about what we knew , what was fabricated , what was made up .
On the phone we have somebody who has been vociferous in her effort to out the wrongdoings of people like Douglas Feith and people like Donald Rumsfeld .
So , Karen Kwiatkowski , welcome to Truthdig .
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
Thanks for having me .
JAMES HARRIS : It ’s our pleasure .
I want to start , not talking about Douglas Feith , but I want to get your opinion about Iraq .
We know that British troops and Tony Blair have decided that they ’re out .
We ’ve seen the commitment of other nations drop by 17 countries and our biggest partner , England , is now out .
Why do you think they ’re out and Bush is still in ?
Well we know why Bush is still in .
Why now ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
It is towards the end of Tony Blair ’s long , long term of duty there as the Prime Minister .
And the other thing is , the British very much oppose , in spite of the fact that there are some Rupert Murdoch newspapers in Great Britain , some conservative papers , pseudo conservative I should say , not truly conservative .
Truly conservatives , true conservatives have opposed this adventure from the beginning .
But in spite of the small , loud pro-war faction in London , most people in Britain recognize this for what it is .
They have some experience in this kind of thing with , both in Middle East , particularly in Iraq years ago when they left in dishonor .
Another time when they tried to occupy Baghdad , years and years ago , and also their experience with terrorism and movements of independents or what have you with Ireland , much more recent memory for many of the people in Great Britain .
I do n’t think Britain ’s economy can afford it .
Certainly they see the writing on the all , why get , why not get out now while George Bush is still there than be stuck with , stuck holding the bag when a Democratic president takes over and pulls the troops out abruptly in 2008 , 2009 .
So I think there ’s many reasons why they ’re doing it .
Some people say it is , it is because of Tony Blair ’s concern over his legacy .
If he does n’t bring the troops home , his legacy will be that he left Britain in a quagmire .
They are in a quagmire now and maybe he does n’t want to leave office with that being on his record , a lot of reasons .
Mainly it ’s the right thing to do , the people of Britain want those troops home .
And I guess their government is listening .
Unlike ours .
JAMES HARRIS :
The highly speculative people have said they ’re out because we ’re going into Iran .
You might ’ve read the news …
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
Well yeah , I do n’t …
I had not seen that connection made , but I certainly am alarmed at the daily signs that indeed this country is getting ready to instigate an attack on Iran .
All the signs are there , the suggestions that Iranian bombs are killing American soldiers , that ’s not true , but it ’s certainly been made in , I think every American newspaper , the suggestion that Iran is somehow killing Americans .
The suggestion that Iran has nuclear weapons , is imminently close to nuclear weapons .
That is not true but that ’s been , those claims are made , even by this Administration .
The idea that we have two carrier battle groups currently in the region and in fact I just saw today , Admiral Walsh , one of the big guys in the Navy said that we ’re very concerned about what Iran is doing even more so than Al Qaeda .
So there , all the signs are there that we are being , we ’re going to wake up one morning soon , very soon , and we will be at war with Iran .
We will have bombed them in some sort of shock and awe campaign destroying many lives and setting back US relations even further than we ’ve already done it with Iraq .
JOSH SCHEER : I want to continue on Iran .
You spent obviously many years in the military and you talk in those kind of terms that many people maybe not know about .
Can we not just politically , and not just in the region , but can we support another war in another country ?
Right now we ’re in Afghanistan , we ’re in Iraq .
Can we feasibly actually go into Iran , or is this going to be a shock and awe campaign ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
You know , I think the , one of the big reasons that Bush and Cheney think they can do Iran is that they believe , well , they ’re hearing from the Air Force and the Navy , two of the three main branches of our military , the two that have been left out of the glory of Iraq , you see .
And those guys want a piece of the action , and so they ’re advertising to the Administration and publicly , I mean you can read it for yourself , the Air Force and the Navy have targets they believe they can overwhelmingly hit their targets , deep penetration , possibly nuclear weapons , I mean , nothing is off the table as Dick Cheney says “ nothing is off the table . ”
And the delivery of these weapons , whether they ’re conventional or nuclear will be naval and Air Force .
They ’ll be Navy from the sea and Air Force form long range bombers and some of the bases that we have around the… so I do n’t think , certainly , I do n’t know , I ’m not in the Army , was n’t in the Army , I was in the Air Force , I do n’t think the Army could support any type of invasion of Iran and they would n’t ’ want to .
I ’m sure that they ’ve , they ’ve had enough with Iraq and our reserves are in terrible condition .
We ’ve got huge problems in the Army and in the Reserve system .
So I do n’t think there ’s any intention to go into Iran , but simply to destroy it and to create havoc and disruption and humanitarian crisis and topple perhaps the government of Ahmadinejad .
We want to topple that government .
Yeah , we ’ll do it with bombs from a distance .
I do n’t know if you call that shock and awe , we ’ve been advertising it for a long , long time .
It will not be a surprise to the Iranians if we do it .
JAMES HARRIS :
That was your former boss , the shock and awe campaign .
I ’m still shocked and I ’m awed .
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : [ laughs ]
He shocked and awed all of us .
JAMES HARRIS :
As a means of understanding the level of deceit that you claim took place and I agree took place before the war .
Because it , the things that are going on in and around Iran sound a lot like the things that went on in 2002 …
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : Sure do .
JAMES HARRIS : And I always note Scott Ritter , because I spoke to him , and I could n’t believe that we did n’t take the advice of people like him that were saying that there ’s nothing there , there ’s nothing .
Can you describe for us a typical day , if we went in around March , we ’re approaching that anniversary , we went in around March of ’03 .
What was it like in The Pentagon ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
Well , I worked in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and up until mid February I was in Near East South Asia , which is the office that owns the Office of Special Plans , they were our sister office .
And so Iraq is one of the areas .
And there ’s a great degree of excitement , there ’s a , we did n’t know when we would invade Iraq , and many people thought it would be in February , late February , early March and it actually was like I think march 23 is when we actually conducted that attack on Baghdad and that kind of thing .
Most people in the Pentagon , there ’s 23,000 people work in the Pentagon .
Most of those people were as in the dark as any of the Americans .
They believed what they read in the papers , and what they read in the papers , particularly The New York Times and The Washington Post had been , for the most part , planted by The Administration .
We know this now , the whole Congress knows this now , they ’ve had a number of hearings publicly faltered , I think even the DODIG [ Department of Defense Inspector General ] just recently faltered , Doug Feith and his whole organization for planting and providing misleading stories , many of which were later leaked on purpose to the press .
A friendly press , of course , Judith Miller was not hostile to the intentions of this administration .
They wanted to go into Iraq , and they intended to go into Iraq .
We did go into Iraq , and all that was really needed was to bring onboard the American people , and to bring onboard the Congress .
But not necessarily to declare war .
Congress has never been asked to declare war on Iraq .
And they wo n’t be asked to declare war on Iran even though we will conduct that war .
These guys had an agenda .
In fact , one of the things that I did learn as a result of having my eyes opened in that final tour in the Pentagon is that neo -conservatives , their foreign policy is very activist , you could say that ’s a nice way to say it , very activist , it ’s very oriented towards the Untied States as a benevolent dictator , a benevolent guiding hand for the world , particularly the Middle East .
And it ’s very much a pro-Israel policy , and it ’s a policy that says , we should be able to do whatever we want to do , if we see it in our interest .
Now , Americans do n’t see any value , most Americans , 75 percent of Americans want the troops home now .
They do n’t see any value to having our troops in Iraq .
They did n’t see any value in that in 2002 .
But , they had a story sold to them , which was of course that Saddam Hussein somehow was involved with 9/11 , had WMDs , and was a serious threat , an imminent threat , a grave threat to the United States .
JAMES HARRIS :
For those people that think somehow that government officials , even though you work for the government , were complicit in this effort to move into Iraq .
I want you to be clear , as a worker there , you were doing what you thought was right at the time .
Is that a safe thing to say ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
We were doing , I ’ll tell ya , there ’s two parts of how the story is sold , how the propaganda was put forth on the American people , and how it ’s been put forth on them today in terms of Iran .
You have political appointees in every government agency , and they switch out every time you get a new president , and that ’s totally normal .
Usually those , the numbers increase after every president , they always get a few more .
So Bush was no different .
He brought in a number of political appointees : Doug Feith , certainly Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz .
But also a number of political appointees at what you would call a lower level , like my level – Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel level .
And they ’re not military officers , they ’re civilians .
And they ’re brought in , and this is where the propaganda was kind of put together , this is where the so - called alternative intelligence assessments were put together by the civilian appointees of the Bush Administration .
Most of which , in fact , probably all of the Pentagon shared a neo -conservative world vision , which has a particular role for us , and that included the topping of Saddam Hussein , and it includes the toppling of the leadership in Tehran .
These guys are the ones doing it , they ’re doing it .
They ’re putting all the propaganda , they ’re spreading stories , planting stuff in the media .
They ’re doing that to people in The Pentagon , the Civil Service core in The Pentagon , which is about half of them , and the other half which are uniformed military officers serving anywhere from three to four , five years , sometimes tours in The Pentagon .
We ’re looking at regular intel , we ’re looking at the stuff the CIA and the DIA , Defense Intelligence Agency produces .
And that stuff never said , that stuff never said Saddam Hussein had WMDs , had a delivery system , was a threat to the United States .
It never said that Saddam Hussein had anything to do with 9/11 or that Saddam Hussein worked with Al Qaeda .
That intelligence never said that .
JAMES HARRIS : Did they tell you to shut up ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : Absolutely ! [ Laughs ]
That ’s a funny thing , and of course , here ’s how it worked .
Once the Office of Special Plans was set up formally , now they were informally set up prior to the fall of 2002 , but formally they became an office with office space and that whole bit .
And the first act to follow that setup of the Office of Special Plans , we had a staff meeting , and our boss , Bill Ludy , who was the boss of Special Plans technically , not in reality but on paper .
And he announced to us that from now on , action officers , staff officers such as myself and all my peers , at least in that office , and I presume this went all the way through the rest of policy , but we were told that when we needed to fill in data , putting it in papers that we would send up , doing our job , as we did our daily job , we were no longer to look at CIA and DIA intelligence , we were simply to call the Office of Special Plans and they would send down to us talking points , which we would incorporate verbatim no deletions , no additions , no modifications into every paper that we did .
And of course , that was very unusual and all the action officers are looking at each other like , well that ’s interesting .
We ’re not to look at the intelligence any more , we ’re simply to go to this group of political appointees and they will provide to us word for word what we should say about Iraq , about WMD and about terrorism .
And this is exactly what our orders were .
And there were people [ Laughs ] a couple of people , and I have to say , I was not one of these people who said , “ you know , I ’m not gonna do that , I ’m not gonna do that because there ’s something I do n’t like about it , it ’s incorrect in some way . ”
And they experimented with sending up papers that did not follow those instructions , and those papers were 100 percent of the time returned back for correction .
So we were n’t allowed to put out anything except what Office of Special Plans was producing for us .
And that was only partially based on intelligence , and partially based on a political agenda .
So this is how they did it .
And I ’ll tell you what , civil servants and military people , we follow orders , okay .
And we buy into it .
And we do n’t suspect that our leaders are nefarious , we do n’t suspect that .
They , they quite frankly have to go a long way to prove to us that they are nefarious .
That ’s how it worked , and I imagine it ’s working much the same way there in terms of Iran .
JOSH SCHEER : Obviously you ’ve been in the military for quite a while .
Has this every happened to your knowledge in any other [ administration ’s ]
Pentagon , where political appointees have the power to just control the …
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : Sure , well sure , Vietnam is filled with examples .
And Daniel Ellsberg ’s information and his Pentagon paper that he released factual information that contradicted what political appointees at the top of the Pentagon were saying to Congress and saying to the American people .
Yeah , this is typical of how it works .
Now , having said that , most people who serve and wear the uniform or give a career of service to the military , whether civilian , civil service or military , we do n’t think that our bosses will do that .
We do n’t think that our military will do that .
But in fact history is full of examples of bald - faced lies being told to sell particular agendas .
Often times those agendas include war making , certainly in Vietnam they did , under LBJ and a few other presidents .
Look at the thing that Reagan did .
I mean , I actually do n’t dislike Reagan , he deployed very few troops overseas , but when he went in to that little island down there … what is the name of that island that he invaded , Grenada .
[ Laughs ]
Remember that ?
Remember the Invasion of Grenada .
JOSH SCHEER : All eight hours ?
JAMES HARRIS :
It was a short one .
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : I mean , God , shortly thereafter , come to find out , well actually , some of the stuff they said about the threat and the Cubans and all that was n’t really true .
So politicians and their politically appointed military leaders will lie , historically do lie when it has to do with making war , particularly making a war that they want .
And what has happened in the Bush Administration is the war that they want was Iraq .
And the war that they want is Iran , and the war that they want is Syria , okay ?
That ’s the war they want .
They do n’t want Vietnam .
I do n’t know why , they do n’t want Vietnam , they want these places , this is what the neo-conservatives are particularly interested in .
So we have war .
And they make up stories and we ’re seeing the exact same thing in terms of Iran , which is quite alarming because it seems as if we ca n’t stop this , we ca n’t prevent this .
JOSH SCHEER :
You were talking about these political appointees and pushing us into war .
Why have n’t people like Paul Wolfowitz , I mean these guys seem to feather their own nests .
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : [ Laughs ]
That ’s an understatement .
JOSH SCHEER : They lead us into war , Mark Zell , Doug Feith ’s partner was in bed with Chalabi .
It falls apart and then it seems that these guys disappear into the woodwork .
What happens ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
Well , a big part of what happens is these guys have top cover , the names of the top cover are Dick Cheney and George W. Bush .
These guys like what Wolfowitz has done .
And here ’s the other thing .
While we as American citizens do not like being lied to , particularly being lied to into a stupid quagmire that makes no sense .
We do n’t ’ like being lied to .
Congress does n’t like being lied to .
However , many in Congress , and certainly in this administration agree , and this is Democrats and Republicans , like the idea that we have gone into Iraq , we have built four mega bases , they are complete .
Most of the money we gave to Halliburton was for construction and completion of these bases .
We have probably , of the 150,000 , 160,000 troops we have in Iraq probably 110,000 of those folks are associated with one of those four mega bases .
Safely ensconced behind acres and acres of concrete .
To operate there indefinitely , no matter what happens in Baghdad , no matter who takes over , no matter if the country splits into three pieces or it stays one .
No matter what happens , we have those mega bases , and there ’s many in Congress and certainly in this administration , Republican and Democrat alike that really like that .
Part of the reason I think that we went into Iraq was to reestablish a stronger foothold than we had in Saudi Arabia , but also a more economical , a more flexible , in terms of who we want to hit .
If you want to hit Syria , can you do it from Iraq ?
Of course you can .
And now you can do it from bases that will support any type of airplane you want , any number of troops in barracks .
I mean we can do things from Iraq .
And this is what they wanted .
So , yeah , we do n’t like being lied to .
But quite frankly , many people in the Congress , and certainly this administration , when they call Iraq a success , they mean it , and this is why .
We ’re in Iraq to stay .
And can we strike Iran from Iraq ?
Well , I do n’t know if we ’ll do that next week , but we can .
JAMES HARRIS :
We ’re there to stay in the sense that even , let ’s say somebody takes office in ‘ o8 , do you think that we ’re gonna be occupying those bases still ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : Absolutely !
And we do n’t even have status of forces agreements with any legitimate government in Iraq to support those bases .
They are illegal bases , okay .
But yes , they ’re gonna stay , absolutely , they ’re gonna stay .
And I ’ll tell you , there are guys that have been with this administration for awhile , people , in fact one of the guys was an Air Force General that was involved with the Kurds ten years ago , he ’s retired now , but he was actually the guy , his name escapes me for the moment , but he [ Jay Garner ] was [ Paul ]
Bremer ’s predecessor for a short period of time .
And he was fired , and Bremer came in and took over in Baghdad as part of the reconstruction phase .
This is in the Spring of 2003 .
And this guy gave an interview in Government Exec Magazine , February 2004 , he said “ we will be in Iraq , and the American people need to get with this program , we will be in Iraq like we were in the Philippines for anywhere from 20 to 30 more years .
That ’s the time frame that we ’re looking at .
And that is the life span of the bases that we ’ve constructed there .
Yeah , we are not leaving these bases , and a Democratic president , I do n’t care who they are , will keep those bases there .
They will justify them and they will use them and we love that .
We love it .
So it ’s not about what the American people think is right or wrong , it ’s not about if we got lied to , what matters is , they did what they wanted to do , and as Bush says , and as Cheney says , “ it ’s quite the success . ”
And this is very frightening .
Because none of this has ever been admitted to the American people , it ’s only been hinted at by people that know .
And of course the facts speak for themselves .
The facts are , we are in Iraq , we have the finest military installations in the world , the newest military installations in the world , and we ’re not leaving them .
We ’re not turning them over to a Shiite government , we ’re not turning them over to a Sunni government , we ’re not turning them over to a Kurdish government .
We ’re not doing that .
They are American bases .
We ’ve got our flag there .
And this is kind of the way they used to do things , I guess back in the Middle Ages .
Maybe the Dark Ages .
A king decided he wanted to go do something , he went and did it .
And this is George Bush .
We call him an elected president .
I mean , he ’s operating much as kings have operated in the past .
JAMES HARRIS :
You called him “ the war pimp ” in your essay .
“ He ’s behaving , ” as you put it , “ a lot like a pimp would treat a prostitute , ‘ you do like I tell you to do . ' ”
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
That ’s right , and over the money .
“ Get back to work . ”
We ’re using these , we use these bases , we use these people , the country , it matters not one whit to us .
JOSH SCHEER : With all we see in the news on a daily basis , is there any reason to hope ?
Every day I lose more and more sleep , about soldiers who are dying .
You ’re talking about being there another 30 years .
How many more soldiers are going to be injured and killed ?
How much more money is this war going to cost ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
Well the money , yeah , sure , the money ’s a problem .
The number of soldiers being killed will probably actually reduce in many ways because we will withdraw to our bases and we will not interface with Iraqis who hate us .
This idea of what they ’re doing right now , this so called three - block program , let ’s meet more Iraqis so they ’ll like us , that ’s totally for show .
The more Iraqis meet us , the more they hate us .
So I actually do think though , over time , fewer Americans will die , and look how easily , look how easily this country has accepted the loss of those 3,200 soldiers that have died .
I think something like 90 women , maybe more have died , mothers of children .
They ’ve died , and America has eaten it up , we have not complained one bit .
They ’re spread out over 50 states , hey , it ’s no big deal .
So I think we can certainly , as a country , accommodate future deaths and I think the death rate will drop .
The problem is , it ’s immoral , it ’s illegal , it engenders hatred for Americans , contempt for Americans .
It makes every American in the world a target for terrorism .
It ’s just plain wrong , it ’s unconstitutional .
I mean , there ’s a lot of problems with it .
Dead Americans , unfortunately does n’t seem to be the problem for most of us , which is a shame .
We do n’t like looking at ugly people , I will say that .
And we ’re seeing a lot of folks come back pretty deformed , mentally and even more obviously physically , deformed from their experiences in Iraq .
And I think that could , that might give , I hate to say give hope , but realize the real moral price that we ’re paying for this , that that can help .
But quite frankly , I have no hope of us leaving Iraq .
I think the intention was for us to put bases there , to stay there , operate militarily from there .
And I think that ’s what we ’re going to do , Democrat , Republican , Independent , I ca n’t imagine anybody but Ron Paul , if you elect Ron Paul as president , those bases will be closed down .
Otherwise …
JOSH SCHEER : Or Dennis Kucinich .
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : Or Kucinich , there you go , Kucinich would do it too .
So these are the guys we are able to elect , but chances are , I hate to say , the machine is not behind these men .
So yeah , we got a problem .
Now is there anything optimistic ?
Yeah .
I ’m a God fearing Christian .
God has the power .
How
He might express that , I do n’t know .
But yeah , can the average American do anything about it ?
I ’m just not , I ’m pretty not very , I ’m not optimistic , I ’m pessimistic that any single American can do much to prevent what seems to be going to happen here , attacking Iran and also this terrible thing we ’ve done to Iraq which I think will continue to go on for many years .
It will fester , fester for many years .
JAMES HARRIS : I ’m one that believes the price of terrorism , I ’m interested to get your perspective on this as one who watched us engage on this terrorist enemy , an enemy like we ’d never seen before , at least from a military standpoint .
I look at terrorism , and I see it tearing us apart .
And in a lot of ways I look at it and say , we ’ve already lost this war because we now have a president who ’s bending the Constitution .
We ’re looking over our shoulders .
We question our whereabouts .
This whole thing that went on in Boston with the advertisement , “ is it a bomb ? ”
There ’s always that question .
Perhaps the goal of Osama , perhaps the goal of these people was to make us afraid , and they ’ve succeeded at that .
My question to you is , in your mind , what is the true price of terrorism been for you ?
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI :
The military has been broken in most respects into the extent that it worked , it worked because it ’s a mercenary force .
We were so contracted out , we hired people that are beyond the law , that are not accountable to rules of war .
And that ’s how we function .
So the whole military system , the idea of a defensive force , forget it , that ’s done with .
Constitution has been hurt by many presidents , but this president has done huge damage to understanding of the Constitution , its idea that it should restrain presidential power , that we should be conservative , small “ c ” conservative when we go out and engage in these adventures , the Congress has the right to declare war , we ’ve ignored that for many decades .
Just continued down that path .
Te idea that the Bill of Rights is an option , the Bill of Rights is a set of suggestions has become almost mainstream belief .
And this is terrible , this is a terrible thing .
But I do n’t think Osama Bin Laden did that .
Terrorism is , obviously it has a political intent , but terrorism almost always , in fact I think in every case , when the political solutions are offered , when the politics change , when the people themselves change , terrorism stops .
Terrorism to the extent that it is a crime , should ’ve been treated like a crime , but instead we made it a war .
Well there is no war with terror , terrorism is a tactic , you do n’t make war against a tactic .
So yeah , a lot of things have happened , I do n’t think Osama had much to do with it , quite frankly , I think this administration , many of the people in Washington are quite comfortable with reduced freedoms for America and this is a good way to get those reduced freedoms , to basically break down and deconstruct the Bill of Rights and say , “ well we did n’t mean that , we did n’t mean this . ”
It ’s a problem .
Our country has changed , and I think what people have to do now is kind of stand up and separate themselves from a government to the extent that they do n’t agree with it and prepare themselves for real battle .
Because we are gonna need to stand up very , I can use the word “ vociferously , ” I think that ’s what we have to do , cause our own country is at risk , but not from terror , not from buildings being knocked down , that ’s not what our country is at risk from , it ’s at risk from our politics , from our abandonment of the Constitution , our devaluing of the Bill of Rights .
We ’ve lost our freedom .
Osama probably could n’t have dreamed that George Bush would help him out so much .
I do n’t think even that was his intention , I do n’t think Osama could care less about our freedom , Osama ’s issues have to do with Islam and the Holy land , Saudi Arabia , his issues are much more narrow than anything that he ’s so called achieved .
And I think George Bush has achieved this in a very weak and LAUGHS debased Congress has achieved this for this country .
And so , it ’s a big problem .
I ’m quite depressed about it .
I do n’t really have a solution or a remedy .
I think we just need to wake up and see what ’s being done , and then we need to decide if we want to be a part of it .
It ’s like that old thing , I ’m not a child of the 60s , but you ’re either working to fix the problem or you are the problem .
JOSH SCHEER : Now , Karen , I heard you make a reference to [ terrorism as a tactic ] … Chuck Hagel made reference to terrorism as a tactic in a speech , and [ how ] it ’s not a country , and you talk about Ron Paul .
Why have the neo-cons been allowed [ to do this ] , they ’re not , to me , they do n’t seem like the Republicans that I grew up with .
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : No , no , they ’re not .
And if you look at the history of neo -conservatism , it really traces its roots , well back to Trotsky , but if you go more recent , back to who was the guy , Senator from Boeing ( Henry Jackson ) they used to call him … big Democratic , 30 year Senator out of Washington State .
And Richard Perle was on his staff , Wolfowitz I think was inspired by him .
And he was a Democrat during the Cold War .
And he was a pro , or I should say strongly anti-Communist democrat , kind of a strong defense democrat .
And these guys migrated , particularly after Jimmy Carter , because Jimmy Carter , remember , what was he doing , he was trying to make peace .
Remember that , somebody got a Peace Prize out of it , I do n’t know what it was , some kind of approach between Arabs and Israelis , and Carter was part of that .
And that alienated a great many of these folks who now we know as neo -conservatives because they have two things that they care about , one is strong defense , for whatever reason they like that , an activist foreign policy , and pro-Israel , no questions asked policy .
So many of these conservative , pro-defense democrats , anti-Communist democrats abandoned the democratic party at the time of Jimmy Carter , particularly after the time of Jimmy Carter and his summit working on Middle East peace .
And they came over to eth Republican party , and of course they came over with a great deal of money and a great deal of political influence and a great deal of voters .
So now they ’re in the Republican party , and absolutely , this happened , late 1970s .
so it is not , these are not the Republicans that we grew up thinking about , but they are in the Republican party now .
Of course the Republican party now is n’t anything like what I thought it was , it ’s certainly no Goldwater party , it ’s a party of big spending , it ’s a party of corruption .
What do you want me to say ?
They love big government , they have n’t seen a big government plan they did n’t like .
JAMES HARRIS : Henry “ Scoop ” Jackson was the guy you were looking for .
As we continue to search for the truth , and that ’s pretty much the motto of Truthdig , we do n’t believe we have the answer , but we believe that we should at least be looking for the answers .
So as we approach that truth around the issues that take place in Iraq and perhaps Iran , we think you might be a good friend to have close to the Truthdig family so we ’d like to check in from time to time .
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : Sure , I ’d be delighted , it ’s great fun talking .
And hopefully maybe in a couple of months some of these negative things I think are going to happen , maybe they wo n’t happen .
JAMES HARRIS : Maybe we ’ll all be proven wrong … whatever the case …
JOSH SCHEER : I ’m praying for it .
JAMES HARRIS :
We ’re both praying , even though Josh is not a religious man .
JOSH SCHEER : Oh , excuse me , I am a religious man .
KAREN KWIATKOWSKI : Maybe we ’re in a foxhole together .
You know what they say , there are no atheists in a foxhole , and I think in political sense , many true conservatives and classical liberals , people that love freedom , unlike George Bush , people that really love freedom , we are in a foxhole .
We are threatened .
And so we gotta call on every little bit of help we can possibly get .
JOSH SCHEER : I believe in God , I do n’t believe in big religion , just like I do n’t believe in big government .
JAMES HARRIS :
There you go , we ’re in a foxhole , so we ’re on the same team .
The Myth of the Rational Voter
There ’s an election tomorrow .
Do voters know what they ’re doing ?
According to the typical economist — and many political scientists — the answer is “ No , but it does n’t matter . ”
How could it not matter ?
The main argument is that the public ’s errors cancel out .
[ 1 ]
For example , some people underestimate the benefits of immigration , and others overestimate the benefits .
But as long as the average voter ’s belief is true , politicians win by promoting immigration policies based on the facts .
This story is clearly comforting , but is it correct ?
Are the average voter ’s beliefs true ?
In The Myth of the Rational Voter , my forthcoming book with Princeton University Press , I review a large body of evidence and conclude that the answer is definitely no .
Like moths to the flame , voters gravitate to the same mistakes .
They do not cancel each other out ; they compound .
In my book , and in this essay , I focus on the public ’s mistaken beliefs about economics .
Partly , this is because I am an economist , but mainly it is because economics is such a clear example of a subject that is politically important ( “ It ’s the economy , stupid , ” ) yet poorly understood .
I suspect that the public ’s errors extend far beyond economics .
There is convincing evidence that the public holds systematically biased beliefs about toxicology and cancer .
[ 2 ]
In foreign policy , similarly , we have the “ rally round the flag ” effect , the public ’s tendency to support wars as soon as they have been declared .
But even if the average voter perfectly understood every non-economic subject , misconceptions about economics by themselves would pose a serious problem for democracy .
Identifying Misconceptions
Suppose that one scholar maintains that the average voter ’s belief about X is true , and another denies it .
For their debate to make sense , both sides have to claim knowledge about ( a ) what the average voter believes , and ( b ) which belief is true .
How can we get to the bottom of this sort of dispute ?
It is fairly easy to figure out what the average voter believes .
High - quality surveys abound .
The hard thing is figuring out how to “ grade ” the beliefs of the average voter — to find a yardstick against which his beliefs can be measured .
The most straightforward is to compare voter beliefs to known fact .
We can ask voters to tell us the fraction of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid , and compare their average answer to the actual number .
Studies that use this approach find that the average voter has some truly bizarre beliefs .
The National Survey of Public Knowledge of Welfare Reform and the Federal Budget finds , for example , that 41 % of Americans believe that foreign aid is one of the two biggest areas in the federal budget — versus 14 % for Social Security .
The main drawback of this approach is that many interesting questions are too complex to resolve with an almanac .
But there is another mirror to hold up to public opinion .
We can track down people who are unusually likely to know the right answer , see what they think , then check whether the public agrees .
Who might these unusually - likely - to - know people be ?
The most obvious candidates are experts . [ 3 ]
To see if the average voter ’s beliefs about the economic effects of immigration are right , for example , you can ask the general public and professional economists , and see if , on average , they agree .
Is this an infallible test ?
No ; experts have been wrong before .
But it is hard to get around the strong presumption that if experts and laymen disagree , the experts are probably right , and the laymen are probably wrong .
More importantly , if you have some specific reason to doubt the objectivity of the experts , you can control for it .
If you think that economists ’ high income biases their beliefs , for example , you can check whether laymen and experts agree after statistically adjusting for income .
This was precisely the approach that I used to analyze the best available data set on economic beliefs , the Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy .
The overarching finding : Economists and the public hold radically different beliefs about the economy . [ 4 ]
Compared to the experts , laymen are much more skeptical of markets , especially international and labor markets , and much more pessimistic about the past , present , and future of the economy .
When laymen see business conspiracies , economists see supply - and - demand .
When laymen see ruinous competition from foreigners , economists see the wonder of comparative advantage .
When laymen see dangerous downsizing , economists see wealth - enhancing reallocation of labor .
When laymen see decline , economists see progress . [ 5 ]
While critics of the economics profession like to attribute these patterns to economists ’ affluence , job security , and / or right - wing ideology , the facts are not with them .
Controlling for income , income growth , job security , gender , and race only mildly reduces the size of the lay - expert belief gap .
And , since the typical economist is actually a moderate Democrat , controlling for party identification and ideology makes the lay - expert belief gap get a little bigger .
Economists think that markets work well not because of their extreme right - wing ideology , but despite their mild left - wing ideology .
From one perspective , we should have expected these findings all along .
From the time of Adam Smith , if not earlier , economists have complained that economic policy was based on misconceptions , and tried to make a difference by correcting their students ’ prejudices against markets , international trade , and so on .
Economists preserve this tradition to this day when they teach undergraduates , write for popular audiences , or talk amongst themselves .
In recent decades , however , economic research has built on the contrary assumption that the beliefs of the average voter are true .
What is surprising about my results is that I race long - standing economic tradition against recent economic research , and the traditional view wins . [ 6 ]
What Misconceptions Do
Political scientists have often criticized economists for assuming that voters are selfish .
The data — along with personal experience — have convinced me that the political scientists are right — no matter how much you know about a voter ’s material interests , it is hard to predict how he is going to vote . [ 7 ]
In contrast , if you know what a voter thinks is best for society , you can count on him to support it .
Before we can infer that the policies that are best for society will actually prevail , however , we have to add the very assumption I am challenging : that the beliefs of the average voter are true .
If his beliefs are false , his good intentions lead him to support policies that are less than optimal , and possibly just plain bad . [ 8 ]
Consider the case of immigration policy .
Economists are vastly more optimistic about its economic effects than the general public .
The Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy asks respondents to say whether “ too many immigrants ” is a major , minor , or non-reason why the economy is not doing better than it is .
47 % of non-economists think it is a major reason ; 80 % of economists think it is not a reason at all .
Economists have many reasons for their contrarian position : they know that specialization and trade enrich Americans and immigrants alike ; there is little evidence that immigration noticeably reduces even the wages of low - skilled Americans ; and , since immigrants are largely young males , and most government programs support the old , women , and children , immigrants wind up paying more in taxes than they take in benefits . [ 9 ]
Given what the average voter thinks about the effects of immigration , it is easy to understand why virtually every survey finds that a solid majority of Americans wants to reduce immigration , and almost no one wants to increase immigration .
Unfortunately for both Americans and potential immigrants , there is ample reason to believe that the average voter is mistaken .
If policy were based on the facts , we would be debating how much to increase immigration , rather than trying to “ get tough ” on immigrants who are already here .
Needless to say , I do not expect any prominent politicians to read this and publicly change their position on immigration .
Democracy is a popularity contest .
If the average voter believes that less immigration is best for society , democracy rewards politicians who oppose immigration .
This does not necessarily mean that elected officials cynically pander to the prejudices of the public .
Our leaders might have gotten to the top of the political game because they sincerely share popular prejudices .
Regardless of what is going on in politicians ’ hearts and minds , though , we can expect democracy to listen to the average voter , even when he is wrong .
The empirical evidence indicates that he often is .
How Misconceptions Are Possible
Most of the economic misconceptions that we see today were already well - known in the time of Adam Smith .
How can the public keep making costly policy mistakes , year after year , century after century ?
Public choice economists are used to blaming what they call “ rational ignorance . ”
In elections with millions of voters , the personal benefits of learning more about policy are negligible , because one vote is so unlikely to change the outcome .
So why bother learning ?
In my book , however , I argue that rational ignorance has been oversold .
Rational ignorance cannot explain why people gravitate toward false beliefs , rather than simply being agnostic .
Neither can it explain why people who have barely scratched the surface of a subject are so confident in their judgments — and even get angry when you contradict them .
Why , to return to the case of immigration , do people leap to the conclusion that immigration is disastrous , and have trouble holding a civil conversation with someone who disagrees ?
My view is that these are symptoms not of ignorance , but of irrationality .
In politics as in religion , some beliefs are more emotionally appealing than others .
For example , it feels a lot better to blame sneaky foreigners for our economic problems than it does to blame ourselves .
This creates a temptation to relax normal intellectual standards and insulate cherished beliefs from criticism — in short , to be irrational .
But why are there some areas — like politics and religion — where irrationality seems especially pronounced ?
My answer is that irrationality , like ignorance , is sensitive to price , and false beliefs about politics and religion are cheap . [ 10 ]
If you underestimate the costs of excessive drinking , you can ruin your life .
In contrast , if you underestimate the benefits of immigration , or the evidence in favor of the theory of evolution , what happens to you ?
In all probability , the same thing that would have happened to you if you knew the whole truth .
In a sense , then , there is a method to the average voter ’s madness .
Even when his views are completely wrong , he gets the psychological benefit of emotionally appealing political beliefs at a bargain price .
No wonder he buys in bulk .
What ’s Wrong With Democracy — and What ’s Better
Unfortunately , the social cost of irrationality can be high even though it is individually beneficial .
If one person pollutes the air , we barely notice ; but if millions of people pollute the air , life can be very unpleasant indeed .
Similarly , if one person holds irrational views about immigration , we barely notice ; but if millions of people share these irrational views , socially harmful policies prevail by popular demand .
When individual choices in markets have harmful social side effects , most people want to do something to about it .
In the case of pollution , for example , economists usually want to tax emissions , and non-economists want to set emission standards .
Few people just shrug their shoulders and say , “ The solution to the problems of markets is more markets . ”
When individual choices in democracy have harmful social side effects , however , many people really do just shrug their shoulders and say , “ The solution to the problems of democracy is more democracy . ”
If they wish to sound more hard - headed , they may instead quote Churchill : “ [ D ] emocracy is the worst form of government , except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time . ” [ 11 ]
On reflection , though , quoting Churchill in the face of democratic failure makes about as much sense as seeing rampant air pollution , and saying , “ The free market is the worst form of economic organization , except all the others . ”
One can criticize markets or democracy — and propose remedies — without advocating socialism or dictatorship .
Democracy , like the free market , can be limited , regulated , or overruled .
So what remedies for voter irrationality would I propose ?
Above all , relying less on democracy and more on private choice and free markets .
[ 12 ]
By and large , we do n’t even ask voters whether we should allow unpopular speech or religion , and this “ elitist ” practice has saved us a world of trouble .
Why not take more issues off the agenda ?
Even if the free market does a mediocre job , the relevant question is not whether smart , well - meaning regulation would be better .
The relevant question is whether the kind of regulation that appeals to the majority would be better .
Another way to deal with voter irrationality is institutional reform .
Imagine , for example , if the Council of Economic Advisers , in the spirit of the Supreme Court , had the power to invalidate legislation as “ uneconomical . ”
Similarly , since the data show that well - educated voters hold more sensible policy views [ 13 ] , we could emulate pre-1949 Great Britain by giving college graduates an extra vote . [ 14 ]
I suspect that these — and other !
— eccentric institutional reforms would be helpful if tried .
Unfortunately , there is a catch - 22 :
The majority is unlikely to vote to reduce the power of the majority .
Still , milder versions of these reforms might slip through the cracks .
The public has largely ceded control of monetary policy to professional economists ; perhaps the public would be willing to defer to expert judgment on some other areas as well .
In a similar vein , although the majority is unlikely to approve plural votes for college graduates , it does allow the well - educated to exert extra influence by virtue of their higher turnout rate .
It might be politically possible to further increase the de facto influence of educated voters by spending less money to increase turnout .
In the end , though , the catch - 22 means that institutional reform is unlikely to be a very effective check on voter irrationality .
What else is there ?
Even in the most democratic countries , political actors have a degree of slack or “ wiggle room . ”
It is usually possible for officials to deviate moderately from voter preferences without being removed from power .
And to be blunt , if the average voter holds irrational beliefs that lead him to support bad policies , using political slack to mitigate the damage seems like the right thing to do .
If the average voter is wrong about immigration , and you have the political slack to push through an amnesty , go for it .
The Supreme Court may be the best example of a political body with a lot of slack .
Justices serve for life , and it takes a constitutional amendment to overturn their decisions .
This suggests — and history confirms — that they have significant power to improve upon democratic outcomes .
If the Court has the chance to rule on the constitutionality of legislation inspired by anti-market misconceptions , why not overturn it for violating due process , or the Ninth Amendment , or the Tenth Amendment ? [ 15 ]
This was the essence of so - called “ Lochner era jurisprudence . ”
Given what we know about the public ’s economic biases , however , I think we owe those stodgy old judges an apology .
Of course , I do not expect the Supreme Court to revive Lochner anytime soon .
At least as far as economics is concerned , the current justices basically accept the idea that they should defer to majoritarian wisdom .
And obviously , they are not alone .
The prevailing view even among the well - educated is that it is unseemly to question the competence of the average voter .
Many elites go further by praising the insight of the average voter , no matter how silly his views seem .
As long as elites persist in unmerited deference to and flattery of the majority , containing the dangers of voter irrationality will be very hard .
Someone has to tell the emperor when he is naked .
He may not listen , but if no one speaks up , he will almost surely continue embarrassing himself and traumatizing spectators .
My final remedy for voter irrationality , then , is for people who know more than the average voter to stop being so modest .
When experts and those who heed them address a broader audience — in the media , in their writings , or in a classroom — they need to focus on the questions where experts and the public disagree , and clearly explain why the experts are right and the public is wrong .
Thus , when economists get the public ’s ear , they should not bore them with the details of national income statistics , or quibble with each other about marginal issues .
They should challenge the public ’s misconceptions about markets , foreigners , saving labor , and progress .
But if the public is as irrational as I say , will this work ?
It might .
Irrationality does not rule out persuasion , but it does change what people find persuasive .
If people accept beliefs , in part , because they feel good , it is important to wrap your message in the right emotional packaging .
“ I ’m right , you ’re wrong , change , ” falls flat .
But in my experience , “ I ’m right , the people outside this classroom are wrong , and you do n’t want to be like them , do you ? ” is fairly persuasive .
Frederic Bastiat , arguably the greatest economic educator in history , should be our role model .
Who else could make a critique of popular economic prejudices not just charming , but funny ?
Conclusion
I suspect that many readers will just view me as “ tone - deaf ” to democracy .
Whether or not the people know what they are doing , do n’t they have a right to choose ?
I can understand when people make this argument about self - regarding choice .
Even if an individual does not know his own best interest , I normally think that he should be free to make his own mistakes .
The problem with irrational voting , unfortunately , is that people who do it are not “ just hurting themselves . ”
If the average voter is irrational , we all have to live with the consequences .
Every parent eventually asks his child , “ If all your friends jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge , would you ? ” I have an even more loaded question for those who refuse to second - guess the wisdom of the average voter : “ If the majority said we all had to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge , would you push people who refused to jump ? ”

How can these patterns be so clear - cut , given economists ’ legendary tendency to disagree with each other ?
The answer , quite simply , is that there is much more consensus than meets the eye .
Popular culture creates a false impression because it is more entertaining to watch experts debate than it is to watch them agree ; and in any case , once economists reach a common understanding , they move on to new topics .

MOZART OR ROCK ?
FOR THESE MICE IT WAS A NO - BRAINER MICE LISTENING TO HARD ROCK TRIPLED THE TIME THEY TOOK TO NAVIGATE A MAZE .
MICE HEARING MOZART CUT THEIR TIME FROM 10 TO 1 1/2 MINUTES .
Your mom was right .
Rock ' n ' roll really does rot your brain .
That 's according to David Merrell , a 16 - year - old Nansemond River High School student whose high school science experiment supports what parents have been saying for years :
Hard rock taints the brain - well , at least the brains of mice .
Using 72 male laboratory mice , a stopwatch , a 5 - by 3 - foot maze and the music of Mozart and Anthrax , David worked with an Old Dominion University statistician to establish that hard rock impedes learning .
In the process , the rising junior captured top honors in regional and state science fairs and earned accolades from the Navy and the CIA .
`` Do n't let your kids listen to hard rock music , '' he said .
`` I think it has a major negative effect . ''
To prove his point , David assembled three separate groups of 24 mice : a control group , a hard rock group and a classical group .
To ensure scientific validity , each white mouse weighed between 15 and 20 grams , was 4 to 6 weeks old and was bred to ensure no genetic abnormalities existed .
The mice spent the first week getting used to their controlled environment in David 's parents ' basement .
They received measured feedings and 12 hours of light each day .
Each mouse navigated the maze to establish the base time of about 10 minutes .
Then David started piping in music 10 hours a day .
The control group navigated without music .
He put each mouse through the maze three times a week for three weeks .
The results : the control group shaved five minutes from its original time .
The mice that navigated the maze with Mozart knocked 8 1/2 minutes off their time .
But the group listening to hard rock bumped through the maze , dazed and confused , taking an average of 30 minutes , tripling the amount of time it previously took to complete the maze .
Most noticeably , the hard rock mice did n't sniff the air to find the trails of others that came before them .
`` It was like the music dulled their senses , '' David said .
`` It shows point - blank that hard rock has a negative effect all around .
I can't think of a positive effect that hard rock has '' on learning .
In fact , David thinks that the negative effects go well beyond learning .
During the four - month experiment David housed each mouse in separate aquariums .
That 's because last year , for a similar project , he kept all the hard rock mice together , all the classical mice together and all the control mice together .
The results were horrific .
``I had to cut my project short because all the hard rock mice killed each other , '' David said .
``None of the classical mice did that at all . ''
David 's awards include first place in the behavioral science division at the Virginia State Science and Engineering Fair and the Tidewater Science Fair .
He also won Northern Virginia Community College 's Veterinary Technology Award and accolades from the Newport News Arts Commission , the Science and Humanitarian Symposium at James Madison University , the Navy and the CIA .
David himself is n't a fan of hard rock , so his discovery wo n't affect his lifestyle too much .
But other teens may feel the heat .
`` At the actual fairs parents would see it and come back with their kids , '' David said .
`` They 'd say , ` See , I told you hard rock would do that . ' ''

STUDY LINKS ATTEMPTED SUICIDE WITH GENETIC EVIDENCE IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS SUICIDE RESEARCH
A Johns Hopkins - led study has found evidence that a genetic tendency toward suicide has been linked to a particular area of the genome on chromosome 2 that has been implicated in two additional recent studies of attempted suicide .
“ We ’re hoping our findings will eventually lead to tests that can identify those at high risk for attempting suicide , ” says Virginia Willour , Ph.D. , an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and lead author of the study .
An estimated 4.6 percent of Americans ages 15 to 54 have tried to take their lives , according to Willour .
The investigators conducted a family linkage study in which they searched for commonalities in the genomes of family members with bipolar disorder and a history of attempted suicide .
The same gene region on chromosome 2 that was identified by this bipolar disorder and attempted suicide study was recently identified by two complementary family studies that looked at attempted suicide in families with major depression and alcohol dependence .
“ Family linkage studies are not always consistent , so the fact that all three studies , including ours , point to the same region of the genome is a good indication that we are on the right track toward identifying a gene or genes that play a role in why a person chooses to take his or her own life , ” says Willour .
In the multi-institutional study , results of which appear in the March issue of Biological Psychiatry , the researchers examined data from 162 families with bipolar disorder .
They looked at attempted suicide in this sample because it is an important clinical problem that tends to occur more often in some of these families than in others , suggesting a distinctive genetic basis , according to senior author James B. Potash , M.D. , M.P.H. , of the Department of Psychiatry at Hopkins .
This technique , of looking at sub - types of illness , is used by genetic researchers as a way to reduce genetic complexity .
From the 162 families , the researchers selected 417 subjects who were diagnosed with schizoaffective / bipolar disorder , bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder .
These subjects were asked whether they had ever attempted suicide and the degree of intent of the most serious attempt .
One hundred fifty - four subjects said they had attempted suicide , and 122 stated that they had “ definite ” intent .
For the purpose of this study , the latter were considered to have a history of attempted suicide .
Data for all 417 subjects was entered into a computer program that looks for genetic similarities between subjects with similar psychological profiles .
Results indicated that family members with a history of attempted suicide and bipolar disorder showed a high degree of genetic similarity at a specific area -- DNA marker D2S1777 -- on a section of chromosome 2 referred to as 2p12 .
This is the same marker implicated in a 2004 study from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine that looked at attempted suicide and major depression .
And it is close to another marker , D2S1790 , located in the 2p11 region of chromosome 2 , which was identified in a 2004 study from the University of Connecticut School of Medicine that looked at alcoholism and attempted suicide .
Willour says that although the Hopkins - led study does not pinpoint a specific gene responsible for attempted suicide , it does suggest a “ neighborhood ” in which the gene might be found .
She adds that the next step is to further narrow the search and find the “ address . ”
“ Once we have located the specific gene , ” she says , “ we can better identify people who might be at risk of suicide and offer drug companies a target for possible therapies . ”
The data used by Willour and her team -- DNA samples , medical histories and psychiatric evaluations -- came from an independent study , CHIP , conducted at the University of Chicago , Johns Hopkins , and the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) Intramural Program .
The purpose of CHIP , initiated in 1988 and funded through at least 2010 , is to find genes that predispose people to developing bipolar disorder or particular subtypes of the illness .
Other Johns Hopkins researchers who contributed to this study are Peter P. Zandi , Ph.D. , from the Department of Mental Health in the Bloomberg School of Public Health and J. Raymond DePaulo Jr. , M.D. ; Dean F. MacKinnon , M.D. ; and Francis M. Mondimore , M.D. , from the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences .
Additional researchers include Elliot S. Gershon , M.D. , and Judith A. Badner , M.D. , Ph.D. , from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Chicago ; Francis J. McMahon , M.D. , from the NIMH Intramural Program ; and Melvin G. McInnis , M.D. , from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor .
Funding for this study came from the National Institute of Mental Health .
Story Highlights • Police : Pulitzer winner involved in a 10:30 a.m. crash near San Francisco
• Halberstam , 73 , spoke to students at UC - Berkeley Saturday
• A New Yorker , Halberstam was working on book in California , dean said
• Wrote 21 books on various subjects including Vietnam War , civil rights , sports
Adjust font size :
SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) -- Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist and author David Halberstam has died in a car accident in Menlo Park , California , near San Francisco , the San Mateo County coroner 's office said Monday .
In 1964 Halberstam , then with The New York Times , shared a Pulitzer for international reporting for his coverage of the early years of the Vietnam War , including the 1963 overthrow of South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem .
The accident happened at about 10:30 a.m. ( 1:30 p.m. ET ) , and the driver of the car carrying Halberstam identified him as the victim , according to the Associated Press .
The driver is a student at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California , Berkeley , where Halberstam had spoken Saturday about the craft of journalism , the Associated Press reported .
The student was taken to Stanford Medical Center , the AP said , and two others involved in the crash were injured .
Orville Schell , the dean of Berkeley 's journalism school , said Halberstam was in the Bay Area working on a book on NFL hall of famer Y.A. Tittle .
He said Tittle , the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback , now lives in Palo Alto , California , near the scene of the wreck .
After attending Harvard University , Halberstam launched his career in 1955 at the Daily Times Leader , a small daily newspaper in Mississippi .
By age 30 he had won the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Vietnam War for the New York Times .
He quit daily journalism in 1967 and wrote 21 books covering such diverse topics as the Vietnam War , civil rights , the auto industry and a baseball pennant race .
His 2002 best - seller , " War in a Time of Peace , " was a runner - up for the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction .
His 1972 book , " The Best and the Brightest , " documented the Kennedy administration 's early steps during the war .
Halberstam lived in New York .
Authorities say the accident is still under investigation .
So I am going to seize this opportunity to give some thoughts on research funding in general , and some possible political realities .
But let me start by saying that I think that the bill is a very good idea .
This past week I was asked ( outside this forum ) to give an opinion on H.R. 364 , a bill in the US Congress “ to provide for the establishment of the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy . ”
This seems to follow the earlier H.R. 507 “ Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States , in collaboration with other international allies , should establish an energy project with the magnitude , creativity , and sense of urgency that was incorporated in the " Man on the Moon " project to address the inevitable challenges of " Peak Oil " .
This was developed by Congressman Bartlett , who began by making speeches on the floor about Peak Oil , and who joined with Congressman Udall to found the Congressional “ Peak Oil ” Caucus and to co-sponsor the resolution .
Congressman Bartlett is a co-sponsor of H.R. 364 .
Sometimes it is hard to grasp the size of the problem that is now facing the world .
One way is , perhaps , to relate it to time .
A hundred thousand seconds is just under 28 hours ; a million seconds is eleven and a half days , and both are graspable numbers .
A billion seconds is , however , 31.7 years , which is almost half a lifetime , and on a different scale of perception .
So it is with the world energy supply , it is easy to talk about the necessary changes in individual lifestyle , or to debate whether a single power station / wind farm should or should not be built .
Those issues are relatively easy to appreciate and debate .
But trying to convey the problems when crude oil and natural gas supplies will drop by over a billion barrels of oil equivalent in a year carries the debate beyond the numbers that are as easy to grasp or assimilate .
The fossil fuel extraction industry is relatively conservative in regards to research , with a small percentage of their finances being directed toward the topic .
Further their definition includes exploration , and much of the research that is funded is aimed purely at solving immediate problems and supply needs , rather than “ out - of - the - box ” concepts that could have a greater payback but which require a longer term investment .
Given the competing tasks of research and teaching an industry executive last week left me in no doubt as to his belief that the second was paramount and the former not that necessary in a university department .
Collectively around the industry there is not a great deal of concern with the long term prognosis .
Demand is high , and the needs for production today ( and in the next couple of years ) take precedence over worrying about where the barrels of oil or tons of coal will come from in a decade or so .
There are not enough knowledgeable engineers being graduated from universities around the world to work on today ’s issues , and today ’s technologies are working , so why fix something that is n’t broke ?
A second senior executive ( it was that sort of week ) discussed the political realities of the coming couple of years .
There is , foregoing the collaboration that the above bills illustrate in the House , a considerable difference between Democratic and Republican positions on Energy .
Bear in mind , for example , that the next President will appoint the members and heads of a number of oversight committees and agencies that regulate the industries .
Given the range of opinions among the currently announced candidates , would you be willing to commit the monies now to start a new venture , while unsure that , with the advent of a new Administration , you might not be faced with a complete reversal of approval , or a wall of new regulations within two years .
Better to hold off on that investment until the future gets a little clearer .
Both these opinions , you may note , do not sense any concern about the supply of any form of fossil fuel within the near - term .
That having been said , there is a current effort underway in renewable energy that focuses , at different levels of intensity , on wind , solar , hydro- electric and the biofuels .
But it is here that my opening comment becomes relevant .
We are still at a point where the relative merits of different approaches are being debated .
This debate too often spends too much energy on running down the different alternatives – not being willing to recognize the improvements that will come about through research investment – rather than understanding that it will not be too long before we need not one of these , or the other , but rather all of them .
It also can assume that , because the Federal Government is backing a technology at the production plant level , the developmental problems needed for economic production have been solved .
Therefore , the proponents of that ideology would argue that there is no need for investment in alternative sources , since , with enough investment , approach C will provide all the energy we need .
Unfortunately , particularly with renewable sources that rely on bio- feedstock , the impact of the recent weather on the fruit trees as well as grains shows the dangers of an over - dependence on harvests .
It is an event that has occured , the effects are recognized , but the general public ( and the dependent wildlife ) will not see and pay the cost of the weather until the fall and winter .
We must have a broad range of supply alternatives that include all potential sources being considered and developed .
And given the problems that some can generate , then research should be carried out to develop a realistic solution .
( Closing power plants that are needed to provide the services that sustain life is not a realistic solution ) .
Further just because company / university A is carrying out research in sub-topic B of concept C does not mean that the real answer lies in that line of investigation .
Many times it is only through going down multiple paths that the way forward can be detected .
Running “ lean and mean ” research efforts can too often result in waste if the investigation does not initially start out on a broad investigative base .
Hopefully , from this you will realize that I think that the basic idea of an ARPA - Energy program is a really good idea .
We need to have a new commitment to finding alternative ideas that are not constrained by having to live within the definitions of the existing boundaries within the Department of Energy .
But , having said that , there is a concern with modeling it too closely on DARPA .
( The Department of Defense version ) .
There has been an increasing trend by Federal Agencies to believe that problems can be solved thorough funding a very limited number of Research Centers .
The premise being that if enough money is thrown at a select few , that the answer will be forthcoming .
This often ends up giving those that are well - connected an inside track , and generally means that those that are not , regardless of the worth of their ideas , do not get funded .
As one illustration of this during the days of the last Energy Crisis the response was to give large chunks of money to “ our brightest scientists ” – which were considered to be those at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
Well , apart from a little work on lunar and Martian mining , at the time they had no idea about fossil fuel extraction , and how to enhance it .
But they got the money , and so spent time trying to learn about the business , while those more knowledgeable in this particular area did not .
Now there is nothing wrong with getting bright people to take a new look at a situation – often new creative approaches can be formed – but it is inefficient and we really may not have the mindset to conceive of the silver bb of an idea that comes from a chemist in Idaho , or a minerals processing person in Baton Rouge .
Thus , what I would hope would happen if the idea is brought to pass ( in itself perhaps questionable ) , is that some provision be made to solicit and fund ( say at $ 100,000 for a year ) a broad suite of ideas .
The premise being that most will be found not to work , but by encouraging creative thought , the ones that do can be winnowed and encouraged .
( Along the lines of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 funding that the SBIR program follows at NSF , but with a much smaller threshold to be met for Phase 1 funding ) .
Do I expect that to happen ?
Well , No !
But Spring might finally be here and for an afternoon it is nice to dream .
Oh , and if you get the chance , put in a good word for H.R. 364 .
It would not hurt to contact your Member of Congress , your senator , or anyone in the executive branch who might listen .
It never hurts .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Dow rallied to yet another record high Wednesday , capping its longest winning stretch in nearly 52 years , on robust earnings news , a $ 10.6 billion deal for Cablevision and a strong reading from the manufacturing sector .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( up 75.74 to 13,211.88 , Charts ) rose nearly 0.6 percent to close at an all - time high for the fifth time in the last six sessions .
The Dow also hit an intraday high of 13,256.33 during the session .
The blue - chip indicator has now risen in 21 of the last 24 sessions - the best streak since the summer of 1955 .
Back then , the 30 - share Dow climbed about 10 percent over 25 sessions while it 's up about 7.5 percent in the recent run .
The tech - heavy Nasdaq composite ( up 26.31 to 2,557.84 , Charts ) gained over 1 percent and the broader S&P 500 ( up 9.62 to 1,495.92 , Charts ) index rose more than 0.6 percent .
Oil settled down 72 cents to $ 63.68 a barrel , while gold prices eased $ 2.20 to $ 675.10 an ounce on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Treasury prices edged lower , leaving the yield on the 10 - year note at 4.64 percent .
In currency trading the dollar gained against the euro and the yen .
Here 's what was moving before the close :
After cheering News Corp 's $ 5 billion bid for Dow Jones on Tuesday , Wall Street learned of another potential deal from Cablevision ( up $ 3.23 to $ 35.90 , Charts , Fortune 500 ) , which has agreed to be taken private for $ 10.6 billion by the family that already owns a controlling stake in the No. 5 cable operator .
Cablevision shares jumped over 8 percent .
The momentum continued Wednesday , as investors welcomed a stronger - than - expected March factory order reading which rose 3.1 percent , after growing 1.4 percent in the previous month .
" It probably lessened recession fears more than anything else , " said John Lonski , chief economist for Moody's .
" It [ factory orders ] should supply a boost to economy in the months ahead . "
Wall Street also weighed a weaker - than - expected reading on private sector employment , as the ADP National Employment reported that the private sector added 64,000 jobs in April , short of forecasts .
The reading suggests that Friday 's April jobs report could show weaker payroll growth than currently forecast .
Lower oil prices on the day provided support , but the consensus among market observers appeared to be that upbeat corporate earnings were the main driver on Wall Street .
" There 's no question that the earnings have been much better than what analysts were expecting , " said Charles Smith , chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group .
" And that 's been driving the advance . "
Smith noted that at the end of last quarter , analysts were expecting earnings growth of just over 3 percent , whereas now , growth is on track to rise 7 or 8 percent .
With 72 percent of the S&P 500 having reported results , earnings are currently on track to have grown 7.9 percent from a year ago , according to the latest Thomson Financial estimates .
That 's a blended number , including reported and forecast earnings , with the final number likely to show growth of 7 or 8 percent .
In addition to earnings , stocks have gotten a boost from the wave of corporate mergers and other deals news .
Dow Jones ( down $ 0.20 to $ 56.00 , Charts ) shares inched lower after the company that controls the media behemoth indicated it would not approve News Corp ( up $ 0.44 to $ 23.43 , Charts , Fortune 500 ) 's proposed takeover , opening the door to other bidders .
In earnings news , CNNMoney.com parent Time Warner ( up $ 0.35 to $ 20.94 , Charts , Fortune 500 ) reported earnings that beat estimates on sales that met estimates .
( Full story ) .
MasterCard ( up $ 11.50 to $ 126.35 , Charts ) reported higher quarterly sales and earnings that topped forecasts , sending shares over 11 percent higher .
Shares of the fast - food firms Yum Brands Inc. ( Charts ) and Chipotle Mexican Grill ( up $ 11.83 to $ 78.09 , Charts ) soared after reporting better - than - expected results late Tuesday .
Transocean ( up $ 2.94 to $ 89.21 , Charts ) , which operates petroleum drilling rigs , reported higher quarterly sales and earnings that topped estimates .
Shares gained 3.4 percent .
Nortel Networks ( up $ 2.05 to $ 25.12 , Charts ) jumped over 9 percent after the telecom gear maker said late Tuesday that it expects first - quarter revenue in a range that could top analysts ' forecasts .
Market breadth was positive .
On the New York Stock Exchange , winners beat losers about 3 to 1 on volume of 1.19 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , advancers topped decliners almost 2 to 1 on volume of 1.55 billion shares .
Treasury prices slipped , lifting the yield on the 10 - year note to about 4.64 percent from around 4.63 percent late Tuesday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
In bond market news , the government said Wednesday that it is discontinuing the sales of three - year treasury notes , due to what it said was an improving budget deficit .
In currency trading , the dollar eased against the euro and gained versus the yen .
U.S. light crude oil for June delivery fell 72 cents to $ 63.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , after the government said supplies of gasoline fell and crude oil inventories climbed .
COMEX gold for June delivery fell $ 2.20 to $ 675.10 an ounce .

I was asked if my fixed number module ( ) which has the precision built into the type could be used with a dynamic epsilon , i.e. , one that is not know at compile time .
The answer is , yes .
It only takes a fraction of an oleg to do .
A recap :
The idea with the Fixed type was that , e.g. , , is the type where computation happens with an epsilon of 1 .
To get the epsilon for a type I have a classSo what do we do if we need an epsilon of say , 0.01 ?
Well , there 's another instance for the type constructorSo the typewill have an epsilon of 0.01 .
Similarly , with the right set of primitive types and type constructors you could build any epsilon you want .
To simplify a little the function below only finds an epsilon within a factor of 10 from the requested one .
This function takes a desired ( rational ) epsilon , r , and a function , f , and returns a function that behaves like f , but that will round its argument to the desired epsilon and compute with that .
How does it work ?
It 's starts by passing something of type Eps1 to loop , and then the loop uses that epsilon if it is small enough , otherwise it will pass something that have an epsilon that is a tenth to the next iteration of the loop .
There are two " tricks " here , first the loop function recurses with an argument of a different type than it was given .
So it needs polymorphic recursion , and thus needs a type signature .
Second , the function , f , has a rank two type .
This way the function can work with any epsilon it is given ; otherwise we would not know that .
Note how the argument to loop is actually never ysed , soworks great .
All we need is the right type .
And with scoped type variables this is easy to do .
There are some improvements that should be made to this function : it is inefficient and it does n't give you the exact epsilon back .
But it has the right general idea .

Last week FoodNavigator.com reported on a study from Barcelona , published in the journal Hepatology​ , which fed rats a liquid fructose beverage and found the metabolism of fat in the liver had been changed by impacting a specific nuclear receptor called PPAR - alpha , leading to a reduction in the liver 's ability to degrade the sweetener .
Talking to FoodNavigator.com , Audrae Erickson , president of the CRA stated that links to high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) are not justified since fructose and HFCS are different .
HFCS consists of 55 per cent fructose and 42 per cent glucose .
" It 's like comparing night and day , " ​ she said .
" If you feed rats [ fructose ] beyond what you get in a normal diet you will get results [ as seen in the Barcelona study ] , " ​ said Erickson .
" But HFCS contains about 50 per cent glucose , which acts a moderator to fructose . " ​
Campaigners against the high fructose corn syrup ingredient point to epidemiological studies that have linked the consumption of sweetened beverages and obesity , as well as some science that claims that the body processes the syrup differently than other sugars due to the fructose content , leading to greater fat storage .
However , industry associations like the Corn Refiners Association ( CRA ) have repeatedly claimed there is no scientific evidence to suggest that HFCS is uniquely responsible for people becoming obese .
Indeed , Erickson pointed out that a new study , published in the peer - review journal Nutrition​ , reported that high fructose corn syrup fed to 30 lean female volunteers showed that the sweetener had the same effects as sucrose .
The women ( average age 33 , average BMI 22.4 kg per sq.m ) were randomly assigned to consume either a sucrose - or HFCS - sweetened beverage providing 30 per cent of energy levels for one day .
Blood samples were taken and glucose , insulin , leptin , and ghrelin levels measured .
The women returned one month later to consume the other beverage .
The study was double - blind , meaning neither the subjects nor the scientists knew which beverage was being given .
The researchers , led by Kathleen Melanson from the University of Rhode Island reported that no significant differences were observed between any of the measured blood variables were observed as a result of drinking the sucrose - or fructose - sweetened beverages .
" These short - term results suggests that , when fructose is consumed in the form of HFCS , the measured metabolic responses do not differ from sucrose in lean women , " ​ wrote Melanson .
" Further research is required to examine appetite responses and to determine if these findings hold true for obese individuals , males , or longer periods , " she concluded . ​

There are ways to prevent diversion without imprisoning doctors who have shown no illegal intent .
They are increasingly used — but state authorities and doctors need to push even harder .
The majority of states , South Carolina among them , do not yet have prescription monitoring — a central registry of prescriptions , which could help catch people getting opioids from several different doctors and pharmacies .
Doctors should use more urine and blood tests , including screens that can tell quantities of drug present .
Last year , state medical boards took 473 actions against doctors for misdeeds involving prescribing controlled substances .
In many cases , their licenses were pulled .
Physicians can also lose their D.E.A. registration , and with it the right to prescribe controlled substances .
A few dozen do every year , although there is considerable overlap with medical - board actions .
Washington is the first state to recommend that only pain specialists handle high - dose opioids ; other states are likely to follow .
But such guidelines are futile while there is one pain specialist for , at the very least , every several thousand chronic - pain sufferers nationwide .
And even though pain is an exciting new specialty , doctors are not flocking to it .
The Federation of State Medical Boards calls “ fear among physicians that they will be investigated , or even arrested , for prescribing controlled substances for pain ” one of the two most important barriers to pain treatment , alongside lack of understanding .
Various surveys of physicians have shown that this fear is widespread .
“ The bottom line is , doctors say they do n’t need this , ” said Heit .
“ They ’re in a health care system that wants them to see a patient every 10 to 15 minutes .
They do n’t have time to take a complete history about whether the patient has been addicted .
The fear is very real and palpable that if they prescribe Schedule II opioids they will come under the scrutiny of the D.E.A. , and they do n’t need this aggravation . ”
Proper pain management will always take time , but the D.E.A. can at least ensure that honest doctors need not fear prison .
It should use the standard it claims to follow : for a criminal prosecution to occur , a doctor must have broken the link between the opioid and the medical condition .
If the evidence is of recklessness alone , then it should be a case for a state medical board , the D.E.A. ’s registration examiners or a civil malpractice jury .
Undoubtedly , such a limit will allow a small group of pill - mill doctors to escape prison .
But America lives with freeing suspects whose possible crimes are discovered through warrantless searches or torture — and unlike other suspects , doctors who lose their licenses are as incapacitated as those behind bars .
For cases without the broken connection , prosecution is too blunt an instrument .
It runs too high a risk of condemning innocent physicians to prison and discourages the practice of a medical specialty desperately needed by millions of Americans .
Pain patients are the collateral victims here .
It is worth remembering that the vast majority of McIver ’s patients were not people who abused or sold their medicines .
One of those who did n’t was a man named Ben , a tall , heavy man in his 50s who lives about 45 minutes from Greenwood .
( He asked that his last name not be used because of the stigma still attached to taking opioid drugs . )
Ben was once a mail carrier and a farmer and cattle rancher .
But years of pushing 800 - pound bales of hay wore out his back .
In 2001 he had an operation to fuse the bottom three vertebrae .
The few Vicodin his neurosurgeon prescribed did not control his pain .
“ I never had enough to get me through the night , ” he said .
“ He was n’t going to go any further than Vicodin — and he was doing me a favor by doing that , because his other partners would n’t have done as much as he did . ”
His neurosurgeon recommended he find a pain doctor .
He started seeing McIver .
The first examination , Ben said over coffee in a local Waffle House , was “ extremely thorough — he had me crying .
I hardly ever got out of there in less than two hours — he would be on top of me popping my back . ”
And he got opioids .
With his typical imprudence , McIver told Ben : “ You do n’t worry about it , take whatever you need to be pain - free , if it takes 2 pills or 10 pills .
If you ’re taking too much and slurring your words , you know to back off .
Use some common sense . ”
At McIver ’s request , Ben kept a diary of what he took and how much .
He reached a top dosage of five 80 - milligram pills of OxyContin four times a day — more opioids than Shealy was taking at the time of his death .
“ I never felt high , ” he said .
“ They helped my pain .
I could get out and work , use the bulldozer .
I was working a 250 - head cattle herd .
I was doing everything relatively pain - free because of the drugs .
They gave me my life back . ”

BBC News , Lahore
Lahore is in the midst of a middle class building boom
While the events of 11 September 2001 created an atmosphere of fear and suspicion among Pakistani expatriates living in the US , the benefits back home are becoming increasingly noticeable .
Many wealthy Pakistanis in America have responded to increased monitoring of wealth and assets , particularly owned by Muslims , by sending a substantial part of their savings back home .
And areas like the up - market Defence Housing Authority in Lahore have benefited enormously .
A recent ballot to allocate 300 residential plots in this area received nearly 70,000 applications .
Affluent middle class
The huge interest of investors in this and other well - to - do areas is typical of the unprecedented surge in real estate businesses in big cities like Lahore and Karachi following the attack on the World Trade Centre .
Since then , the value of one plot in the Defence Housing Authority has shot up from about $ 65,000 before 11 September to in excess of $ 1.5 m after it .
In the town of Johar , another affluent middle class locality , average prices have risen on an equally spectacular basis - from about $ 35,000 to more than $ 132,000 .
The boom has led to a mushrooming of Pakistan 's middle class housing suburbs , often at an unprecedented speed .
The growth of Lahore 's Defence Housing Authority is so phenomenal that it has announced five new building phases since 2002 .
Rags to riches
" The property boom in Lahore would not have been possible had 9/11 not occurred , " says Sahir Chaudhary , a real - estate developer in Lahore , " The price of the real estate went up by as much as 1,000 % in the city in the last five years . "
Lahore is being transformed by money from the US
The rocketing real estate prices in Lahore have resulted in hundreds of rags - to - riches stories .
Poor farmers with small pieces of land in the villages close to the municipal limits could hardly make ends meet .
But with the fast expansion of the city 's frontiers , they sold off their property , pocketing millions of rupees overnight .
The city 's roads are now clogged with brand new four - by - fours - the names of BMW and Lexus are becoming increasingly common on the streets .
The cars are just one sign of the ostentatious new rich , showing off money which was unheard of a few years back .
More than 30 m cellular phone subscribers is another signpost of the upturn .
It is not only the property market which is booming
Pakistan 's electricity company chief Tariq Hameed says there have also been record sales of refrigerators , washing machines and split air conditioners which have caused a sudden surge in electricity demand .
Not surprising then that this summer there were many power cuts in peak hours .
All this is all the more amazing when one considers that just five years ago , Pakistan was on the verge of bankruptcy , with only a little more than $ 1bn in foreign exchange reserves and its stock market teetering at 1,000 points .
Massive remittances
Two months after 9/11 , the forex reserves went up to $ 4bn as Pakistan joined the US coalition against the " war on terror " .
The forex reserves now stand at more than $ 12bn .
The property boom in Lahore would not have been possible had 9/11 not occurred
Sahir Chaudhary , Lahore real - estate developer
And there is little doubt that the catalyst for this growth has been the massive amount of remittances sent back by non-resident Pakistanis in the US and later from Europe .
In 2001 , the remittances totalled a little more than $ 1bn .
But since 2002 , Pakistan has received nearly $ 4bn in remittances every year .
That means an additional inflow of $ 14 - 15 bn has been returned to the country since the 2001 attacks .
No wonder , then , that the once ever - declining rupee has been stable at around 60 - 61 to a dollar since then .
The wealth flowing in to Pakistan now is second only to the boom created by money sent back to the country by its blue - collar workers in the Middle East in the 1980s .
The difference is that the 1980s money created a lower middle class , whereas today the principal beneficiaries are upper middle class people in big cities .
They brandish credit cards and drive Mitsubishis .
Their children go to grammar schools , eat burgers and pizzas and celebrate Halloween and Valentine 's Day .
Strange then that the vast majority still have few kind words for the US - even though it is arguably the source of their new - found prosperity .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
One weekend morning in 2002 , Michael Brill had the sort of epiphany that commonly befalls successful businesspeople - particularly tech businesspeople who live in the San Francisco Bay Area .
Fed up with an unfulfilling career in software marketing , Brill wanted to wake up , look out over a vineyard and spend his days handcrafting wine .
Unlike many of those who have had the daydream before him , however , he did n't have the , oh , $ 15 million to plant a stake in Napa or Sonoma .
So he got creative .
" I dug up my backyard , " Brill says , referring to his 625 - square - foot plot in San Francisco 's sunny Potrero Hill neighborhood .
" There was an avocado tree , a lemon tree .
I just razed the whole thing and planted pinot noir and a couple of syrah vines . "
Over the next year he buried himself in winemaking books , replaced the junk in his garage with a few stainless - steel tanks and a couple of fermenters , and began meeting farmers and procuring grapes .
He still had the day job , but by night and on weekends he was living his dream .
And suddenly he had a lot more friends .
" Random people walking down the street would drop in and say , ' What are you doing ? '
I 'd give them some pizza and beer , and they'd help me for 12 hours , " the 41 - year - old Brill recalls .
" We made some nice wine .
And then I knew I wanted to do this in a bigger way . "
Thus Crushpad was born .
Headquartered in a 17,000 - square - foot warehouse on a gritty edge of the Mission District , Crushpad is a custom winemaking facility that taps into that universal human urge to give it all up for a life among the vines - without the giving - it - all - up part .
At a fraction of the cost and effort of buying land or ripping up the backyard , customers work elbow - deep in grapes and , with the help of a team of professional winemakers , custom - craft their own vintages .
Some buy in to get a quality wine at a fraction of the retail cost .
Others consider the experience an apprenticeship , an on - ramp to a career change .
Many just want a bottle with their name on it to give to clients and family .
Whatever their motivation , Crushpad 's 1,500 customers are now following Brill 's charge toward Wine 2.0 , which shares all the buzzy characteristics of " Web 2.0 " - social networks , user collaboration , wikis and so forth .
The difference , of course , is that whereas Web 2.0 - ers drink the proverbial Kool - Aid , Crushpad customers get to enjoy an actual adult beverage .
Hands - on winemaking
Here 's how it works .
Let 's say you have a thing for Russian River Valley pinot noirs , the earthy , fruit - forward reds that can sell for more than $ 100 a bottle - if you can find them .
Crushpad requires a one - barrel minimum , which is the equivalent of 25 cases .
If you want it all to yourself , you drop roughly $ 6,000 , and Brill and his team begin searching out the grapes that - coupled with some hard work and guidance - will turn into your ideal wine .
If you 're not up for 300 bottles , you sign on with a few friends or search crushnet.com for other people with the same hankering .
From there , you can be as hands - on as your time and enthusiasm allow .
" In the most disinterested customer scenario , you can call and say , ' I want a barrel of your best cabernet ; give it to me in two years , ' " says Brill , who one October evening wears the weary mien of a farmer up past his bedtime .
Fluent in both MBA - speak ( market caps ) and wine geek ( submerged caps ) , he explains that Crushpad exploits inefficiencies in the wine supply chain .
" This is about a redistribution of costs and margins .
We get rid of the retailer and distributor and push the product risk to the community , which provides the cash and the brand development and pays only 40 to 50 percent of what they 'd pay at retail . "
In other words , in Brill 's model the middlemen get , well , corked .
Despite the value message , Brill is n't after the jug - wine demographic .
He 's going for the luxury end of the market ( about $ 50 a bottle and up ) and offering an experience that can entail everything from chatting up the farmer while the fruit is hanging in the late - summer Napa sun to harvesting , pressing , barreling , bottling , labeling and even commercializing the wine .
The Crushpad crew regularly posts fermentation readings on the site for the scrutinizing masses .
The company produces about 15,000 cases of more than 400 different lots of wine , and after three harvests , it 's already producing some impressive product .
One customer recently scored a 91 on a 100 - point scale ; two others won gold medals in wine competitions .
Some of the wines formulated by Bryan Kane , a tech executive and Crushpad customer , can be found at fancy restaurants around San Francisco .
" If you start out with excellent grapes , " Brill says , " anyone can make good wine . "
The right place at the right time
Crushpad has benefited from stellar harvests in California during the past few years .
But Brill says his model works even when there 's not a glut of great fruit on the market .
Free of the complexity and expense of dealing with distributors and retailers , he can pay a lot more for great fruit .
" The farmers spend 12 months tending the vines , and the winery gives them $ 3,500 a ton , or about $ 5 for a bottle that 'll eventually sell to the consumer for $ 50 , " he says .
" We could pay all our growers $ 7 a bottle , or $ 5,000 a ton , and turn around and say to our customers , ' You 're going to have to pay $ 2 more a bottle . '
They know that if we pay more for fruit , they pay more , but they get a higher - quality product . "
All over the Web , startups are exploiting an increased interest in wine , driven partly by a stream of studies demonstrating the health benefits of consuming it regularly .
The sites connect aficionados and offer personalized guides to the often confusing , insular world of wine .
Cellar - Tracker.com allows users to catalog and price their collections while sharing tasting notes and rubbernecking at everyone else 's cellars .
Another site , called Cork'd , brokers introductions of " drinking buddies " who have similar taste profiles .
Wine blogs are everywhere .
Crushpad customers do more than talk about wine .
They become winemakers in their own right .
Chad Thomas , a 36 - year - old vice president of private banking with J.P. Morgan , is on his second vintage with Crushpad .
One evening in early November he stands arm 's length from a forklift as employees lower a bin of high - end Napa Valley grapes into the presser .
Last year Thomas made a syrah .
This summer he showed it off to friends from business school .
" We had a blind tasting of $ 70 bottles , and I slid in one of my ' 05s , " Thomas says .
" It was n't quite ready , but right away my friends said , ' I want in . ' "
This year they opted for cabernet sauvignon grapes from the ToKalon vineyard in Oakville , Calif .
They 're paying about $ 25 a bottle for fruit that in 2003 produced a wine that tastemaker Robert Parker gave a perfect 100 - point score .
The natural fear for a novice winemaker would be to spoil such high - quality product , but Thomas seems unconcerned .
He and his friends will constantly monitor the Web site to see how the wine is progressing , and they can stop by whenever they want .
" This is a word - of - mouth business , " he says , smiling , as he takes his first swig of the grape juice that , after 18 months in a French oak barrel , should ferment into his dream vintage .
" They 're not going to let us mess up . "
The business of winemaking
Crushpad employs four full - time winemakers in addition to Brill , all with oenology degrees and experience working at such vaunted wineries as Opus One and Clos du Val .
Brill says two customers have disliked their end products so far , so the company refunded their money - and promptly resold the wine to local restaurants at a profit .
The company 's revenue quadrupled last year , and Brill expects it to double this year .
He is currently closing a $ 2 million round of financing , much of it from individuals who started out as customers .
Brill says that opening branches in other cities - he 's aiming for New York and Chicago in 2008 - should n't be too hard .
" There 's not much required in the way of winemaking technology , " he says , " but information technology is a different story .
It 's about tracking styles , goals , acids , yeasts - and then translating all that information to the community .
We have more people developing software than we do in full - time winemaking . "
What do the established winemakers think of this revolutionary in their midst ?
The consensus seems to be that Brill is overplaying the role of the fruit - but in a benign way .
" If it 's all about the grapes , then my job is n't really that important , " says Richard Bruno , the head of winemaking for Don Sebastiani & Sons and co-owner of Vinum Cellars in Napa .
Bruno produces more than 1.8 million cases a year , ranging from a $ 6 Pepperwood Grove merlot to Vinum 's $ 90 Leaky Lake cabernet .
" I think he 's oversimplifying a bit , but as long as people are drinking wine , it 's good for the industry . "
Brill does n't expect to be embraced by the establishment of his adopted industry .
He 's an outsider trying to strip away inefficiencies and distribute the savings to farmers and consumers .
But do n't mistake his model for altruism .
What started out as a fit of passion in the backyard has become an act of pure capitalism .
" This is a social production model for wine , " Brill says .
" It 's the old industrial model vs. the networked economy . "

Happy hour for drinkers ' wages
Trust but verify .
That little piece of strategy that Ronald Reagan applied to the measurement of nuclear stockpiles during the cold war is being used by astronomers .
When measuring the size and age of the universe , astronomers have relied on the " Hubble constant , " named after the late American astronomer Edwin Hubble .
The constant relates a galaxy 's distance to the speed at which it 's moving away from us .
Astronomers determine a galaxy 's speed by looking at its light .
The redder the light , the faster the speed .
Divide that speed by the Hubble constant , and you get the galaxy 's distance from Earth .
As Max Bonamente at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , has explained , " astronomers absolutely need to trust this number because we use it for countless calculations . "
Attempts to verify that number , however , do n't yet support that level of trust .
This high - stakes need for verification has energized a painstaking effort to refine the Hubble constant .
Fritz Benedict and Barbara McArthur at the University of Texas in Austin led the international team that published their attempt to refine this number in this month 's Astronomical Journal .
To verify the Hubble constant , astronomers compare the distance they get using the constant against the distance they get from an independent measurement based on Cepheid variable stars .
A Cepheid 's light varies with time .
This variation reflects the star 's inherent brightness .
Once astronomers know this inherent brightness , or intrinsic luminosity , they can estimate the distance to the Cepheid by noting how dim it appears from Earth .
But the relationship between a Cepheid 's variability and its intrinsic luminosity has not been known accurately enough to serve to verify the Hubble constant .
The international team worked largely with nearby Cepheids whose distance could be measured directly by geometrical means .
Comparing these absolute distances with those indicated by the Cepheid 's apparent brightness helped refine this relationship .
The team had to take account of myriad errors .
They include minute motions of the Hubble Space Telescope that made the observations .
" We 've been cranking on this since 1977 , " Dr. Benedict says .
Now this picky picky work has produced a result that Benedict says " has excited me more than any [ other result ] in my 35 - year career . "
Astronomers now have a more accurate distance - measuring tool to use wherever they can find a Cepheid .
Last August , Dr. Bonamente and colleagues reported new distance measurements to 38 galaxy clusters ranging from 1.4 billion to 9.9 billion light years away .
They used radio and X - ray observations to estimate the physical size of a galaxy cluster .
Geometric triangulation then gave the cluster 's distance .
Their check of the Hubble constant confirmed its currently accepted value .
But Kris Stanek at Ohio State University in Columbus and colleagues found that value in error .
They reported last August how they measured the intrinsic brightness of a binary star system in galaxy M33 .
Judging the stars ' distance by how dim they appear from Earth , they found it to be 3 million light years away .
The estimate based on the Hubble constant 's accepted value was only 2.6 million light years .
The true value of the constant may be 15 percent smaller – and the universe may be 15 percent larger and older – than we thought .
Astronomers will " trust " whatever they believe is the best value for the constant .
But the need to verify remains .
Paul Krugman says there 's no reason to shed any tears over Reagan 's lost legacy :
Do n’t Cry for Reagan , by Paul Krugman , Commentary , NY Times :
As the Bush administration sinks deeper into its multiple quagmires , the personality cult the G.O.P. once built around President Bush has given way to nostalgia for the good old days .
The current cover of Time magazine shows a weeping Ronald Reagan , and declares that Republicans “ need to reclaim the Reagan legacy . ”
But Republicans should n’t cry for Ronald Reagan ; the truth is , he never left them .
There ’s no need to reclaim the Reagan legacy : Mr. Bush is what Mr. Reagan would have been given the opportunity .
In 1993 Jonathan Cohn ... published an article in The American Prospect describing the dire state of the federal government .
Changing just a few words ... makes it read as if it were written in 2007 .
Thus , Mr. Cohn described how the Interior Department had been packed with opponents of environmental protection , who “ presided over a massive sell - off of federal lands ... ” that “ deprived the department of several billion dollars in annual revenue . ”
Oil leases , anyone ?
Meanwhile , privatization had run amok , because “ the ranks of public officials necessary to supervise contractors have been so thinned ...
Agencies have been left with the worst of both worlds — demoralized and disorganized public officials and unaccountable private contractors . ”
Holy Halliburton !
Not mentioned ... , but equally reminiscent of current events , was the state of the Justice Department under Ed Meese , a man who gives Alberto Gonzales and John Mitchell serious competition for the title of worst attorney general ever .
The politicization of Justice got so bad that in 1988 six senior officials , all Republicans , ... resigned in protest .
Why is there such a strong family resemblance ...?
Mr. Reagan ’s administration , like Mr. Bush ’s , was run by movement conservatives ...
And both cronyism and abuse of power are part of the movement conservative package .
In part this is because people whose ideology says that government is always the problem , never the solution , see no point in governing well .
So they use political power to reward their friends , rather than find people who will actually do their jobs .
If expertise is irrelevant , who gets the jobs ?
No problem : the interlocking , lavishly financed institutions of movement conservatism , which range from K Street to Fox News , create a vast class of apparatchiks who can be counted on to be “ loyal Bushies . ” ...
Still , Mr. Reagan ’s misgovernment never went as far as Mr. Bush ’s .
As a result , he managed to leave office with an approval rating about as high as ... Bill Clinton ...
But the key to Reagan ’s relative success , I believe , is that he was lucky in his limitations .
Unlike Mr. Bush , Mr. Reagan never controlled both houses of Congress — and the pre-Gingrich Republican Party still contained moderates who imposed limits on his ability to govern badly .
Also , there was no Reagan - era equivalent of the rush , after 9/11 , to give the Bush administration whatever it wanted in the name of fighting terrorism .
Mr. Reagan may even have been helped , perversely , by the fact that in the 1980s there were still two superpowers .
This helped prevent the hubris , the delusions of grandeur , that led the Bush administration to believe that a splendid little war in Iraq was just the thing to secure its position .
But what this tells us is that Mr. Bush , not Mr. Reagan , is the true representative of what modern conservatism is all about .
And it ’s the movement , not just one man , that has failed .
It was meant to be a vigil for Kendrick Castillo , who was killed after he charged one of the two classmates who opened fire at his school in suburban Denver just the day before .
But the gathering at a neighboring school Wednesday night quickly turned political .
There were speeches by politicians and at least one activist from the gun control group Moms Demand Action .
Some students from the STEM School Highlands Ranch , where nine students were shot Tuesday , reacted with anger , walking out in protest .
There were chants of “ mental health ” and shouts of “ f - ck the media ” and “ f - ck this . ”
One student , who later took the podium , said , “ We ca n’t be used for a reason for gun control .
We are people , not a statement . ”
STEM School junior Fischer Argosino , who was at the vigil , told TIME the handling of the event was “ inappropriate ” and “ disrespectful . ”
He said he resents the politicization of the students who had just lost a friend and experienced the trauma of yet another school shooting .
“ We needed a time to mourn his passing and kind of process what happened .
Because I would say it still does n’t feel real , ” Argosino said .
The students ’ anger during the vigil resulted in the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , whose affiliate student group Team Enough hosted the event , issuing an apology .
It ’s a lesson that not all school shooting survivors are willing to quickly turn their grief into demands for gun control and political change like many students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Fla .
Within a week of that shooting , which killed 17 last year , Parkland students marched on the Florida state capitol and told lawmakers , “ We ’ve had enough of thoughts and prayers … we are coming after every single one of you and demanding that you take action . ”
Joseph Eriqat , a STEM School senior who says Kendrick Castillo was one of his best friends , says the vigil left many of his classmates angry with the intense media scrutiny and the political messages from adults not connected to the school .
“ I appreciate their sentiment , ” Eriqat said of his classmates .
“ I ’m not happy that it ’s being politicized so soon after the tragedy . ”
This area of Colorado has experienced a great deal of suffering over gun violence in the last few decades .
The STEM School is less than eight miles from Columbine High School , where 12 students and a teacher were killed by two students 20 years ago .
The STEM School is 20 miles away from another Denver suburb , Aurora , Colo. , where a gunman killed 12 and wounded dozens of others in a movie theater in 2012 .
But the STEM School is different from Florida ’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas school .
It ’s a K - 12 charter school geared toward math and science education .
The two locations ’ voter habits are also different .
Parkland , Fla. , is in a solidly Democrat - leaning area , whereas Douglas County , Colorado voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 by a nearly 20 - point margin .
Another difference between the anger in Colorado and the activism in Parkland was the role of the adults in the room , students tell TIME .
In Florida last year , students led the conversation and many appeared happy to appear on camera to broadcast their grief and anger to the nation .
STEM
School students say they felt their home was hijacked by adults with an agenda .
Many were also frustrated by some TV camera crews , who they felt were pursuing students too aggressively .
“ We made it clear that we did n’t want politics , and they used his death and victims for the wrong and unfair reasons , ” Noah Stickney , a former STEM student who now attends another school in the area , said .
“ We know what politicians want , but this was about Kendrick and all who were there .
We deserve a major apology , and they said the same things we ’ve heard before about guns and shootings .
We ’re teens and children , we should n’t have to solve and deal with these problems . ”
A spokesperson for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet , a Democrat who spoke at the vigil , said in a statement , “ That night should have been about Kendrick Castillo and the STEM School students .
They are our focus and the event should have been set up to ensure their voices were fully heard . ”
Following the public backlash , the Brady Campaign released a statement that said , in part : “ We are deeply sorry any part of this vigil did not provide the support , caring and sense of community we sought to foster and facilitate and which we know is so crucial to communities who suffer the trauma of gun violence . ”
Argosino said that while he personally feels that the focus should be on mental health care , he recognizes there will ultimately be a conversation at the STEM School about gun control .
But , he says , first he and the other students need time to process what happened , and to mourn their friend Kendrick .
“ I was surprised that they were already talking about gun control and that whole political issue , ” Argosino says .
“ So I knew that eventually we ’d get to that topic and that debate about gun control and mental health and all those things , but not so soon as the day after Kendrick ’s passing . ”
Correction , May 14
The original version of this story misstated Fischer Argosino ’s grade level .
He is a junior , not a senior .

Let 's take this piece of piss - yellow " journalism " apart and see just how incredibly biased it is , shall we ?
By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS , Associated Press Writer
1 hour , 45 minutes ago WASHINGTON -
Valerie Plame put a glamorous face and a personal story to Democrats ' criticism of the Bush administration Friday ...
So right off the bat , this entire story , according to the AP , is about nothing more than Democrats criticism of the Bush administration .
It 's NOT about outing a covert CIA operative , a decidedly treasonous act , an act which she could describe whereas " I was betrayed by my own government " .
No .
To the AP , this is about nothing but Democrats criticism of the Bush administration .
What a crock of steaming stinking crap .
It gets worse :
Still , Plame 's appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was a moment of political theater that dramatized Democrats ' drive to use their control of Congress to expose what they see as White House efforts to intimidate dissenters .
Again , no facts here .
It 's all about the Democrats " drive " to " use their control of Congress " to " expose what they see as White House efforts to intimidate dissenters .
And of course the whole Plame affair is just " political theater " .
It has nothing to do with intelligence operations vital to the national scurity of the United States being destroyed , nothing to do with entire networks of covert operatatives being exposed and put in mortal danger , their years of work suddenly shot to hell .
No , it 's just political theater from the democrats who are " using " their new position to expose " what they see " ( presumably nobody else sees it , just the Democrats , and they must be HALLUCINATING ) .
Are you as disgusted as I am yet ?
How about we keep going ?
Who 's the first person who gets to offer commentary in this article ?
DING DING DING -- you guessed it -- a Republican !
And here it is :
Rep .
Tom Davis of Virginia , the committee 's senior Republican , called the session a partisan hearing that would do little to illuminate how Plame 's identity came to be exposed or how such disclosures could be prevented .
Right .
The hearing was a complete waste of time .
Nothing to see here .
Move along .
" It 's a terrible thing that any CIA operative would be outed , " Davis said .
But " there 's no evidence here that the people that were outing this and pursuing this had knowledge of the covert status . "
Pure Bushian talking point .
Pure bullshit .
Why is this even in an article which is supposed to reports FACTS ?
Then they go on to call her a liar :
" I did not recommend him .
I did not suggest him .
There was no nepotism involved .
I did not have the authority , " she said .
That conflicts with senior officials at the CIA and State Department , who testified during Libby 's trial and told Congress that Plame recommended Wilson for the trip .
That 's a pure smear .
" Senior officials " at the State Department and the CIA , both departments which fall under the Executive Branch of the government and therefore Bush 's jurisdiction , where it has been made clear that all work " at the pleasure of the President " ?
They finish the article by referring simply to her star quality and the fact that many people went all ga - ga over her appearance , and they compare her to a professional athlete .
Even a member of Congress confessed to being a bit star - struck .
" If I seem a little nervous , I 've never questioned a spy before , " Rep. Lynn Westmoreland ( news , bio , voting record ) , R - Ga. said .
" I was here during the steroid hearings , too , and I do n't think any of those baseball stars got this kind of media attention that you 're getting today . "
Yeah .
This is equivalent to the " steroid hearings " .
Sure .
Once again , the entire thrust of the article is " nothing to see here , move along " .
It 's the AP 's modus operandi of the last five years at least .
And it's what millions of people who get their news from Yahoo saw today .
I do n't know why I bother doing this , because obviously they do n't give a flying fart what anybody thinks of them .
It is obvious that they , too serve " at the pleasure of the President " .
This is pure , Pravda - esque propaganda .
What 's so sickening about it is that we 've become so used to this kind of thing that most people do n't even notice it anymore .
They know that , and they keep ratcheting up the propagandistic qualities of their stories .
This one is particularly transparent , if one uses any objectivity AT ALL .
Makes me sick .
How do we stop it ?
I do n't know .
Bust them on it , call them on it , at the same time ignore it ?
If anyone has any ideas , I 'd sure love to hear them .
They abuse the First Amendment , the right to " free speech " in order to lie , lie , and lie some more .
It 's just plain wrong .

Fortunately , the ten man crew were uninjured but had to live in survival shelters for more than 3 days until the weather improved enough to allow a rescue plane to land .
The Navy personnel who arrived to inspect the aircraft and investigate the accident determined that salvaging it would be too dangerous and costly ; the salvage crew was given only an hour to cut loose the most valuable instruments , and the aircraft was left to get buried .
During the following years the aircraft was gradually buried in ice .
Only the top of the airplane 's tail was still above the snow .
The three - foot section of the tail fin was the only object visible in miles of snow .
But the economics of aircraft procurement caused the National Science Foundation to take a closer look at the buried LC - 130 .
In January 1987 , sixteen years later , experts determined that repairing the stricken Hercules would be cost - effective , considering the price of a replacement aircraft .
On january 1987 , a field repair team set up their base camp and immediately started work on the aircraft .
During the next months they replaced all four of the aircraft 's engines , two main landing gear systems , struts and small components .
A year later , on january 10 , 1988 , the plane was completely dug up and it was flown from the crash site to McMurdo Station .
From McMurdo the aircraft was flown to a repair facility in Christchurch , New Zealand , where it had some additional repairments before being put back into service in Antarctica .

This was covered yesterday by georgia10 and others , but I 'm going to bring it up again because is just so terribly stupid , and in a wide and kaleidoscopic variety of ways .
It 's not even the kind of stupid that we all secretly wish upon Republican politicians , just to make our own liberal advocacy easier , it 's the kind of stupid that 's sad and creepy and alarming to watch , a kind of stupid that reeks of something deeply wrong with the person that says it .
It 's the kind of stupid that can only show up in a desperate man who has , at heart , nothing resembling what you or I or the average household dog might consider " values : "
MANCHESTER , N.H. Rudy Giuliani said if a Democrat is elected president in 2008 , America will be at risk for another terrorist attack on the scale of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
But if a Republican is elected , he said , especially if it is him , terrorist attacks can be anticipated and stopped .
" If any Republican is elected president -- and I think obviously I would be the best at this -- we will remain on offense and will anticipate what [ the terrorists ] will do and try to stop them before they do it , " Giuliani said .
Yes .
If a Republican is elected , they can " anticipate " terrorist attacks .
You know , perhaps because staff members with their " hair on fire " are warning them of the high risk of terrorist attacks .
Perhaps because staff members are trying to educate them in vain about a recent ongoing history of terrorist attacks .
Perhaps because somebody practically staples a memo to the Republican President 's forehead dramatically entitled , in a large and bolded font , " Bin Laden Determined To Strike in U.S. " MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT .
Yes , the recent history of Republican " anticipation " of terrorist attacks is certainly something I 'd be pinning my ass to , if I were a Republican running for President .
I was pondering over this last night , as a matter of fact , so let 's think about this for a minute .
Under six years of President Bush , there have been major terrorist attacks on two American cities , public - safety - threatening electricity blackouts artificially created by major energy corporations in an effort to extort the recipients of that electricity , deficits that have reached crisis proportions , criminal indictments of Republican congressmen nationwide and even of Republican White House staffers , one of Americas " crown jewel " cities was in large part destroyed and its population turned into refugees battling a national government response that ranged from incompetent to absent , the defacto suspensions of habeas and other Constitutional rights , the international diplomatic isolation of America , and there have been two major wars , both ongoing .
So a Democratic administration could , in theory , see major terrorist attacks on two American cities , electrical blackouts and corporate criminal extortion of our electrical grids , further massive deficits , criminal indictments of Democratic congressmen nationwide and of White House staffers , the destruction of another major city , encroachments upon various Constitutional rights , the continued international isolation of the nation , and start one major war ...
... and they 'd still suck less than Bush .
Good God , what monstrosities this nation has endured in six short years .
What a hell of a record to live up to .
It speaks to a certain constitutional ( small - c ) fortitude , I suppose , that every national Republican politician has not simply boarded themselves up in their offices , ashamed to even be seen .
And yet they continue on , arrogantly preening about a party that at this point I would n't trust to run power tools , much less a nation .
UPDATE : Keith Olbermann , tonight :
OK , so the subpoenas have been issued :
The Senate subpoenaed the White House and Vice President Dick Cheney 's office Wednesday , demanding documents and elevating the confrontation with President Bush over the administration 's warrant - free eavesdropping on Americans .
Besides issuing the subpoenas , the Senate Judiciary Committee also is summoning Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to discuss the program and an array of other matters that have cost a half - dozen top Justice Department officials their jobs , committee chairman Patrick Leahy announced .
What happens if the White House and the VP tell Congress to go Cheney itself ?
Essentially , the Senate 's options for dealing with non-compliance are :
Move to hold the targets of the subpoenas in statutory contempt of Congress Move to hold the targets in inherent contempt of Congress Extend the deadline for compliance and make threats regarding either # 1 or # 2 above Come to some negotiated settlement with the " administration " -- i.e. , closed door , no transcript testimony , limited document release , etc .
Do nothing , complain loudly about obstructionism , stonewalling , and lawlessness , and hope that voters elect Democrats in 2008 , because Republicans are so nasty Ask the House to impeach
That 's really about it .
Most likely outcome ?
If history 's any guide , the answer lies somewhere in the neighborhood of # 4 .
Although it should be said that history 's never really been any kind of a guide for this " administration . "
But there 's always a first time for everything , and no doubt when backed into a corner , the White House gang will be depending on the quasi- precedent of the negotiated settlement to save its bacon ( or at least allow them to futz around long enough to run out the clock and slip out the back door in January 2009 ) .
Problems ?
Well , statutory contempt of Congress is prosecuted at the discretion of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia .
And we know where the U.S. Attorneys ' offices are at these days .
But has the U.S. Attorney ever declined to prosecute such a case ?
Yes it has : EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch , during the Reagan administration .
How about inherent contempt ?
Well , that takes the Justice Department out of the loop .
But it 's a daring move , involving trying the contemnors at the bar of the Senate , and possibly arresting and imprisoning them on the direct authority of the Senate and its Sergeant at Arms .
Has it ever been done ?
Yes it has , though the last time was over 70 years ago .
Extended deadlines , negotiated settlements and doing nothing all carry their own peculiar problems , mostly political .
Will the executive branch ever take the legislative branch seriously if they do n't hold the line ?
Will voters take Congress seriously ?
Will they be angry ?
Grateful ?
Indifferent ?
And what will future presidents think they 're likely to face if this Congress lets this president slide ?
And finally , impeachment .
We know the problems , and do n't need to list them again .
But is this really an impeachable offense ?

Ask anyone why there is an obesity epidemic and they will tell you that it ’s all down to eating too much and burning too few calories .
That is undoubtedly true – you cannot get round the first law of thermodynamics .
It ’s also true that we live in an “ obesogenic environment ” : calorific food is plentiful and cheap and our lifestyles are increasingly sedentary .
Most of us have to make an effort not to get fat .
That explanation appeals to common sense and has dominated efforts to get to the root of the obesity epidemic and reverse it .
Yet obesity researchers are increasingly dissatisfied with it .
Many now believe that something else must have changed in our environment to precipitate such dramatic rises in obesity over the past 40 years or so .
Nobody is saying that the “ big two ” – reduced physical activity and increased availability of food – are not important contributors to the epidemic , but they cannot explain it all ( see “ Why the ‘ Big Two ’ just will not do ” , below ) .
Earlier this year a review paper by 20 obesity experts set out the 10 most plausible alternative explanations for the epidemic ( International Journal of Obesity , DOI : 10.1038/sj.ijo.0803326 ) .
Here they are .
1 Not enough sleep
It is widely believed that sleep is for the brain , not the body .
Could a shortage of shut - eye also be helping to make us fat ?
Several large epidemiological studies suggest there may be a link .
People who sleep less than 7 hours a night tend to have a higher body mass index ( BMI ) than people who sleep more , according to data gathered by the US National Health …
One evening last December , in front of nearly 2,000 people at Stanford 's Memorial Auditorium , Al Gore spoke in uncharacteristically personal and passionate terms about the failed quest that has dominated much of his adult life .
Save for his standard warm - up line - " Hi , I 'm Al Gore , and I used to be the next president of the United States " - there was hardly a mention of the White House .
Instead , during the next 90 minutes , Gore had plenty to say about thinning polar ice caps , shrinking glaciers , rising carbon dioxide concentrations , spiking temperatures , and hundreds of other data points he has woven into an overpowering slide show detailing the catastrophic changes affecting the earth 's climate .
The audience was filled with Silicon Valley luminaries : Apple 's Steve Jobs ; Google 's Larry Page and Eric Schmidt ; Internet godfather Vint Cerf ; Yahoo ! 's Jerry Yang ; venture capitalists John Doerr , Bill Draper , and Vinod Khosla ; former Clinton administration defense secretary William Perry ; and a cross section of CEOs , startup artists , techies , tinkerers , philanthropists , and investors of every political and ethnic stripe .
After the souped - up climatology lecture , a smaller crowd dined at the Schwab Center on campus .
There , at tables topped with earth - shaped ice sculptures melting symbolically in the warmth of surrounding votive candles , guests mingled with Gore and his wife , Tipper , along with experts from Stanford 's Woods Center for the Environment and the business - friendly Environmental Entrepreneurs .
The goal : to enlist the assembled leaders in finding market - driven , technological solutions to global warming and then , in quintessential Silicon Valley style , to rapidly disseminate their ideas and change the world .
" I need your help here , " an emotional Gore pleaded at the end of the evening .
" Working together , we can find the technologies and the political will to solve this problem . "
The crowd fell hard .
" People were surprised , " says Wendy Schmidt , who helped organize the event and , with her husband , Google CEO Eric Schmidt , supported Gore 's 2000 presidential campaign .
" They think of a slide show about science , they think of Al Gore .
But they come out later and say , ' He 's funny , he 's passionate , he 's real . ' "
Al Gore ?
Five and a half years after leaving the political stage , only the fourth man in US history to win the popular vote for president without being inaugurated , Gore has deftly remade himself from an object of pity into a fearless environmental crusader .
The new Gore is bent on fixing what he calls the " climate crisis " through a combination of public awareness , federal action , and good old - fashioned capitalism .
He 's traveling the globe , delivering a slide show that , by his own estimate , he 's given more than a thousand times over the years .
His one - man campaign is chronicled in a new documentary , An Inconvenient Truth , which made Gore the unlikely darling of the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and will be released on May 26 by Paramount Classics .
He has also written a forthcoming companion volume of the same name , his first book on the subject since the 1992 campaign tome Earth in the Balance : Ecology and the Human Spirit .
Along the way , Gore has become a neo - green entrepreneur , taking his messianic faith in the power of technology to stop global warming and applying it to an ecofriendly investment firm .
The company , Generation Investment Management , which he cofounded nearly two years ago , puts money into businesses that are positioned to capitalize on the carbon - constrained economy Gore and his partners see coming in the near future .
All the while , he has been busy polishing his reputation as the ultimate wired citizen :
Not far from the Stanford campus , Gore sits on the board of directors at Apple and serves as a senior adviser to Google .
Farther up Highway 101 are the San Francisco headquarters of Current TV , the youth - oriented cable network he cofounded with legal entrepreneur Joel Hyatt .
For Gore , the private - sector ventures are all pieces of the same puzzle .
He 's challenging the power of the investment and media industries to decide what information matters most and how it ought to be distributed .
" I find a lot of joy in the fact that these parts of my life post - politics have connected into what feels like a coherent whole , in ways that I did n't consciously plan , " Gore told me at the Technology Entertainment Design conference in Monterey , California , where - again - he was the star attraction .
" I think I 'm very lucky . "
This is not , of course , the image of Al Gore stored in the nation 's memory .
He 's been filed away as a tragic character who saw his victory hijacked by the Supreme Court .
( In the film , he addresses the experience in a poignant passage : " That was a hard blow , but what do you do ?
You make the best of it . " )
How Gore has reengineered himself as a hero of the new green movement is a story known so far by only the relative few who have seen him in action lately .
" You have a sense that this is the moment in his life , as though all the work he 's been doing is now coming to a head , " says film director Davis Guggenheim , who spent months traveling with Gore while shooting An Inconvenient Truth .
" City by city , as he gives this presentation , he is redeeming himself in a classically heroic way - someone who 's been defeated and is lifting himself out of the ashes . "
Al Gore 's redemption begins aboard a sailboat in the Ionian Sea .
There , in waters once traveled by Odysseus during his long journey home after the Trojan War , Al and Tipper retreated during the summer of 2001 to recover from their ordeal .
In the months immediately following his searing loss , Gore had kept himself busy , teaching at several universities and working with Tipper on a book about the American family .
The couple abandoned Washington and moved back to Nashville , Tennessee , where they had lived as newlyweds and where their older daughter , Karenna , was born .
There they reconnected with old friends who had nothing to do with politics .
" It was very healing , " Tipper says .
" We renewed ourselves . "
Though he still had n't decided whether he would run for president in 2004 , Gore felt it was " time to recede " from the public stage , she says , to spare himself - and the polarized public - an endless rehashing of the country 's civic trauma .
That July and August , Al and Tipper vacationed at a seaside estate in Spain and then sailed along the Greek coast , trying to figure out what to do next .
For the first time in his high - achieving life , the man who ran for president in 1988 , at age 39 , and who was a candidate in every national election since , had few demands on his time .
Alone but for the boat 's crew , he and Tipper spent their secluded days reading , exploring , and enjoying more than a few good meals .
As usual when he was on vacation , Gore did n't bother to shave .
On the morning they were due to return to the US , Tipper says , she walked into the bathroom and found Gore preparing for his end - of - vacation ritual , just as he had done countless times during his days as a US congressman , senator , and vice president .
" I said , ' Al , you do n't have a job to go back to .
The beard is fun .
Leave it . '
He said , ' Oh yeah , ' and put down his razor .
And then we came back and everyone saw the beard and it was ' yada yada yada . ' "
When Gore hit US shores looking like a well - fed Grizzly Adams , the late - night comics lampooned him without mercy .
The political talking heads puzzled endlessly about Gore 's latest " makeover " and what signal he was trying to send .
" It 's not as if we were talking about Allen Ginsberg , " Tipper told me , clearly amused by the image of her husband as a closet counterculturist .
" It was just his way of saying he was free . "
As Gore started traveling the country again , tentatively feeling out campaign donors and testing his political viability before select audiences , it soon became clear that his heart was no longer in the hunt .
In late September 2001 , Gore was scheduled to address an influential gathering of Democrats in Iowa .
He had planned to signal his interest in the 2004 race .
But after the September 11 attacks , he tore up the speech and instead called for national unity , offering a salute to President Bush as " my commander in chief . "
Gore rejects the notion that he had somehow lost his Democratic backbone in a spasm of post - 9/11 patriotism .
" I genuinely think he did a good job in the immediate aftermath of September 11 and up until Tora Bora , " Gore told me , referring to the battle in Afghanistan in December 2001 , when Osama bin Laden eluded US forces .
" And especially up until the invasion of Iraq , I think , he did a good job .
But then he blew it , in my opinion . "
Over the next few months , Gore turned away from politics , Tipper says , and shouldered as his " ministry " the campaign against global warming .
He went back to work on the climate - change slide show he had been giving since he was a junior congressman in the late ' 70s .
After earning little more than a government paycheck and book royalties for most of his career , he also started to make some serious money .
Indulging his lifetime fascination with " information ecology , " Gore took up an advisory post at Google in early 2001 , three years before its blockbuster IPO .
Later that year , he signed on with Metropolitan West Financial , a Los Angeles - based securities firm , as a rainmaker .
In March 2003 , he joined Apple 's board of directors .
The next year , Gore and a consortium of investors purchased a cable TV news network for a reported $ 70 million .
Then he teamed up with David Blood , the former CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management , to form an investment fund based on the principles of sustainability .
( The event was covered in the Financial Times under the irresistible headline " BLOOD AND GORE LAUNCH FIRM WITH A DIFFERENCE . " )
While the political press remained obsessed with Gore the loser ( underlined by his ill - timed endorsement of Howard Dean right before the candidate tanked ) , by 2004 Gore the neophyte businessman had built an impressive second act around his twin passions : technology and the environment .
" His new work leverages what he 's really good at , which is thinking deeply about the drivers of change and having a perspective on where companies need to go in a global business environment , " says Peter Knight , a longtime friend and adviser who is one of Gore 's partners at Generation .
" This turns out to be a wonderful convergence of his abilities and interests . "
Along with his bank account , the transition from public to private sector has also buoyed Gore 's wounded spirit .
" This is the Al that I 've known since we were teenagers , " Tipper says .
" How does that Joni Mitchell song go ?
' I was a free man in Paris , I felt unfettered and alive . '
That 's him . "
When Gore and I meet , it is , alas , not in Paris but at the St. Regis Hotel in San Francisco , where he and Tipper recently purchased a pied - à - terre .
Gore is dressed in his new uniform , looking very GQ in well - tailored trousers and a charcoal silk shirt , open at the collar .
He 's chucked the Brylcreem ; his hair is modishly parted and flops on his forehead .
At 58 , he looks younger ( though considerably heavier ) than he did a few years ago .
Earlier in the week , Gore had returned from a grueling lecture tour of Tokyo , Manila , Mumbai , and Jiddah , where he gave a speech accusing the Bush administration of " terrible abuses " against Arabs after the September 11 attacks .
Gore knew he would be pilloried for criticizing Bush on foreign soil , though he never could have predicted that a trigger - happy Dick Cheney would have blasted him , as it were , out of the headlines that week with even worse vice presidential news .
As he pops a beer and sprawls on a sleek leather lounger , Gore chortles at Cheney 's predicament .
I ask him how his ventures in cable television and sustainable investing are supposed to fit together .
Gore responds with a typically long and sometimes philosophical filibuster that eventually circles back to the question .
Central to Gore 's philosophy are two inextricable beliefs : first , that " the world is facing a planetary emergency , a climate crisis that is without precedent in all of human history . "
Second , that " the conversation of democracy is broken . "
Fix the latter , Gore argues , and the chances of remedying the former improve dramatically .
One reason Gore remains enthusiastic about his cable venture , Current TV , despite its startup pains and anemic reviews , is that he sees his fledgling network as busting the access monopoly that broadcast and cable outlets have held since television began .
" If you want to be Thomas Paine in the information age , " says Gore , " what do you do ?
You go to a studio , and then you can play a bit part in making a show about people who eat bugs .
The barriers to entry are impossibly high . "
Current TV , which already seems hopelessly overtaken by the proliferation of video - sharing Web sites like Google Video and YouTube ( see " The Wired Guide to the Online Video Explosion " ) , was conceived to give the audience the power to decide what should be carried on the network .
Programming consists largely of short videos submitted by its young viewers , giving the channel the disjointed flavor of home - movie night in the dorm :
A report on rebuilding with green materials in the wake of Hurricane Katrina might be followed by a clip on cockfighting in Puerto Rico and another featuring bikini - clad meter maids in Australia .
Make what you will of viewers ' tastes ;
Gore says Current TV is the answer to a crucial social challenge :
How do you open up the public dialog to individuals who are shut out of television ?
For all the early hype surrounding Current TV , the commercial venture that excites Gore most these days is Generation Investment Management , his global fund .
As governments begin imposing carbon caps on businesses , Gore says , free markets will reward companies that practice environmental sustainability .
The result : reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases responsible for global warming .
" As soon as business leaders get global warming or the environment at large , " he says , " they start seeing profit opportunities all over the place .
There is so much low - hanging fruit right now , it 's just ridiculous . "
So much , in fact , that early this year venture capitalist Doerr announced that his firm , Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , would launch a $ 100 million green - technology fund .
" Greentech could be the largest economic opportunity of the 21st century , " he said .
Though Generation invests in a wide range of companies , Gore and his team are especially bullish on the energy sector .
We 're on the verge of " a real gold rush " in renewables , conservation , and software for identifying and eliminating waste , he says .
" The whole economy is going to shift into a much more granular analysis of which matter is used for what , which streams of energy are used for what .
Where does it come from ?
Where does it go ?
Why are we now wasting more than 90 percent of it ? "
Gore shakes his head .
" The investments in doing it right are not costs - they 're profits . "
Make no mistake : Generation 's strategy is to beat the market , not just to feel good about socially responsible investing .
Gore 's partner at the firm , David Blood , is a legend in the London investment scene .
He retired as CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management in 2003 , at age 44 , after helping grow its assets from $ 50 billion to $ 325 billion in just seven years .
He , too , was casting about for a way to incorporate environmental and social values into traditional investment analysis .
The concept was n't an easy sell on Wall Street .
" As soon as you say ' sustainability , ' some people will roll their eyes and say , ' These guys are tree huggers and they run around in sandals and they are n't serious investors , ' " says Blood .
" But once they listen , there is no one who says this does n't make sense . "
Gore is fond of citing a maxim from psychologist Abraham Maslow : " If the only tool you have is a hammer , you tend to see every problem as a nail . "
The same principle , he says , applies to investing .
" If the only tool you have for measuring value is a quarterly financial report or a price tag , then everything that is excluded from that report or that comes without a price tag begins to look like it has no value . "
Solving the climate crisis , Gore says , will require a new set of market signals for investors .
" The precision with which labor and capital are measured and accounted for is in one category .
The precision with which nature is tracked and depreciated and cared for is something else again . "
Gore compares the voluminous but incomplete information that investors get to the intelligence briefings he used to receive each morning at the White House .
" These satellites are just parked out there , grabbing signals from all across the electromagnetic spectrum . "
But without bringing to bear his own human intelligence , incorporating information from elsewhere on the " spectrum of value , " the top secret satellite data would have made little sense .
" Now , in the same way , if you rely on financial reports that are constructed without regard to environmental factors , you 're excluding a lot , " he says .
" When you look at other parts of the spectrum of value , you get important information that 's directly relevant to the sustainable value of the company . "
As an example , Gore cites a Generation report on the auto industry .
Researchers analyzed traditional metrics , including sales and labor costs , but they also looked at the degree to which profits depended on high carbon output .
Two years before it became clear how badly General Motors and Ford were performing , the Generation team calculated that Toyota , a more carbon - conscious company with better labor relations , would gain a $ 1,500 advantage per vehicle as government - mandated fuel efficiency and carbon emission standards come into effect .
GM 's reliance on gas - guzzling SUVs made money in the short term .
But the company 's inability ( or refusal ) to position itself ahead of the coming carbon - regulation regime economy was a barometer of poor strategic thinking .
Generation likes to use this sort of nontraditional analysis .
When considering an investment in an energy company with operations in the Rocky Mountain area , for instance , fund analysts looked to community blogs , where they found considerable local opposition to the company 's strategy .
" That business plan had a huge vulnerability that was outside the scope of its financial reports , " Gore says .
" I often say , ' It 's really just common sense . '
But common sense is not as common as it should be .
Our whole mission is to make it mainstream . "
Gore and his Generation partners base their investments on long - term research , looking ahead up to five years , and they have agreed not to take any profits themselves until three years into any investment .
The firm began investing client money in April 2005 ( it now manages around $ 200 million in assets ) , and Gore , while declining to give specific figures , says the returns thus far have been " really gratifying , I mean really exciting . "
Initial investments include companies involved in photovoltaics , wind turbines , wave energy , and solar power .
The firm put money into BP , betting on its new power plant in Scotland that injects carbon emissions back into the ground .
It 's the kind of technology Generation sees as having a competitive advantage in a carbon - constrained economy .
Generation 's overriding goal , of course , is to make money for its investors .
But Gore and his partners also believe the firm can help innovative businesses attract even more funding .
The idea is to draw capital away from the fossil - fueled economy and direct it toward new and profitable centers of the sustainable economy .
" We 're trying to get Wall Street to wake up , " says Colin le Duc , who heads Generation 's London - based research team .
" I want to be able to sit there with the hardest - nosed , most skeptical investment fund manager in New York and say , ' We beat the market by 20 percent , and you can , too . ' "
The Gores and all the employees of Generation lead a " carbon - neutral " lifestyle , reducing their energy consumption when possible and purchasing so - called offsets available on newly emerging carbon markets .
Gore says he and Tipper regularly calculate their home and business energy use - including the carbon cost of his prodigious global travel .
Then he purchases offsets equal to the amount of carbon emissions they generate .
Last year , for example , Gore and Tipper atoned for their estimated 1 million miles in global air travel by giving money to an Indian solar electric company and a Bulgarian hydroelectric project .
Carbon offsets are still an imperfect tool , favored only by a few early adopters .
( An Inconvenient Truth directs viewers to a personal carbon calculator posted at www.climatecrisis.net.)
Gore acknowledges that the average US consumer is n't likely to join what is , for now , essentially a voluntary taxation system .
" The real answer is going to come in the marketplace , " he says .
" When the capitalist market system starts working for us instead of at cross- purposes , then the economy will start pushing inexorably toward lower and lower levels of pollution and higher and higher levels of efficiency .
The main thing that 's needed is to get the information flows right , removing the distortions and paying attention to the incentives . "
It is Friday afternoon at the TED conference in Monterey , California , the annual four - day , four - star schmooze - fest of the tech and design elite .
Motivational speaker Tony Robbins is onstage , asking the TEDsters for reasons people commonly give when they fail .
The answers are mostly predictable : bad management , not enough money , lack of time .
Then Gore , who 's sitting just a few feet from the stage , shouts , " The Supreme Court . "
Everyone roars with laughter .
Robbins wheels on Gore .
If he'd shown more passion , Robbins chides , " you 'd have kicked his ass and won ! "
Everyone , Gore included , roars again - but the point is taken .
These days ,
Gore speaks with a verve and conviction that were often sorely absent during his political days .
From time to time , he fires broadsides at the Bush administration - for its warrantless domestic wiretapping program , for the interrogation methods used against al Qaeda suspects rounded up in Iraq and Afghanistan - usually , he says , " when I get to the point where I can't stand not making a speech and unburdening myself . "
But most of Gore 's public energies are directed toward his campaign against global warming , which he , like Tipper , describes in evangelical terms as " my mission . "
As vice president , and then as a candidate for president , Gore enjoyed a retinue of advisers , Secret Service agents , schedulers , and speechwriters .
Save for one harried , full - time assistant , that 's all gone now , a change that Gore seems to relish .
On New Year 's Eve 2005 , he was home in Nashville with Tipper , hunched behind two 30 - inch hi-def Apple displays , trying to finish his book on climate change .
As he completed a page , Tipper would grab it from the printer and cram it into a three - ring binder .
Finally , at 10:30 pm , the manuscript was finished , and Tipper raced down the driveway to hand it to a waiting courier .
" I told Al , ' This is just the way it was when we started , ' " she says , recounting the story for me without a shred of pathos .
" ' Just the two of us . ' "
These glimpses into what , for years , has been zealously guarded privacy are Gore 's way of letting the world know that he has adapted quite comfortably to his life after politics .
The inevitable queries about whether he plans to run again are batted aside with another one - liner : " I like to think of myself as a recovering politician .
I 'm on about step nine . "
During the question - and - answer session following his climate lecture at TED , Gore confesses , " I was n't a very good politician . "
" Well , you won ! " someone shouts from the audience .
" Oh , well , " Gore deadpans in a Saturday Night Live imitation of himself .
" There is that . "
Since his defeat in 2000 , Gore has developed an impressive arsenal of self - deprecating ripostes to protect himself against misplaced pity .
" The elephant in the room is always , How does he feel about the election ? " film director Davis Guggenheim says .
" You kind of suspect this guy is pissed off and dug in .
And what he 's saying right off is ' I 've moved on , and I want you to move on with me .
I need you to laugh about it , too . '
And then he gets them to listen to what they need to hear . "
At TED , before offering his remedies for global warming , Gore acknowledges the elephant with a wicked stand - up routine - punctuated by faux crying jags - about the indignities of leaving public office .
His shtick includes having to explain to Bill Clinton an erroneous Nigerian wire service report that he and Tipper had decided to open a chain of Shoney 's eateries ( prompting a letter of congratulations from the former president ) and the " phantom limb " pain he feels when he looks in the rearview mirror and does n't see his motorcade .
Reality is just as funny .
Last year , while traveling on business , Gore stopped at a restaurant .
A woman kept walking slowly past his booth to stare .
Finally she stopped .
" You know , if you dyed your hair black , you 'd look just like Al Gore , " she said .
" Why , thank you , ma'am , " Gore , ever the straight man , responded .
" And your imitation of him is pretty good , too , " she said .
This spring marks a coming - out of sorts for Gore , no longer a candidate for anything , but campaigning nonetheless to change American attitudes about global warming .
Gore says he will channel earnings from his upcoming book and movie into a " mass persuasion " offensive .
Together with An Inconvenient Truth producer Laurie David and a coalition of major environmental , business , labor , and religious groups , Gore wants to make climate crisis a household phrase .
They plan a three - pronged Internet , television , and print advertising campaign to provoke wide - reaching changes in consumer and business behavior and to force shifts in government policy .
He 'll bring an army of surrogate speakers to Nashville , where he and Tipper will equip them with the slide show and train them to deliver the lecture .
During the opening sequence of the documentary , Gore confesses ruefully : " I 've been trying to tell this story for a long time , and I feel as if I have failed to get the message across . "
For Al Gore , it 's the race of his life .

Demar has been in and out of prison so many times he has lost count of his convictions .
" Being drunk , being disorderly , trespass , assault and battery ; you name it , I did it .
How many times I been in jail ?
I do n't know , I was locked up so much it was my second home . "
Demar has been taking part in a clinical trial at the US government 's National Institutes for Health , near Washington .
The study is investigating the effects of omega - 3 fatty acid supplements on the brain , and the pills that have effected Demar 's " miracle " are doses of fish oil .
The results emerging from this study are at the cutting edge of the debate on crime and punishment .
In Britain we lock up more people than ever before .
Nearly 80,000 people are now in our prisons , which reached their capacity this week .
But the new research calls into question the very basis of criminal justice and the notion of culpability .
It suggests that individuals may not always be responsible for their aggression .
Taken together with a study in a high - security prison for young offenders in the UK , it shows that violent behaviour may be attributable at least in part to nutritional deficiencies .
The UK prison trial at Aylesbury jail showed that when young men there were fed multivitamins , minerals and essential fatty acids , the number of violent offences they committed in the prison fell by 37 % .
Although no one is suggesting that poor diet alone can account for complex social problems , the former chief inspector of prisons Lord Ramsbotham says that he is now " absolutely convinced that there is a direct link between diet and antisocial behaviour , both that bad diet causes bad behaviour and that good diet prevents it . "
The Dutch government is currently conducting a large trial to see if nutritional supplements have the same effect on its prison population .
And this week , new claims were made that fish oil had improved behaviour and reduced aggression among children with some of the most severe behavioural difficulties in the UK .
Deficiency
For the clinician in charge of the US study , Joseph Hibbeln , the results of his trial are not a miracle , but simply what you might predict if you understand the biochemistry of the brain and the biophysics of the brain cell membrane .
His hypothesis is that modern industrialised diets may be changing the very architecture and functioning of the brain .
We are suffering , he believes , from widespread diseases of deficiency .
Just as vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy , deficiency in the essential fats the brain needs and the nutrients needed to metabolise those fats is causing of a host of mental problems from depression to aggression .
Not all experts agree , but if he is right , the consequences are as serious as they could be .
The pandemic of violence in western societies may be related to what we eat or fail to eat .
Junk food may not only be making us sick , but mad and bad too .
In Demar 's case the aggression has blighted many lives .
He has attacked his wife .
" Once she put my TV out the door , I snapped off and smacked her . "
His last spell in prison was for a particularly violent assault .
" I tried to kill a person .
Then I knew something need be done because I was half a hundred and I was either going to kill somebody or get killed . "
Demar 's brain has blanked out much of that last attack .
He can remember that a man propositioned him for sex , but the details of his own response are hazy .
When he came out of jail after that , he bought a can of beer and seemed headed for more of the same until a case worker who had seen adverts for Hibbeln 's trial persuaded him to take part .
The researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , which is part of NIH , had placed adverts for aggressive alcoholics in the Washington Post in 2001 .
Some 80 volunteers came forward and have since been enrolled in the double blind study .
They have ranged from homeless people to a teacher to a former secret service agent .
Following a period of three weeks ' detoxification on a locked ward , half were randomly assigned to 2 grams per day of the omega - 3 fatty acids EPA and DHA for three months , and half to placebos of fish - flavoured corn oil .
An earlier pilot study on 30 patients with violent records found that those given omega - 3 supplements had their anger reduced by one - third , measured by standard scales of hostility and irritability , regardless of whether they were relapsing and drinking again .
The bigger trial is nearly complete now and Dell Wright , the nurse administering the pills , has seen startling changes in those on the fish oil rather than the placebo .
" When Demar came in there was always an undercurrent of aggression in his behaviour .
Once he was on the supplements he took on the ability not to be impulsive .
He kept saying , ' This is not like me ' . "
Demar has been out of trouble and sober for a year now .
He has a girlfriend , his own door key , and was made employee of the month at his company recently .
Others on the trial also have long histories of violence but with omega - 3 fatty acids have been able for the first time to control their anger and aggression .
J , for example , arrived drinking a gallon of rum a day and had 28 scars on his hand from punching other people .
Now he is calm and his cravings have gone .
W was a 19st barrel of a man with convictions for assault and battery .
He improved dramatically on the fish oil and later told doctors that for the first time since the age of five he had managed to go three months without punching anyone in the head .
Threat to society
Hibbeln is a psychiatrist and physician , but as an employee of the US government at the NIH he wears the uniform of a commander , with his decorations for service pinned to his chest .
As we queued to get past the post - 9/11 security checks at the NIH federal base , he explained something of his view of the new threat to society .
Over the last century most western countries have undergone a dramatic shift in the composition of their diets in which the omega - 3 fatty acids that are essential to the brain have been flooded out by competing omega - 6 fatty acids , mainly from industrial oils such as soya , corn , and sunflower .
In the US , for example , soya oil accounted for only 0.02 % of all calories available in 1909 , but by 2000 it accounted for 20 % .
Americans have gone from eating a fraction of an ounce of soya oil a year to downing 25 lbs ( 11.3 kg ) per person per year in that period .
In the UK , omega - 6 fats from oils such as soya , corn , and sunflower accounted for 1 % of energy supply in the early 1960s , but by 2000 they were nearly 5 % .
These omega - 6 fatty acids come mainly from industrial frying for takeaways , ready meals and snack foods such as crisps , chips , biscuits , ice - creams and from margarine .
Alcohol , meanwhile , depletes omega - 3s from the brain .
To test the hypothesis , Hibbeln and his colleagues have mapped the growth in consumption of omega - 6 fatty acids from seed oils in 38 countries since the 1960s against the rise in murder rates over the same period .
In all cases there is an unnerving match .
As omega - 6 goes up , so do homicides in a linear progression .
Industrial societies where omega - 3 consumption has remained high and omega - 6 low because people eat fish , such as Japan , have low rates of murder and depression .
Of course , all these graphs prove is that there is a striking correlation between violence and omega 6 - fatty acids in the diet .
They do n't prove that high omega - 6 and low omega - 3 fat consumption actually causes violence .
Moreover , many other things have changed in the last century and been blamed for rising violence - exposure to violence in the media , the breakdown of the family unit and increased consumption of sugar , to take a few examples .
But some of the trends you might expect to be linked to increased violence - such as availability of firearms and alcohol , or urbanisation - do not in fact reliably predict a rise in murder across countries , according to Hibbeln .
There has been a backlash recently against the hype surrounding omega - 3 in the UK from scientists arguing that the evidence remains sketchy .
Part of the backlash stems from the eagerness of some supplement companies to suggest that fish oils work might wonders even on children who have no behavioural problems .
Alan Johnson , the education secretary , appeared to be jumping on the bandwagon recently when he floated the idea of giving fish oils to all school children .
The idea was quickly knocked down when the food standards agency published a review of the evidence on the effect of nutrition on learning among schoolchildren and concluded there was not enough to conclude much , partly because very few scientific trials have been done .
Professor John Stein , of the department of physiology at Oxford University , where much of the UK research on omega - 3 fatty acid deficiencies has been based , agrees : " There is only slender evidence that children with no particular problem would benefit from fish oil .
And I would always say [ for the general population ] it 's better to get omega - 3 fatty acids by eating fish , which carries all the vitamins and minerals needed to metabolise them . "
However , he believes that the evidence from the UK prison study and from Hibbeln 's research in the US on the link between nutritional deficiency and crime is " strong " , although the mechanisms involved are still not fully understood .
Hibbeln , Stein and others have been investigating what the mechanisms of a causal relationship between diet and aggression might be .
This is where the biochemistry and biophysics comes in .
Essential fatty acids are called essential because humans cannot make them but must obtain them from the diet .
The brain is a fatty organ - it 's 60 % fat by dry weight , and the essential fatty acids are what make part of its structure , making up 20 % of the nerve cells ' membranes .
The synapses , or junctions where nerve cells connect with other nerve cells , contain even higher concentrations of essential fatty acids - being made of about 60 % of the omega - 3 fatty acid DHA .
Communication between the nerve cells depends on neurotransmitters , such as serotonin and dopamine , docking with receptors in the nerve cell membrane .
Omega -3 DHA is very long and highly flexible .
When it is incorporated into the nerve cell membrane it helps make the membrane itself elastic and fluid so that signals pass through it efficiently .
But if the wrong fatty acids are incorporated into the membrane , the neurotransmitters can't dock properly .
We know from many other studies what happens when the neurotransmitter systems do n't work efficiently .
Low serotonin levels are known to predict an increased risk of suicide , depression and violent and impulsive behaviour .
And dopamine is what controls the reward processes in the brain .
Laboratory tests at NIH have shown that the composition of tissue and in particular of the nerve cell membrane of people in the US is different from that of the Japanese , who eat a diet rich in omega - 3 fatty acids from fish .
Americans have cell membranes higher in the less flexible omega - 6 fatty acids , which appear to have displaced the elastic omega - 3 fatty acids found in Japanese nerve cells .
Hibbeln 's theory is that because the omega - 6 fatty acids compete with the omega - 3 fatty acids for the same metabolic pathways , when omega - 6 dominates in the diet , we can't convert the omega - 3s to DHA and EPA , the longer chain versions we need for the brain .
What seems to happen then is that the brain picks up a more rigid omega - 6 fatty acid DPA instead of DHA to build the cell membranes - and they do n't function so well .
Other experts blame the trans fats produced by partial hydrogenation of industrial oils for processed foods .
Trans fats have been shown to interfere with the synthesis of essentials fats in foetuses and infants .
Minerals such as zinc and the B vitamins are needed to metabolise essential fats , so deficiencies in these may be playing an important part too .
There is also evidence that deficiencies in DHA / EPA at times when the brain is developing rapidly - in the womb , in the first 5 years of life and at puberty - can affect its architecture permanently .
Animal studies have shown that those deprived of omega - 3 fatty acids over two generations have offspring who cannot release dopamine and serotonin so effectively .
" The extension of all this is that if children are left with low dopamine as a result of early deficits in their own or their mother 's diets , they cannot experience reward in the same way and they cannot learn from reward and punishment .
If their serotonin levels are low , they cannot inhibit their impulses or regulate their emotional responses , " Hibbeln points out .
Mental health
Here too you have one possible factor in cycles of deprivation ( again , no one is suggesting diet is the only factor ) and why criminal behaviour is apparently higher among lower socio- economic groups where nutrition is likely to be poorer .
These effects of the industrialisation of the diet on the brain were also predicted in the 1970s by a leading fats expert in the UK , Professor Michael Crawford , now at London 's Metropolitan University .
He established that DHA was structural to the brain and foresaw that deficiencies would lead to a surge in mental health and behavioural problems - a prediction borne out by the UK 's mental health figures .
It was two decades later before the first study of the effect of diet on behaviour took place in a UK prison .
Bernard Gesch , now a senior researcher at Stein 's Oxford laboratory , first became involved with nutrition and its relationship to crime as a director of the charity Natural Justice in northwest England .
He was supervising persistent offenders in the community and was struck by their diets .
He later set out to test the idea that poor diet might cause antisocial behaviour and crime in the maximum security Aylesbury prison .
His study , a placebo - controlled double blind randomised trial , took 231 volunteer prisoners and assigned half to a regime of multivitamin , mineral and essential fatty acid supplements and half to placebos .
The supplement aimed to bring the prisoners ' intakes of nutrients up to the level recommended by government .
It was not specifically a fatty acid trial , and Gesch points out that nutrition is not pharmacology but involves complex interactions of many nutrients .
Prison trial
Aylesbury was at the time a prison for young male offenders , aged 17 to 21 , convicted of the most serious crimes .
Trevor Hussey was then deputy governor and remembers it being a tough environment .
" It was a turbulent young population .
They had problems with their anger .
They were all crammed into a small place and even though it was well run you got a higher than normal number of assaults on staff and other prisoners . "
Although the governor was keen on looking at the relationship between diet and crime , Hussey remembers being sceptical himself at the beginning of the study .
The catering manager was good , and even though prisoners on the whole preferred white bread , meat and confectionery to their fruit and veg , the staff tried to encourage prisoners to eat healthily , so he did n't expect to see much of a result .
But quite quickly staff noticed a significant drop in the number of reported incidents of bad behaviour .
" We 'd just introduced a policy of ' earned privileges ' so we thought it must be that rather than a few vitamins , but we used to joke ' maybe it 's Bernard 's pills ' . "
But when the trial finished it became clear that the drop in incidents of bad behaviour applied only to those on the supplements and not to those on the placebo .
The results , published in 2002 , showed that those receiving the extra nutrients committed 37 % fewer serious offences involving violence , and 26 % fewer offences overall .
Those on the placebos showed no change in their behaviour .
Once the trial had finished the number of offences went up by the same amount .
The office the researchers had used to administer nutrients was restored to a restraint room after they had left .
" The supplements improved the functioning of those prisoners .
It was clearly something significant that can't be explained away .
I was disappointed the results were not latched on to .
We put a lot of effort into improving prisoners ' chances of not coming back in , and you measure success in small doses . "
Gesch believes we should be rethinking the whole notion of culpability .
The overall rate of violent crime in the UK has risen since the 1950s , with huge rises since the 1970s .
" Such large changes are hard to explain in terms of genetics or simply changes of reporting or recording crime .
One plausible candidate to explain some of the rapid rise in crime could be changes in the brain 's environment .
What would the future have held for those 231 young men if they had grown up with better nourishment ? "
Gesch says .
He said he was currently unable to comment on any plans for future research in prisons , but studies with young offenders in the community are being planned .
For Hibbeln , the changes in our diet in the past century are " a very large uncontrolled experiment that may have contributed to the societal burden of aggression , depression and cardiovascular death " .
To ask whether we have enough evidence to change diets is to put the question the wrong way round .
Whoever said it was safe to change them so radically in the first place ?
Young offender 's diet
One young offender had been sentenced by the British courts on 13 occasions for stealing trucks in the early hours of the morning .
Bernard Gesch recorded the boy 's daily diet as follows :
Breakfast : nothing ( asleep )
Mid morning : nothing ( asleep )
Lunchtime : 4 or 5 cups of coffee with milk and 2 ½ heaped teaspoons of sugar
Mid afternoon : 3 or 4 cups of coffee with milk and 2 ½ heaped sugars
Tea : chips , egg , ketchup , 2 slices of white bread , 5 cups of tea or coffee with milk and sugar
Evening : 5 cups of tea or coffee with milk and sugar , 20 cigarettes , £ 2 worth of sweets , cakes and if money available 3 or 4 pints of beer .
After all that perfect chocolate chip cookie baking , what 's the use when your batch goes stale in a matter of days ?
Cookies are great out of the oven , but biting into a hard crumbly mass later in the week is no fun .
That 's why you need to understand the science of cookie osmosis , or How to Keep Cookies Fresh .
The trick is simple : place a slice of fresh bread in with your cookies a day or two after you 've baked them , or whenever you find their texture has deteriorated .
The moisture from the fresh bread will migrate to your cookies ( through cookie osmosis , see diagram above ) , rendering them soft and chewable again .
It will literally unstaleify them !
Story Highlights • Russian prosecutors say they will refuse to extradite Andrei Lugovoi
• Ex-KGB agent charged with murder of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko
• Litvinenko died in London after being poisoned with radioactive Polonium - 210
• He blamed President Putin for his poisoning -- an allegation the Kremlin denied
Adjust font size :
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Russian prosecutors say they will refuse to extradite Andrei Lugovoi , charged by Britain in the poisoning death of Alexander Litvinenko , to London because of a constitutional ban .
Earlier Tuesday British officials said they wanted to bring Lugovoi before a British court and charge him with the " extraordinarily grave crime " of murdering Litvinenko in London last November .
" I have today concluded that the evidence sent to us by the police is sufficient to charge Andrei Lugovoi with the murder of Mr. Litvinenko by deliberate poisoning , " Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald said in London .
Litvinenko , who was a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin and had been granted political asylum in the UK , died in a London hospital last November , several weeks after he was poisoned with polonium - 210 .
The case has put pressure on relations between London and Moscow , and Tuesday 's announcement threatened to aggravate the situation further .
Britain urged Moscow to cooperate in the case .
" Russia should comply with our legal request , " Prime Minister Tony Blair 's spokesman said .
However , the response from the Russian prosecutor - general 's office appeared to rule out extradition .
" In line with article 61 of Russia 's constitution , a Russian cannot be handed over to another state , " spokeswoman Marina Gridneva told reporters .
But she said Lugovoi could be tried in Russia .
" At the same time , in line with the European convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal cases and Russian criminal law , a citizen who has committed a crime on the territory of a foreign country can be held criminally responsible ... but only on Russian territory , " Gridneva said .
A lawmaker in Russia 's upper house of parliament , meanwhile , said he doubted that Russian law prevented such extraditions , according to The Associated Press .
Speaking on Ekho Moskvy radio , Yuri Sharandin , chairman of the Federation Council 's constitutional legislation committee , said the European convention allowed for such extraditions , but also gives the country receiving the request the right to refuse .
Both Russia and Britain are signatories to the convention .
Lugovoi had met Litvinenko in London on November 1 at the Millennium Hotel bar , hours before the 43 - year - old fell ill .
On Tuesday Russian media cited Lugovoi as saying the British murder charge against him was politically motivated .
" I consider this decision ( by prosecutors ) politically motivated , " the state - owned Itar - Tass news agency quoted Lugovoi as saying .
" I did not kill Litvinenko , have nothing to do with his death and can prove with facts my distrust of the so - called evidence collected by Britain 's justice system . "
' Howl of protest '
Litvinenko , who had a 12 - year - old son , released a deathbed statement blaming the Russian president for involvement in his poisoning -- an allegation the Kremlin denied .
Litvinenko said : " You may succeed in silencing one man , but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate , Mr. Putin , in your ears for the rest of your life .
" May God forgive you for what you have done , not only to me , but to beloved Russia and its people . "
Litvinenko's widow said Tuesday she hoped justice would now be done .
" I would like to thank the police and the CPS for all their hard work in investigating the murder of my husband , " Marina Litvinenko said .
She later met Russia 's ambassador in London .
" I am now very anxious to see that justice is really done and that Mr. Lugovoi is extradited and brought to trial in a UK court , " she said .
Lugovoi , a former security service agent but now a businessman , traveled to London three times in the month before Litvinenko 's death and met him four times , Russian media reported .
Lugovoi and businessman Dmitry Kovtun told Russian media they went to London with a group of Moscow soccer fans and met Litvinenko briefly on November 1 to discuss business .
Later , they attended a football match between CSKA Moscow and Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in north London , where polonium - 210 was detected .
A trail of radiation was also detected at other locations in the city , prompting several buildings to be closed .
Some British Airways flights were grounded over fears they might be contaminated .
Hundreds of people were tested by health officials for radiation .
Seventeen people tested positive , but authorities said the risk to their health was low .
Meteorite fragments were recovered from the frozen Tagish Lake
Scientists say that " bubbles " like those in the Tagish Lake meteorite may have helped along chemical processes important for the emergence of life .
The globules could also be older than our Solar System - their chemistry suggests they formed at about - 260C , near " absolute zero " .
Details of the work by Nasa scientists are published in the journal Science .
Analysis of the bubbles shows they arrived on Earth in the meteorite and are not terrestrial contaminants .
These hollow spheres could have provided a protective envelope for the raw organic molecules needed for life .
Dr Lindsay Keller of Nasa 's Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) in Houston , Texas , told BBC News that some scientists believed such structures were " a step in the right direction " to making a cell wall .
But he emphasised that the globules in Tagish Lake were in no way equivalent to a cell .
The hollow spheres seem to be empty , but they do have organic molecules on their surfaces .
Mike Zolensky , a Nasa mineralogist , commented : " If , as we suspect , this type of meteorite has been falling on to Earth throughout its entire history , then the Earth was seeded with these organic globules at the same time life was first forming here . "
Co-author Keiko Nakamura - Messenger of JSC told BBC
News : " We reported only 26 globules in this paper , because they are small and hard to analyse .
But we have seen hundreds in a small area .
We can estimate that there are billions of them in this meteorite . "
The ratios of different forms , or isotopes , of the elements hydrogen and nitrogen in the meteorite are very unusual , which suggests the structures did not come from Earth , say the scientists .
" The isotopic ratios in these globules show that they formed at temperatures of about - 260C , near absolute zero , " said co-author Scott Messenger , also from Johnson Space Center .
" The organic molecules most likely originated in the cold molecular cloud that gave birth to our Solar System , or at the outermost reaches of the early Solar System . "
The Tagish Lake meteorite was collected immediately after its fall over Canada in 2000 .
It has been maintained in a frozen state , minimising the potential for terrestrial contamination .
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was among the speakers on Wednesday at a forum about crime in the cities , sponsored by The New York Post .
The Mayor discussed how crime and law enforcement had changed in New York over several decades , and how society had changed .
Here is an excerpt , as transcribed by The New York Times .
We constantly present the false impression that government can solve problems that government in America was designed not to solve .
Families are significantly less important in the development of children today than they were 30 or 40 years ago .
Religion has less influence than it did 30 or 40 years ago .
Communities do n't mean what they meant 30 or 40 years ago .
As Americans , we 're not sure we share values .
We 're sometimes even afraid to use the word values .
We talk about teaching ethics in schools -- people say , " What ethics ?
Whose ethics ?
Maybe we can't . "
And they confuse that with teaching of religion .
And we are afraid to reaffirm the basics upon which a lawful and a decent society are based .
We 're almost embarrassed by it .
We look upon authority too often and focus over and over again , for 30 or 40 or 50 years , as if there is something wrong with authority .
We see only the oppressive side of authority .
Maybe it comes out of our history and our background .
What we do n't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want , be anything they can be .
Freedom is about authority .
Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do .
A storm is brewing half a billion miles away and in a rare event , astronomers get to watch it closely .
Jupiter is growing a new red spot and the Hubble Space Telescope is photographing the scene .
Backyard astronomers have been following the action , too .
" Red Spot Jr. " as it is being called , formed after three white oval - shaped storms - two of which were at least 90 years old - merged between 1998 and 2000 .
A similar merger took place centuries ago and formed the bigger and legendary Great Red Spot , a storm twice as big as Earth and almost 300 years old .

Close inspections of Red Spot Jr. , in Hubble images released today , reveal that similar to the Great Red Spot , the more recently developed storm rises above the top of the main cloud deck on Jupiter .

Little is known about how storms form on the giant planet .
They are often described as behaving similar to hurricanes on Earth .
Some astronomers believe that the spots dredge up material deep below Jupiter 's clouds and lift it to where the Sun 's ultraviolet light chemically alters it to give it a red hue .
The latest images could provide evidence that Jupiter is in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit on different parts of the globe .
The study was led jointly by Imke de Pater and Philip Marcus of University of California , Berkeley .
" The storm is growing in altitude , " de Pater said .
" Before when they were just ovals they did n't stick out above the clouds .
Now they are rising . "
This growth signals a temperature increase in that region , she said .
Marking change
The global change cycle began when the last of the white oval - shaped storms formed south of the Great Red Spot in 1939 .
As the storms started to merge between 1998 and 2000 , the mixing of heat began to slow down at that latitude and has continued slowing ever since .
The movement of heat from the equator to Jupiter 's south pole is expected to stop at 34 degrees southern latitude , where Red Spot Jr. is forming .
This will create a big wall and stop the mixing of heat and airflow , the thinking goes .
As a result , areas around the equator become warmer , while the poles can start to cool down .

Blair could make a lot of money as an ex-PM
When Tony Blair leaves Number 10 on Wednesday he will be much better off than Winston Churchill was when he became an ex-prime minister in 1945 - after winning the war and losing the general election .
" My grandfather was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war , " says the great man 's grandson - also called Winston Churchill .
Churchill was forced to put his home , Chartwell in Kent , on the market .
" Lord Camrose , the then proprietor of the Daily Telegraph was outraged , " says young Winston .
" And he corralled 10 wealthy well - wishers and they each ponied up the princely sum of £ 5,000 .
" So for £ 55,000 - which was a lot of money in those days - they bought Chartwell on the understanding that my grandparents would live there until the end of their days and then it would be presented to the nation . "
' Cut off '
In contrast to Churchill , Blair will receive a severance package from the state worth some £ 300,000 a year .
Thanks to some astute lobbying by other ex-PMs , Blair will get a car , a police driver and round - the - clock special branch protection .
He will also receive an immediate prime - ministerial pension of almost £ 64,000 a year as well as a further £ 84,000 to run his office - on top of what he makes as an MP .
But how will Blair cope with life in the ex-prime ministers ' club , after what his predecessor John Major describes as the longest farewell tour since Dame Nelly Melba ?
Sir Winston Churchill was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war
One of Blair 's closest advisers inside Number 10 told me : " Tony still does n't know what is going to hit him .
" The thing he will miss most of all is being cut off from top - grade information .
" He will no longer receive secret intelligence reports and papers and briefings which tell him what is really going on - both in Britain and the rest of the world . "
When I put this to John Major - a rueful smile of recognition came over his face .
He produced an answer worthy of Donald Rumsfeld : " People ask you questions and you 're about to answer and you think to yourself , ' hang on , I 'm about to express an opinion on this and I have n't seen the papers .
I do n't know what it is that the prime minister knows that I no longer know ' .
" So here am I about to say that I think he should have handled this differently , but he may know something that I once would have known that nobody else knows . "
' Disorientating experience '
Blair will also face the practical problems of adapting to the loss of the life - support system provided by Number 10 .
" When you stop being prime minister it 's a very disorienting experience , because you go in such a short period of time from having everything arranged for you to being on your own , " says Lord Powell , who was Margaret Thatcher 's right - hand man for seven years when she was prime minister .
You are very ex as an ex-prime minister
Former Tory cabinet minister Ken Clarke
" You do n't have an up - to - date telephone book of your own because of course Number 10 had all your telephone numbers .
Code numbers have probably changed since you came in .
" I remember being rung up by Margaret Thatcher a week or two after she left Number 10 and being told on a Sunday she had a plumbing problem .
And I said ' oh dear , better get a plumber in ' .
And a long silence .
' How do I do that ? ' ' Well ' , I said , ' try the Yellow Pages ' .
And that 's the way we had to go .
I ended up ringing the plumber in the Yellow Pages . "
The biggest question of all is how to fill the suddenly empty days .
The former Tory cabinet minister , Ken Clarke , who as an MP since 1970 has watched five prime ministers come and go says : " Like a departing captain of industry , Tony will want the next big job in the career .
" In his case I think it will be trying to govern the world and advise all the other political leaders how to run things .
And he 'll find that difficult , because you are very ex as an ex-prime minister . "
Baroness
Thatcher was not used to dealing with mundane matters
Blair 's meeting with the Pope on Saturday is one key to what he plans to do .
According to one of Blair 's closest advisers : " Tony is obsessed with the idea of becoming a roving envoy who would seek to reconcile the Abrahamic religions of Christianity , Judaism and Islam . "
Blair sought Papal endorsement for his plans to set up an inter - faith foundation - headed by himself .
And there are also strong hopes in the White House of Blair becoming a Middle East peace negotiator on behalf of the West .
Ken Clarke scoffs at these ideas : " Not that Tony would ask for my advice , but if he did I would say , ' forget about reconciling the faiths .
You have disqualified yourself from that in a very big way ' . "
Memoirs goldmine
Blair 's former press secretary Alastair Campbell is unsurprisingly more sanguine .
" There are all sorts of things Tony will do in the future , " he says .
" He is 54 - while Gladstone and Churchill were in their 80s when they left office .
And if you look at someone like Bill Clinton and Al Gore and you see what they have achieved since leaving office - Tony 's going to want some of that : to still be involved and focus on the big international stuff - like climate change and Africa . "
An ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics
Former prime minister John Major
But Blair is also sitting on a goldmine - his memoirs .
Campbell has long described his own diaries as his pension .
Blair 's will be worth many times more .
I asked Campbell 's literary agent , Ed Victor , the New Yorker who 's now the top London literary agent to the superstars , how much he thought Blair would get .
" £5 m - plus or minus , " replied Victor .
" And he should sell his memoirs immediately he steps down .
Ronald Reagan did the deal the day after he left office , and that was very smart .
Thatcher waited and I think she got less money as a result . "
Blair will also have to decide on whether to stay involved in domestic politics or whether he will sign a peace treaty with Gordon Brown .
" An ex-prime minister 's a rather unusual fish in politics , " says John Major .
" If they say nothing , what are they doing there ?
If they say something , there 's every chance it will be construed as an oblique attack on your successor .
So it is extremely difficult to have a role that is n't capable of severe misinterpretation . "
I think Tony Blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 ( £ 75,000 ) per lecture in America
Literary agent Ed Victor
" I certainly do n't think Tony will be hanging around , backseat driving on Gordon , " says Alastair Campbell .
One sure way that Blair can make big bucks outside politics is by following his wife 's footsteps on the American lecture circuit .
Although the rapture that once greeted him after 9/11 has waned , Blair remains the most popular and recognisable British public figure there since Lady Thatcher .
He would wow US lecture audiences .
" And the lecture circuit has another purpose for you as an ex-prime minister .
When you have been used to public adulation , at least appearing before wildly enthusiastic audiences of hundreds of Americans in Tuscaloosa or elsewhere , still has a nice role in your life .
" It makes you think you are still admired and wanted - and psychologically it's a great compensation for the loss of office . "
" I think Tony Blair would make a minimum of $ 150,000 ( £ 75,000 ) per lecture in America : all expenses paid , flown there first class , put up in a nice suite , " says Ed Victor .
" If he does 10 a year - say one a month - he will be making huge , huge money . "
Finding happiness
But can all the money in the world make up for the loss of the most political drug of all - power ?
Alastair Campbell says Blair will focus on the " big international stuff "
" I do n't know whether you can be happy after being prime minister , but I can tell you that I do n't believe Margaret Thatcher has not had a happy day in her life since she ceased being prime minister , " says Charles Powell .
It may take you a very long time to adjust fully to no longer being the most powerful person in the land .
For the one thing all members of the ex-prime ministers ' club have in common is that they have lost the most exciting job that they will ever have .
Ken Clarke sums it up : " I think almost all of them , if you said that , by some amazing miracle , you could go back tomorrow and you could be prime minister again and take on all that hassle , and all that strain , and all that criticism , and all those crises , they 'd all have jumped at it and gone straight back straight away . "
How to be ex-Prime Minister , Michael Cockerell 's TV documentary , will be shown on BBC Four on Sunday at 2100BST .
Cocktail
It ’s Saturday night and the Bistro ’s jamming .
I ’m heading to the men ’s room when Beth , a fellow waiter , intercepts me .
“ I need help , ” she squeaks , “ I ’m going into the weeds . ”
“ Whatcha need ? ” I offer gallantly .
My piss can wait a minute .
“ Do you know how to make a Sidecar ? ” Beth asks , “ That would really help me out . ”
“ No problem . ”
I head over to the bar and rim a frosted martini glass with sugar .
I throw ice into a Boston shaker , measure in some brandy , Cointreau , fresh lemon juice and shake the ingredients together vigorously .
I pour the concoction into the glass , place a corkscrew lemon twirl on the rim , and admire my handiwork .
Sidecars , and other drinks popular in Dashiell Hammett ’s day , appear to be having a renaissance .
I ’ve sort of become the Bistro ’s old and odd drink specialist .
Maybe I should switch to bartending .
“ Sidecar up ! ” I yell over the din .
Beth races in and grabs the drink .
“ Thanks , ” she says .
“ Do n’t spill it , ” I call after her .
I head over to the men ’s room and pull on the door .
Locked .
Sigh .
I head back onto the floor .
“ Waiter , ” a voice calls out , “ I need another drink . ”
A large woman wearing too much foundation makeup waves her glass in the air .
It ’s not my table but I go over anyway .
That ’s me .
Mister Customer Service .
“ What were you drinking Madam ? ” I ask , taking the empty glass out of her hand .
“ A whiskey Old Fashioned , ” she says .
What ’s up with the old timer drinks tonight ?
Next thing you know William Powell and Myrna Loy are gonna sashay through the front door .
“ Right away Madam . ”
This lady ’s in Saroya ’s section but she ’s busy repeating the specials to some deaf oldsters on table 17 .
They look like they voted for Hoover .
I ’ll bet they ’d know who Myrna Loy was .
I cast a glance at my section .
I ’ve got time .
Everyone ’s on apps and entrees .
I head back to the bar , throw a piece of orange into a whisky glass , add sugar , two dashes of bitters , and muddle the whole thing together with the back of a teaspoon .
I should really use a muddling spoon but we do n’t have one .
One day I ’m gonna go to Chef Central and get the all bar tools we need .
I throw ice on top of the muddled fruit , grab a bottle of Canadian Club , pour the requisite amount , and stir the mixture thoroughly .
I garnish the glass with an orange slice , drop in a cherry , and run the drink over to the customer .
“ Your drink Madam , ” I say , placing it in front of her .
The woman makes no effort to thank me .
Oh well .
I run back to the men ’s room .
Still locked .
Damn .
This is rapidly becoming a problem .
I head back to my section .
My little window of inactivity ’s drawing to a close .
Soon I ’ll be bringing out entrees , making cappuccinos , and ringing up checks .
If I do n’t piss now I wo n’t get another chance .
My bladder ’s aching like it ’s just seen a “ NEXT REST STOP 25 MILES ” sign after wrestling with a Super Big Gulp for an hour .
I wonder if pinching my urethra shut in public would look undignified .
Something tells me it might .
I decide my customers are gonna have to wait .
I run to the men ’s room .
The door ’s still locked .
near the men ’s room says .
“ I wonder if he ’s all right , ” I wonder aloud .
The patron shrugs and returns to his rack of lamb .
This is a conversation he does n’t want to have .
I rap gently on the men ’s room door .
“ Everything all right in there ? ”
“ I ’m gonna be here a while , ” a strained voice replies .
“ Sorry . ”
I ’ll have to use the ladies room .
If that ’s occupied there ’s always the alley .
Luckily the little girl ’s room ’s unoccupied .
But , out of the corner of my eye , I see Old Fashioned drink lady struggling down the aisle , her hammy arms outstretched as she tries to balance her inebriated frame , a wild drunken smile opening up the fault lines in her pancake makeup .
I should do the right thing .
I should let Old Fashioned go to the can first .
But it ’s survival of the fittest time and I ’m not getting voted of the Island .
I duck into the ladies room and throw the lock .
As soon as my pants drop I ’ve got a steady stream going .
My knees almost buckle in relief .
“ Thank God , ” I whisper .
Behind me the doorknob rattles furiously .
It ’s gotta be Old Fashioned Lady .
Too bad .
I ’m gonna be here a few minutes .
It ’s axiomatic that , when squeezed for time , your urine stream flows for an eternity .
A good three minutes passes .
I finally finish , shake , flush , zip , kick the lid down , and wash my hands thoroughly .
I towel off my hands and open the door to find Old Fashioned Lady glaring at me .
“ This is the ladies room , ” she says , slurring her words .
I decide to skip the witty comeback and mumble a sincere , “ Sorry . ”
“ Harrumph , ” the woman says , blustering past me .
I head back to my section .
All my tables need something .
I dive in .
Twenty minutes later everything ’s under control and I feel two quarts lighter .
I stop to get a cup of coffee , think better of it , and grab a glass of water instead .
I lean against the service bar and take a deep breath .
Beth sticks her head in .
“ Hey Waiter , ” she says , “ Could you make me another Sidecar ? ”
That friggin Sidecar .
That ’s how I angered my bladder in the first place .
“ Is this customer ninety - two ? ” I ask irritably .
“ No , He ’s a young guy .
Why ? ”
“ Tell him the 30 ’s called .
Nick and Nora Charles want their cocktails back . ”
“ Huh ? ” Beth says , staring at me like I have two heads .
“ Forget it Beth , ” I say , knowing my sense of humor is often only understood by myself , “ I ’ll make the drink . ”
I grab a Boston shaker and start mixing up a Sidecar .
I wonder if I ’d make a good bartender .
Probably not .
