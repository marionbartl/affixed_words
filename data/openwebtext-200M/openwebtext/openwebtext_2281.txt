It 's easy to fall into a rut of eating the same foods when you follow a gluten - free diet .
But being gluten free does n't mean you have to say goodbye to the tastiest meals out there .
In fact , when you think about all of the fresh and crispy veggies , the tender and savory meats , and the rich and creamy dairy — wheat products are n't really necessary .
And even those recipes that do call for products with gluten can easily be swapped out with rice or gluten alternative ( we 're looking at you , zoodles ) .
Here are some gluten free dinner ideas , including sides , that you have may have never tried before .
Nevertheless , you 'll surely love them .
Do n't forget to make something for dessert , too !
STANLEY , North Dakota ( CNN ) -- Herb Geving unleashes a broad smile in his 11,000 - square - foot mansion .
The former cattleman , farmer and owner of a North Dakota garbage business is now retired , able to count the dollar signs brought in by three oil wells .
Herb Geving worked his whole life , but says oil changed his life .
" You do n't have to work at all . "
" Oil , " he says , " it 's amazing .
You do n't have to work at all .
You just walk to the mailbox and there it is . "
The 74 - year - old grandfather receives whopping checks at the end of every month for the oil .
He 'll never forget the time the first check came in January .
" Thousands , I guess you 'd call it , " he says .
Geving chuckles when asked if it was for $ 2,000 .
Was it closer to $ 10,000 ?
" You can keep going up and up and up , " he says from his home , decked out with a massive fire pit in the living room , semi-circular leather couch and bright orange shag carpet .
He had worked on the home for more than 40 years .
Now , he 's expanding it -- just because he can .
Tour the mansion , meet Herb Geving »
Stanley , North Dakota , might seem an unlikely boomtown located in the northwest part of the state about 50 miles from the Canadian border .
But the town is teeming with activity -- all thanks to rich oil deposits sitting deep below the surface .
The town has grown from 1,250 people to more than 1,600 since the start of the year , says Mayor Mike Hynek .
The oil has brought better paying jobs , raised real estate values and spawned millionaires .

" Practically everyone is being affected by it , " Hynek says .
It 's not uncommon to hear stories of 20 - year - olds with no job experience getting hired to work in the oil fields with starting salaries of $ 70,000 a year .
Gary Dazell makes more than $ 100,000 a year hauling water to and from the oil fields .
" The oil field has blessed us , " he says .
Then , there are stories like Geving 's where locals suddenly come into a fortune for owning the mineral rights .
Geving says he 's amassed so much money that 70 relatives will get sizable sums when he dies .
The town sits in an area known as the Bakken Formation , a vast region below North Dakota , Montana and a portion of Canada that the U.S. Geological Survey says contains between 3 billion and 4.3 billion barrels of oil .
See a U.S. map of the Bakken Formation »
" The continual amount of oil in North Dakota is three times as much as Texas , " says Kevin Frederick , a geologist in the region .
" We 're doing as much as we can to try and get it out . "
Mayor
Hynek says the region is so flush with oil that it 's nearly impossible for an oil well to come up dry .
Standing in the middle of a downtown street , he says , " I 'm fairly certain that if they drilled a well here , they 'd have oil . "
" There 's oil down there .
No doubt about it , " he adds .
" They just need to perfect how to get it out . "
Watch " I never imagined this " »
It 's always been known there was oil in the region , but it was n't always cost effective to drill for it or the technology was n't good enough .
When oil was cheap overseas , it also was easier for a company to import it , rather than explore for it , experts say .
But that 's all changed with high oil prices .
Better drilling technology , some good oil finds in the area and the political push for oil exploration in the United States has spurred the boom here and in smaller nearby towns .
" I think we can be a positive impact for the whole country if we can figure this out , " Hynek says .
But the boom comes with a cost .
The mayor says roads -- many of them gravel -- were n't built to sustain huge equipment being hauled to and from the fields ; the town 's one hotel is completely booked ; and an RV trailer park is overflowing .
Houses are hard to come by too , with the average price jumping from around $ 30,000 to about $ 100,000 in the last three years .
" We have a real housing shortage at this time .
But eventually , it 'll be OK , " Hynek says .
" It 's a good challenge .
It 's better than going the other way . "
" My biggest concern today is making sure our infrastructure is adequate for the growth that we 'd like to maintain . "
Nearby , at Joyce 's Cafe , the topic of oil is thick as the coffee served at the communal gathering spot .
Farmer Robert Western worked in the region 's oil fields 48 years ago , but back then the boom never came .
Soon , a well will be going on his property .
Watch farmer in field : " I do n't think it will change our life " »
He never thought five decades ago he'd have an oil well of his own .
" I 'd have said you were crazy .
It would n't come to pass , " he says , peering out from a weathered black baseball cap .
He says if they find oil , it wo n't change him .
He 's lived frugally all his life , a survivor of the Great Depression .
" It 's just kind of difficult to change a pattern of living , " he says , adding he'd love to take a trip around the world and donate money to charity .
Farmers Sheryl and Roger Sorenson spoke humbly too of the possibility of finding oil -- that in some cases a well brings in $ 2,000 a day depending on how much is found .
They say they 'd straighten out their finances ; enjoy more free time ; help children and take family members on a trip to Disneyland or Disneyworld .
" We 're old enough now so we do n't have great desires for bigger and better , " Sheryl Sorenson says .
Watch oil is " a gift " »
Roger Sorenson says he thinks of all the old timers who lived hard - scrabble lives for decades but missed the modern - day boom .
" They always had the hope , but it never came , " he says .
" It 's kind of sad for them because they went through life and never got it .
And now , it 's coming . "
As for Geving , he says when he was a boy , kids carried eggs and milk buckets , and people worked their " tails off . "
Now , he 's building a brand new home for his foreman and his family of five .
Geving -- who 's nicknamed Jed Clampett by the locals after the " Beverly Hillbillies " character -- likes driving out at night to get a closer look at the wells .
He said the wells stand for " success .
I 'm glad I 'm able to help my family . "
What 's he think of when he looks at the oil wells ?
" Money , " he says .
" I can't get tired of that .
... I just grin all the way to it and back . "

Peter the Great heads the fleet travelling 15,000 miles to Venezuela Russian warships have set off for Venezuela for joint exercises unprecedented since the Cold War .
The fleet of ships , headed by the nuclear - powered Peter the Great cruiser , set off from its base at Severomorsk in the Arctic .
The ships are due to take part in joint manoeuvres with Venezuela in November .
The move is seen as a rebuff to the United States , which is facing increasingly fraught relationships with the two nations .
Russian Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the ships set sail at 1000 local time ( 0600 GMT ) , and would travel 15,000 nautical miles to reach their destination .
" It 's the nuclear - powered guided missile cruiser Peter the Great , the anti-submarine warship Admiral Chebanenko and other accompanying ships , " he told the AFP news agency .
Two Russian bombers arrived in Venezuela last week for training flights .

" It would be wrong to talk about one nation having exclusive rights to [ Latin America ]
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin Caracas and Moscow have signed arms contracts , and are looking to extend bilateral co-operation on energy .
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin , in Caracas last week , said five Russian oil firms were looking to begin operations in Venezuela .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , who will visit Moscow this week , said on Sunday that Latin America needed a strong friendship with Russia to help reduce Washington 's influence in the region .
A staunch critic of the US , he backed Russian intervention in Georgia last month and has accused Washington of being scared of Moscow 's " new world potential " .
Mr Sechin also warned the US not to view Latin America as its own backyard .
" It would be wrong to talk about one nation having exclusive rights to this zone , " he told the Associated Press .
During the Cold War , Latin America became an ideological battleground between the US and the then USSR .

What are these ?
Chappelle 's
Show is the greatest sketch comedy of all time .
There , we said it .
We can already hear the proverbial groans of disagreement .
What about the G.O.A.T. Saturday Night Liveâ€ ¦you know Belushi , Murphy , Ferrell ?
Well , let 's see the legendary SNL become a cultural phenomenon in the age of cable TV and shrinking Nielsen ratings .
But Dave can't fuck with the Wayans family 's multicultural breakthrough In Living Color .
Sure Dave owes a lot to Keenan .
But In Living Color overstayed its welcome , while Chappelle 's Show left a pristine corpse , a la Jimi Hendrix and Tupac .
Mad TV ?
You 're kidding , right ?
Really , who cares why Dave bailed out of his landmark show .
He can go on Oprah and Inside the Actors ' Studio and explain his meltdown all he wants .
His show should n't be , and is n't , defined by his abrupt exit or self - medicating trip to Africa .
Its tombstone should read : Here Lies the Comedy With the Biggest Balls .
Period .
Season One
Chappelle 's Show premiered on January 22 , 2003
The Mad Real World
Christian Finnegan ( " Chadâ€ ) : I 'm a standup comic , and so was Neal .
One day , he was like , " You know , I 'm doing this show with Dave , and we 're doing this bit that you might be really good for .â€ 
When you get cast for something like that , you have to sit down for a table read together , and read the script out loud .
It was that sketch , the Clayton Bigsby sketch , and something else .
Everybody was looking around the table like , " I can't believe how funny this is.â€ 
Charlie Murphy ( comedian , actor ) : People liked the [ tough ] characters I did from CB4 , Players Club and Spike Lee 's films , and when people would think of someone playing a gangster - type role , my name would come up at the top of the list .
So when they were writing " The Mad Real Worldâ€  sketch Dave was like , " Yo , we need Charlie Murphy to play this thug - ass character named Tyree.â€ 
That was my first sketch .
Finnegan :
No one ever comes up to me quietly and says , " Hey , I really enjoyed your work in â€ ˜The Mad Real World . 'â€ 
People walk up to me in the middle of a dinner with my girlfriend like , " Katie 's got some big- ass tittays ! â€ 
Ask A Black Guy / Negrodamus
Paul Mooney ( comedian , writer , actor ) : I basically came up with " Negrodamusâ€  and " Mooney On Movies , â€  while Dave came up with " Ask A Black Guy.â€ 
" Negrodamusâ€  was actually supposed to be Niggerdamus , but we had to clean it up .
You know when I say " nigger , â€  it 's like the devil is saying it [ laughs ] .
Player Haters ' Ball
Bryan Tucker ( writer , " Player Hater 's Ballâ€ ) : Dave and Neal have a good idea , and they have a set - up , and then they do like 10 takes .
Dave does a little something different every time .
So a lot of the great lines you see are n't necessarily stuff that you 'd see written in a script .
Donnell Rawlings ( comedian , actor ; Ashy Larry ) :
Ten minutes before we go shoot " Player Haters ' Ball , â€ my character did n't have a name or anything .
I went to hair and makeup , told them to give me a Jheri - curl wig .
Then I went to props , and I asked for a MoÃ«t bottle with an activator on it so I can just squirt my hair down .
They did n't have that , so they gave me the aerosol can .
I 'm spraying it , people laughing and shit , three minutes before shooting .
I did n't have a name , dialogue or anything .
Neal told me to make my name up .
I walked past the mirror like twice , looked in it , and said , " Man , I feel beautiful ! â€ 
That 's when " Beautifulâ€ was born .
Bill Burr ( announcer , " Racial Draftâ€ ) : Dave and Neal were real cool with improv .
They were like , " If it 's funny , it 's going in.â€ 
Rawlings :
Dave always does something to let everybody know why it 's Chappelle 's Show .
When he got to the page flip , we had already had 18 hours in .
It had to be like 2:30 , 3 in the morningâ € ” we was all joked out !
Dave was the only one who kept it moving .
" She look like she wear underpants with dickholes in them !â€ 
That was the end of that .
It 's a wrap .
Let 's go home .

When a cool breeze breaks the desert heat and the faint scent of mesquite wafts through Tucson , photographers Jeff Smith and Tom Willett hit the road to chase lightning .
The duo drive their pickup beneath dark thunderheads , shooting hundreds of photos during the summer monsoons that rumble over Arizona 's Sonoran Desert and reach their climax in September .
" Super - close bolts of lightning will give you a reality check , " says Willett .
" When the antenna on your car starts to sizzle , that 's when you know it 's time to get out of there as fast as you can . "
Smith , 44 , and Willett , 49 , operate independent photography businesses in Tucson , but they merged their interest in weather imagery to form a stock - photography company called Lightningsmiths .
They pool resources for their Web site and marketing campaigns , and they offer an extensive portfolio of images to clients that include Omega watches , Timberland , the Weather Channel , and the Swiss and British postal services , which have used Lightningsmiths images on stamps and posters .

The number of female foetuses being aborted in India is rising , as ultrasound is increasingly used to predict the sex of babies .
What would you do if your husband 's family did not want you to have daughters - and insisted you took steps to make sure it did not happen ?
Would you walk out or would you stay on and take a chance ?
What if the bias against girls is reflected across society ?
Would that mean you could not make it on your own ?
Vaijanti is an Indian woman who says she faces this dilemma .
She lives in the city of Agra , home to the Taj Mahal , perhaps the world 's most famous monument to a woman , the wife of a Mughal emperor .
" I had a lot of dreams in my heart , " Vaijanti says , " just like in the movies ... but now I think of love as a betrayal . "
Vaijanti has taken her husband to court , saying he and his family insisted that she have an abortion because a scan showed she was expecting a girl .
Having already had one daughter , she says the pressure to abort the second child was intense .
So Vaijanti moved out of the marital home and now lives apart from her husband - with her two girls .
Gender skew Testing and aborting for gender selection are illegal in India and Vaijanti's husband and in - laws deny the charges against them .
Despite the obvious bitterness between her and her husband 's family , reconciliation is still possible .
Girls still face discrimination in modern Indian society But Vaijanti was unsure of what to do next .
We wanted to find out if she thought India really is a country biased against young girls .
Despite the law , some Indians clearly are using ultrasound techniques to scan for female foetuses , in order to abort them .
Figures suggest as many as a million such foetuses could be aborted every year in India .
It is unlikely nature alone accounts for this gender skew - in Delhi , for instance , only 821 girls are born for every 1,000 boys .
Many Indian families regard daughters as a liability .
Expensive dowries must be arranged for their weddings and they frequently move into their husband 's households - making it less likely they will support ageing parents .
As Vaijanti had never travelled beyond Agra , director Nupur Basu took her on a whistle - stop tour of India .
In Rajasthan , she meets Jasbir Kaur , who left her husband after facing a similar predicament .
Told she should abort her girl triplets , she decided to go ahead and have them anyway .
She is a potential role model for Vaijanti , telling her : " You must educate your girls .
Do n't lose courage .
Do n't feel alone . "
Although millions of Indian girls are still left out of formal education , Jasbir Kaur 's three girls are doing fine in the local school .
Icon of globalisation
In Delhi , there is good and bad news .
Vaijanti meets women who have come into Delhi filled with hope , but end up begging on the streets .
In many places , boys are unable to agree to find girls to marry .
Because of this , the nation will soon face an unimaginable crisis
Renuka Chowdhury
Minister for women
She also visits a disco for the first time in her life - no den of iniquity but a place where she meets some bright young women with good cheer and strong advice .
In Bangalore , there are also two sides to the picture .
This is the city that is world famous as an icon of globalisation and women 's empowerment .
It has young girls working in IT , making good careers , and scooting around town on mopeds , listening to their iPods .
But there is another Bangalore - where some families still demand the expensive dowries traditionally given by a bride 's family to the in - laws .
And while Bangalore 's senior managers may encourage women , younger men may still question their qualifications and their right to work .
Finally Nupur also takes Vaijanti to Mahatma Gandhi's retreat , where she hears that the revered leader was concerned about the bias against women .
Writer Tridip Suhrud says Mahatma Gandhi " would have been deeply perturbed with this entire social surge of ... civilisation to acquire this hard militant , masculine self - identity " .
He adds : " He would have fought it with femininity . "
' Grave situation '
We wanted to make this film after a leading development expert , Kevin Watkins , suggested India had a curiously ambivalent role in the globalisation debate .
The Taj Mahal was conceived as a monument to an emperor 's wife Its booming economy is cause for hope , and the government is clearly concerned about both gender and economic inequality .
But if huge swathes of the populace do not share the increasing wealth , the whole Indian model of development may be called into question .
Meantime , Vaijanti's immediate concern is India 's missing girls - unborn because of the desire to have boys .
Vaijanti and Nupur call on Renuka Chowdhury , the minister for women , who says : " This is a very , very grave situation . "
She adds : " In many places , boys are unable to agree to find girls to marry .
Because of this , the nation will soon face an unimaginable crisis . "
When Vaijanti left Agra she was quiet but watchful .
At the journey 's end , she is calm and eloquent as she weighs up whether to seek reconciliation with her husband 's family .
" I feel at peace ...
I will go back to Agra now and think about what I should do for my daughters and myself .
I will go back and think about my decision . "
Life on the Edge is broadcast on BBC World News on Tuesdays at 1930 GMT .
The films were made for the BBC by TVE .
A selection of your comments on this story : Nowadays females are doing much better in many fields .
I think it is time now that men pay a dowry to see how it feels .
We as men would not have been here without women .
In our family women have studied at a higher level than the men , so where is the difference ?
I have daughter and son , and as my daughter is older , I have explained to her that she will be the head of the household after us in all aspects .
Ganesh , Vijayawada , India
How very sad and so short - sighted to consider abortion because of gender .
Some parts of China already face a serious shortage of women for the very same reason .
Why can't people recognise that both genders are valuable but for very different reasons ?
As someone who strongly advocates a woman 's right to reproductive choices , it seems to me that the worldwide problem is not gender , but rather overpopulation .
Lisa , United States
The practice of dowry - giving by the bride 's family devalues women in society and is responsible for the widespread practice of aborting female foetuses .
The skewing of boys to women born to families represents a social time - bomb .
The law in India must be rigorously enforced with immediate effect .
Shouvik Datta , Prague , Czech Republic
I do n't understand why in Indian and European cultures , the tradition of the woman 's family paying a dowry to the man 's came about .
In Chinese culture , the dowry or " bride - gold " is paid by the man 's family - which makes a lot more sense considering how much labour and other economic benefits a housewife ends up contributing in an old - fashioned family .
Shi-Hsia Hwa , Penang , Malaysia
This article creates an impression that the cause of all the gender bias in India are males .
That is not what I saw when growing up in India .
Several of the discriminatory , abusive practices against females are carried on by females themselves .
Many times men have no part in this , nor do they have such intentions .
Kamal , Portland , USA India is definitely a country biased against young girls and I am stating this as a fact , being a girl born in India .
It is still a matter of pride to bear a male child and people still express their deep sympathy for a girl child .
It sickens and saddens me to see so much hypocrisy in our society where goddesses are worshipped in temples and female babies are aborted and killed at homes .
Anisa Chaudhary , USA
My mother was one of these ladies .
She was married at the age of twelve and was pregnant by the age of thirteen and a half .
My father found out that I was going to be a girl and ordered my mother to have an abortion .
When she refused , he and my grandfather beat her .
A tourist saw them and stopped them .
My mother married this wonderful stranger who brought her here and accepted me as his daughter .

For the past week , Chicago has been peppered with pint - sized footballers from around the globe here to compete in the World Sport Chicago International Cup tournament from July 24 - 27 .
The under - 15 club teams include Germany ’s Hamburg SV , Sockers FC , Mexico ’s Centro de Formacion Cuauhtémoc Blanco , 36 Lion from Nigeria , the Chicago Fire Academy squad , and the under - 15 U.S. National team .
Hamburg SV has won this tournament three times before ( 2004 , 2006 , 2007 ) , but they do n’t think that a fourth victory is in their hands just yet .
“ The tournament has grown and grown , and the competition gets better each year , ” said Markus Hirte , the youth academy director for Hamburg SV .
Hamburg may have an edge , as they have experienced tough competition in Europe already .
“ The competition here is different .
In the tournament here , there are always one or two good matches with good teams , but in Europe its every match . ”
Hirte is , however , looking forward to seeing the Mexican and African teams compete , acknowledging that those teams are typically “ very good technically , very skillful , and very fast , ” but maintains that his team tends to be a bit “ more powerful , a little bit more smooth and coordinated ” than the other teams competing .
“ In Germany , the teams have a lot of discipline and technique and power , ” said Hirte .
Despite his comments ,
Hirte is n’t prepared to make a prediction on how Hamburg will fare in the tournament this year .
“ We have played no matches yet , so I ca n’t speak to anything about the other teams . ”
Chicago Fire ’s Cuauhtémoc
Blanco is also bringing a team plucked from his academy in Mexico .
This tournament will be Centro de Formacion Cuauhtémoc Blanco ’s inaugural U.S. competition .
Blanco brought the best team available , chosen from a pool of player tryouts in Mexico City .
“ The kids work really hard .
I want them to have a good time in Chicago and have a good game .
They will work hard to represent Mexican soccer well , ” said Blanco .
Blanco founded his academy a year and a half ago , and when he has time away from the Fire , he goes back to Mexico to train with the team and get acquainted with the players .
“ I wanted to start an academy so the players can be learning to become professionals , ” he said .
Though Blanco hopes that his team wins the tournament , it is not his primary goal .
“ The most important part is that they ’re working hard , and they ’re learning the game . ”
Co-hosted by Illinois Youth Soccer ( the official representative of both U.S. Youth Soccer and the United States Soccer Federation in Illinois ) and World Sport Chicago ( WSC ) , an Illinois not - for - profit that works to enhance the image and participation of Olympic sports across the Chicago community , the tournament will bring a total of eight teams to the Chicagoland area to compete .
While this is WSC ’s first time co-hosting , the organization is already looking ahead , hoping to bring in more elite youth teams to compete in future tournaments .
Founded in early 2007 , originally to bolster Chicago in the domestic phase of the Olympic bid process , WSC has been working to spread the popularity of Olympic sports for the past 18 months .
Though Chicago is now one of the four finalists to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games , whether or not Chicago is awarded the bid is of no consequence to WSC ’s mission .
“ We ’re committed to promoting the Olympic spirit .
In my mind , it ’s a commitment to sport as an integral part of developing the total person : fair play , pushing the limits , striving to be better .
Not being best , but being the best you can be , ” said WSC ’s executive director Scott Myers .
“ Regardless of whether Chicago wins the Olympic bid , the organization will continue after the Olympic games . ”
Myers acknowledges that it is n’t just this tournament , or any one event , that WSC believes will extend a lasting international influence on Chicago ’s youth .
“ We want to get kids involved with loving sports , to get them involved for their lifetime , ” said Myers .
“ We ’d like to create youth exchange programs . ”
The tournament will be a lively showcase of the future of global soccer , and readers in the Chicago area should make an effort to come out in support .
With plenty of U.S. youth playing against formidable competition from Germany , Mexico , and Africa , the tournament will provide a prime opportunity to see firsthand how the U.S. ’s youth development programs stack up .

Third time 's the charm
It 's taken three generations of Zunes to avoid the curse of the squi- .
First - gen Zunes were all about the Social — and " squirting " your tunes to other Zunes .
The term , widely mocked , gave way to the second - gen " squircle " controller , which sent shivers down the spines of Microsoft 's PR team .
The third generation of Zunes leaked out of Redmond a bit earlier than planned , but everything is now official and on store shelves , the new firmware and client software is out , and there 's a refreshing lack of new squi- about the whole experience .
As the old saying goes , Microsoft does learn its lessons the third time around .
Microsoft now has a mature ecosystem ( music store , video store , community features , hardware ) built around some smooth - looking gadgets and a nice interface — there are even some games !— but as Steve Jobs reminded us during Apple 's recent nano unveiling , Microsoft also has less than a 3 percent share of the media player market .
Can features like FM radio tagging , wireless sync , wireless store browsing , free McDonald 's WiFi access , WiFi streaming , some new colors , a clock (! ) , and larger capacities do much to change that ?
Zune :
So good , who needs changes ?
The Zune has followed a different development path from the iPod .
Microsoft , perhaps recognizing that it needed to do all it could to appeal to new customers , built a feature set into the first Zunes that has yet to be changed in any major way .
All Zunes feature WiFi , FM radio , a click pad , the same data connector , and the same screen resolution ( though the gen 2 Zunes did add touch sensitivity to their click pad ) .
With every new release , Microsoft has rolled out the same new firmware to every Zune model ; even the new games will work on the original Zune 30 .
The idea , I 've been told , was to build a hardware set of features that would stay constant over time but allow for creative innovation , and we can finally see the promise of the initial hardware specs being lived up to by the new firmware upgrade .
The complete Zune lineup
What 's unusual about the gen 3 Zunes is the look of the devices : it 's identical to the earlier models .
There 's a smaller , candybar - looking , flash - based player that comes in multiple colors , and a chunkier , hard - drive player that comes in black .
The new hardware features upgraded capacity ( 16GB and 120 GB , respectively ) and a pair of new colors , but that 's it — this is a software upgrade more than a true generational shift .
Radio tagging
One of Zune 's most intriguing new features this time around is FM radio tagging .
According to Microsoft 's own research , most people discover music today through two sources : friends and the radio .
( It also does n't hurt that Apple wo n't include a radio , so everything done with this functionality creates a new talking point that the Zune has against the competition . )
Microsoft has gradually rolled out community discovery features , not to mention all that " squirting " from friends , but it has done little to make radio music discovery easier .
This time around , the Zune can grab RDS metadata from radio and store it in list for later viewing or purchase of music .
It 's a slick feature — click the squircle once when listening to a radio station and " add song to cart " is selected .
Click it again and the song goes into your queue .
The list can be viewed on the Zune itself or on the desktop software after a sync .
A radio station
showing metadata
Unfortunately , there are problems — not so much with Microsoft as with the radio stations .
As a test , I tried to add nine songs from several different stations to my cart .
The system could only identify three of them .
Taking a closer look at the metadata , one can see why .
Rather than transmitting the artist and track names separately ( and leaving out all extraneous identifiers ) , many radio stations run them all together .
For instance , Beck 's song " Loser " was listed as " 93XRT LOSER / BECK " in the metadata , while another station used " It 's Trace Adkins with ' You 're Gonna ... ' "
Fortunately , a classic rock station in town broadcast its data in Zune - friendly fashion , so I was able to have REO Speedwagon 's " Ridin ' the Storm Out " correctly identified .
Users with a subscription Zune Pass can then download and listen to the song right from the device or via the desktop client ; those without can hear a 30 - second sample or choose to buy the song using the ( dreaded ) Microsoft points system common to the Xbox 360 as well .
It 's all quite slick , so long as it works .

The US has refused an Israeli request for military hardware to assist with a strike against Iran 's nuclear facilities , while warning against any such plan , according to a report today .
Israel presented its list of desired military hardware and other backup for the strike during President George Bush 's visit to Jerusalem in May , the Israeli newspaper , Ha'aretz , said .
This was turned down with Washington officials insisting Israel give the US prior notice if it plans an attack .
The US is among a group of nations which has sought to engage with Iran over its nuclear activities by offering a package of incentives if Tehran suspends uranium enrichment .
Iran insists it is interested only in civil nuclear power but the US and EU claims it plans to build a nuclear bomb .
Israel , which has its own undeclared nuclear arsenal , has warned Iran repeatedly against developing its own .
A major Israeli air force exercise in June was viewed by observers as a veiled warning to Iran that Israel has the capability to attack the country 's nuclear facilities .
According to Ha'aretz , Bush held talks with the country 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , and defence minister , Ehud Barak , during which they requested " certain specific items of military equipment " as well as diplomatic backing .
The paper - which does not specify the hardware sought – says that the US took this to imply an attack on Iran was imminent and sent a " strong message " to Israel not to do so .
It also demanded prior warning of any attack , and offered in compensation to improve Israel 's missile defence systems .
Israel rejected this and warned it " reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary " if diplomatic efforts achieved nothing .
Ha'aretz says Israel had hoped Bush would order an American strike before leaving office but that this was seen as unlikely .
The country fears that an Israeli attack " would give Iran international legitimacy for its programme , which it currently lacks " and portray Israel as the aggressor .
Israel believes that Iran will continue to stall , perhaps even temporarily suspending uranium enrichment , " in an effort to see out the rest of Bush 's term in peace " , the paper added .

Man Almost Loses Penis Humping Steel Bench
Last night in Hong Kong , the police received a disturbing call from a man in trouble .
Xing , a 41 year - old man , was calling from LanTian park in the middle of the night .
The lonely and disturbed man had apparently thought it would be fun to have sex with one of the steel sit - up benches around the park .
The bench has numerous small holes in it , which Xing used to attempt to satisfy himself .
However , once he became aroused he found that he was stuck and could not get his penis out of the small hole .
He panicked and called the police to help him .
When police arrive they found Xian stuck face down where he had been stuck for some time .
When doctors arrived on the scene they tried to release some of the pressure by removing some of his blood , but the penis was so swollen that they ended up having to cut the entire bench free and take it , with Xian attached , to the hospital .
4 painful hours later , Doctors finally separated Xian from his bench .
Doctors stated that if he had been stuck for even an hour longer , they would have had to remove his penis .
Lets just say this is probably one bad date that Xing will never forget .

実用上HotRubyがC Rubyより速いというわけではまったくない
プリミティブ型の有無が原因という話はどうやら間違い
のようです 。
とはいえ 「 ↓のベンチマーク でHotRubyがC Rubyより速い」というのは事実です。これがなぜなのかちょっと気になったので考えてみました。
startTime = Time .new.to_f sum = " " 50000 . times{| e | sum += e.to_s} endTime = Time .new.to_f puts ( endTime - startTime ) .to_s + ' sec '
これについてはRubyが遅いのは本当にBoxingのせいか？が参考になります。まず、C
Rubyではベンチマークの += を << に書き換えるとめっちゃ（手元の1.9では約84倍）速くなります。これはなぜかというと、
インスタンスの生成も減りますが、それよりO( N^2) がO(N)になったのが大きいです。上の記事の+=版でだんだん時間がかかってるのはこのせいですね。
そうなると上の記事の最後の記述、「 HotRuby版では+=でも時間が一定になった」というのが気になります。JavaScriptでは+=を使っても上のコードはO(N)になるということです。これが上のベンチマークでHotRubyがC Rubyより速くなった理由のようです。しかし、どうやってるのでしょう…？
まず「 JavaScriptの+=はRubyの< JavaScript上では単なる+=ではなく、以下のようなコードが実行されます*1。
function string Plus( a , b ) { var c = a.__native + b.__native ; return { __native : c } ; } a = string Plus ( a , b ) ;
これを破壊的な連結 （Rubyでいう<
次に考えたのが、JavaScriptの文字列の連結はこんな感じになってるのではないか、というものです。
つまり、a.__nativeのバッファに余裕があったら、そこに詰めてしまう。ただし、個々の変数は文字列の始点と終点を保持してるので、これによってa.__nativeの内容が変わることはない、というもの。この実装ならRubyの<ベンチマークはO( N)になります。
これは単なる想像で、実際こうなってるのかは調べていません（知ってる人かFirefoxなどのソースを見た人がいたら教えてください…）が、 JavaScriptではRuby のString #<
2008/8/2追記 : shinhさ ん が Firefoxの（だと思う）ソースから該当箇所を見つけてくれました。どうも上の想像は当たっていたみたいです。

When you buy a new PC today , unless you hunt down a Linux system or you buy a Mac , you ’re pretty much stuck with Vista .
Sad , but true .
So , when I had to get a new PC in a hurry , after one of my PCs went to the big bit - ranch in the sky with a fried motherboard , the one I bought , a Dell Inspiron 530S from my local Best Buy came pre-infected with Vista Home Premium .
Big deal .
It took me less than an hour to install Linux Mint 5 Elyssa R1 on it .
As expected , everything on this 2.4GHz Intel Core2 Duo Processor E4600 - powered PC ran perfectly with Mint .
But , then it struck me , everyone is talking about having to buy Vista systems and then ‘ downgrading ’ them to XP Pro , how hard really is it to do that .?
Since I had left half the 500BG SATA hard drive unpartitioned , I decided to install XP SP3 on it to see how much , if any , trouble I ’d run into .
The answer : a lot .
First , thanks to my Microsoft TechNet membership I could download an XP disk image , which included all the patches up to and including SP3 .
Many people are n’t going to be that lucky .
They ’ll need to install XP and then download perhaps hundreds of megabytes of patches .
Boy , does n’t that sound like a lot of fun ?
If you do n’t have a MSDN ( Microsoft Developers Network ) or TechNet membership , there are two ways to approach this problem .
The first is to manually slipstream the patches into an XP installation CD .
You can find a good set of instructions on how to do this in Slipstreaming Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Create Bootable CD .
While the article is for SP2 , the same technique works for XP SP3 as well .
The other way is use nLite .
This is a program that allows you to customize Windows XP and 2000 .
While it ’s primarily so that you can set up Windows without components you do n’t want , such as Internet Explorer 6 , Outlook Express , MSN Explorer , or Messenger , you can also use it to create fully patched - up boot / installation CDs .
I highly recommend it .
This time I did n’t need to use either one .
I simply put in my newly burned XP SP3 CD and went through the usual XP installation routine .
Within an hour , I was booting XP .
If this had been Linux my work would have been done .
With XP , I soon discovered my job was just beginning .
I soon found that XP could n’t recognize my graphics sub-system , a totally ordinary Integrated Intel GMA ( Graphics Media Accelerator ) 3100 ; the audio system , the Realtek HD Audio chipset , or , most annoying of all , the Intel 10 / 100 M bps Ethernet port .
How can an operating system in 2008 not recognize an Ethernet port ?
Well , XP does n’t .
Fortunately , Dell includes a CD with the full range of Windows drivers on it .
With it , I was able to install the drivers for all the equipment without much trouble .
Within another hour , I finally had a working XP SP3 system .
That was n’t so bad was it ?
Well , here ’s my problem , except for Dell , I do n’t know of any vendors who ship their PCs with driver disks anymore .
The usual vendor answer for when you have a driver problem is for you to go online , search down the right driver , download , and install it .
Except , of course , had that been my only course of action , I would have been up the creek without a paddle because XP was n’t capable of letting me talk to my network .
Mint , on the other hand , let me point out , had no trouble with any of my hardware .
Thus Ubuntu - based Linux recognized the equipment , it set it up and let me get to work .
It was Windows that proved to be a pain in the rump .
Greg Kroah - Hartman , a prominent Linux developer , is right .
Linux Journal recently reported that he recently told an audience at the Ottawa Linux Symposium that “ Linux supports more different types of devices than any other operating system ever has in the history of computing . ”
Linux is n’t perfect that way , as Kroah - Hartman would be the first to admit .
Based on what I experienced , though , Linux is much better than Windows at supporting modern hardware .
We have this illusion , that ’s just because Windows works on the systems it comes pre-installed on , that Windows has great built - in driver support .
No , it does n’t .
Once you move to installing Windows on a new system , you ’ll quickly find that Linux , not Windows , has the better built - in hardware support .
Yes , that ’s right .
Linux , not Windows , is easier to install on a new PC .
Just something to think about as you get ready to strip Vista off your new computer .

GORI , Georgia ( Reuters ) - Russian forces battled pro-Western Georgian troops in South Ossetia on Friday in an escalating conflict that threatens to engulf a key energy transit route to Western Europe .
Both sides ignored pleas from world leaders for calm as Moscow and Tbilisi blamed each other for the fighting in South Ossetia which began after several days of skirmishes .
Georgian forces shelled the capital of its breakaway region , which separatists said left 1,400 people dead .
Moscow said its troops were responding to a Georgian assault to retake the region , which broke from Georgia as the Soviet Union was collapsing but has no international recognition .
The crisis , the first to confront Kremlin leader Dmitry Medvedev since he took office in May , with violence flaring in a region seen as a key energy transit route where Russia and the West are vying for influence .
The hostilities dampened investor confidence and hit the Moscow stock exchange .
Georgia said Russia bombed airfields and Poti port deep inside its territory and Tbilisi and rushed tanks and troops into South Ossetia , formally still a part of Georgia , to reinforce its small force of peacekeepers .
“ If the whole world does not stop Russia today , then Russian tanks will be able to reach any other European capital , ” President Mikheil Saakashvili said .
A top Georgian official said Saakashvili was planning to declare martial law within hours , a move that will gives him a free hand to manage the conflict .
The U.N. Security Council held a second meeting on the conflict on Friday , and diplomats said they hoped the council would unanimously call for a ceasefire .
A Reuters correspondent near Gori -- the birthplace of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin between South Ossetia and the Georgian capital -- saw Georgian troops heading back towards Tbilisi on otherwise empty roads , kicking empty ammunition cartons away from their lorries .
Checkpoints usually manned by the international peacekeeping force in the region were abandoned on the darkened road .
Two tanks stood unguarded by the roadside .
Georgian soldiers said little and appeared exhausted .
RIVAL CLAIMS
The conflict over Georgia ’s breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia has bedeviled Georgia ’s relations with Russia , angered by Tbilisi ’s moves towards the Western fold and its pursuit of NATO membership .
Both the Russian - backed separatists and the Georgian government said they were in control of the regional capital Tskhinvali .
“ Tskhinvali and the heights around Tskhinvali and the majority of the villages in South Ossetia are under the control of Georgian forces , ” Saakashvili said in a televised address .
Irina Galgoyeva , spokeswoman for separatist South Ossetia , denied the report .
“ The entire town of Tkshinvali is currently controlled by units of South Ossetia ’s self - defence , ” Russia ’s Interfax news agency quoted her as saying .
Political analysts saw Georgia ’s bid to re-take its rebel region of South Ossetia by force as a gamble by its leader that Ossetia and Abkhazia , another rebel region on the Black Sea .
“ He is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro-Western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by Russia , ” said James Nixey , of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London .

Saakashvili , who wants to take his small Caucasus country in to NATO , has made it a priority to win back control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , another rebel region on the Black Sea .
Saakashvili said the two countries were at war .
The Georgian leader said on television : “ What Russia is doing in Georgia is open , unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world .
The secretary of Georgia ’s Security Council , Kakha Lomaia , said Saakhashvili would impose martial law within hours .
Russia , he said , had bombed Georgia ’s Black Sea port of Poti and a military base as part of what authorities believed was the start of attacks on civilian targets and infrastructure .
“ CEASE ATTACKS ”

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged Russia to withdraw combat troops from Georgia and stop air strikes .
“ We call on Russia to cease attacks on Georgia by aircraft and missiles , respect Georgia ’s territorial integrity , and withdraw its ground combat forces from Georgian soil , ” she said .
The president of South Ossetia , Eduard Kokoity , told Interfax about 1,400 people had been killed as a result of “ Georgian aggression ” .
Saakashvili put Georgian casualties at about 30 , mostly in the military .
President George W. Bush , in Beijing for the opening of the Olympic Games , pledged U.S. support for Georgia ’s territorial integrity and called for an immediate ceasefire , the White House said .
Envoys from the United States , European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe were due to head to Georgia .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said he had spoken to the Russian and Georgian foreign ministers , Sergei Lavrov and Eka Tkeshelashvili , to call for an end to the violence .
The Kremlin said Medvedev told German Chancellor Angela Merkel that “ the only possible way out is the withdrawal of Georgian forces to starting positions ” .
Soldiers fired machineguns and armored personnel carriers moved through the deserted streets of Tskhinvali .
Shell holes pierced the grey concrete apartment bocks and plumes of smoke hung over the South Ossetian capital .
Lavrov accused the Georgians of driving people from their homes .
The majority of the roughly 70,000 people living in South Ossetia are ethnically distinct from Georgians .
They say they were forcibly absorbed into Georgia under Soviet rule and now want to exercise their right to self - determination .
Claus Vistesen and Edward Hugh are proud and happy to announce that they are now working as " featured analysts " with a new Boston - based start - up - Emerginvest Claus and Edward have used a new , updated , methodology in order to identify a group of 13 emerging economies which we consider are going to outperform both the rest of the emerging economy group and the OECD economies in terms of a number of key performance indicators over the 2008 - 2020 horizon .
Through our association with Emerginvest we hope to develop performance indicators which will confirm both the relevance and validity of the selection procedure adopted .
We would like to point out that we have absolutely no financial connection whatsoever with Emerginvest - although we do heartily endorse what they are trying to do .
In particular we see the move by the investment community towards emerging markets as one of the most effective and direct ways to address those issues of inter-country wealth and income imbalances which have plagued our planet for so long now - namely by getting the money from the rich who have it to the poor who need it .
Sending investment to emerging economies is also a way of addressing the underlying imbalances which exist between the relatively older populations of the developed economies who increasingly need to save , and the relatively younger emerging economies who can benefit from the investment of those savings in their countries .
So in a way you can both ensure the future of your own pension and help attack poverty at one and the same time .
This type of possibility is normally known in economics as " win-win " .
More theoretical background on the methodology behind this choice can be found across the posts in our Demography Matters and Global Economy Matters blogs .
The oldest known source and most probable origin for the expression " baker 's dozen " dates to the 13th century in one of the earliest English statutes , instituted during the reign of Henry III ( r. 1216 -1272 ) , called the Assize of Bread and Ale .
Bakers who were found to have shortchanged customers could be liable to severe punishment .
To guard against the punishment of losing a hand to an axe , a baker would give 13 for the price of 12 , to be certain of not being known as a cheat .
Specifically , the practice of baking 13 items for an intended dozen was to prevent " short measure " , on the basis that one of the 13 could be lost , eaten , burnt or ruined in some way , leaving the baker with the original dozen .
The Securities and Exchange Commission prepared an aggressive assault against short - sellers , saying it would temporarily prevent investors from making bets on stock declines in an attempt to stem some of the worst stock - market slides in years , according to people briefed on the proposal .
The SEC was convening a late - night commission meeting to consider several items , some of which could be announced as early as today , a person familiar with the matter said .

WASHINGTON --
A congressional panel has taken tough swings at the New York Yankees and New York City government over a new stadium for the Yankees .
But neither the team nor the city budged from their positions on the $ 1.3 billion structure .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich said Thursday he found " waste and abuse of public dollars " in the financing of the new stadium under construction in the South Bronx .
Kucinich is an Ohio Democrat who heads a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee .
He charged that city officials misrepresented to the IRS the value of the property , helping them to get special tax deals from the federal government and in effect dumping the cost of construction onto taxpayers .
No one from the either the city or the Yankees spoke at the hearing .
As Kucinich spoke , New York 's mayor , Michael Bloomberg , was in a nearby building testifying before a different House committee on global warming .
Earlier this week , Bloomberg defended the deal , calling it " a great project . "
" We want these kinds of facilities here .
Having new stadiums is as important as other things in terms of , not just the spirit for the people who live here , but our economy , " Bloomberg said .
That 's not how several Democrats on the panel saw it .
" In the case of the new Yankee Stadium , not only have we found waste and abuse of public dollars subsidizing a project that is for the exclusive benefit of a private entity , the Yankees , but also we have discovered serious questions about the accuracy of certain representations made by the City of New York to the federal government , " Kucinich said .
The panel 's investigation found " substantial evidence of improprieties and possible fraud by the financial architects of the new Yankee Stadium , " he added .
The criticism highlights tensions felt nationwide as governments increasingly support stadiums for profitable pro sports teams with multimillion dollar payrolls .
Rep. Diane Watson , D - Calif. , said her hometown of Los Angeles has gone without a professional football team for decades because city officials are unwilling to pay for a new stadium .
Given the current financial crisis gripping the U.S. economy , she said it made no sense for taxpayers to pay for construction of buildings for the benefit of sports owner tycoons .
" In this country we have allowed the upper class to destroy the middle class , " Watson charged .
The lawmakers also complained that city and team officials had not provided information they have sought about the financing of Yankee Stadium .
The panel did hear from New York State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky , an outspoken critic of the deal , who charges that between $ 550 million to $ 850 million in taxpayer money has been committed to the project .
Brodksy 's charges , based on city , IRS , and Yankee documents , include :
• The city manipulated the assessed value of the stadium to meet requirements for an IRS tax exemption .
That included using comparable land values in Manhattan rather than the Bronx to come up with the value for the new property .
• City officials did n't disclose their purchase of a luxury box and extra game tickets and apparently there is no city policy on their use .
• The $ 366 million in additional funding sought by the Yankees to complete the stadium would be for a large video screen , not structural costs .
Previously , Yankee officials have accused Brodsky of factually inaccurate grandstanding after he voted twice in favor of the deal in the state legislature .
" The project has been one of the most transparent transactions undertaken in the city of New York and details have been recorded in voluminous , publicly available documents , " Yankees spokeswoman Alice McGillion said earlier this week .
The credit crisis has taken a new and dangerous turn : Shares of a large money market mutual fund have " broken the buck " -- fallen below the standard $ 1 a share -- because of losses on IOUs from brokerage Lehman Bros .
Holdings Inc .
The Reserve Primary Fund in New York , which had $ 65 billion in assets at the end of August , said it cut its share price to 97 cents after marking down the value of $ 785 million in Lehman debt securities , following the brokerage ’s filing for bankruptcy court protection on Monday .
Read the fund 's statement here .
The Reserve Primary Fund ’s situation apparently was exacerbated as big investors have fled in the last two days , forcing the fund to sell other securities .
Assets have dived by more than 60 % since Sunday , Bloomberg News reported .
The fund , apparently seeking to dissuade other investors from leaving while it sorts out the situation with its Lehman IOUs , today said it would take up to seven days to meet investors ’ redemption requests .
Normally , money funds redeem investors ’ shares immediately on request .
The fund also said it had valued the Lehman IOUs at zero for the moment .
That , too , could be a move to discourage redemptions , because it ’s conceivable the securities have some value .
The woes of Reserve Primary Fund -- the nation 's oldest money fund -- are sure to set off a public relations blitz by other mutual fund companies to forestall an investor panic .
" The whole money fund industry is going to be out there trying to assure people , " said Pete Crane , head of Crane Data , which tracks the industry .
Crane said the Reserve Primary Fund lacked a " deep - pocketed " parent company that could step in and buy out the Lehman IOUs .
A number of other money funds have been caught with dicey debt over the last year as the credit crisis has deepened , but their parent firms have chosen to purchase the securities to keep shareholders whole .
Crane noted that the Evergreen Funds said on Monday that parent Wachovia Corp. agreed to back up Lehman debt in three Evergreen money funds .
See the announcement here .
Money market funds , which hold a record $ 3.5 trillion , have long been considered relatively safe because they 're supposed to limit their investments to high - quality , short - term securities .
The funds do n’t guarantee that they can keep their share prices steady at $ 1 , but before today only one other fund has broken the buck -- and that was a small institutional fund , in 1994 .
Money funds overall have taken in $ 400 billion in fresh cash this year alone as nervous investors have sold stocks , bonds and other assets and sought a haven where they believed their principal was protected .
Reacting to the Reserve Primary Fund 's bomb , the Investment Company Institute , the trade group for mutual funds , said that it was " working closely with its members and with regulators , including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve , to maintain open communications about market conditions and their impact on funds . "
There ’s high irony in the Reserve Primary Fund 's troubles :
The fund ’s founder is 71 - year - old Bruce Bent , who is considered to be the father of the money fund industry , which dates back to the early 1970s .
Just last week Bent was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story saying that " the purpose of [ a ] money fund is to bore the investor into a sound night 's sleep . "
A call to the company ’s offices in New York was n’t returned .
Time to play offense
The fact that the economic fallout from this Wall Street meltdown has n’t been worse , says David Leonhardt in The New York Times , “ should be considered a victory for Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson , the point men on the crisis . ”
But while they ’ve reacted aggressively to keep things from crashing down , neither man has done much to address the problems underpinning this crisis .
Bailouts hinder long - term solutions ( think Chrysler ) , and besides , the causes of this crisis — people with stagnant incomes taking “ wishful - thinking loans ” from “ lightly regulated banks ” — ca n’t be solved with a bailout .
Playing defense has kept us from sinking , but “ when will someone start playing offense ? ”
Wall Street ’s dead ; long live Wall Street
“ Wall Street as we know it is kaput , ” says Robert Samuelson in The Washington Post .
And it ’s not just the fall of Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , and AIG .
Rather , “ Wall Street ’s business model has collapsed . ”
Three changes since 1980 — a move by financial firms from advising and acting as intermediary to placing their own market bets ; skewing compensation toward exorbitant bonuses that reward short - term gain ; and a heavy reliance on crazy amounts of leverage — turned Wall Street into “ a manic machine for gambling . ”
It is unclear how Wall Street will restructure itself , and the changes will probably be beneficial , eventually and for a little while , but Wall Street ’s miscalculations will hurt the rest of the economy in the meantime .
( Stephen Elliott reporting )
OAKLAND , California – Linux guru and convicted murdered Hans Reiser was handed a prison sentence of 15 - to - life Friday , putting a final capstone on a case that began as a murder mystery , and ended with Reiser leading police to a makeshift grave a short distance from where he strangled his wife .
" I wish to humbly apologize to society for my crime , " Reiser said in a statement before his sentence was pronounced .
" Every human life is sacred .
I took the life of a human being and I 'm very sorry for that . "
Hans Reiser killed his wife , Nina , at about 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 3 , 2006 , according to the belated confession Reiser wrote as part of his deal , said prosecutor Paul Hora after the sentencing .
He first punched her in the mouth , cutting his hand , then strangled her to death .
He briefly stored the body in the bathroom , then moved it to his car , where it stayed for two days while he searched for a place to bury her .
Nina Reiser , at age 31 , was last seen alive at Hans Reiser 's house in the Oakland hills on the day of her murder , when she dropped off the once - happy couple 's two young children to stay with him the Labor Day weekend .
The couple were in the middle of a heated divorce .
The developer of the ReiserFS file system becomes eligible for parole in about 13 years , having already served two years since his October 2006 arrest .
The 44 - year - old defendant 's jury trial here concluded in April this year with Reiser 's first - degree murder conviction .
That carries a 25 - to - life term , but the authorities , in a backroom deal , later offered him 15 - to - life if he produced his wife 's body and waived any rights to appeal his conviction .
Hans Reiser arrived in court today in his red jumpsuit wearing a long - sleeve undershirt , his hair wild and unkempt .
Reiser was wearing a chain around his waist , linked to his handcuffs .
With no jury to impress , there was no longer a need for Reiser to have a haircut and a suit .
The courtroom was filled , and nearly all the jurors from his trial earlier this year were seated in the front row of the gallery .
When they saw one another , they exchanged hugs .
The start of the hearing was delayed , as Judge Larry Goodman met with Reiser and the attorneys in chambers .
Reiser sat reading through his 30 - page transcribed confession he produced under the terms of his new agreement , which , in addition to leading the police to Nina 's remains , required him to waive his right to appeal .
Just before noon , defense attorney William DuBois returned to the court room , leaned over the table , and told Reiser , " If it takes until midnight , you 're going to be sentenced today . "
The court came to order at 1 p.m. Judge Goodman got right to business .
He pointed out that since the verdict , several significant events have occurred , including the agreement , which would turn Reiser 's first - degree murder conviction into second - degree .
The judge asked Reiser if he understood he was waiving all of his rights to appeal , and Reiser said yes .
But the proceeding ground to a halt when Goodman asked Reiser if he had received competent council in regards to the plea agreement .
There was a long pause and Reiser lowered his head .
He mumbled something .
After repeating the question several times , Goodman finally asked DuBois what Reiser was talking about .
Du Bois said he knew , but that it would not be good for the defendant , and asked if they could go to chambers .
They quickly returned , and Goodman formally found Hans Reiser guilty of second - degree murder .
Reiser was allowed to give a statement before being formally sentenced .
Reiser vowed to try to make up to society for what he had done .
He said he was putting Namesys and ReiserFS into a trust fund his children , and that he hoped to earn money while in prison to make their lives a little more comfortable , " assuming I 'm able to get access to a computer and the internet . "
He also apologized for depriving Anthony Zografos , Nina 's boyfriend , of their lifetime together , and robbing Nina 's mother of her daughter .
" I know how much she loved her . "
Finally , Reiser said he admired the district attorney and the police for their skill and dedication .
The courtroom seemed to exhale as the final chapter in the long Reiser saga closed .
" He 's expressed remorse , " said Hora later .
" But whether it 's actually sincere – time will tell . "
Here 's the video from the sentencing .
Update : A transcript of Reiser 's detailed confession is available here .

Do n't say you did n't know , or can't understand , the presidential candidates ' plans for dealing with America 's healthcare crisis .
Do n't say you do n't get how they might affect you .
It 's all out there , analyses from independent , nonpartisan groups as well as from very partisan groups .
You can have a quick , thumbnail , side - by - side peek at how each candidate sees the future of healthcare .
Or you can dig into papers examining the economic and societal impacts of each plan .
A starting point might be where each candidate stands , from his own point of view .
Sen .
John McCain 's site talks about " Straight Talk on Health System Reform . "
And Sen. Barack Obama 's site proposes a " Plan for a Healthy America . "
But you might want to see the two plans side by side , comparing and contrasting such things as the candidates ' stated goals , overall approach to expanding access to healthcare , changes to private insurance , cost containment , what it 'll cost and who will pay .
The Kaiser Family Foundation , a private , nonprofit health policy and communications organization , has just what you need .
On Sept. 16 , the journal Health Affairs offered a web exclusive with a critique of the Obama healthcare plan , saying its costs are unsustainable , and one of the McCain plan , saying the number of uninsured could grow from 45 million to 60 million in the next five years .
Another article in the journal suggests that America 's healthcare system could benefit from a mixing and matching from each of the plans .
The bottom line from the healthcare economists who examined each candidates ' proposal is that the Obama plan wo n't curb the escalating costs of healthcare in the U.S. , the most expensive system in the world .
And McCain 's plan wo n't reduce the number of uninsured , and likely would increase their ranks .
If that 's too much to read , you can always go to a Sept. 16 L.A . Times story summarizing the Health Affairs articles .
Even if you 've got a job with health insurance , do n't think this debate is n't about you .
The Segal Co. , an actuarial and consulting firm , has put together a report on how the candidates ' health reforms will effect your benefits .
If it 's issues you want , healthcare is a good one .
Do n't say we did n't tell you .

Do you like microblogging , but always found Twitter to be too full of godless heathens ?
Well rejoice , because Gospelr is here !
It 's the Christian version of Twitter , and do we need to explain anything further ?
Praise god no .
The founder says he hopes it will be " effectual in regards to sharing the Gospel , " but then admits " I have no idea how Gospelr might eventually be used . "
Hopefully not by Julia Allison !
Let 's take a look at the holy activity going on at Gospelr right now :
A bunch of meaningless crap , just like non-Christians !
Gospelr should soon be worth billions .

Ministers say that droughts will become ever - more likely unless people start to use less water , and that they will be encouraged to do so if they pay for what they use .
Hilary Benn , the Environment Secretary , said : " We must find efficient ways to save not only water but also the energy needed to pump , treat and heat it . "
This article is part of a series describing a port of the samples from Practical Common Lisp ( PCL ) to Clojure .
You will probably want to read the intro first .
This article covers Chapter 11 , Collections .
Sequence basics
PCL describes a group of basic collection functions : count , find , position , remove , and substitute .
Clojure supports count for a variety of list - like types :
user= > ( count ( quote ( 1 2 3 ) ) ) 3 user= > ( count [ 1 2 3 ] ) 3 user= > ( count # { 1 2 3 } ) 3 user= > ( count " characters " )
10
These types , and any others than implement a basic first / rest protocol , are called sequences in Clojure .
A sequence is logically a list , but may be implemented using other data structures .
In addition to generic sequence functions , some sequences have specific functions unique to their underlying data structure .
Clojure defines find for maps to return the matching key / value pair :
user= > ( find { : lname " Doe " , : fname " John " } : fname ) [ : fname " John " ]
Or , you could just place the map itself in function position , and get back the matching value for a key :
user= > ( { : lname " Doe " , : fname " John " } : fname ) " John "
The Clojure core does not define find for other collection types .
But the implementation is a one - liner using some .
For example , to ask if a collection contains the number 2 :
user= > ( some # ( = % 2 ) [ 1 2 3 ] ) true
Clojure - contrib wraps the some idiom into a function named includes ? .
The rest of the " basic " functions have similar stories :
The Clojure core tends to support them directly where they are efficient ( constant time ) operations .
Where they would take longer ( e.g. linear time ) , the operations can be written as one - liners atop higher - order functions .
Higher - order functions
CL includes higher order versions of the basic functions described above .
These higher - order versions take an additional parameter , which is a function that acts as a filter .
Here are some examples .
First , a collection of days for the examples to work against :
; for re-split ( use ' clojure.contrib.str-utils ) ( def days ( re-split # " " " Sun Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat " ) )
Now I can find the weekdays that start with " S " :
user= > ( filter # ( .startsWith % " S " ) days ) ( " Sun " " Sat " )
Or simply count the days that start with " S " :
user= > ( count ( filter # ( .startsWith % " S " ) days ) ) 2
In an immutable world , remove is the opposite of find .
I can get a collection with all " S " days removed by reversing the previous filter with complement :
user= > ( filter ( complement # ( .startsWith % " S " ) ) days ) ( " Mon " " Tues " " Wed " " Thurs " " Fri " )
To replace all " S " days with " Weekend ! " I can use map :
user= > ( map # ( if ( .startsWith % " S " ) " Weekend ! " % ) days ) ( " Weekend ! " " Mon " " Tues " " Wed " " Thurs " " Fri " " Weekend ! " )
Sorting
Sorting is easy :
user= > ( sort days ) ( " Fri " " Mon " " Sat " " Sun " " Thurs " " Tues " " Wed " )
Sorting by criteria is also easy :
user= > ( sort - by # ( .length % ) days ) ( " Sun " " Mon " " Wed " " Fri " " Sat " " Tues " " Thurs " )
Combining sequences
The concat function concatenates sequences .
user= > ( concat [ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ] ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 )
Note that the resulting sequence is lazy .
So , concat can return without walking each input sequence .
In other words , the ( take 5 ... ) below does not have to wait ( forever ! ) for all the powers of 2 to be generated :
user= > ( take 5 ( concat ( quote ( 1/4 1 /2 ) ) powers - of - 2 ) ) ( 1/4 1 /2 1 2 4 )
What if one of the sequences passed to concat blows up instead of returning a sequence ?
user= > ( take 2 ( concat ' ( 1 2 3 ) ( throw ( Error .
" Not a sequence " ) ) ) ) java.lang .
Error :
Not a sequence
Here concat fails because its second argument is not a sequence .
As it happens , I have an even lazier option than concat .
The lazy - cat function does not even look at each argument until it is forced to do so :
user= > ( take 2 ( lazy - cat ' ( 1 2 3 ) ( throw ( Error .
" Not a sequence " ) ) ) ) ( 1 2 )
Lazy sequences have many uses , but take some getting used to .
One mistake to avoid is trying to inspect a lazy infinite sequence from the REPL .
The REPL tries to print the entire sequence , which will take forever ( literally ) .
Hence the ( take 2 ... ) wrappers above .
Subsequences
It is often interesting to take subsequences from the beginning , middle , or end of a collection .
Clojure supports this in a general way with take and drop .
You have already seen take , which returns the first part of a collection :
user= > ( take 2 days ) ( " Sun " " Mon " )
For the end of a collection , I can use drop :
user= > ( drop 2 days ) ( " Tues " " Wed " " Thurs " " Fri " " Sat " )
For the middle of a collection , I can use take and drop together :
user= > ( take 5 ( drop 1 days ) ) ( " Mon " " Tues " " Wed " " Thurs " " Fri " )
The take - nth function takes only every nth item of a collection .
To demonstrate take - nth , I will begin by defining a lazy collection of the natural - numbers :
( def natural - numbers ( iterate inc 1 ) )
The call to iterate produces a collection that starts with 1 and generates subsequent members by calling inc .
You can verify that these are the natural numbers by taking a few of them .
user= > ( take 10 natural - numbers ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 )
Now I can write an intuitive definition for the even and odd numbers in terms of the natural numbers :
( def odd - numbers ( take - nth 2 natural - numbers ) ) ( def even - numbers ( take - nth 2 ( drop 1 natural - numbers ) ) )
Predicates
Clojure provides a number of functions that test boolean predicates , including every ? , not -any ? , and not - every ? , and some .
Here are a few examples , using the days collection defined above .
Does every day start with " S " ?
user= > ( every ?
# ( .startsWith % " S " ) days ) false
Is there some day that starts with " M " ?
user= > ( some # ( .startsWith % " M " ) days ) true
Map and reduce
map take a function and one or more sequences .
It returns a new sequence which is the result of applying the function to the item (s ) in each sequence .
So , to take the product of numbers from two sequences :
user= > ( map * ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ' ( 10 9 8 7 6 ) ) ( 10 18 24 28 30 )
If I want to control the type of collection returned , I can use into :
user= > ( into [ ] ( map * ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ' ( 10 9 8 7 6 ) ) ) [ 10 18 24 28 30 ]
reduce walks down a collection , applying function f of two arguments to the first two arguments , then applying f to the result of the first call and the next element .
This is very useful for operations that process a sequence and return a single value .
For example , I can sum a sequence :
user= > ( reduce + [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ) 15
Or find the max value of a sequence :
user= > ( reduce max [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ) 5
Maps
Maps ( hash tables in CL ) can be iterated just like any other sequence type , bearing in mind that the function you pass in should expect a key / value pair .
Given the following map of names to scores :
user= > ( def scores { : john 18 , : jane 21 , : jim 14 } ) 7 # 'user / scores
I can find all the people who scored above 15 :
user= > ( filter ( fn [ [ k, v ] ] ( > v 15 ) ) scores ) ( [ : jane 21 ] [ : john 18 ] )
Notice how the destructuring bind ( [ [ k , v ] ] ) makes it easy to bind k and v separately , without introducing a temporary variable pair that I do n't really need .
Wrapping up
Lisp excels at processing lists .
Clojure offers similar capabilities , but generalized to sequences , which can be lists , vectors , maps , sets , or other list - like collections .
Clojure 's support for lazy collections allows a different style for collection processing that I will continue to explore in later articles in this series .

Revision history
Why people who believe in God 'are more likely to have a lower IQ '
President George Bush :
Not known for being the smartest politician , he is deeply religious
Stupid people are more likely than eggheads to believe in God , a controversial new study claims .
In a move that is bound to offend millions of churchgoers , a British psychologist says he has found a link between having a high IQ and being an atheist .
The discovery helps explain why university academics are less likely to be religious than almost anyone else , he says .
Church leaders dismissed the study as absurd and simplistic .
They pointed out that many of the greatest brains in history believed in God .
The study came from Prof Richard Lynn - a retired academic at the University of Ulster who has courted controversy in the past with studies looking at sex , race and intelligence .
His latest work , published today in the scientific journal Intelligence , compared religious belief and average national IQs in 137 countries .
Information about faith was based on surveys carried out in 2004 .
Prof Lynn found that in only 17 per cent of countries did the proportion of people who believe in God fall below 80 per cent .
' These are virtually all the higher IQ countries , ' he said .
Controversial : Prof Richard Lynn 's study has infuriated the church community
When he broke down the statistics , he found a strong link between intelligence and faith .
Countries with a lower national IQ tended to have the most believers .
One of the few exceptions was America - a high IQ country where only 10 per cent of people do n't believe in God .
In Britain - another high IQ country - the figure is around 40 per cent , he said .
' One factor that could provide a possible explanation for this is that many Americans are Catholics and the percentage of believers in Catholic countries in Europe is generally much higher than in Protestant countries , ' he said .
' A further possible factor might be that that the number of emigrants from Europe went to the United States because of their strong religious beliefs - so it may be that these beliefs have been transmitted as a cultural and even genetic ally to subsequent generations . '
Prof Lynn said a survey of fellows of the Royal Society - Britain 's science academy - found that only 3.3 per cent believed in God at a time when nearly 70 per cent of Britons described themselves as having a faith .
Prof Lynn said most primary school children believde in God - but that they lose their faith as they get older and begin to question the world .
But Prof Gordon Lynch of Birkbeck College , London , said the study had failed to take into account complicated economic , historical and social factors that explained different IQ and ' faith ' levels in countries .
' Linking religious belief and intelligence in this way could reflect a dangerous trend , developing a simplistic characterisation of religion as primitive , ' he said .
Ben Wilson a spokesman for the Church of England said : ' The idea that believers are not intelligent is absurd .
' Some of the greatest thinkers through history have been people of faith .
You do n't have to leave your brain in the church porch . '
A woolly jumper :
The sheep that leapt onto the roof of a two - storey house
A cat stuck up a tree they could understand .
But when they were called out to rescue a sheep stuck on a roof , firemen thought the wool was being pulled over their eyes .
However , when they arrived at the scene in Harrogate North Yorkshire , there indeed was a woolly wanderer standing on top of a two - storey house ... contentedly grazing on vegetation which had grown between the tiles .
It had roamed into the garden of a cottage and jumped on to an outhouse before making its way on to the roof .
How on earth did ewe get up there ?
Fire crews used an aerial - ladder platform to try to reach it , but it ran on to an adjacent roof and fell , breaking a rear leg .
Ben Cairns , from Harrogate Fire Station Green Watch , said : ' It 's possibly the most unusual animal that we have attempted to rescue from a roof .
Watch your step :
The sheep was treated for a broken leg after slipping while trying to evade capture
The fire brigade tried to rescue the runaway sheep
' It slipped off the front of the property and landed .
It was fine , although its leg was injured .
We left it with villagers who knew the local farmer .
' Every effort was made to protect the animal from becoming harmed . '
Fire crews were shocked to see the animal on top of the roof

Advertisement A total eclipse of the Sun has been witnessed in Canada , Russia and China , casting dramatic shadows and allowing a glimpse of the Sun 's outer atmosphere .
The Moon 's shadow arced over the Earth as the lunar body passed directly between our planet and its star .
In all , the path of darkness covered about 10,200 km ( 6,300 miles ) .
Russia saw the longest full eclipse , for two minutes , 27 seconds , at 1021 GMT - but the UK and most of Europe experienced just a partial eclipse .
The eclipse path covers 10,200 km ( 6,300 miles )
Enlarge Image
" Totality " began at sunrise at 0921 GMT in Queen Maud Gulf off Victoria Island in the territory of Nunavut , Canada .
The instant of greatest eclipse occurred at 1021 GMT close to the Russian city of Nadym , before totality came to an end at 1121 GMT near the Chinese city of Xi'an , in Shaanxi province .
Tourists and amateur and professional astronomers flocked to towns in the best viewing locations along the path of totality .
In Novosibirsk , Siberia 's cultural and scientific capital , more than 5,000 foreign tourists were expected to show up in the city .
China experienced the eclipse just a week before the opening ceremony of Beijing 's Olympic Games .
Chinese TV was due to broadcast the eclipse live , with crowds of people gathered along the Silk Road , a fabled trading route through the country 's western deserts .
Eclipses were once viewed as unlucky events in China , but the country 's media had rebranded the event as " the Olympic eclipse " , reports said , hoping for good fortune ahead of the sporting jamboree .
Moonshadow
The eclipse allowed astronomers a glimpse of the Sun 's corona - its outer atmosphere of super - heated gases .
The area is usually impossible to see because of the bright light of the Sun , but is visible during a total eclipse as the Sun 's light is obscured .
Total solar eclipses usually take place about once every 18 months , and always at new Moon - when the lunar body sits directly between the Sun and the Earth .
Please turn on JavaScript .

However , they do not happen every new Moon .
The lunar orbit is slightly tilted to that of our planet and therefore the Moon 's shadow often misses the Earth .
The Moon 's shadow has two parts : an umbra and a penumbra .
The umbra is the " inner " part of the Moon 's shadow , and people inside this zone will witness the full glory of the eclipse .
The penumbra is the Moon 's faint " outer " shadow .
It will only give surface viewers a partial eclipse .
The Sun was partially eclipsed over London on Friday morning In London , where the Moon 's disc took its biggest bite out of the Sun at 1016 BST ( 0916 GMT ) , a maximum of 12 % of the star was blotted out .
Conditions were better further north .
In Lerwick in the Shetland Isles , the Moon obscured as much as 36 % of the Sun . Astronomical groups reminded the public that viewing the Sun without protective equipment - even in partial eclipse phases - could result in a retinal burn and permanent eye damage .
Viewing the Sun 's harsh light should only be done through proper solar telescopes or glasses , or through a pinhole projection system .

New York , NY – Nigerian philanthropic billionaire Esenam Ayele said that he would make $ 80 billion dollars available to US banks from his accounts in Nigeria .
All he needed to transfer the funds was a trusted associate at the bank .
It could n't come at a better time for Wall Street as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , the sale of Merrill Lynch and government bailout of AIG has left markets tumbling with no bottom in site .
The guaranteed funds should bring some stability back to financial institutions .
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said Ayele could be trusted .
" I know he's had problems in the past with people believing him , but I assured the folks over at Washington Mutual that he was for real . "
Ayele , who has returned to wealth with the rise in oil prices , said from his palace in Lagos , " I just need someone to fax me a copy of the transfer codes on some bank stationery , and I 'll get the money right over . "
He added that his widowed sister also had more funds she could transfer out of the country which she inherited from Prince Ugube of Tanzania .
" She just as helpful as I am , but she 's unable to come to the United States because of a visa issue .
If somebody could just send her a cashier 's check for $ 1000 , she 'll be able to clear everything up and transfer the funds . "

The American government would rather have private funds involved as to not create the appearance that taxpayers will rescue every bank from dumb mistakes .
" I 'm glad I can be of service , " said Ayele .
" The American people have done so much for me .
I 'm thankful to return the favor . "
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,458 points on the news .

There 's one thing more annoying than a game character that outstays their welcome , and that 's a game character that vanishes too quickly .
They may live on in memory , or eke out an existence on XBLA , Virtual Console or old - school compilations , but they are caught in the curious predicament of staying forever young while ageing horribly in today 's hyper - fast world of mega - power gaming .
This article is dedicated to some of the game characters that deserved more ( except Croc ) , but were , for whatever reason , left behind .
Forever frozen in the past like 16 - bit popsicles .
These are the game characters that time forgot .

The Mervyns department store chain Tuesday joined the parade of retailers entering bankruptcy , staggered by a tottering economy made more tenuous by escalating job losses and higher gasoline prices .
The company , which operates 129 stores in California , plans to remain open during the bankruptcy process .
But its future remains clouded by a retail environment in which consumers are abandoning mid-tier retailers for bigger bargains at discount stores .
“ They ’re one of the groups in the retail sector that ’s going to be most affected by the downtrending economy , ” said Marshal Cohen , chief industry analyst for NPD Group , a market research firm .
“ It ’s just too much for them to absorb all of these forces coming on them all at once . ”
Other retailers that have sought bankruptcy protection in recent months include Shoe Pavilion Inc. , Sharper Image Inc. , Steve & Barry ’s and Linens ‘n Things Inc .
Though the circumstances vary , retail experts say a common thread is that consumers have been pinched by the housing downturn , job losses and higher costs for food and fuel .

That ’s an ominous sign for the economy , leading to more job losses and more vacancies in shopping centers , said Esmael Adibi of the Anderson Center for Economic Research at Chapman University .
“ The retail industry , whether it ’s the actual stores or vendors , will go through cutbacks in jobs , and that will exacerbate overall job losses for the region , ” Adibi said .
“ There ’s no ray of sunshine here .
You try to find one thing positive .
I can ’t . ”
California could be hit particularly hard , Adibi and others said .
During the housing boom that began in the late 1990s , retailers rushed to open stores in outlying suburbs such as the Inland Empire and Antelope Valley .
But with many of those new homes now lost to foreclosure , retailers have been forced to retrench in the state , where many of them have their largest number of stores .

“ If the economic pressures become more pronounced , Californian consumers will suffer more than the rest of us , ” said Burt P. Flickinger III , managing director for Strategic Resource Group , a business strategy firm .
“ And the more Californian consumers suffer the more we suffer nationally and , ultimately , internationally . ”
Mervyns , like Shoe Pavilion and Sharper Image , is based in California , and most of its 177 stores are here .
Given the severity of the housing downturn here , “ California could lead the retail bankruptcy rate in the country , ” said Sung Won Sohn , professor of economics with the Smith School of Business at Cal State Channel Islands in Camarillo .
In filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , Hayward , Calif . - based Mervyns blamed the “ state of the economy and difficult operating environment for our industry . ”
“ After careful consideration of available alternatives , the company ’s management board determined that a Chapter 11 filing was a necessary and prudent step that allows us to operate our business without interruption as we seek to restructure our debt and other obligations in a controlled , court - supervised environment , ” John Goodman , Mervyns chief executive , said in the statement .

The company said in its filing that it had identified a “ limited number ” of unprofitable stores that should be closed , but it did n’t divulge the locations .
The filing came on the anniversary of the company ’s founding by Mervin Morris .
“ Fifty - nine years ago this very day we opened the first store and it was a huge success , ” Morris , 88 , said Tuesday .
“ A huge success means we took in $ 1,500 , and I thought I died and went to heaven .
And today is a very sad day for me . ”
The department store chain is now owned by Sun Capital Partners Inc. , a Florida investment firm that was part of the group that acquired Mervyns from Target Corp. in 2004 for $ 1.2 billion .

In its bankruptcy filing , the company said it had implemented a turnaround plan early this year to set itself apart from competitors and improve its sales .
But that plan bumped up against external economic factors , including the decline in the housing market and the tightening in the credit markets , which affected consumer spending and ultimately “ led to a precipitous decline in the debtors ’ profitability and liquidity , ” the filing said .
It also said that Mervyns assets and debts both fall between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion ; a company spokesman declined to elaborate .
Fans of the store said they like its prices and regularly scan its weekly ads in search of bargains .

“ I ’m in here trying to save them , ” Carol Surface , 53 , of Beverly Hills said Tuesday at the Westchester store .
“ I told my husband last night , ‘ I just might cry if Mervyns goes out of business . ’ ”
But Robin Leishman , an architectural designer from Woodland Hills , said that Mervyns was not her first choice for shopping , even though she could “ always find what I need here . ”
“ I prefer going to Target , only because it ’s a better atmosphere , ” said Leishman , 53 .
“ The Targets , the Wal - Marts -- there ’s more variety , they ’re larger , ” said Janice Triplett , 55 , who teaches dental hygiene .
“ It ’s like a one - stop shop . ”

Discount stores have been among the biggest beneficiaries of economic stimulus checks issued by the government in recent months .
Shares of Wal - Mart Stores Inc. have gained nearly 22 % since Jan.
1 . Big Lots Inc. has seen its stock rise by 86 % .
More broadly , sales at stores open a year or more rose 4.3 % in June , the strongest monthly advance in more than a year , according to the International Council of Shopping Centers ’ tally of 38 chains nationwide .
Wal - Mart posted a 6.4 % jump , its biggest in more than two years , and BJ ’s Wholesale Club Inc. notched a 16.5 % gain , its best in at least seven years .
But many traditional department stores , including luxury retailers , are struggling .
The shopping centers council estimates that 144,000 stores will be shuttered nationwide this year , 7 % more than in 2007 and the largest jump since the trade group began tracking retail bankruptcies 14 years ago .
It estimates that national chains will account for about 6,500 closures , and independent stores will account for the rest .

Britt Beemer , chairman of America ’s Research Group , predicts that the industry is in for a miserable Christmas that will be followed by more bankruptcy filings in the first three months of 2009 .
“ You ai n’t seen nothing yet .
It ’s going to be a blood bath , ” he said .
“ I think retailers are going to be extremely weak financially coming out of Christmas . ”

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Air traffic delays began to clear up Tuesday evening after computer problems left travelers across the United States waiting in airports , the Federal Aviation Administration said .
Flights at Atlanta 's Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport were delayed Tuesday afternoon .
Airports experienced hours of flight delays Tuesday afternoon after a communications breakdown at a Federal Aviation Administration facility , the administration said .
The facility south of Atlanta had problems processing data , requiring that all flight - plan information be processed through a facility in Salt Lake City , Utah , overloading that facility .
The two facilities process all flight plans for commercial and general aviation flights in the United States , FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said .
Delays had begun to clear by 5 p.m. ET .
By 6 p.m. , the administration said minimal delays remained as the Salt Lake facility began processing requests closer to normal speed .
" The situation is pretty much resolved , " FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said .
At about 9:30 p.m. ET , most major airports were reporting flights departing on time or with less than 15 - minute delays .
Newark International was still reporting delays of up to 1 hour and 45 minutes and LaGuardia Airport in New York reported 45 - minute delays -- although weather problems were cited as the main problem .
John F. Kennedy International in New York and Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International were reporting delays of up to 30 minutes , although both of those airports also had experienced thunderstorms and other weather - related difficulties .
The administration said there were no radar outages and said it had not lost contact with any planes during the computer glitch .
The roughly 5,000 flights that were in the air when the breakdown happened were not affected , just those that were waiting to take off .

" This is really not a safety issue , this is an aggravation issue , " CNN aviation expert Miles O'Brien said .

The problem appeared similar to a June 8 , 2007 , computer issue that caused severe flight delays and some cancellations along the East Coast .

Are you stuck at the airport ?
i Reporter Stephanie McCauley sat on the tarmac for more than an hour at Baltimore / Washington International Airport on Tuesday on a flight bound for Albany , New York .
" It happens .
It 's just weird , because you 're sitting , and you do n't know if it 's going to be 20 minutes or 2 hours , " McCauley said .
Cheryl Stewart , spokeswoman for Baltimore / Washington International Airport , said that as of about 3:40 p.m. , some flights were being allowed to take off , but the FAA was no longer accepting new flight plans .
" We 're just kind of waiting for further word , " Stewart said .
On the FAA 's Web site , delays were being reported at all 40 airports on the administration 's primary flight information map .
The worst delays were in the Northeast , Bergen said .
Chicago 's Midway and O'Hare airports in Illinois were reporting delays of up to 90 minutes .
The Web site , which normally lists the length of expected flight delays , was no longer listing that information Tuesday afternoon .
The total number of flights affected was unknown , although it was believed to be in the hundreds .
Mark Biello , a CNN photographer sitting on a delayed flight at Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport in Atlanta on Tuesday afternoon , said flights there were being cleared for takeoff one at a time .

" They 're releasing the planes but on a one - by - one basis , so it 's really backed the whole system up , at least in the Atlanta area , " Biello said .
At Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania , iReporter Randy Hehn and his wife were on their way home to Denver , Colorado , after a trip to Europe .
He said he'd left Stockholm , Sweden , 11 hours earlier .
" I do n't really want to spend the rest of the evening in the airport ; I 'm hoping they get this fixed , " Hehn said in a video posted on iReport.com .
" I see planes moving around , but I do n't know .
" We 're just coming back from Europe , we 're really tired , and this is bad news . "

A second photograph has been discovered showing a group of the Spain 's Olympic athletes making slit - eyed gestures .
In the image , which was found on the official website of the Spanish Tennis Federation , players and support staff from the country 's Federation Cup Team are seen pulling their eyes back alongside the caption " Estamos preparados para China " - " We are prepared for China " .
It is thought to have been taken in April , prior to the team playing their Chinese counterparts in the semi-final of the competition - the leading team event for female tennis players .
Visible in the picture are Nuria Llagostera Vives , Anabel Medina Garrigues and Carla Suarez - Navarro , who are all at present competing in Beijing .
The discovery comes days after a photograph showing the Spanish Olympic basketball team making the same gestures emerged .
It was part of an advert that appeared in Marca , Spain best - selling newspaper , and was meant to promote the country 's involvement in the 2008 Games .
No offence is believed to have been intended by the photographs and , as yet , Olympic organisers have not issued a complaint in regard to either of them , but the pictures have caused much adverse comment , particularly in the United States .
Luis Aragones , the former manager of the national football team , was heard in 2004 calling the France striker Thierry Henry a " black shit " , shortly before home supporters racially abused Ashley Cole and Shaun Wright - Phillips during a friendly between Spain and England in Madrid .

Is sleep essential ?
Ask that question to a sleep - deprived new parent or a student who has just pulled an " all - nighter , " and the answer will be a grouchy , " Of course ! "
But to a sleep scientist , the question of what constitutes sleep is so complex that scientists are still trying to define the essential function of something we do every night .
A study published this week in PLoS Biology by Chiara Cirelli and Giulio Tononi addresses this pressing question .
The search for the core function of sleep can seem as elusive as the search for the mythological phoenix , says Cirelli , an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison .
Some scientists argue that sleep is merely a way to impose a quiet , immobile state ( rest ) , and is n't important by itself in mammals and birds .
This is the so - called " null hypothesis , " and Cirelli and Tononi reject it .
" We do n't understand the purpose of sleep , but it must be important because all animals do it , " Cirelli says .
There 's no clear evidence of an animal species that does n't sleep , she says .
Even the dolphin — which is sometimes held up as an animal that does n't sleep because it moves continuously — will show " unihemispheric sleep " with one eye closed and one half its brain showing the slow waves characteristic of deep sleep .
" The very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization . . . , rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether , should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated , " Cirelli says .
She also argues that sleep is strictly regulated by the brain , because sleep deprivation is followed by a rebound , in which the sleep - deprived animal either sleeps longer , or spends more time in the deeper sleep characterized by large slow brain waves .
Prolonged sleep deprivation has been shown to kill rats , flies and cockroaches .
Humans who have a genetic insomnia can also die .
In less extreme cases , sleep deprivation affects cognitive function in animals ranging from flies to rodents .
Rats kept awake will engage in " micro- sleep " episodes , and sleep - deprived humans tend to fall asleep even in the most dangerous circumstances .
Because it is universal , tightly regulated , and cannot be lost without serious harm , Cirelli argues that sleep must have an important core function .
But what ?
" Sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day , " Cirelli and Tononi say .
Their hypothesis is that sleep allows the brain to regroup after a hard day of learning by giving the synapses , which increase in strength during the day , a chance to damp down to baseline levels .
This is important because the brain uses up to 80 percent of its energy to sustain synaptic activity .
Sleep may also be important for consolidating new memories , and to allow the brain to " forget " the random , unimportant impressions of the day , so there is room for more learning the next day .
This could be why the brain waves are so active during certain periods of sleep .
" While there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep , it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep , particularly at the cellular level , is still a worthwhile exercise , " she concludes .

Will the easy availability of drugs on the Internet open the door to a depraved new world ?
If current trends are any indication , U.S. drug policy is an endangered species By Michelle Goldberg
It came in a plain brown wrapper -- two varieties of high - grade marijuana totaling a quarter ounce , delivered to a downtown San Francisco office building via regular mail .
The pot had been ordered off a website in Amsterdam , members.xoom.com /drugsstore/ , which is designed to look just like a Dutch coffee - shop menu .
The site offers two types of weed and five types of hash , all pictured and listed on a pull - down order form with boxes to let buyers specify how many grams of each kind they want .
After ordering , customers receive an email with an address on it .
They 're instructed to send cash .
It 's a risk , but in this case it paid off .
The twentysomething professional who ordered it found the marijuana to be not only a bargain at $ 92 including delivery , but sweet , green and potent .
Of course , buying marijuana online is illegal .
But enforcing marijuana prohibition online is n't easy , especially when sellers live in countries with more tolerant drug laws , such as the Netherlands .
Even harder to detect is the flourishing online seed trade , since packages of pot seeds are usually undetectable by the U.S. Department of Customs drug dogs .
The result is that the Internet , which for years has been making national borders increasingly porous , is slowly helping to subvert marijuana prohibition .
The new trade is thriving on two fronts : filling up the stash boxes of recreational users who want the same convenience buying their weed that they have purchasing books and CDs at amazon.com , and supplying medical marijuana patients , especially those in places like San Jose without a local pot dispensary .
" The government is going to learn what the music industry is learning .
The net is a wall buster , " says technology journalist Jon Katz , who wrote the Netizen column for Hotwired and who now writes for the tech news site Slashdot .
" It 's not policeable .
There are not enough cops in the world to monitor all the communications and digital commerce that 's going on .
The effort to control the flow of drugs into the U.S. is a complete failure with or without the Internet .
The Internet is just going to make it harder .
There are millions of new ways for consumers and retailers to find each other .
The DEA can sniff all the packages it wants , but it can't make more than a fraction of a dent in the business . "
In real life , a person without a regular marijuana connection may spend days or weeks searching for a dealer .
Online , it takes just a few clicks .
Though he 's never done it , Katz says he would feel comfortable buying pot online .
" I feel I can buy almost anything online safely , " he says .
" I know enough people online that could get almost anything for me in minutes .
"
In fact , Katz believes that the Internet is going to force a reconsideration of domestic marijuana policy .
" That 's the power of the Net - - it 's really not for the government to be telling people whether they should be using marijuana or not , and the Internet makes it possible for people to make these judgments on their own .
The Internet has killed off traditional notions of moral policing . "
International Marketplace OF COURSE , THE ONLINE marijuana business is just the latest example of ways the Internet has made national borders amorphous and national laws hard to enforce .
The wide distribution of prescription drugs online without prescriptions is well documented but difficult for the government to fight , especially with Internet doctors willing to write virtual prescriptions after brief questionnaires .
There are dozens of online overseas pharmacies that will ship drugs which are controlled in the United States but not abroad .
Try typing " Viagra " or " Xanax " into a search engine and see how many offers come up .
In a recent issue of The Industry Standard , James Ledbetter wrote , " There 's a pile of drugs on my desk .
Dozens of pills of different shapes , sizes and colors , designed to treat obesity , baldness and erectile dysfunction .
My doctor did not prescribe them , and -- knock on wood - - I have no medical need for any of them .
How did they get here ?
Through the magic of the World Wide Web . "
Online gambling , another illegal activity in many states , also thrives .
Though a congressional commission recently recommended a ban on Internet gaming , they could n't come up with a viable way to enforce it .
Writes Declan McCullagh in Wired News ,
" The commission identified overseas betting sites as a major problem .
Such sites are often located in countries that license those businesses , as the state of Nevada does for physical casinos .
The group appears to have recognized that the only way to stop eager Americans from connecting to offshore sites would be to censor all overseas links , much as Singapore and China do when restricting access to information that their governments find objectionable .
The report notes that such a law ' may be easily circumvented . ' "
The same is true , it seems , for marijuana law .
Chain of Contraband Command WHEN I CALL the San Francisco office of the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Postal Inspection Service they both claim to be unaware of the Internet marijuana trade , suggesting how easy it is for digital dealers to escape notice .
And even if they are caught , the DEA has no jurisdiction outside the United States .
Not that they 're admitting powerlessness .
" In cooperation with authorities in other countries , we can arrest and extradite dealers , " says Evelyn James , DEA special agent and public information officer .
Dutch police , she points out , have shut down marijuana websites before , usually at the request of foreign governments .
Nevertheless , the possibility of legal trouble does n't much worry Joey Phdfort , a 35 - year - old Amsterdam man who runs a website ( people .A2000.nl / lpafort / ) where people from around the world can order weed .
" I live in the Netherlands , where cannabis is allowed .
I do nothing wrong , " he says .
Phdfort , who is suffering from liver cancer , believes he is doing humanitarian work .
" In Holland , doctors give cancer patients cannabis and it helps .
I can help other people who need it also .
Most of the people who are buying from me are ill .
Most of them have cancer themselves .
That is why they buy it on the Internet . "
He points out the logistical troubles that many cancer patients have in acquiring marijuana .
It 's not like they can call up an old college pal who knows where to score .
" If somebody is 40 or 50 years old , how can he buy it if the government wo n't allow it ? " he asks .
" If you are sick and you need it and you know that it helps , why not ? "
Phdfort says that he used to send out 1,000 packages a week , but now that his sickness has progressed , he only has time to serve a few dozen regular customers , making about 25 mailings a week .
Customs , he says , are rarely a problem -- he estimates that 99 percent of the marijuana he sends out makes it to its addressee intact .
In the case of the order placed from and delivered to San Francisco , the marijuana came in small , plastic zipper bags , placed inside a padded envelope .
Nothing fancy about it .
Recipients in the United States are obviously subject to our drug laws , but , although importing drugs is a federal crime , buyers are unlikely to face penalties much stiffer than they would for possession of the same amount in their city and state .
" The whole purpose for having federal law enforcement as opposed to state , county or municipal law enforcement is so that we can most efficiently and effectively utilize taxpayer resources .
It is not appropriate for federal - level resources to be used to prosecute someone in possession of one joint , " concedes DEA spokeswoman James .
" That does not mean we wo n't arrest you and prosecute you through the state system .
If you 're using the mail , that 's a separate crime that you can be charged with . "
But the Postal Inspection Service , the government agency in charge of investigating crimes involving the mail , is also unlikely to throw the book at minor buyers , especially those with a medical excuse .
" If a website is in Amsterdam we do n't have any jurisdiction there , " says U.S. Postal Inspector Linda Joe .
" If marijuana does come here and if customs does n't catch it and we do , then of course we 'll seize it .
There we run into the issue of whether it will be prosecuted .
That varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction .
Sometimes if the U.S. attorney 's office does n't want to prosecute , a local DA will .
It would depend on the quantity of drugs and how often a person had been receiving them .
We 'd definitely look into it to see if this was a one - shot deal or if they 'd been getting packages every week . "
The Postal Inspection Service is much more concerned , it seems , with dealers sending huge packages via the mail to other dealers .
A quote from the chief postal inspector published in the agency 's 1998 annual report reads : " Marijuana is the most prevalent drug found in the mail , and Postal Inspectors focus investigative efforts on the large quantities associated with drug dealers . "
Last year , for instance , three Californians were arrested for mailing 11,000 pounds of pot to the East Coast .
Of the 651 marijuana - related arrests that the postal service made last year , most were of members of huge drug - trafficking rings , like the 106 people busted in Southern California in a sting involving the seizure of 2,824 pounds of weed .
The fact that the feds are unlikely to prosecute small - time recipients is n't always good news for buyers .
Joe recalls one case in which a man in Virginia was receiving pot in the mail from a relative in New Jersey .
The sender 's case , which the government considered more serious because he was dealing , was prosecuted federally , and he got probation .
Since the feds were n't interested in going after the recipient , his case was pursued by his own county DA in Virginia , and he ended up getting six years .
Locally , Santa Clara County 's prosecutors say they 'll certainly go after those ordering pot online for fun .
" Without hesitation we would prosecute them .
We prosecute people who possess marijuana every day , " says assistant district attorney Karyn Sinunu .
But she throws in the caveat that her office would probably leave those with legitimate doctor recommendations alone .
" If someone has marijuana and they have a recommendation to have it , under state law we 're not going to prosecute , " she says .
" We do n't have any state agencies investigating what goes through the mail , so if the feds have a hands - off policy , there probably would n't be a prosecution .
I 'd have to see an actual case and make a determination based on the person 's criminal history , medical need , the amount and whether they had a legitimate [ medical ] recommendation .
I truly believe that marijuana has some medical purpose , and I truly believe that some people are abusing Proposition 215 [ the proposition legalizing possession of medical marijuana ] .
Legitimate patients should be able to use medicinal marijuana without being hassled by the police . "
Clicking for Cannabis :

Medical Quandary EVER SINCE
San Jose police shut the Santa Clara County Medical Cannabis Center down in March of 1998 , it is unclear where San Jose 's medical marijuana patients have been getting their pot .
Buying marijuana online may be the best option for those who can't score on the street or through friends or make the journey to Santa Cruz or San Francisco .
" Patients are scattering .
It 's all underground .
They 're just getting it off the street , " says Suzie Andrews , owner of Rainbow Smoke Shop , a store on West San Carlos Street that sells marijuana accessories .
Andrews is currently working to open a new dispensary in San Jose -- she hopes to be operating by the end of the year .
Until then , she says , " People will try to gain access any way they can . "
Of the online marijuana trade , Andrews says , " I think it 's a great idea , as long as what they 're selling is what they 're advertising .
Patients do n't have too many choices these days . "
Andrews says patients often come into her shop asking where they can buy marijuana .
" We go through all the options , " she says .
" I talk to people about growing , tell them about the right lights to use .
A lot of people can't grow their own so they try to find out who is selling it .
It breaks my heart that they have to scramble around like that . "
Right now , Sinunu is recommending that patients grow their own .
" One of the problems with 215 is they say you can have marijuana for medicinal purposes , but where the hell is it supposed to come from ? "
Sinunu says .
" You 're either going to have to grow it or have a caregiver grow it for you .
Right now that 's all the law permits . "
Besides sticking to the letter of the law , she adds , patients who grow their own can be sure that their marijuana is free of additives that could exacerbate their illnesses .
" I had a very good friend use marijuana at the end of her life , and you want your marijuana to be clean ; you do n't want people who are already sick to have stuff that might be contaminated .
Some of the stuff that comes up from Mexico is often padded with other ingredients , really foul ingredients .
That 's why I always recommend to bona fide patients that they grow it themselves . "
Growing the Grass WHILE GROWERS can always pick through a bag of pot for seeds , if they want to know exactly what they 're raising , the Internet can be a huge help .
There are dozens of seed banks online based both in the Netherlands and in Canada , where possession of marijuana seeds is legal .
The seed trade is flourishing both because seeds , tiny and odorless , are easy to ship , and also because selling seeds is more profitable than selling actual marijuana .
" In the economics of marijuana , cultivating for seeds is a better industry than cultivating for bud , " remarks John Entwistle , legislative analyst for Californians for Compassionate Use and one of the authors of Proposition 215 .
" Those little seeds are just worth so much money .
It takes years to get them because you have to do all this genetic work -- when you buy seeds , you 're buying knowledge of what the plant is .
If they tell you , for example , that the plant will mature in exactly 92 days , it generally will . "
Indeed , the language on seed sites drips with the kind of reverent connoisseurship often found among wine snobs .
On Heaven 's Stairway ( www.hempqc.com), a strain called Amstel Gold that sells for $ 50 per packet of 10 seeds is described as " soft with a citruslike aroma and a good high .
Easy to grow , grows with long compact resinous buds . "
The more expensive Durban Poison ( $ 75 for 10 seeds ) is said to be " 100 % Sativa .
Large long bud leaves , buds are also large and long with lots of resin .
A sweet licorice or anise flavor .
' Up ' high similar to Thai . ...
Also does very well under artificial light . "
To order , you simply send an international money order or certified check ( all prices are in U.S. dollars ) to a post office box in Quebec .
Self - Regulation FOR MANY WOULD -BE
Internet pot buyers , even those who are n't afraid of running afoul of the law , the fear of being scammed is a strong deterrent .
But unlike the real - life black market , the Internet fosters a community of users who constantly rate sites and trade advice .
" The odds online overwhelmingly favor the buyer , " Katz says , based on his observations of the online drug community in action .
Discussions flourish at www.yahooka.com and www.cannabis.com, and on newsgroups such as alt.drugs.pot.cultivation .
There 's even a Zagat guide of sorts for seed banks at www.suresite.com/ca/r/razzmat/, where online seed stores are rated for reliability , speed of delivery and convenience of ordering .
Here you can learn which sites take checks , which take money orders at no extra charge and which provide free shipping .
Additionally , the webmaster warns users against sites known to burn would - be buyers .
Joel , a recreational grower who buys seeds online , used the site as a guide and was very pleased with the results .
" I went with one of his five - star guys .
It took about a month , but I got my product and I was very happy with it .
They did an excellent job . "
Before the Internet , Joel says , buying seeds could be difficult " unless you knew someone , went to Canada or flew over to Amsterdam . "
The Internet also makes growing easier by providing access to a group of experts ready to answer questions from novices growing the first plant or from veteran cultivators attempting new , more difficult strains .
" The guys on the cultivation newsgroup are really nice , " Joel says .
" It 's the greatest source on the Internet for growing advice .
There are four or five guys who are really cool and will answer pretty much any question . "
Anyway , he adds , growing pot , even indoors , is pretty simple .
" It 's easier than growing a house plant , " he says .
" I 'd kill a house plant .
Marijuana literally grows like a weed .
You can buy a cheap fluorescent light and keep it over your seeds and in a 120 days you 'll have a cheap , jumbo crop . "
Joel says he 's not too concerned about being busted .
" I worry to some extent , but really they'd have to be kind of silly to pay attention to me .
Why would anyone spend an ungodly amount of money to catch someone buying 10 seeds ?
I do take precautions , though .
I use proxy servers and remailers to post to the newsgroups , which makes it a real pain to trace it back to me . "
He 's probably right .
" Technically seeds are illegal , but there is n't THC in the seeds , only in the plant itself , " says postal inspector Joe .
" They would be seized , but as far as prosecution , it would depend on the local climate . "

Paranoid Collusions STILL , MOST OF THOSE involved in the fight for marijuana legalization caution against buying anything illegal through the Internet .
" I would be very cautious about putting my name out there as a consumer of marijuana , " Entwistle says .
" We have run several messages on our website saying that one of the stupidest things you can do is buy pot through the Internet .
It 's even riskier than going up to somebody in the street , " says John Holmstrom , multimedia director for High Times magazine .
" Who knows who 's behind the website ?
What if it 's a government agency and they 're keeping a list of everyone they 're sending pot to ? "
Suspicions run especially high around sites that offer to ship marijuana domestically , because people worry that such sites are government sting operations .
Arizona Company Medical ( www.medical-marijuana.com), for example , is a pot website registered to an address in Anaheim , Calif .
It 's run by Anaheim resident Mike Aranov , who refused to answer questions except to say that his site ships to people throughout the country , which is , obviously , illegal .
To order , buyers must send a check or money order along with a copy of a medical report or a doctor 's note and " proof of ID " ( what constitutes proof is unclear ) to 5051 E. Orangethorpe Ave. , Suite E , in Anaheim .
The prices are low , starting at $ 65 for a quarter ounce .
One Bay Area marijuana dispensary worker said that he'd heard about successful buys through the site , but he does n't recommend using it .
" I met a gentleman from the company who said they were doing fine .
It 's strange that they 're able to survive , " he says .
" I have hesitations because of the federal government 's ability to tap into it .
They might even be dealing with a narc to catch people who are propositioning them .
You do n't know what you 're getting into . "
Enwistle said he 's been getting lots of inquiries lately from people who want to know whether Arizona Medical is safe .
" While in theory the idea of being able to click for pot is good and in practice it is happening , it 's a very temporary thing , I suspect .
I would n't do it .
It 's frightening .
I think that people should be clear about what they 're doing .
When you 're breaking the law , you should n't let yourself get caught .
The government can just trace where the clicks came from and round up enormous numbers of people .
It lends itself to a conspiracy prosecution .
People get away with breaking the law for a period of time , but it does catch up to you . "
Net Scum BESIDES PROBLEMS WITH the law , online buyers must also be wary of scams .
Seed buyers tend to protect themselves by constantly exchanging information , but those who actually order pot online are less likely to fess up to it .
" Most of my clients have been ripped off many times on the Internet before they came to me , " says Phdfort .
" There 's a lot of scum on the Internet . "
Indeed , if you do a web search for the words " buy marijuana online , " many of the resulting links will be to a site called the " Netherlands High Shoppe , " which had dozens of separate URLs .
The site even promises free samples .
But before you get in , you have to buy something called an " adult check ID " for $ 20 , which , in addition to providing access to the Netherlands High Shoppe , also lets you in to a variety of porn sites .
The ID wo n't , however , get you any closer to actual marijuana , because all the Netherlands High Shoppe offers are the phone numbers of U.S. companies selling legal herbal marijuana substitutes with names like " Wizard Smoke . "
And as with Arizona Medical , buyers on some sites are required to provide far more information than they 'd ever dream of giving to a guy skulking around the park with a pocket full of dime bags .
A few months ago , an email was circulating with the URLs of two websites , civildisobedient.net and antae.org , said to be working in concert , that promised to deliver free medical marijuana to patients in San Jose .
" This is one more step in our movement to launch a pacifist guerrilla medi- pot dispensary for the chronic suffering patients of San Jose , but which we will operate from a virtual location , " said the email 's attachment .
At first , it seemed thrilling .
But no local activists knew anything about it , no phone number was given , and there was no response to repeated requests for more information .
Users were instructed to send a signed , notarized copy of their photo identification , a signed " oath " with the name of their primary caregiver , and a " Police or Police Agent Waver ( sic ) form signed " ( what this means is unclear ) to CivilDisobedient.net , c /o Mahlon , Gen Del PO , Washington DC , USA 20090 .
It turns out that both domains are registered to the same person , one ' Mahlon Coats . '
People who register domain names are required to provide phone numbers , and of the numbers Coats used , one is for a Motel 6 in Oakland and the other is for an Internet company in Australia .
But most disturbing of all is the fact that Mahlon Coats writes like a schizophrenic .
" If our website seems slightly irreverent toward the so called ' drug war ' ( and so called ' drug warriors ' ) we apologize but we needed the dark humor for novel extents of parabolic range and breadth , " it says on www.antae.org.
" And the Internet novel approach is intended to hopefully bring a quicker end to any unnecessary suffering of patients today , now -- before even more of them join the already - deceased patients ( who now feel no more pain , but ) who were forced ( as a result of political positioning ) to endure their suffering without a safe source for this simple herbal remedy .
If our web sites also seem slightly fanatical at times , it is because the stratified contradictions in the so called ' Drug War ' become hilarious when exposed .
And this is also to heighten the novel experience . "
The bizarre ramblings continue on civildisobedient.net : " For those who believe that we who used an illegally smoked mantra as a unifying element , especially those who used it with us but then after our goals were achieved in halting the Vietnam War , should have stopped the smoke , I argue that our next goal needed to be to expose the government complicity in causing such a benign substance to be so feared and maligned -- and thereby better prepare the government against such a flawed policy ' Achilles heel , ' from future protester strengths against the government . "
This , needless to say , is probably not a person many would want to trust with their name , address and medical history .
" The Internet can't gloss over the fact that it 's not Walgreens on the other end of the line .
It 's still just a drug dealer with a home page , " Entwistle says .
But for some , especially the old and the ill , a drug dealer with a home page is easier to find than a drug dealer on the street .
As long as there are people who want pot badly enough to send cash blindly through the mail , there will be people all over the world more than happy to sell it to them .

Barack Obama will have to draw on all his considerable oratorical skills tonight to connect himself to those parts of the electorate that remain unconvinced by his message and unclear about what he represents .
" He will be addressing the single largest audience he will have at any time between now and the election , so it 's important to use the event to make clear where he stands on matters that are worrying voters , " said Ted Sorensen , John F Kennedy 's chief speechwriter .
" Obama is the first presidential candidate who reminds me of Kennedy 's eloquence and capacity to inspire .
They both , despite their own special backgrounds , convey to people that they understand and listen to every American citizen . "
To a large degree , the success of Obama 's presidential run so far has been built on his skills as a speechmaker .
It was his speech to the Democratic convention four years ago , before he had even entered the Senate , that propelled him into the national spotlight .
" He is blessed with a richly resonant voice that we love to hear ; he could read the telephone directory and it would sound good , " said Ted Widmer , editor of an acclaimed edition of American political speeches and a former Bill Clinton speechwriter .
" He is very good at pauses and inflection , and he cuts an impressive figure on stage - all of which adds up to making an Obama speech a special event . "
The Kennedy link is evident within Obama 's own team of speechwriters .
Adam Frankel , a graduate of the London School of Economics , spent six years working with Sorensen on his memoirs - immersing himself in the process in Kennedy 's oratory .
Frankel is 26 , as is Obama 's chief speechwriter , Jon Favreau , or Favs as he is known , who used to work for John Kerry .
A third important scribe recently joined the Obama campaign .
Sarah Hurwitz was Hillary Clinton 's main speechwriter during the primary season , a role she previously performed for General Wesley Clark in his 2004 bid .
Obama is clearly surrounded by youthful talent , though what is less clear is how much he depends on it .
He has told reporters that he personally began writing tonight 's address while on holiday this month in Hawaii .
But demonstrating his now well - proven ability to inspire a crowd will be only part of the challenge for Obama tonight .
Crucially , he must also tiptoe his way through the sensitive issue of race .
The question of how much reference he makes to his potential to make history as America 's first black president is all the more loaded because today is the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King 's famous " I have a dream " speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial .
" It 's a complicated calculation , " said Randall Kennedy , a professor at Harvard law school .
" On the one hand , he can't go wrong in invoking such an iconic speech that has become part of Americana .
On the other hand , the more Obama talks about race the blacker he becomes - and America still has a massive race problem . "
“ What could you accomplish if you stopped watching TV ?
What would you do with all the extra time ? ”
My wife asked me these questions two weeks ago .
After a short discussion , we decided to find out for ourselves .
We completely eliminated television from our lives last week .
It turned out to be an incredibly rewarding experience .
We now have a plan to drastically reduce our future viewing habits .
Here are 40 positive effects from our week without television .
Wrote 4 blog posts .

– I typically waste a good hour everyday watching CNN .
This week I grabbed my news off the web .
It took me significantly less time to scan CNN.com .
Enhanced focus on everything .

You ’ll be amazed …
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Children who regularly exercise and limit their time in front of the TV and computer are much less likely to be overweight than their peers , a new study suggests .
Pedestrians wait to walk across a street near Times Square in New York August 28 , 2007 .

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children devote no more than two hours per day to watching TV and playing video games .
Experts also encourage children to exercise regularly ; some groups , including the AAP , recommend that boys move enough to take 13,000 steps each day , while girls should strive for 11,000 .
Another common recommendation is for children and teenagers to get at least one hour of moderate exercise on most , if not all , days of the week .
For the new study , researchers at Iowa State University in Ames looked at whether there were weight differences between children who met or did not meet recommendations for “ screen time ” and exercise .
They found that among 709 7 - to 12 - year - olds , those who did not meet either recommendation were three to four times more likely to be overweight than their peers who met both guidelines .
The findings are published in the Journal of Pediatrics .
Since the study compared groups of children at one point in time , it does not prove that following exercise and screen - time recommendations keeps children at a healthy weight , according to lead researcher Dr. Kelly R. Laurson .
However , the findings do show that screen time and exercise are each independently associated with the odds of a child being overweight , explained Laurson , who is now with Illinois State University in Normal .
This gives support to experts ’ guidelines , the researcher told Reuters Health , and “ parents should encourage their children to comply with both . ”
Laurson and colleagues based their findings on 709 children from 10 schools in Iowa and Minnesota .
They surveyed the children about their TV watching and video game habits , and they had each child wear a pedometer , or step counter , for at least four days in order to gauge his or her typical physical activity level .
Boys who took at least 13,000 steps per day were considered to be in line with exercise recommendations , as were girls who logged 11,000 or more steps .
The researchers found that among boys who met the recommendations on exercise and screen time , 10 percent were overweight .
Among girls meeting both recommendations , 20 percent were overweight .
That compared with 35 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls who met neither recommendation .
“ Both physical activity and screen time are important factors in childhood overweight , ” Laurson said .
Unfortunately , the investigators found , only a minority of children in their study were meeting experts ’ recommendations .
About 44 percent were getting enough exercise , while just 31 percent were limiting their screen time to less than two hours per day .
For once it seems the Army is actually turning fiction into science .
After nearly a decade in the shadows — with billions spent on earlier versions long since abandoned — the Army is moving quickly to field a revolutionary new weapon to Joes a lot sooner than anyone had ever imagined .
It ’s a weapon that can take out a bad guy behind a wall , beyond a hill or below a trench , and do it more accurately and with less collateral damage than anything on the battlefield today , officials say .
It ’s called the XM25 Individual Air Burst Weapon , and by next month the service will have three prototypes of the precision - guided 25 mm rifle ready for testing .
“ We ’ve done a lot of testing with this , and what we ’re seeing is the estimated increase in effectiveness is six times what we’d be getting with a 5.56 mm carbine or a grenade launcher , ” said Rich Audette , Army Deputy Project Manager for Soldier weapons .
“ What we ’re talking about is a true ‘ leap ahead ’ in lethality , here .
This is a huge step , ” Audette added during a phone interview with Military ​.com from his office at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey .
Born of the much - maligned and highly - controversial Objective Individual Combat Weapon — a 1990s program that sought a “ leap ahead ” battle rifle that combined a counter - defilade weapon with a carbine — the XM25 only recently gained new momentum after the Army formalized a requirement and released a contract in June for a series of test weapons .
Current infantry weapons can shoot at or through an obstacle concealing enemy threats , but the Army has been trying for years to come up with a weapon for engaging targets behind barriers without resorting to mortars , rockets or grenades — all of which risk greater collateral damage .
After fits and starts using a 20 mm rifle housed in a bulky , overweight , complicated shell , technology finally caught up to shave the XM25 from 21 pounds to a little more than 12 pounds .
If the XM25 does what its developers hope , it will be able to fire an air - bursting round at a target from 16 meters away out to 600 meters with a highly accurate , 360 - degree explosive radius .
In Prime Minister Harper ’s recent apology to Canada ’s First Nations people over the residential schools issue , he stated that the purpose of the residential schools was “ to kill the Indian in the Indian ” .
Canada ’s media and politically correct have been quick to repeat the phrase — - probably without doing too much research into the issue .
Undoubtedly , mortal sins were committed in the residential school / colonization process .
But before all those associated with residential schools are lowered into the deepest circle of Hell with no hope of parole for their role in the colonization process , we should note that a reverse colonization process is underway right now .
Moreover , we should note that its effects on Canadians and on the entire country will be far more mortal in scale than anything seen in the residential schools .
Ironically , First Nations people who suffered may be better able to see what is happening than many other Canadians .
To enable the current colonization process to occur , a number of steps have been necessary .
Here are a few of the more important ones .
One was to immolate much of Canadian history .
According to Canadian historian Jack Granatstein ( author of “ Who Killed Canadian History ? ” ) ,
“ the core — “ the politics , diplomacy and warfare which led to the creation of British North America and the Canadian political system ” — has been largely excised from our schools and universities .
So , too , has the political , diplomatic , and military history of post - Confederation Canada .
“ The social historians …are , regrettably , the same historians who simultaneously removed the political leaders , diplomats , and generals .
“ And the bureaucrats who set the curricula for our schools have cheerfully gone along with this for their own social engineering purposes : the elimination of any controversy that might offend students and parents , and an emphasis on the sins of Canadians so they can create a mythical city on the hill .
“ In those provinces where Canadian history is still a compulsory course in high school , scant attention is paid to anything but social history .
And much of the teaching focuses on the maltreatment of aboriginals and immigrants , the abuse of women , and the evils of capitalism .
I agree all these issues must be studied , but I oppose the blatant indoctrination our schools practice .
Far from teaching patriotism , our schools now focus almost exclusively on historical ills . ”
( From “ HOW WE TEACH HISTORY MATTERS MOST ” )
In our view , a thorough presentation will give history the role of guiding parents in Canada ’s future .
Social engineers ( a host of our history writers , bureaucrats , and grievance promoters ) have separated Canada from its parents and its heritage and taken away the wise guides that our society needs .
In general , the socially - engineered version of Canadian history leaves Canadian adults and students with the impression that their ancestors were a group of rogues and that their descendants somehow have to compensate for the sins of their rogue ancestors .
The only way to do this is to indulge in life - long , self - loathing and self - abuse .
The first problem with this idea is that , in general , this view of Canadian history is wrong .
The second is that it leaves Canadians floundering in the present — cut off from their ancestors who have already travelled in realms unknown to the present .
It kills the Canadian in the Canadian .
A second necessary step has been to give Canada a new set of parents .
In effect , multiculturalism and diversity have been elevated to that role .
They are a major part of the new reality and they are Canada ’s new elders and guides .
There is a major problem with putting multiculturalism into that role .
Multiculturalism , by suggesting that Canada is a mere collection of people from everywhere , undermines the role of Canada ’s founding people : the First Nations , the French and the English .
It weakens Canada and makes it vulnerable .
It implies that Canada ’s older host population and their ancestors never inherited or developed any culture ( other than a negative one ) in the old Canada and do not deserve any special attention in the new Canada .
In effect , it works at erasing First Nations , European and Canadian history .
It also creates a false historical equality between host and newly - arrived .
As a result , the wishes of Canada ’s founders are entitled to no more consideration than those of the newly - arrived .
To multiculturalists , the host should not expect the new to adapt to the host ’s traditions .
In fact , the host should have to cater to all the demands of the new — - in particular their demand that they be allowed to bring to Canada as many of their own as they wish .
To some of the new , it is their right to come here and Canada has an obligation to take them .
Multicultural cheerleaders boast that Canada will soon have much more than the current 20 % visible minority population .
What they are really saying is that , if high immigration inflows continue , their diaspora will eventually outnumber the host population .
When they have reached that state , they will be able to do whatever they deem necessary to finish the process of killing the Canadian in the Canadian and establishing a diasporic reality .
The problem with having diversity as a foster parent is that it implies that Canada was culturally impoverished before the post - 1990 flood and that Canada has been enriched by the new arrivals .
This is like arguing that enriched bread is better for us , but , as we know about bread , if the original whole wheat grains had been left alone , the bread that was made from them would have been infinitely healthier than the enriched bread with all its additives .
Like multiculturalism , diversity teaches guilt , self - loathing and the necessity that the host Canadian seek absolution .
That is , it teaches the killing of the Canadian in the Canadian .
It is difficult to imagine parents any more un-Canadian and more devoted to abuse of their foster child than Multiculturalism and Diversity .
A third step has been to organize a large number of those born here and those newly - arrived to denounce much of what Canada has been founded on .
For example , current Supreme Court Judge and social engineer Rosalie Abella , who proudly says that she escaped the Holocaust in Europe , was asked in the mid-1980s to determine whether visible minorities suffered from discrimination in the workplace .
After her study , whose carelessness was thoroughly exposed by Dr. Martin Loney , she proclaimed that Canadians were guilty of discrimination .
In her view , Canadians ( particularly white males ) had to expiate by submitting themselves to her Employment Equity programme in which visible minorities would be rushed to the front of the employment queue .
Ironically , the Holocaust escaper has created a Holocaust in Canada in which the careers of probably tens of thousands of white males have been incinerated on a funeral pyre in order to receive absolution for the alleged sins of their parents .
Our CBC , which also sees itself as a social engineer , has no reservations about denouncing Canada ’s past .
The CBC should be a forum for national discussion of Ms. Abella ’s work as well as of other far - reaching immigration issues .
But it has been turned into a virtual propaganda arm for the immigration industry .
There are undoubtedly voices within the CBC which dissent with the coup that the current herd of independent thinkers staged a number of years ago .
But official CBC proclaims multiculturalism as one of its policies , and CBC hosts and reporters absurdly claim that their staff ( some of whom from Asia have trouble understanding English ) is “ diverse ” .
Every day , for example , CBC Radio in Vancouver gives air time to those who want to tell listeners that immigration is wonderful .
In a discussion related to the recent dismissal of the CBC Orchestra so that more “ diverse ” music could be played , CBC reporter Gillian Findlay sarcastically referred to the music often played on CBC as music written by “ old white guys ” from Europe .
If any Canadians were to use insults such as “ # ” , “ Chink ” , or Pakky ” , Ms. Findlay and CBC management would self - righteously crucify them .
But it seems they have no qualms about throwing abuse at Canadians in actions such as the dismissal of the CBC Orchestra , in words such as those used by Ms. Findlay or in the thousands of hours of free air time that they ( a publicly - funded institution ) have shamelessly given to Canada ’s immigration industry to undermine Canada .
As Multiculturalism and Diversity ’s promoter , the CBC is also a reviser of Canadian history .
One of the latest , outrageous versions of the new “ CBC truths ” in Canadian history has arisen over a film just released on the anniversary of the Air India bombing .
The film , with CBC blessing , alleges that white Canadians are responsible for the Air India mass murder which most Canadians still view as part of India ’s ongoing quasi-civil war between Sikhs and other Indians .
Canada ’s private media are slightly different .
Some in our private media have questioned Canada ’s new parents ( Multiculturalism and Diversity ) and the effects of their abuse of Canada .
But these reporters are few and their voices are , to this point , drowned out by a host of others who have no difficulty in denouncing Canada .
In fact , some newspapers have officially or unofficially designated “ immigration and diversity reporters ” on their staffs .
One of these Toronto reporters has at least once contemptuously referred to Canada ’s host population as “ whitebread ” .
Apparently , he has received no reproach from his self - flagellating editors .
Our criticism is not that the media do not cover the immigration issue .
On the contrary , they cover the issue but they seem to think that it is their duty to hang on every word that immigration advocates say .
As a result , they publish or broadcast little other than what Canada ’s immigration industry tells them to write .
As such , they — - like the CBC — - betray professional standards and cannot be taken seriously .
Denouncing and killing the Canadian in the Canadian ( that is , killing the heritage and interests of Canada and Canadians ) infected our social - engineering politicians many years ago .
A number of our federal politicians now brazenly and openly state that Canada ’s immigration programme should serve the interests of immigrants .
In fact , NDP MP Olivia Chow , who is a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Immigration and who seems to be writing NDP immigration policy , recently proclaimed this .
If her husband , NDP leader Jack Layton , is afraid to stand up to her , then other NDP MP ’s should take her aside and whisper a few words of Canadian history in her ear .
One point should be that Canada had an immigration policy from the 1920s until 1990 which put the interests of Canada ’s own workforce first .
This point is particularly relevant now in Ontario where the manufacturing sector has already suffered tens of thousands of job losses .
Ms. Chow did not grow up here , and seems to be unaware of Canada ’s past .
But if she knows so little , why are the NDP MP’s who were born here allowing her to articulate the immigration policy of the NDP , the party which professes to be nationalist , that is , the party which defends Canada ’s interests ?
Ms. Chow ’s Liberal MP counterparts on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Immigration seem to be equally devoted to abuse of Canada .
Like her , Jim Karygiannis and Andrew Telegdi were not born here .
Other immigrants have recovered from their move to Canada , but these two suffer from serious gaps in their awareness of Canada .
They also seem to think that Canada ’s immigration policy should serve non-Canadians .
In fact , whoever in the Liberal caucus allowed these two to become members of the Standing Committee on Immigration suffers from the same delusion that these two MP ’s and MP Chow do : that the stakeholders in the immigration issue are immigrants and our immigration industry .
Someone in the Liberal caucus has to take these two aside and tell them that the major stakeholder on the immigration issue is the Canadian public ( both host and newly - arrived ) .
If the Canadian public ’s interest is not being looked after by this committee and the rest of our government , who will look after it ?
Unfortunately , any observer of the immigration committee can see that the Bloc Quebecois and Conservative members of this committee have also not said much to defend Canadians .
Many other examples could be given .
But our point should be clear by now :
Our high immigration numbers and a series of federal policies have already done much to kill the Canadian in the Canadian .
That is , they have severely damaged the heritage and interests of Canada and Canadians .
If not stopped , the blow that some in our First Nations have experienced will seem small compared to the blow that is being compounded every day for all Canadians by high immigration .

For Jack Granatstein ’s views , see “ HOW WE TEACH HISTORY MATTERS MOST ”
Dan has spent about 28 years teaching , mostly at the high school level in Vancouver and Langley , but also at Fraser Valley College , SFU and UBC .
Dan was a rancher for over 20 years ( full and part - time ) during which time he developed a strong awareness to the environment .
He plans to return to that life soon .
he has personally witnessed the negative effects of over - population on Vancouver and surroundings .
When he discovered that senseless immigration was the main cause of these effects , he decided to research that topic and to do something to reduce high immigration levels .
The key word is “ reduce ” , not “ abolish ” .
The general idea is to make immigration serve Canada , rather than the other way around .
Marc Gallagher of www.LibertyMaven.com recently posted this trial news show .
It 's called “ Freedom Watch ” and is a 60 minute injection of raw liberty hosted by Judge Andrew Napolitano .
You can try watching the second hour - long trial show from this link .
Peter Schiff , Stephen Moore from the Wall Street Journal , Cody Willard , Ron Paul , Tracey Burns and Lew Rockwell from the Mises Institute and lewrockwell.com all took turns as the Judge moderated .
The hour of audio from the first show is available here .
Prior to the watching the show , I had only come across the Judge 's name once or twice before as by personal choice I 've been boycotting FOX since they blackballed Ron Paul from the New Hampshire presidential debate a year ago .
I 've decided to remove my boycott if FOX airs this show – although it will probably only apply to NFL games and Freedom Watch .
Topics ranged from the Obama Bailout and Ron Paul ’s complaint that no one had time to read this important bill , the Republican - Democrat duopoly , the Constitution and the rule of law , CEO bonuses , Peter Schiff took potshots at the dollar , the propping of the housing market .
The show was bustling as guests were constantly coming and going without the usual formatting and quite possibly the most entertaining moment in the impromptu show was when Schiff , well - endowed with the gift of gab , found himself forced into silence while switching a microphone back - and - forth between Napolitano and another FOX commentator .
My favorite quote was from Lew Rockwell :
“ Well the government understands what ’s good for the government .
They understand they are ripping us off .
Federal Treasuries are certificates of guaranteed expropriation , that ’s about all we can expect from the government – more expropriation .
One thing we can do besides fighting this ideologically I ’ll just say is buy gold .
As long as people will accept your dollars for gold , buy gold . ”
With the recent hubbub about the Re-elect Obama in 2012 Act – I mean the Great Depression
Act of 2009 – it would be a rare find indeed to have a show air where eco-politics and liberty is debated in a serious fashion .
The show will never go live unless there is some support for it , so if you like it please feel free to join the Facebook group “ Fans of Fox 's Freedom Watch That Want To See it on the Air ” or better yet send a quick email to FOX at yourcomments@foxnews.com
Who knows ?
Perhaps the rEVOLution can finally hit the mainstream media and Americans can start realizing that there is no easy “ bailout ” this time around .
When Obama's “ 100 Days ” honeymoon finally ends , it may result in an awakening for a few more converts for liberty , freedom , prosperity , and free markets .
That is , unless you leave in a dream world where Obama will make everything alright .
Was n't one of the campaign promises from that charlatan that the troops would start heading home from Iraq within a month of his inauguration ?
Well , it is February 24th and the inauguration was January 20th , so time 's up .
Fact is , those troops are not coming home anyways .
They are off to Chaostan .

A controversial new X - ray technology is being tested that could stop potential terrorists from blowing up a car bomb at one of the nation ’s airports , homeland security officials say .
The Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is running a test at a North Carolina ferry terminal of a 21 - foot - high arch - like machine that shoots low - intensity X - rays at cars as they pass through .
The photos show whether explosives or drugs might be in the car .
The technology , called backscatter X - ray , is in use at several airports to screen passengers .
Privacy advocates have denounced scanning people as invasive because the X - rays can see through clothes .
Melissa Ngo , a Washington , D.C. , lawyer who focuses on privacy issues , says using the technology for cars could pave the way for “ Big Brother ” government spying .
“ If this technology ends up being deployed widely , it seems to be another step toward a society where you need to accept surveillance in every part of your life , ” Ngo says .

Taking 1000 mg of a specific olive leaf extract ( EFLA®943 ) can lower cholesterol and lower blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension ( high blood pressure ) .
These findings came from a ' Twins ' trial , in which different treatments were given to identical twins .
By doing this , researchers could increase the power of their data by eliminating some of the uncertainties caused by genetic variations between individual people .
The research is published in the latest edition of Phytotherapy Research .
Hypertension is one of the most common and important disease risk factors imposed by the modern lifestyle .
Many people would therefore benefit from finding ways of reducing blood pressure .
Experiments in rats had previously indicated that olive leaf extract could be one way of achieving this goal .
To test this in humans , researchers from Switzerland and Germany conducted a pilot trial with 20 identical ( monozygotic ) twin pairs who had an increased blood pressure .
Individuals were either given placebo capsules or capsules containing doses of 500 mg or 1000 mg of olive leaf extract EFLA®943 .
Pairs of twins were assigned to different treatments .
After the subjects had taken the extract for eight weeks researchers measured blood pressures as well as collecting data about aspects of life - style .
" The study confirmed that olive leaf extract EFLA®943 has antihypertensive properties in humans , " says one of the co-authors , Cem Aydogan , General Manager , Frutarom Health .
" This works showed that taking a 1000 mg dose has substantial effects in people with borderline hypertension , " says Aydogan .

Book Description
The Curry - Howard isomorphism states an amazing correspondence between systems of formal logic as encountered in proof theory and computational calculi as found in type theory .
For instance ,
minimal propositional logic corresponds to simply typed lambda - calculus , first - order logic corresponds to dependent types , second - order logic corresponds to polymorphic types , sequent calculus is related to explicit substitution , etc .
The isomorphism has many aspects , even at the syntactic level :
formulas correspond to types , proofs correspond to terms , provability corresponds to inhabitation , proof normalization corresponds to term reduction , etc .
But there is more to the isomorphism than this .
For instance , it is an old idea--- due to Brouwer , Kolmogorov , and Heyting --- that a constructive proof of an implication is a procedure that transforms
proofs of the antecedent into proofs of the succedent ; the Curry - Howard isomorphism gives syntactic representations of such procedures .
The Curry - Howard isomorphism also provides theoretical foundations for many modern proof - assistant systems ( e.g. Coq ) .
This book give an introduction to parts of proof theory and related aspects of type theory relevant for the Curry - Howard isomorphism .
It can serve as an introduction to any or both of typed lambda - calculus and intuitionistic logic .
Key features

" It is clear that desa Fed policy interacted with desa Wall Street incompetence .
Senators !
Dellow felegates !
In response to this direct threat to incompetent Wall Street bankers , mesa propose , that the Senate give immediately emergency powers to the Treasury secretary "
Update :
( Adapted version of Jar Jar Bink 's call for emergency powers to Palpatine in Star Wars Episode 2
There are many troubling things with the proposed " comprehensive " bailout of incompetent Wall Street bankers .
Just how troubling it will be remains to be seen until the final version is announced .
I 'll certainly return to the subject once the announcement has been made .
version the Bush administration asks for ( which they may or may not be granted ) is that it will grant the Treasury department complete discretion to buy mortgage backed securities from anyone at any price they want without the reach of courts or really even Congress .
Except for the $ 700 billion quantity limit , there will be no checks or limits or accountability for the actions of the Treasury department .
Regardless of how much money they unnecessarily waste on Wall Street banks , whether out of incompetence or out of cronyism / corruption , there will be no possibilty for courts to intervene and no possibility of prosecuting anyone .
While there will be a provision saying the Treasury department should safeguard taxpayer 's interests , that provision is in practice meaningless as the Treasury department will have full discretion in interpreting what that provision means .
And of course , if they really had taxpayer 's interest in mind , they would n't have come up with this package in the first place .
The Democrats appears to be all for this power grab .
The only hope to stop this comes if they insist on putting into this bill their desired various other spending plans and the Republicans insist on stopping those plans .
Unfortunately , it appears more likely they in " bipartisan " spirit will agree to a compromise .
It now appears that the Democrats will in fact oppose giving the Treasury department unlimited powers , while also demanding limits on executive pay and various spending programs .
So maybe I was too pessimistic .
It remains to be seen however if they will really be willing to block it if Paulson insist on his version .
Design thinking is a human - centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer ’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people , the possibilities of technology , and the requirements for business success .
Thinking like a designer can transform the way organizations develop products , services , processes , and strategy .
This approach , which is known as design thinking , brings together what is desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically feasible and economically viable .
It also allows people who are n't trained as designers to use creative tools to address a vast range of challenges .
IDEO did not invent design thinking , but we have become known for practicing it and applying it to solving problems small and large .
It ’s fair to say that we were in the right place at the right time .
When we looked back over our shoulder , we discovered that there was a revolutionary movement behind us .
About this site
This design thinking site is just one small part of the IDEO network .
There ’s much more , including full online courses we 've developed on many topics related to design thinking and its applications .
We fundamentally believe in the power of design thinking as a methodology for creating positive impact in the world — and we bring that belief into our client engagements as well as into creating open resources such as this .
At IDEO , we ’re often asked to share what we know about design thinking .
We ’ve developed this website in response to that request .
Here , we introduce design thinking , how it came to be , how it is being used , and steps and tools for mastering it .
You ’ll find our particular take on design thinking , as well as the perspectives of others .
Everything on this site is free for you to use and share with proper attribution .
( From 2008 - 2018 , designthinking .ideo.com was the home of IDEO 's design thinking blog , written by our CEO , Tim Brown .
You can find that blog here . )
Design thinking in context
We live and work in a world of interlocking systems , where many of the problems we face are dynamic , multifaceted , and inherently human .
Think of some of the big questions being asked by businesses , government , educational and social organizations :
How will we navigate the disruptive forces of the day , including technology and globalism ?
How will we grow and improve in response to rapid change ?
How can we effectively support individuals while simultaneously changing big systems ?
For us , design thinking offers an approach for addressing these and other big questions .
There ’s no single definition for design thinking .
It ’s an idea , a strategy , a method , and a way of seeing the world .
It ’s grown beyond the confines of any individual person , organization or website .
And as it matures , its history deepens and its impact evolves .
For IDEO , design thinking is a way to solve problems through creativity .
Certainly , it is n’t a fail - safe approach ; nor is it the only approach .
But based on the impact we are seeing in our work , the relevance of design thinking has never been greater .
Design thinking today
Design thinking is maturing .
It ’s moving from a nascent practice to an established one , and with that comes interest and critique .
People are debating its definition , pedigree , and value .
As a leading and committed practitioner of design thinking , IDEO has a stake in this conversation — and a responsibility to contextualize its value in the present moment and , importantly , in the future .
We ’ve learned a lot over the years , and we ’d like to share our insights .
We ’ve seen design thinking transform lives and organizations , and on occasion we ’ve seen it fall short when approached superficially , or without a solid foundation of study .
Design thinking takes practice ; and as a community of designers , entrepreneurs , engineers , teachers , researchers , and more , we ’ve followed the journey to mastery , and developed maps that can guide others .
Designer 's mindset
At IDEO , we are a community of designers who naturally share a mindset due to our profession .
Our teams include people who 've trained in applied fields such as industrial design , environmental architecture , graphic design , and engineering ; as well as people from law , psychology , anthropology , and many other areas .
Together , we have rallied around design thinking as a way of explaining design 's applications and utility so that others can practice it , too .
Design thinking uses creative activities to foster collaboration and solve problems in human - centered ways .
We adopt a “ beginner ’s mind , ” with the intent to remain open and curious , to assume nothing , and to see ambiguity as an opportunity .
To think like a designer requires dreaming up wild ideas , taking time to tinker and test , and being willing to fail early and often .
The designer 's mindset embraces empathy , optimism , iteration , creativity , and ambiguity .
And most critically , design thinking keeps people at the center of every process .
A human - centered designer knows that as long as you stay focused on the people you 're designing for — and listen to them directly — you can arrive at optimal solutions that meet their needs .
The creators of Dream Pinball have aggressively pursued suspected pirates
A British woman who put a game on a file - sharing network has been ordered to pay damages to the game 's creator .
Topware Interactive has won more than £ 16,000 following legal action against Isabella Barwinska of London , who shared a copy of Dream Pinball 3D .
Three other suspected sharers of the game are awaiting damages hearings .
The test case could open the floodgates for litigation against thousands of other Britons suspected of sharing the game .
' A lot more '
In the case heard at London 's Patents County Court the game maker won damages of £ 6,086.56 plus costs of £ 10,000 .
" The damages and costs ordered by the Court are significant and should act as a deterrent , " said David Gore , a partner at Davenport Lyons who acted for Topware .
He added : " This shows that taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy . "
" This is the first of many , " said Mr Gore .
" It was always intended that there would be a lot more . "
Mr Gore said details of " thousands " of suspected file - sharers of the game who might now face legal action were known .
On file - sharing or peer - to - peer ( P2P ) networks the files being shared are held on members ' computers and those who want a particular game , music track or video get bits of it from everyone else who has it .
The music industry has taken a softer line against suspected pirates Topware Interactive started its campaign against pirates of Dream Pinball 3D in early 2007 after legal action forced 18 British net firms to pass on details of suspected pirates that it had identified .
Following this it sent out about 500 letters to Britons it had identified as making the game available via file - sharing networks such as eMule , eDonkey , Gnutella and many others .
In the letters the company asked for a payment of about £ 300 as a " settlement " figure that would head off further legal action .
Some of those accused of sharing the game chose to fight the legal action and it was in one of these contested cases that Topware Interactive won its claim for damages .
" This is a proper Intellectual Property ( IP ) court that has made this judgement , " said independent IP barrister David Harris .
" The previous ones were default judgements where defendants never turned up . "
The hearing in the IP court meant the case had been rigorously analysed and the law properly understood , said Mr Harris .
" It 's a much more interesting case in that respect , " he said .
But , he said , he was not sure if this case meant game makers were getting more aggressive about chasing and prosecuting pirates .
" I do not get any sense that there 's been any fundamental shift in the desire to litigate , " he said .
Becky Hogge , director of the Open Rights Group that campaigns on cyber liberties issues , said : " An open court process with a full report is certainly preferable to justice of the type being mooted by the government on P2P , where activity takes place behind closed doors through industry action . "
She added that awards for damages had to be realistic and not made to act as a " deterrent " .
" In relation to the orders for release of personal data , it is important that court processes do not become rubberstamps for industry action but retain judicial safeguards and independence , " said Ms Hogge .

“ In order to infiltrate those organizations you have to be established , ” Mr. Magaw said .
“ You can not just get on criminal boards and start dealing with high - level players .
He provided us with that ability to do that on Shadowcrew . ”
In the wake of Operation Firewall  and the expanding wave of credit card theft emanating from south Florida  the Secret Service began to focus on how the members of Shadowcrew and other carders were obtaining stolen credit card data .
They focused on a ring of people , most of whom had never met in person , who were working together in cyberspace and breaking into corporate computer systems nationwide .
Secret Service agents from the San Diego field office homed in on Maksym Yastremskiy or “ maksik , ” 25 , from the Ukrainian industrial city of Kharkiv .
Agents believed that he was among the largest distributors of stolen debit and credit card numbers in the world .
Mr. Yastremskiy , an indictment unveiled last week in San Diego alleges , earned over $ 11 million plying his trade in 2004 - 6 alone .
In July 2007 , the Secret Service learned that Mr. Yastremskiy was traveling on vacation to Turkey and the agency coordinated his arrest by the Turkish police outside a nightclub in Kemer .
The Turkish police provided a copy of the hard drive from Mr. Yastremskiy ’s laptop to Secret Service agents , yielding significant breakthroughs in the case .
In addition to millions of stolen credit and debit card numbers , investigators found a sniffer program similar to the one used that year to capture credit card transactions at 11 restaurants in the Dave & Buster ’s chain .
That attack , unlike earlier ones , was not conducted through war - driving .
Instead , Aleksandr Suvorov , 24 , an Estonian hacker , remotely accessed the chain ’s computers by exploiting errors in the way it set up passwords , investigators say .
Agents brought the sniffer program to the Computer Emergency Response Center at Carnegie Mellon University , where experts compared it with another program found during the investigation of the earlier breach at TJX and found they were two versions of the same underlying code .
Agents now knew conclusively that the same gang was responsible for both crimes .

I would like to take this opportunity to echo my co-blogger Steve ’s sentiment and thank Jenny McCarthy .
What ?
You say .
Has Gorski completely lost his mind ?
( Or maybe you used another word besides “ mind , ” a perhaps not so savory word . )
Not really .
I just agree with Steve that accomplishment should be recognized , and there ’s no doubt that in her year as the new celebrity spokesperson for the antivaccination movement , Jenny McCarthy has pulled off a major coup .
She ’s helped reignite a movement that was until her entrance ( and especially the entrance of her far more famous boyfriend Jim Carrey , who ’s said some things just as breathtakingly dumb as Jenny has ) more or less moribund , to the point where it ’s now become so effective that measles is coming back far faster than I had thought possible .
Between her tireless prosletyzing on Oprah Winfrey ’s show that vaccines caused her son ’s autism and that “ biomedical ” quackery can “ cure it ” ; her organizing of a march on Washington , D.C. this summer to push an explicitly antivaccine agenda disguised under the deceptive and disingenuous ( but brilliantly Orwellian ) slogan “ Green Our Vaccines “ ; her holding celebrity fundraisers ( complete with Britney Spears , Hugh Hefner , and Charlie Sheen , yet ! ) ; and her fronting WWE events to raise money for Generation Rescue , she ’s done it all in a little more than a year .
And she ’s not resting on her “ laurels ” ( such as they are ) , either .
This September , she will be publishing the followup to her previous book on “ healing autism ” ( with quackery ) , Mother Warriors : A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds .
No doubt she will again appear with Oprah to fawning acclaim to make the unfounded assertion that vaccines injured her son to make him autistic and that her favored forms of quackery have successfully “ healed him . ”
In light of these “ accomplishments , ” it ’s only right that we all give Jenny ( and Jim ) the “ thanks ” they deserves for their role in bringing the measles back to the U.S .
As further evidence that this is the case , last week , the CDC released an update to its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) that demonstrates very clearly that the antivaccination movement is having an effect .
Let ’s put it this way .
A mere eight years ago , measles was considered , in effect , eradicated from the U.S. , thanks to a vigorous vaccination program and a very high vaccine uptake .
All that remained were a handful , usually less than 100 , cases of measles from outside the U.S.
That ’s all changing now :
The number of measles cases in the U.S. is at its highest level since 1997 , and nearly half of those involve children whose parents rejected vaccination , government health officials reported Thursday .
The number of cases is still small , just 131 , but that ’s just for the first seven months of the year and doctors are troubled by the trend .
There were only 42 cases for all of last year .
“ We ’re seeing a lot more spread .
That is concerning to us , ” said Dr. Jane Seward , of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Pediatricians are frustrated , saying they are having to spend more time convincing parents the shot is safe .
“ This year , we certainly have had parents asking more questions , ” said Dr. Ari Brown , an Austin , Texas , physician who is a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics .
The CDC ’s review found that a number of cases involved home - schooled children not required to have the vaccines . [… ]
It is no longer endemic to the United States , but every year some Americans pick it up while traveling abroad and bring it home .
Measles epidemics have exploded in Israel , Switzerland and some other countries .
But high U.S. childhood vaccination rates have prevented major outbreaks here .
In a typical year , only one outbreak occurs in the United States , infecting perhaps 10 to 20 people .
So far this year through July 30 the country has seen seven outbreaks , including one in Illinois with 30 cases , said Seward , deputy director of the CDC ’s Division of Viral Diseases .
None of the 131 patients died , but 15 were hospitalized .
It ’s not all bad news .
The article and the MMWR report note that vaccination rates in the U.S. are still over 90 % , still high enough for herd immunity to hold sway , but that outbreak pockets , where lower vaccination rates are the rule and herd immunity has become shaky , are forming .
That ’s what ’s allowing these outbreaks to occur .
Here ’s the kicker :
Of this year ’s total , 122 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status .
Some were unvaccinated because the children were under age 1 , making them too young to get their first measles shot .
In 63 of those cases _ almost all of them 19 or younger _ the patient or their parents refused vaccination , the CDC reported .
In Washington state , an outbreak was traced to a religious conference , including 16 school - aged children who were not vaccinated because of parents ’ beliefs .
Eleven of those kids were home schooled and not subject to vaccination rules in public schools .
The Illinois outbreak _ triggered by a teenager who had traveled to Italy _ included 25 home - schooled children , according to the CDC report .
So , rejoice , Jenny McCarthy , J.B. Handley , David Kirby , Kim Stagliano , Dan Olmsted , Barbara Loe Fisher , and all the other antivaccine activists ( or their enablers , such as pediatrician to the stars ’ children , including Jenny McCarthy ’s son Evan , Dr. Jay Gordon , who oh - so - piously claim they are really and truly “ not antivaccine ” but then repeat antivaccination pseudoscience word - for - word ) spreading misinformation , pseudoscience , and fear about vaccines !
You ’re winning .
You ’re succeeding in casting doubt on the safety of vaccines to the point that it ’s causing real problems for our public health system :
The nation once routinely saw hundreds of thousands of measles cases each year , and hundreds of deaths .
But immunization campaigns were credited with dramatically reducing the numbers .
The last time health officials saw this many cases was 1997 , when 138 were reported .
Last year , there were only 42 U.S. cases .
The American Academy of Pediatrics has made educating parents about the safety of vaccines one of its top priorities this year , in part because busy doctors have grown frustrated at the amount of time they ’ve been spending answering parents ’ questions about things they read on the Internet or heard from TV talk shows .
In June , the CDC interviewed 33 physicians in Austin , suburban Seattle and Hollywood , Fla. , about childhood vaccinations .
Several complained about patient backlogs caused by parents stirred up by information of dubious scientific merit , according to the CDC report .
Yes , Jenny , this resurgence in measles is at least in part the result of your tireless labor in scaring parents with lies and pseudoscience to the point where they fear and refuse vaccination .
Now , thanks to you and your allies , your efforts are really beginning to bear fruit , and we ’re catching up with the U.K. , which has a decade - long head start .
Measles is coming back ,
Who knows ?
If you keep it up , you could reach the golden age of pre-MMR , as described in the CDC report :
In the United States , measles caused 450 reported deaths and 4,000 cases of encephalitis annually before measles vaccine became available in the mid-1960s ( 1 ) .
Through a successful measles vaccination program , the United States eliminated endemic measles transmission ( 1 ) .
Sustaining elimination requires maintaining high MMR vaccine coverage rates , particularly among preschool ( >90 % 1 - dose coverage ) and school - aged children ( >95 % 2 - dose coverage ) ( 7 ) .
High coverage levels provide herd immunity , decreasing everyone ’s risk for measles exposure and affording protection to persons who can not be vaccinated .
However , herd immunity does not provide 100 % protection , especially in communities with large numbers of unvaccinated persons .
For the foreseeable future , measles importations into the United States will continue to occur because measles is still common in Europe and other regions of the world .
Within the United States , the current national MMR vaccine coverage rate is adequate to prevent the sustained spread of measles .
However , importations of measles likely will continue to cause outbreaks in communities that have sizeable clusters of unvaccinated persons .
But , hey , if Jenny succeeds , it ’ll be far more than just isolated communities of unvaccinated persons being victimized by measles outbreaks .
If Jenny succeeds , the measles can really go to town in a manner not seen since the pre-vaccine era of early 1960s !
After all :
Measles is one of the first diseases to reappear when vaccination coverage rates fall .
Ongoing outbreaks are occurring in European countries where rates of vaccination coverage are lower than those in the United States , including Austria , Italy , and Switzerland ( 3,4 ) .
In June 2008 , the United Kingdom ’s Health Protection Agency declared that , because of a drop in vaccination coverage levels ( to 80 % –85 % among children aged 2 years ) , measles was again endemic in the United Kingdom ( 3,8 ) , 14 years after it had been eliminated .
Since April 2008 , two measles - related deaths have been reported in Europe , both in children ineligible to receive MMR vaccine because of congenital immunologic compromise ( 4,8 ) .
Such children depend on herd immunity for protection from the disease , as do children aged < 12 months , who normally are too young to receive the vaccine .
Otherwise healthy children with measles also are at risk for severe complications , including encephalitis and pneumonia , which can lead to permanent disability or death .
Let ’s not forget that that was just the measles .
Keep it up , Jenny and other antivaccine activists , and you can probably drive vaccination rates low enough that polio , Haemophilus influenza b , the mumps , pertussis and a whole lot of other vaccine - preventable diseases currently under good control make a similar comeback .
Heck , if you work hard enough , maybe they ’ll all become endemic again .
It ’ll be just like the old days !
That ’ll be the reward for your success , just as the manner in which Andrew Wakefield ’s incompetent , litigation - driven , and unethical “ research ” led measles , which had been similarly declared as conquered in the U.K. 14 years ago to become endemic again less than ten years after Wakefield first published his results .
( Indeed , we should thank Andrew Wakefiedl as well for his role in paving the way for Jenny McCarthy and friends here in the U.S. ! )
That ’s the world to which Jenny McCarthy and her merry band of antivaccine activists are leading us in name of a false dichotomy that parents face a choice between either vaccine - preventable infectious diseases or autism .
It ’s a false dichotomy because the best scientific evidence says that mercury in the thimerosal that used to be in vaccines does not cause autism , nor do vaccines themselves .
Indeed , Jenny ’s claims that her son Evan has “ recovered ” from his “ vaccine injury ” - induced autism have recently been revealed to be highly doubtful , and more recently even her fellow travelers can’t seem to keep their stories straight .
I ’m sure all the suffering , hospitalized , and dead children in the future will Jenny for her tireless efforts to “ save them from autism ” now at the cost of suffering and dying from vaccine - preventable diseases in the future .
Steve Novella put it well when he said :
The idiocy of antivaccinationists partly rests upon the modern luxury of never having had to live through the horrible epidemics of the past .
I wonder how much the current generation will have to suffer through before they get it .
And I will say it again – if Jenny McCarthy is going to put her own “ mommy instinct ” before the consensus of scientific opinion , and exploit her dubious celebrity to champion anti-science , then she is going to have to take responsibility for her actions .
The way I figure it , so far there are at least 68 measles cases on her tally sheet , and the number is growing .
I fear how large that number will grow before there is a backlash against the antivaccine activists who had a large role in causing this incipient public health disaster .
ADDENDUM :
By the way , my blog bud PalMD also thanks Jenny for the opportunity to fill in a gap in his medical education by providing him with the future opportunity to see cases of diseases that had previously been driven to being very rare , thanks to vaccines .
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . -
In a daring spacewalk , two space station astronauts cut into the insulation of their descent capsule Thursday and removed an explosive bolt that could have blown off their hands with firecracker force .
Spacewalkers Sergei Volkov and Oleg Kononenko managed , in the end , to safely disconnect the bolt from the Soyuz capsule that will be their ride home this fall .
They immediately slid it into a blast - proof container .
" It is in , " one of the Russian spacewalkers called out .
" Good .
Thank God , " someone replied in Russian .
Before the spacewalk , flight controllers in Moscow assured Volkov and Kononenko that the bolt would not explode and that the unprecedented job would help ensure their safe return to Earth in the Soyuz .
Nonetheless , Mission Control repeatedly urged them to be careful as they worked near the explosives .
" Take your time , " Mission Control warned .
" Be careful ; be careful , please . "
NASA said that its own engineers were convinced the spacemen would be in no danger , and that it would be all right for them to put the explosive bolt in the blast - proof canister and take it into the international space station for eventual return to Earth .
The past two Soyuz descents have been steep , off - course and bone - jarring , and the Russian Space Agency wants to avoid the problem when Volkov and Kononenko fly home in October .
The capsule currently docked at the space station ferried up the two Russians in April .
Kononenko used a serrated knife to cut away the thick shiny insulation surrounding the bolt — a tool normally shunned by spacewalkers because of the possibility of piercing their pressurized suits or gloves .
It was a messy job , with shreds of the multilayer insulation floating every which way .
Next , the astronauts installed devices to eliminate static electricity , struggling at times in the small , cramped area .
Finally , four hours into the spacewalk , Volkov pulled out a socket wrench and removed the 3 - inch pyrotechnic bolt , one of 10 used to separate two parts of the module during re-entry .
During Soyuz descents this past April and in October 2007 , these two sections did not separate properly , leading to so - called ballistic entries that subjected the crews to far higher gravity forces than normal .
Russian engineers suspect some of the explosive bolts did not fire .
By disabling the bolts in this suspect location , there should be no mechanical hang - up during the October descent , officials said .
The lone American on board , Gregory Chamitoff , was inside the Soyuz for the entire six - hour spacewalk in case an emergency required the two Russians to join him in the capsule .
Chamitoff took books , music and a laptop computer with him to while away the time , and could hear everything that was going on .
Each pyrotechnic bolt has the force of a large M - 80 firecracker , NASA officials said .
A high - ranking flight director at Russian Mission Control outside Moscow told the crew Wednesday that the bolt could withstand shocks of up to 100 times the force of gravity and would not fire , even if they hit it with a big hammer .
" You should not be concerned at all , " he said .
The blast - proof container is made of stainless steel .
It will remain sealed , with the bolt inside , until it is returned to Earth aboard the Soyuz for analysis .
" We dream of a lot of wild things to do , and after much analysis , sometimes we do them and sometimes we don't , " Mike Suffredini , NASA 's space station program manager , said earlier this week .
" We have quite a bit of confidence in this particular case that we 're perfectly safe , " Suffredini told reporters .
NASA has a keen interest in the Russian - built Soyuz capsules because they sometimes transport Americans to and from the space station , and also serve as lifeboats .
Once the space shuttles are retired in 2010 , the Soyuz will be the sole means of human space transportation until 2015 , when America 's new rocketship starts carrying crews .
Before floating back inside , Volkov and Kononenko attached a patch over the cut insulation on the Soyuz .
As they wrapped up their work , Mission Control congratulated the pair and noted that Volkov was now " a full - blown crew commander " with his own grenade .
The two Russians will take another spacewalk Tuesday to perform much more routine space station work .

Not Vulnerable :
The world economy has seen globalization collapse once already .
The gold standard eraâ€ ” with its free capital mobility and open tradeâ € ” came to an abrupt end in 1914 and could not be resuscitated after World War I .
Are we about to witness a similar global economic breakdown ?
The question is not fanciful .
Although economic globalization has enabled unprecedented levels of prosperity in advanced countries and has been a boon to hundreds of millions of poor workers in China and elsewhere in Asia , it rests on shaky pillars .
Unlike national markets , which tend to be supported by domestic regulatory and political institutions , global markets are only " weakly embedded . "
There is no global anti-trust authority , no global lender of last resort , no global regulator , no global safety nets , and , of course , no global democracy .
In other words , global markets suffer from weak governance , and therefore from weak popular legitimacy .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Recent events have heightened the urgency with which these issues are discussed .
The presidential electoral campaign in the United States has highlighted the frailty of the support for open trade in the world 's most powerful nation .
The subprime mortgage crisis has shown how lack of international coordination and regulation can exacerbate the inherent fragility of financial markets .
The rise in food prices has exposed the downside of economic interdependence without global transfer and compensation schemes .
Meanwhile , rising oil prices have increased transport costs , leading analysts to wonder whether the outsourcing era is coming to an end .
And there is always the looming disaster of climate change , which may well be the most serious threat the world has ever faced .
So if globalization is in danger , who are its real enemies ?
There was a time when global elites could comfort themselves with the thought that opposition to the world trading regime consisted of violent anarchists , self - serving protectionists , trade unionists , and ignorant , if idealistic youth .
Meanwhile , they regarded themselves as the true progressives , because they understood that safeguarding and advancing globalization was the best remedy against poverty and insecurity .
But that self - assured attitude has all but disappeared , replaced by doubts , questions , and skepticism .
Gone also are the violent street protests and mass movements against globalization .
What makes news nowadays is the growing list of mainstream economists who are questioning globalization 's supposedly unmitigated virtues .
So we have Paul Samuelson , the author of the postwar era's landmark economics textbook , reminding his fellow economists that China 's gains in globalization may well come at the expense of the United States ; Paul Krugman , today 's foremost international trade theorist , arguing that trade with low - income countries is no longer too small to have an effect on inequality ; Alan Blinder , a former U.S. Federal Reserve vice chairman , worrying that international outsourcing will cause unprecedented dislocations for the US labor force ; Martin Wolf , the Financial Times columnist and one of the most articulate advocates of globalization , writing of his disappointment with how financial globalization has turned out ; and Larry Summers , the U.S. Treasury chief and the Clinton administration 's " Mr. Globalization , " musing about the dangers of a race to the bottom in national regulations and the need for international labor standards .
While these worries hardly amount to the full frontal attack mounted by the likes of Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel Prizeâ € “ winning economist , they still constitute a remarkable turnaround in the intellectual climate .
Moreover , even those who have not lost heart often disagree vehemently about the direction in which they would like to see globalization go .
For example , Jagdish Bhagwati , the distinguished free trader , and Fred Bergsten , the director of the pro-globalization Peterson Institute for International Economics , have both been on the frontlines arguing that critics vastly exaggerate globalization 's ills and under - appreciate its benefits .
But their debates on the merits of regional trade agreementsâ€ ” Bergsten for , Bhagwati againstâ€ ” are as heated as each one 's disagreements with the authors mentioned above .
None of these intellectuals is against globalization , of course .
What they want is not to turn back globalization , but to create new institutions and compensation mechanismsâ€ ” at home or internationallyâ € ” that will render globalization more effective , fairer , and more sustainable .
Their policy proposals are often vague ( when specified at all ) , and command little consensus .
But confrontation over globalization has clearly moved well beyond the streets to the columns of the financial press and the rostrums of mainstream think tanks .
That is an important point for globalization 's cheerleaders to understand , as they often behave as if the " other side " still consists of protectionists and anarchists .
Today , the question is no longer , " Are you for or against globalization ? "
The question is , " What should the rules of globalization be ? "
The cheerleaders ' true sparring partners today are not rock - throwing youths but their fellow intellectuals .
The first three decades after 1945 were governed by the Bretton Woods consensusâ€ ” a shallow multilateralism that permitted policymakers to focus on domestic social and employment needs while enabling global trade to recover and flourish .
This regime was superseded in the 1980s and 1990s by an agenda of deeper liberalization and economic integration .
That model , we have learned , is unsustainable .
If globalization is to survive , it will need a new intellectual consensus to underpin it .
The world economy desperately awaits its new Keynes .

Last time out , Mark Wahlberg was fighting a mighty wind ( The Happening ) .
He did n’t look too comfortable …
There was much brow - furrowing and air - gazing and short - sleeve shirt wearing …
For Max Payne , Wahlberg is ditching the elemental for the supernatural and , in a hangar - sized suite at London ’s Mandarin Oriental , he ’s comically at ease : slumped back on a sofa in trainers and worryingly tracksuit - like trousers .
He ’s short and sweet but built like a boxer : all carved bulk and knotted sinew , with a fighter ’s air of serene self - belief .
After a 45 - day stint in jail back in the ’ 80s , Wahlberg toughed himself back into contention via hip hop , workout video production and an autobiography ( at 21 ) “ dedicated to my dick ” .
“ I was out of control , ” he says .
“ I was lucky to get through it , but it made me stronger and , I hope , wiser .
I had a lot of demons to fight .
Maybe that ’s why this character is my favourite role so far ... ”
Before Grand Theft Auto , before Manhunt , Max Payne sealed the idea that videogames could be more than jaunty interactive cartoons .
They were for grown - ups , too .
It ’s doomy , cynical , brutal , brooding : a classical revenger ’s tragedy played out in an uncaring gothic metropolis .
Max – who narrates , neo - noir style – is a cop haunted by the murder of his wife and baby daughter .
Sent out to undercover pasture , grazing on cold cases , he sniffs a conspiracy behind a designer drug called Valkyr .
Could its makers have fuelled – or even instructed – the killers of his family ?
Max goes rogue , teams up with lady - assassin Mona Sax ( Mila Kunis , in the film ) , infiltrates the Mob , gets framed for a colleague ’s murder , takes counsel from a grizzled mentor ( Beau Bridges ) , clashes with an internal affairs attack - dog ( Chris ‘ Ludacris ’ Bridges ) and , eventually , swoops down on the ice - maiden business woman ( Kate Burton ) he believes is the root of the rot .
He ’s hell bent and – judging by the twisted nightmare - visions of winged gargoyle beasties – possibly hell bound ...
“ The hallucinations are a side - effect of this drug that ’s been leaked onto the streets , ” says Wahlberg .
“ A lot of the conspiracy comes from that :
Max finds out that it ’s a drug tested by the military to create super - soldiers , but someone has flooded the streets with it .
It makes crack look like chocolate .
He has to take it to keep up with the fight .
But yeah , there ’s a definite theme of Max fighting the devils inside .
There ’s a lot of action in this movie , but there ’s also plenty of emotion and psychology .
It goes pretty deep . ”
Videogame movies are blessed / cursed with a pre-built but purist fanbase .
So far , the blog bitching has targeted Max Payne ’s director , Irishman John Moore , who made 2006 ’s limp redux of The Omen .
But from what Total Film has seen , it ’s the action - angst cocktail of Moore ’s 2001 Bosnia war - thriller Behind Enemy Lines that makes him a tight fit for Payne .
If he can mesh his lust for Tony Scott - style pyrotechnics with the game ’s Matrix - apeing bullet - time balletics and get Wahlberg playing to his strengths – taking Payne deeper than just feral vigilante – Moore just might have the first videogame - based commercial - critical hit on his hands .
In this Photoshop tutorial I 'll show you how to achieve the effect of using a Graduated Neutral Density filter to make a sky more dramatic using one simple Gradient layer and the Soft Light layer blend mode .
Introduction
It is important for me to point out before we get started that Photoshop is no substitute for making proper adjustments and using all the tools you have available while shooting in the field .
Although we can replicate many filters you may put on your lens post - capture , this particular technique is second best to using an actual Gradated Neutral Density ( ND ) filter at the time of capture .
Often times using the Grad ND filter in the field prevents blown out highlights that are simply not recoverable after the fact because they were never captured to begin with .
Now let me put my soap box away so we can get to the tutorial .
Step 1
Here is a shot Mrs. HERO took while driving through Swan Valley , Idaho last year .
I ’ve made no prior adjustments to this image so as not to detract from the effect .
Traditionally ( because this was shot as a RAW file ) I would make most of my adjustments using the Photoshop Camera RAW interface prior to bringing the photo into Photoshop , but for the sake of instruction , here is the unadjusted image .
Step 2
Lets add a new layer by clicking the Create New Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers palette .
( * note : If you ’re Layers palette is n’t visible , open it by choosing Window > Layers from the main menu . )
Step 3
Although this file will only be 2 layers , it ’s a good practice to name each layer correctly .
Double click on the new layer ( which is by default called Layer 1 ) and change it ’s name to something more appropriate like Graduated ND Filter .
Step 4
Reset the foreground and background colors to their default black and white setting by pressing the D key .
( If your Tools palette is n’t visible , open it by choosing Window > Tools from the main menu . )
Switch to the Gradient tool by pressing the G key and make sure that the gradient is set to Foreground to Transparent in the Gradient Options bar which has now appeared at the top of Photoshop .
Also check to make sure that the Linear Gradient icon is selected .
( If you have no idea what I just said , see the diagram below )
Step 5
With the Gradient tool now selected click and drag in a straight line from the top of the photo to the bottom .
( * note : Holding down the Shift key while dragging will keep the gradient in a perfectly straight line . )
Step 6
Lets redirect our attention back to the Layers palette and change the layer Blend Mode from Normal to Soft Light .
The Soft Light blend mode darkens or lightens the colors depending on the blend color .
The effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the image .
If the blend color ( light source ) is lighter than 50 % gray , the image is lightened , as if it were dodged .
If the blend color is darker than 50 % gray , the image is darkened , as if it were burned in .
Painting with pure black or white produces a distinctly darker or lighter area but does not result in pure black or white .
Step 7
At times this effect is a bit too heavy .
If that ’s the case , simply lower the layer ’s Opacity ( found right next to where we just changed the Blend Mode in the layers palette ) .
For my image a setting of 80 % Opacity seemed right .
Step 8
Here is the split screen before and after .
Notice how much more dramatic the sky is from the original and how much more vivid the blue has become .
Step 9
And the final result .
( * note : because this exercise used only one simple layer , there is no file download needed for this tutorial . )

Many Trump supporters do not believe that he can or will lose , and say he would be justified in questioning whether Democrats manipulated the outcome .
Jess said she was sorry for getting her father into trouble ( pic : MEN ) A man who was arrested and cautioned for slapping his 13 - year - old daughter across the face fears he will no longer be able to work with children .
Jim McCullough , of Manchester , hit Jess after she banged a neighbour 's window at midnight , and she called the police .
He has now quit the football coaching and community work he has done for over 15 years , as the caution could stop him working with vulnerable children .
Mr McCullough said he had never slapped Jess before .
She has apologised .
The father - of - four said he felt striking Jess was the only way to get her to understand what she had done .
The single parent , from Wythenshawe , said : " I wish I had asked for my day in court rather than accepted a police caution .
" That way I could have explained that I was trying to do what was right for my daughter .
I did deserve the slapping because of the things I 'd been doing
Jess McCullough
" Jess is n't bad , but some of the 13 - year - olds who live here do use drugs and drink and I do n't want that path for her . "
Mr McCullough said he had had no trouble with his other three children Christopher , 22 , Nicola , 21 , and Joanna , 19 .
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said : " When an offence is admitted the offender is always liable to receive a caution .
" Had the offence not been admitted , officers would have pursued the matter with the CPS .
' Wrong message ' " An allegation of domestic violence was made and GMP officers always take these allegations very seriously . "
Mr McCullough previously had a clean criminal record and recently qualified as a security guard , but said his work prospects had been ruined .
Jess , a year nine pupil at Parklands High School in Wythenshawe , said she was sorry for what had happened .
She said : " I did deserve the slapping because of the things I 'd been doing .
" I was expecting my dad to come home from the police station and for everything to be the same as before . "
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NSPCC ) policy manager Lucy Thorpe said : " All parents can sometimes be pushed to the limit by teenagers who are looking to see how far they can go but smacking wo n't solve the problem .
" It simply tells your child that violence is acceptable and gives the message that it 's all right for them to hit other people . "

What Invisible Things Are in the Surfaces You Touch and Air You Breathe ?
FROM THE AUGUST 2008 ISSUE
What Invisible Things Are in the Surfaces You Touch and Air You Breathe ?
A DISCOVER editor delves into the unseen forces that affect our lives .
By Stephen Cass|Friday , August 29 , 2008 RELATED TAGS : EARTH SCIENCE , INFECTIOUS DISEASES , COMPUTERS , POLLUTION6Jake Price
Each morning I wake and open my eyes to a new day filled with things I ca n’t see .
I ’ve even grown to appreciate how much the unseen makes its presence felt throughout our daily lives .
It has been this way since the dawn of time , but modern science has opened the doors to understanding the unseen worlds that crowd into our own and even allows us to manipulate some of them for our own ends .
An endless silent babble of radio waves , massed armies of insects , long - gone planet - girdling ice sheets , endemic microbes , rivers of wind , and more all leave their stamp on the shape of my life in the course of 24 hours .
Determined , I set off to unravel the mystery of my invisible day .
The Demons Within 8 a.m. I could pretend that I shoot out of bed bright - eyed and bushy - tailed , ready for another day at DISCOVER .
But the truth is much blearier , an important part of which is the eradication of the first invisible presence of the day : morning breath .
My mouth feels less than fresh as I yawn my way to the bathroom .
Morning breath comes mostly from bacteria that live in the mouth .
More than 500 types of oral bacteria have been identified in people so far , and “ we keep on identifying more , ” says Patricia Lenton , an oral malodor researcher at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry and a “ calibrated breath odor judge . ”
While we are sleeping , the flow of saliva in our mouths decreases , leaving the bacteria alone “ back there , just producing things , lots of sulfur gases , ” Lenton says .
These orally produced sulfur gases — with names like hydrogen sulfide , methylmercaptan , and dimethyl sulfide — plus some other miscellaneous by - products of bacterial metabolism , account for 90 percent of bad breath that ca n’t be traced to an outside cause .
Meanwhile , foods such as garlic and onions release sulfur compounds as they are digested in our intestines .
Some of these compounds are absorbed into the bloodstream and pass into the air in our lungs .
As we exhale , we breathe them out .
It ’s also through the lungs that changes in blood chemistry caused by disease can affect the odor of our breath .
“ Diabetes is a good example .
When people have uncontrolled diabetes , they can have a really sweet , fruity smell in their breath , ” Lenton says .
Researchers are even working to develop tests for breast cancer and organ transplant rejection based on the bouquet of a patient ’s breath .
Most odor - producing bacteria live on the tongue , not the teeth , so I give my tongue a few good scrubs with my toothbrush before continuing my morning routine .
Scrutinizing the Jet Stream 9 a.m.
I ’m ready to leave , checking out the window for the effects of that all - time - classic invisible entity , the wind .
I ’m not looking for the effects of just any old gust of air .
The specific wind that is going to determine whether I ’ll have to put on a jacket is one that weather watchers did n’t even know existed a century ago .
It ’s called the polar jet stream , and as it writhes eastward across the North American continent , it can bring storms in its wake or herald an unseasonable change in temperature — north of the jet stream lies cold , Arctic air , while to its south are warmer conditions .
In summer months the polar jet stream flows mostly across Canada .
During the winter it dips as far south as the U.S. Gulf states .
Jet streams occur at very high altitudes — 30,000 to 40,000 feet — which is why they were not definitively identified until World War II , when pilots noticed intense headwinds during long - distance military missions .
The heart of a jet stream is a relatively narrow band of strong wind a few hundred miles wide that can reach speeds of more than 200 miles per hour .
Jet streams draw their energy from the rotation of the earth and the difference in temperature between the equator and higher latitudes .
Without jet streams , “ it would be a pretty boring place , ” weatherwise , says Klaus Weickmann , a meteorologist at the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) in Boulder , Colorado .
Small changes in the jet stream as it passes overhead can create stormy weather at low altitudes .
For example , “ if you have a low - pressure area aloft , then you will tend to produce low pressure at the surface ahead of it , ” Weickmann explains .
“ That particular [ atmospheric ] structure is very efficient at extracting available potential energy and converting it into kinetic energy . ”
This kinetic energy manifests itself in the kind of high winds and rains that can turn a day into a washout .
From what I can see out my window though , the weather appears to be pretty calm , so I decide to leave my jacket at home and gather my things .
I open my building ’s front door and look up at the slight hill I have to climb to my subway stop .
Glacial Moment
It ’s not much of a slope , but this hill , and others like it , are evidence of the ancient forces that ultimately brought me and more than 8 million other people to live in New York City .
At the peak of the last ice age , some 20,000 years ago , right outside my front door was a frozen glacier wall that rose as high as 300 feet , the southern edge of a vast ice sheet that covered Canada and the northern part of the United States .
“ Glaciers act as a plow , pushing stuff ahead , ” says Sidney Horenstein , a geologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City .
The edge of America ’s ice sheet — marked by a line of rubble called the terminal moraine — ran along Long Island .
When the earth warmed and the glacier receded , the rubble was left behind as a series of low hills .
Look at a map of New York City and in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens ( located on the west end of Long Island ) you can see that chilly history encoded in the names of today ’s neighborhoods : Cobble Hill , Brooklyn Heights , Park Slope , Forest Hills .
Southeast of where I live , water from the melting edge of the glacier flowed over the landscape , depositing layers of sand and silt and leaving behind areas with names such as Flatbush and Flatlands .
“ The community names have meaning , ” Horenstein says .
But the biggest impact on New York ’s destiny came from the glaciers ’ ability to erode , not build , landforms .
A glacier “ acts as sandpaper because it has rocks embedded in its base … so as the glacier moves , it ’s deepening valleys and smoothing off the tops of hills , ” Horenstein says .
As the glacier moved south toward the future location of New York City , it widened and deepened the Hudson River valley .
“ The Hudson is the southernmost fjord in North America , ” Horenstein says .
When the first Europeans explored the river in 1609 , they found in it an ideal trade route that penetrated into the continent .
The glacier ’s deepening of the Hudson also made New York Harbor a snap for trans -Atlantic shipping to navigate .
Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman , the Mythbusters , were at Comic Con last week .
They did a panel discussion of the show ( moderated by Bill Prady , one of the producers of The Big Bang Theory ) , and were great ( as usual ) .
They started off their panel with a bang -- a fantastic trailer for their upcoming episode on the Moon Hoax !
Coooooooollllll .
Love the music .
The show airs August 27 .
I got to hang out with Adam and some of the Discovery Channel crew at Comic Con , and they were as nice , funny , warm , and charming as you 'd imagine .
And I 'm not just sucking up ; they really were a fun group .
[ More pix are here in my Flickr Comic Con set .
ARealGirl has many pix too !]
Adam made sure my friend A and I got front row seats for their panel , which was totally cool .
And if that were n't enough ... during the panel , Adam and Jamie were asked what myths they 've wanted to investigate but have n't had the time too .
Adam , bless his heart , did n't even hesitate : he said it was trying to see stars in the daytime , and then said ( on stage and everything ) that it came from " his good friend , Phil Plait , who is sitting right over here . "
Yes , I totally got a shout - out from Adam freakin ' Savage .
Comic
Con was like that .
Awesome from start to finish .
And I have at least one more story to tell ... but it 's best for a Friday .
Stay tuned . :-)
Much of the global warming debate is perhaps best described as a constant outbidding by frantic campaigners , producing a barrage of ever - more scary scenarios in an attempt to get the public to accept their civilisation - changing proposals .
Unfortunately , the general public – while concerned about the environment – is distinctly unwilling to support questionable solutions with costs running into tens of trillions of pounds .
Predictably , this makes the campaigners reach for even more outlandish scares .
These alarmist predictions are becoming quite bizarre , and could be dismissed as sociological oddities , if it were n't for the fact that they get such big play in the media .
Oliver Tickell , for instance , writes that a global warming causing a 4C temperature increase by the end of the century would be a " catastrophe " and the beginning of the " extinction " of the human race .
This is simply silly .
His evidence ?
That 4C would mean that all the ice on the planet would melt , bringing the long - term sea level rise to 70 - 80 m , flooding everything we hold dear , seeing billions of people die .
Clearly , Tickell has maxed out the campaigners ' scare potential ( because there is no more ice to melt , this is the scariest he could ever conjure ) .
But he is wrong .
Let us just remember that the UN climate panel , the IPCC , expects a temperature rise by the end of the century between 1.8 and 6.0C .
Within this range , the IPCC predicts that , by the end of the century , sea levels will rise 18 - 59 centimetres – Tickell is simply exaggerating by a factor of up to 400 .
Tickell will undoubtedly claim that he was talking about what could happen many , many millennia from now .
But this is disingenuous .
First , the 4C temperature rise is predicted on a century scale – this is what we talk about and can plan for .
Second , although sea - level rise will continue for many centuries to come , the models unanimously show that Greenland 's ice shelf will be reduced , but Antarctic ice will increase even more ( because of increased precipitation in Antarctica ) for the next three centuries .
What will happen beyond that clearly depends much more on emissions in future centuries .
Given that CO2 stays in the atmosphere about a century , what happens with the temperature , say , six centuries from now mainly depends on emissions five centuries from now ( where it seems unlikely non-carbon emitting technology such as solar panels will not have become economically competitive ) .
Third , Tickell tells us how the 80 m sea - level rise would wipe out all the world 's coastal infrastructure and much of the world 's farmland – " undoubtedly " causing billions to die .
But to cause billions to die , it would require the surge to occur within a single human lifespan .
This sort of scare tactic is insidiously wrong and misleading , mimicking a firebrand preacher who claims the earth is coming to an end and we need to repent .
While it is probably true that the sun will burn up the earth in 4 - 5 bn years ' time , it does give a slightly different perspective on the need for immediate repenting .
Tickell 's claim that 4C will be the beginning of our extinction is again many times beyond wrong and misleading , and , of course , made with no data to back it up .
Let us just take a look at the realistic impact of such a 4C temperature rise .
For the Copenhagen Consensus , one of the lead economists of the IPCC , Professor Gary Yohe , did a survey of all the problems and all the benefits accruing from a temperature rise over this century of about approximately 4C .
And yes , there will , of course , also be benefits : as temperatures rise , more people will die from heat , but fewer from cold ; agricultural yields will decline in the tropics , but increase in the temperate zones , etc .
The model evaluates the impacts on agriculture , forestry , energy , water , unmanaged ecosystems , coastal zones , heat and cold deaths and disease .
The bottom line is that benefits from global warming right now outweigh the costs ( the benefit is about 0.25 % of global GDP ) .
Global warming will continue to be a net benefit until about 2070 , when the damages will begin to outweigh the benefits , reaching a total damage cost equivalent to about 3.5 % of GDP by 2300 .
This is simply not the end of humanity .
If anything , global warming is a net benefit now ; and even in three centuries , it will not be a challenge to our civilisation .
Further , the IPCC expects the average person on earth to be 1,700 % richer by the end of this century .
Tickell 's hellfire and damnation sermon also misinforms us of the solutions to global warming : panicking is rarely the right state of mind for finding smart solutions .
In essence , Tickell says that because the outlook is so frightening , we need to cut much , much more than the Kyoto protocol called for .
Now , all peer - reviewed , published economic models demonstrate that such an effort is a colossal waste of money – one of the leading models shows that , for every pound spent , Tickell 's solution would do about 13 p - worth of good .
Tickell finds that current climate efforts like Kyoto have been " miserable failures " , which is true , but makes it seem rather odd that he thinks much - more - of - the - same will suddenly be great policy .
He claims that the reason these policies are not realised is because our governments are " craven to special interests " .
While this is convenient to believe , it is , of course , incorrect ; the real reason is that no one in the electorate wants to pay £ 2 , £ 3 or even £ 4 for a litre of petrol .
If we are to find a workable and economically smart solution , we would do well to look at the best climate solution from the top economists from the Copenhagen Consensus .
They found that , unlike even moderate CO2 cuts , which cost more than they do good , we should focus on investing in finding cheaper low - carbon energy .
This requires us to invest massively in energy research and development ( R&D ) .
Right now , we do n't – because the climate panic makes us focus exclusively on cutting CO2 .
R&D has been dropping worldwide since the early 1980s .
If we increased this investment ten - fold , it would still be ten times cheaper than Kyoto , and probably hundreds to thousands of times cheaper than Tickell 's proposal .
The literature indicates that for every pound invested , we would do £ 11 - worth of good .
The reason : because when we all talk about cutting CO2 , we might get some well - meaning westerners to put up a few inefficient solar panels on their roof - tops .
While it costs a lot , it will do little and have no impact on Chinese and Indian emissions .
But if we focus on investing in making cheaper solar panels , they will become competitive sooner , making everyone , including the Chinese and Indians , switch .
Such a proposal is efficient , politically feasible and will actually fix climate change in the medium term .
Being panicked by incorrect data and suggesting outlandish policies might create a splash , but it will stall our prospects of achieving real change .
Let 's not be silly – let 's choose the best solution .
The web was recently buzzing with the discovery that cattle ( and other herd animals , such as red and roe deer ) tend to situate themselves on a North - South axis , as if involuntarily directed by the earth ’s magnetic field lines to the poles .
It all came about when German scientists were using Google Earth to analyze herding patterns and behavior .
Thousands of years of human ignorance , gone in a single Google moment .

But it ’s not just cattle and deer that are affected by the earth ’s magnetism .
Scientists have previously discovered that birds , bats , turtles and salmon ( among other fish ) are affected by “ animal magnetism ” .
Lobsters have been shown to exhibit magnetic sensitivity , relying upon the earth ’s magnetic lines to navigate .

The aforementioned bats actually have bacteria in their bodies which , through evolutionary natural selection , has been favored due to its beneficial role in magnetic sensitivity .
But , being humans , scientists have also been curious to find out if homo sapiens are affected .
Since testing would be near - impossible , they looked to other large mammals , such as the humble cow , to gather further evidence .

Baby sea turtles rely on the earth ’s magnetism to make their way to and fro in the Atlantic Ocean ( that ’s 8,000 miles round trip ) .
There ’s a major current that spans the Atlantic that scientists have learned baby turtles can actually “ read ” .
Their bodies tell them when they ’ve strayed off course – it ’s just like having an internal GPS .
Even more astonishing , birds can literally see the earth ’s magnetic field .
Though it ’s not conclusively proven , there is compelling evidence : birds ’ eyes contain specialized light receptor molecules that communicate with the visual center in the brain .
Just as a compass relies on a tiny magnet to “ tune in ” to the earth ’s magnet , birds ’ eyes may act as compasses as well .
Bird brain , indeed .

But what about humans ?
Despite many alternative health industry claims that our cell phones , homes and highways are veritable minefields of electro - magnetic danger , the WHO ( World Health Organization ) and the scientific community maintain that such claims are bogus .
The available scientific literature does not offer any meritable evidence that magnetism harms us ; but how it affects us is still being explored .
There is some interesting treatment research for electro - magnetic therapy ’s usefulness , particularly in helping scientists to understand how the human brain works .
And if simple chemical reactions can be affected by the earth ’s magnetism , could n’t our bodies ?

The earth ’s magnetic field itself is fascinating .
Steady as you might think it is , the magnetism of the planet is remarkably capricious .
Every few million years or so , it flips .
It sloshes .
And its power is fading .
In certain parts , the magnetic fields are so weakened that the area is at risk of greater radiation .
In fact , scientists believe the North and South poles could one day switch .
Such fluctuations in magnetism may help to shed light on why geological phenomena like earthquakes and tsunamis are often detected by animals well in advance of people .

The evidence is interesting in that it extends from fishes and birds to mammals .
With terrestrial magnetism serving to help guide animals , does this mean that earthly creatures are mere magnets upon a giant metal ball ?
Shelve science fiction fantasies for now .
Though many animals have developed distinctive features – from heritable bacteria to special eyesight to an internal GPS – one might think of terrestrial magnetism and its impact upon animal evolution and behavior as one remarkably synergistic story .

Adam Nagourney , like so many of the old gang from the Straight Talk Express , seem to miss their old friend , John McCain :
There are now not one but two drawn curtains on Mr. McCain ’s plane separating his spacious quarters from the press corps .
Left idle is the couch that was built in the front of the plane — called “ Straight Talk Air ” — to reproduce at 30,000 feet the freewheeling chats with reporters that were the stock - in - trade on his bus ; the other morning it was covered with newspapers .
Mr. McCain , who promised to hold weekly news conferences if elected president , has not held one in more than a month .
Two curtains !
How cruel .
The traveling press was so looking forward to sitting in that couch .
It ’s hard to lose a friend because that friend start hanging out with a new crowd .
But , that ’s what happened to all the reporters who used to love hanging out with John McCain .
Under the tutelage of the Karl Rove crew , that old John McCain has morphed into somebody new :
These days , Mr. McCain sounds less like his old self than Bob Dole , another Republican senator who ran for president in 1996 , sounded in the closing days of his campaign — speaking louder or repeating statements that he thinks might be overlooked .
“ The American economy is in a crisis ! ” Mr. McCain said .
“ It ’s in a crisis ! ”
To the press corps , McCain has become Bob Dole .
Ouch .
That ’s what McCain gets for ditching them .

With water shortages emerging as a constraint on food production growth , the world needs an effort to raise water productivity similar to the one that nearly tripled land productivity during the last half of the twentieth century .
Worldwide , average irrigation water productivity is now roughly 1 kilogram of grain per ton of water used .
Since it takes 1,000 tons of water to produce 1 ton of grain , it is not surprising that 70 percent of world water use is devoted to irrigation .
Thus , raising irrigation efficiency is central to raising water productivity overall .
In surface water projects — that is , dams that deliver water to farmers through a network of canals — crop usage of irrigation water never reaches 100 percent simply because some irrigation water evaporates , some percolates downward , and some runs off .
Water policy analysts Sandra Postel and Amy Vickers found that “ surface water irrigation efficiency ranges between 25 and 40 percent in India , Mexico , Pakistan , the Philippines , and Thailand ; between 40 and 45 percent in Malaysia and Morocco ; and between 50 and 60 percent in Israel , Japan , and Taiwan . ”
Irrigation water efficiency is affected not only by the type and condition of irrigation systems but also by soil type , temperature , and humidity .
In hot arid regions , the evaporation of irrigation water is far higher than in cooler humid regions .
In 2004 , China ’s Minister of Water Resources Wang Shucheng outlined for me plans to raise China ’s irrigation efficiency from 43 percent in 2000 to 51 percent in 2010 and then to 55 percent in 2030 .
The steps he described included raising the price of water , providing incentives for adopting more irrigation - efficient technologies , and developing the local institutions to manage this process .
Reaching these goals , he felt , would assure China ’s future food security .
Raising irrigation water efficiency typically means shifting from the less efficient flood or furrow system to overhead sprinklers or drip irrigation , the gold standard of irrigation efficiency .
Switching from flood or furrow to low - pressure sprinkler systems reduces water use by an estimated 30 percent , while switching to drip irrigation typically cuts water use in half .
A drip system also raises yields because it provides a steady supply of water with minimal losses to evaporation .
Since drip systems are both labor - intensive and water - efficient , they are well suited to countries with a surplus of labor and a shortage of water .
A few small countries — Cyprus , Israel , and Jordan — rely heavily on drip irrigation .
Among the big three agricultural producers , this more - efficient technology is used on 1 –3 percent of irrigated land in India and China and on roughly 4 percent in the United States .
In recent years , small - scale drip - irrigation systems — virtually a bucket that relies on gravity to distribute the water through flexible plastic tubing — have been developed to irrigate small vegetable gardens with roughly 100 plants ( covering 25 square meters ) .
Somewhat larger drum systems irrigate 125 square meters .
Large - scale drip systems using plastic lines that can be moved easily are also becoming popular .
These simple systems can pay for themselves in one year .
By reducing water costs and raising yields , they can dramatically raise incomes of smallholders .
Sandra Postel estimates that the combination of these drip technologies at various scales has the potential to profitably irrigate 10 million hectares of India ’s cropland , or nearly one tenth of the total .
( She sees a similar potential for China , which is now also expanding its drip irrigated area to save scarce water . )
In the Punjab , fast - falling water tables led the state farmers ’ commission in 2007 to recommend a delay in transplanting rice from May to late June or early July .
This would reduce irrigation water use by roughly one third since transplanting would coincide with the arrival of the monsoon .
This reduction in groundwater use would help stabilize the water table , which has fallen from 5 meters below the surface to 30 meters in parts of the state .
Institutional shifts — specifically , moving the responsibility for managing irrigation systems from government agencies to local water users associations — can facilitate the more efficient use of water .
In many countries farmers are organizing locally so they can assume this responsibility , and since they have an economic stake in good water management , they tend to do a better job than a distant government agency .
Mexico is a leader in developing water users associations .
As of 2002 , farmers associations managed more than 80 percent of Mexico ’s publicly irrigated land .
One advantage of this shift for the government is that the cost of maintaining the irrigation system is assumed locally , reducing the drain on the treasury .
This means that associations often need to charge more for irrigation water , but for farmers the production gains from managing their water supply themselves more than outweigh this additional outlay .
In Tunisia , where water users associations manage both irrigation and residential water , the number of associations increased from 340 in 1987 to 2,575 in 1999 , covering much of the country .
Many other countries now have such bodies managing their water resources .
Although the early groups were organized to deal with large publicly developed irrigation systems , some recent ones have been formed to manage local groundwater irrigation as well .
Their goal is to stabilize water tables to avoid aquifer depletion and the economic disruption that it brings .
Low water productivity is often the result of low water prices .
In many countries , subsidies lead to irrationally low water prices , creating the impression that water is abundant when in fact it is scarce .
As water becomes scarce , it needs to be priced accordingly .
Provincial governments in northern China are raising water prices in small increments to discourage waste .
A higher water price affects all water users , encouraging investment in more water - efficient irrigation technologies , industrial processes , and household appliances .
What is needed now is a new mindset , a new way of thinking about water use .
For example , shifting to more water - efficient crops wherever possible boosts water productivity .
Rice production is being phased out around Beijing because rice is such a thirsty crop .
Egypt also restricts rice production .
Any measures that raise crop yields on irrigated land also raise the productivity of irrigation water .
Similarly , any measures that convert grain into animal protein more efficiently in effect increase water productivity .
For people consuming unhealthy amounts of livestock products , moving down the food chain reduces water use .
In the United States , where annual consumption of grain as food and feed averages some 800 kilograms ( four fifths of a ton ) per person , a modest reduction in the consumption of meat , milk , and eggs could easily cut grain use per person by 100 kilograms .
For 300 million Americans , such a reduction would cut grain use by 30 million tons and irrigation water use by 30 billion tons .
Reducing water use to the sustainable yield of aquifers and rivers worldwide involves a wide range of measures not only in agriculture but throughout the economy .
The more obvious steps , in addition to those mentioned here , include adopting more water - efficient industrial processes and using more water - efficient household appliances .
Recycling urban water supplies is another obvious step to consider in countries facing acute water shortages .

Advertisement Lawyers have claimed that many violent criminals are not being charged because of a drive to reduce congestion in Scottish courts .
The claim comes after doorman David Cantwell , 43 , from Edinburgh , was headbutted by off - duty policeman Samuel Johnston , who was not prosecuted .
Instead , he was told to pay his victim £ 250 compensation .
Senior prosecutors said the decision not to bring Pc Johnston to court was within new parliament guidelines .
Mr Cantwell , a father - of - two , was working on the door at an Edinburgh nightclub in February when he was approached by Pc Johnston and his friends .
After being allowed into the club , they left again but returned and Mr Cantwell was attacked .
Really the money 's not the matter here .
It 's the fact the guy can get off with a fiscal fine
David Cantwell
Victim
He told BBC Scotland : " I had my hands in my pocket , standing totally off my guard - the next minute this headbutt came from nowhere and struck me right on the lip .
I had to get two stitches . "
Mr Cantwell said Pc Johnston then ran off so he grabbed one of his colleagues as a witness until the police arrived .
The case did not go to court but was instead dealt with by the procurator fiscal .
Pc Johnston , who had a clean record and was serving with Fife Constabulary , was ordered to pay Mr Cantwell compensation instead .
After being suspended , then put onto restricted duties , Pc Johnston is now back on the beat .
Mr Cantwell said : " It made it worse for me knowing he was a serving police officer , a trusted person by the public . "
New provisions
He added : " Really the money 's not the matter here .
It 's the fact the guy can get off with a fiscal fine .
He 's got no criminal record whatsoever and he 's back with his police uniform on the next day . "
Catherine Dyer , a senior prosecutor at the Crown Office , said : " Parliament decided that in situations like that the procurator fiscal could look at it , take a decision about what the average fine would be and present it to the justice court which is where that case would have gone .
" The average fine would have been £ 150 .
" We took the decision that under new provisions it would be appropriate for compensation to be paid to Mr Cantwell of £ 250 , quickly and efficiently . "
Mr Cantwell said he had to receive stitches after the attack Gerry Considine , former president of the Glasgow Bar Association , said while there was a general acceptance that lower level crime should be transferred from the courts , there were fears about the use of fines .
He said : " The difficulty seems to be the level of crime that is now being diverted from prosecution is causing great concern .
In particular the level of violent crime which is no longer being prosecuted .
" Justice has to be available for everyone , the accused and victims of crime .
There has to be a balance struck between those two .
" It 's really a matter for public attention and public debate to decide on how we should deal with violent offenders or offenders of a level above the most minimal offence . "
Fife Constabulary said a senior officer was investigating the case .

Advertisement A Palestinian man has driven a bulldozer into a bus and several cars in Jerusalem , killing three people , before being shot dead .
Dozens of people were hurt , at least seven critically , in the rampage on Jaffa Road , in the city centre .
A police officer shot the driver of the bulldozer dead after a struggle in the vehicle 's cab .
Police said the attacker , aged 30 , was from east Jerusalem , with no known affiliations to militant groups .
See detailed map of the area
They named him as Hussam Dwayat , and said officers had been gathering evidence at his address in the Sur Baher neighbourhood .
Police said Hussam Dwayat had no known ties to militant groups
The BBC's Tim Franks , who witnessed the attack , said that within a few minutes a stretch of Jerusalem 's city centre had been turned into a blood - soaked mess .
From his office window , our correspondent says he saw the bulldozer ram a bus again and again until it flipped onto its side .
He says he ran out into the street where the bulldozer had left in its wake cars and taxis skewed across the road , some crushed , their occupants still inside .
Israeli police say the attacker was working for a construction firm laying the foundations for a new railway system .
' Natural ' response Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told the BBC that an initial inquiry indicated the attacker had been acting alone .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called the incident a terrorist attack , and condemned it as " an act of senseless murderous violence " .
Eyewitness : The BBC's Tim Franks BBC witnesses bloodshed In pictures : Bulldozer attack An aide to the Palestinian Authority President , Mahmoud Abbas , said the attack was an attempt to wreck peace negotiations , and urged a restrained response from Israel .
The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas , which controls Gaza and is maintaining a fragile truce with Israel , denied responsibility .
But Hamas added that it was a " natural " response to " a continued aggression against our people in the West Bank and Jerusalem " .
Cabin struggle
The bulldozer , which was heading towards the city 's largest open - air market , upended a bus and ran over several cars .
One eyewitness told the BBC : " I saw [ the bulldozer driver ] crashing cars and going into the bus ...
He wanted to kill as many as he could . "
Another eyewitness , Yaakov Ashkenazi , an 18 - year - old seminary student , told the Associated Press news agency : " I saw the bulldozer smash [ a ] car with its shovel .
He smashed the guy sitting in the driver 's seat . "
MAJOR JERUSALEM ATTACKS March 2008
Gunman kills eight at west Jerusalem religious college 2004
Three suicide attacks , one on a bus , kill a total of 20 people 2003
Four suicide bombings in buses and markets kill a total of 55 people A security guard from a nearby bank told our correspondent that he had shot the driver , bringing the bulldozer to a halt .
But then the vehicle suddenly started down the road again .
At one point , our correspondent saw two or three men inside the vehicle 's cabin , struggling with the driver and causing the cabin to shake violently .
One of the men , a police officer who arrived on the scene by motorbike , described how he dealt with the attacker .
" As he was driving I climbed the tractor stairs ...
I also shot him with two bullets , and made sure he was neutralised - and that was the end of the incident , " Eli Mizrahi told AP .
Attacks by Palestinian militants in Jerusalem have been a rare occurrence in recent years , with none of their trademark suicide bombings since September 2004 .
The last deadly attack was in March this year when a gunman killed eight students in a seminary before he was shot dead .
1 . Palestinian man driving a bulldozer begins his rampage down Jaffa Road in West Jerusalem , hitting several vehicles .
2. Travelling towards the Mahane Yehuda market , he rams a passenger bus several times before it overturns .
3 . The bulldozer is eventually brought to a halt after the driver is shot following a struggle in the cab .
At least three people are killed and dozens injured , some of them seriously .

Advertisement Plans to begin smashing particles at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) may be delayed after a magnet failure forced engineers to halt work .
The failure , known as a quench , caused some of the LHC 's super - cooled magnets to heat up by as much as 100 degrees .
The fire brigade were called out after a tonne of liquid helium leaked into the tunnel at Cern , near Geneva .
The LHC beam will remain turned off over the weekend while engineers investigate the severity of the fault .
A spokesman for Cern told the BBC it was not yet clear how soon progress could resume at the £ 3.6 bn ( $ 6.6 bn ) particle accelerator .
While the failure was " not good news " , he said glitches of this kind were not unexpected during testing .
Delays
The first beams were fired successfully around the accelerator 's 27 km ( 16.7 miles ) underground ring over a week ago .
Superconducting magnets are cooled down using liquid helium
The crucial next step is to collide those beams head on .
However , the fault appears to have ruled out any chance of these experiments taking place for the next week at least .
The quench occurred during final testing of the last of the LHC 's electrical circuits to be commissioned .
At 1127 ( 0927 GMT ) on Friday , the LHC 's online logbook recorded a quench in sector 3 - 4 of the accelerator , which lies between the Alice and CMS detectors .
The entry stated that helium had been lost to the tunnel and that vacuum conditions had also been lost .
It added that the Cern fire brigade had been called to the scene .
The LHC has been in construction for some 13 years
The superconducting magnets in the LHC must be supercooled to 1.9 kelvin ( - 271C ; - 456 F ) , to allow them to steer particle beams around the circuit .
As a result of the quench , the temperature of some magnets in the machine 's final sector rose dramatically .
A spokesman for Cern confirmed that it would now be difficult , if not impossible , to stage the first trial collisions next week .
Further delays could follow once the damage has been fully assessed over the weekend .
The setback comes just a day after the LHC 's beam was restored after engineers replaced a faulty transformer that had hindered progress for much of the past week .

I was a speaker last night at an anti-war event sponsored by the
Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Monmouth County , Progressive
Democrats of America and Democrats For America in Lincroft , NJ , near
the shore .
It was a great group of activist Americans who want to see
this country end the Iraq War , turn away from war as a primary
instrument of policy , and start dealing with the pressing human needs
of the country and the world .
Yet even in this group of committed people , one woman stood up
during the question - and - answer session and said , “ I want to get
involved in writing emails to members of Congress urging them to cut
off funding for the war and other things , but if I do that wo n’t I end
up getting put on a ' watch list ’ ” or something ? ”
I told her the short answer was yes , she probably would .
In George
Bush ’s and Dick Cheney ’s America , no one is safe from such spying , and
even from harassment , as witness Tom Feeley , the man behind the website
Information Clearing House , who had armed men invade his house at night and threaten his wife complaining about his First Amendment - protected effort to publicize important stories on the Internet .
But I also told her that it did n’t matter .
She should defend her
freedom of speech and her right to petition for redress of grievances ,
just as she was defending her freedom of assembly by attending last
night ’s event .
The only demonstrably true statement George Bush has made in his
sorry eight years in office is that the Constitution is “ just a
goddamned piece of paper . ”
While it was n’t the point he was making ,
when he reportedly shouted this at a couple of Republican members of
Congress who were questioning the constitutionality of some of his
actions , he was right that the nation ’s founding document is only worth
the parchment and ink it ’s composed of , unless people use it and defend
it .
There is a remarkable and palpable fear abroad in this land — not a
fear of terrorism , but a fear of speaking up , a fear of being labeled
as “ different ” or as a “ troublemaker . ”
People will lean over and whisper their opinions , if they think they
are anti-Establishment , as though someone might be listening .
People
write me after some of my columns run , praising me for my “ courage , ”
though why it should be perceived as requiring courage to merely write
something in America is beyond me .
The worst thing is that every time someone says she or he is
afraid , or acts afraid to speak or write what she or he is thinking ,
five more acquaintances become equally scared and silenced .
The corollary , though , is that each time someone forgets or ignores
or rejects that fear , five people gain courage the do the same thing .
Now I ’m not saying that there are n’t people monitoring , and
reporting on , what we say .
I know our government is busy doing that .
I
assume that my Internet activities are being monitored by the National
Security Agency .
I assume my phones are tapped .
I assume there was some
agent or informant among the fine people at the church last night .
But
these Stasi wannabes have no power if we do n’t let them frighten us
into silence and inaction .
What I find discouraging is the widespread acceptance , even on the
left , of this effort to intimidate us , and the pervasive attitude of
fear that has grown up around us .
I spent a year and a half living in a
truly fascistic society in China , where there are real , concrete
threats to life and liberty faced by those who stand up and say what
they are thinking , and yet sometimes I think that ordinary people I met
in China were braver about stating their minds than many , or even most
Americans are .
I ’m not talking here about saying things like that you
think the Post Office is dysfunctional , or that you think federal
bureaucrats are corrupt or that taxes are too high .
I ’m talking about
questioning the system , or challenging the war , or protesting military
spending .
Chinese people would tell me all the time that the Chinese
Communist Party was a corrupt gang of thugs or that you could not get
justice in a Chinese court .
Chinese people are closing down factories
that short them on their pay .
They have rallied in the thousands and
burned down police stations when corrupt police have raped , killed and
then covered up the death of a young girl .
They have marched in massive
impromptu protests at the theft of their homes through eminent domain .
If you want to see where we ’re headed here in America , check out
the workplace .
There , we Americans have , through years of collective
cowardice and unwillingness to stand together in organized labor
unions , allowed our constitutional freedoms to be almost completely
erased .
Today , an American workplace is more akin to a police state
than to a democratic society .
Say what you ’re thinking on the job , and
you ’re liable to lose it .
Wear a shirt that says something the boss
disagrees with , and you either remove that shirt or you are unemployed .
Even that final refuge of free speech , the bumper sticker , can get
workers in trouble if the wrong one shows up in the company parking
lot .
That loss of will and of freedom has in no small way contributed
to the loss of jobs and the decline in living standards of American
workers .
It ’s time for all of us to put a stop to this creeping usurpation of our liberties .
The anxious woman who asked her question came up to me after the
meeting and said proudly that she would not be afraid , and would start
signing on to protest letter - writing and emailing campaigns .
We need lots more like her .

It 's one of the simplest hacks we 've seen in a long time , and the more elite computer users have known about it for a while , but it 's still kinda cool and just a little bit unnerving :
A hacker has revealed a way to use Google and other search engines to gain unauthorized access to password - protected content on a dizzying number of websites .
While plenty of webmasters require their visitors to register or pay a fee before viewing certain pages , they are typically more than eager for search engine bots to see the content for free .
After all , the more search engines that catalog the info , the better the chances of luring new users .
But the technique , known as cloaking , has a gaping loophole : if Google and other search engines can see the content without entering a password , so can you .
Want to read this forum from the InkDrop Styles website ?
You can , but first you 'll have to enter a user name and password .
Or you can simply type " cache:http://forums.inkdropstyles.com/index.php?showtopic=4227 " into Google .
It leads you to this cache , which shows you the entire thread .
The technique yields plenty of other restricted forums , including those here , here and here .
Those in the know have been using the trick for years , but a hacker who goes by the handle
Oxy recently made this post that shares the technique with the world at large .
It reminds us of a similar approach for accessing restricted sites that involves changing a browser 's user agent to one used by search engine bots .
The hack is one example of the security problems that result from the practice of cloaking .
Robert Hansen , the web security guru and CEO of secTheory recently alerted us to the compromised blog of Blake Ross , the co-founder of the Mozilla Firefox project who recently went to work for Facebook .
For more than a month , unknown miscreants have been using his site to host links to sites pushing diet pills and other kinds of drugs .
Thanks the some javascript magic , users who visit the site never see evidence of the compromise , i.e. the links are cloaked .
But the image below shows what happens when javascript is disabled .
We 've contacted Blake about his website , but have n't yet received a response .
Cleaning up the site ought to be as easy as updating his badly out - of - date version of WordPress .
Addressing the shadowy world of cloaking will take a bit more work . ®
While the city of Philadelphia is content with using 3D images to deter speeders , the authorities in ShanXi province , China are taking a far more drastic approach .
They built a 100 foot long , 2 foot high , winding speed block smack dab in the middle of the Jing Zhuang highway .
Sure , it scratches up cars , looks hideous and causes massive traffic jams , but hey - by screwing everyone it manages to screw the speeders .
Suck on that leadfoot !

Conservative Leader Stephen Harper speaks to the media on Friday during a campaign appearance in Farnham , Que . ( ( CBC ) )
The federal government is not considering any bailout plans for Canada 's banks and other financial institutions , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Friday , as a massive and unprecedented package was being prepared in the United States .
Harper made the comments while campaigning Friday in Farnham , Que. , a Bloc Québécois stronghold , continuing his party 's push for crucial Quebec votes that could potentially win him a majority Conservative government in the Oct. 14 election .
Despite this week 's worldwide market turbulence over heightened fears for the U.S. economy , Harper said the Canadian financial system remains " in very good shape .
" All our information would indicate obviously while certain banks have had some significant writedowns , that overall , the balance sheets of the Canadian financial sector remains very healthy , " Harper told reporters after announcing a Conservative proposal to provide $ 85 million in tax breaks for families caring for disabled children or relatives .
" The best information I have , and I do continue to get briefed on these matters , is that the troubles in the financial sector of the United States should not spill over into Canada , " Harper said .
" But we ’re obviously watching it closely . "
Just moments before Harper spoke , U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sketched the outlines of a bold approach to relieve banks of their bad debts and restore the credit markets to health , while also warning the government action would cost hundreds of billions of dollars .
Harper has insisted his party is best equipped to handle Canada 's economy in the face of global economic uncertainty , while opposition parties have accused the Conservatives of mismanagement amid dwindling surpluses and economic growth figures .
Harper pressed over Ritz comments
But the Conservative leader 's message again was sidelined at the campaign event , as Harper continued to be pressed for a second day over controversial jokes made by his agriculture minister about the listeriosis crisis , which has been linked to the deaths of 17 people across Canada .
Dennis Schroh , whose mother Elizabeth Schroh died on Aug. 24 in Saskatchewan after contracting the strain of listeria linked to the Maple Leaf Foods meat recall , said he was offended when news broke that Gerry Ritz had cracked jokes about the outbreak while he was on a conference call with scientists and political staffers Aug. 30 .
While Harper expressed his sympathies for Schroh and other victims ' families , he again refused to fire Ritz over the comments .
" Well , look , we would expect that people in that position would be very upset as we all are , and obviously we sympathize greatly with the situation and the loss of their loved ones , " Harper said .
" Minister Ritz clearly did not intend to make any such comments publicly and has thoroughly apologized . "
He added Ritz and Health Minister Tony Clement were working hard to identify and fix problems in the federal food inspection system even before the crisis .
" These are terribly unfortunate cases , " he said .
" It ’s obviously why we are making sure going forward not just that we ’re investing more in the Canadian food inspection system , but we are going to do a thorough review of all the issues here … to make sure that these kinds of things do n’t happen in the future . "
Ritz a ' train wreck ' : Ignatieff
Meanwhile on Friday , Liberal deputy leader Michael Ignatieff called Ritz a " train wreck " who clearly could not handle the agriculture portfolio .
Ignatieff told CBC News that Ritz 's gaffes were the direct result of Harper 's " one- man - band " approach to governing , whereas the Liberals had a solid team to offer as an alternative to Canadians .
Ignatieff , who made his first campaign appearance with Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion in Toronto on Thursday , then headed to Finance Minister Jim Flaherty 's southern Ontario riding of Whitby - Oshawa .
He announced his party 's promise to match the Harper government 's $ 80 - million commitment to retool the Ford engine plant in Windsor , Ont. , as well as provide additional support for hybrid car operations at General Motors .
Ignatieff also said the Liberals " are going after " Flaherty because of his mismanagement of the crisis facing the province , and for him saying Ontario was " the last place " in Canada to start a business .
" This is a terrible call , and every autoworker in Ontario and central Canada manufacturing worker remembers that remark , " Ignatieff said .
He said the Conservative government " has spent 2 ½ years waking up " to the severity of the crisis in the auto sector , only offering assistance right before dropping the writ for an election .
" It 's that sense of too little , too late we want to emphasize , " he said .
' Tough ' Dion ' ready to lead , ' says former rival
Ignatieff also defended his former leadership rival Dion , declaring him " ready to lead , " despite media reports of Liberals questioning their leader 's performance during the campaign so far .
" I'm one of the few people in Canada who is in the room one on one with Stéphane Dion , and I can tell you looking you right in the eye , this guy is up to the job , " Ignatieff said .
" The thing about him that is not getting through and needs to get through , he 's very , very tough . "

August 2008 --
The existence of a secret , CIA - run prison on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean has long been a leaky secret in the “ War on Terror ” and recent revelations in TIME — based on disclosures by a “ senior American official ” ( now retired ) , who was “ a frequent participant in White House Situation Room meetings ” after the 9/11 attacks , and who reported that “ a CIA counter - terrorism official twice said that a high - value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island ” — will come as no surprise to those who have been studying the story closely .
The news will , however , be an embarrassment to the US government , which has persistently denied claims that it operated a secret “ War on Terror ” prison on Diego Garcia , and will be a source of even more consternation to the British government , which is more closely bound than its law - shredding transatlantic neighbour to international laws and treaties preventing any kind of involvement whatsoever in kidnapping , “ extraordinary rendition ” and the practice of torture .
This is not the first time that TIME has exposed the existence of a secret prison on Diego Garcia .
In 2003 , the magazine broke the story that Hambali , one of 14 “ high - value detainees ” transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 , was being held there , and in the years since confirmation has also come from other sources .
Twice , in 2004 and 2006 , Barry McCaffrey , a retired four - star US general , who is now professor of international security studies at the West Point military academy , revealed the prison ’s existence .
In May 2004 , he blithely declared on MSNBC ’s Deborah Norville Tonight , “ We ’re probably holding around 3,000 people , you know , Bagram air field , Diego Garcia , Guantánamo , 16 camps throughout Iraq ” , and in December 2006 he spoke out again , saying , in an NPR interview with Robert Siegel , “ They ’re behind bars … we ’ve got them on Diego Garcia , in Bagram air field , in Guantánamo . ”
The prison ’s existence was also confirmed by Dick Marty , a Swiss senator who produced a detailed report on “ extraordinary rendition ” for the Council of Europe in June 2007 ( PDF ) and by Manfred Novak , the UN ’s Special Rapporteur on Torture , in March 2008 .
Having spoken to senior CIA officers during his research , Marty told the European Parliament , “ We have received concurring confirmations that United States agencies have used Diego Garcia , which is the international legal responsibility of the UK , in the ‘ processing ’ of high - value detainees ” , and Manfred Novak explained to the Observer that “ he had received credible evidence from well - placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on Diego Garcia between 2002 and 2003 ” .
The penultimate piece of the jigsaw puzzle came in May , when El Pais broke the story that “ ghost prisoner ” Mustafa Setmariam Nasar , whose current whereabouts are unknown , was imprisoned on the island in 2005 , shortly after his capture in Pakistan — although the English - speaking press failed to notice .
Despite these previous disclosures , TIME ’s article by Adam Zagorin is particularly striking because of the high - level nature of the source , and his admission that “ the CIA officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information , apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence ” .
In addition , the source noted that “ the US may also have kept prisoners on ships within Diego Garcia ’s territorial waters , a contention the US has long denied ” .
Zagorin also spoke to Richard Clarke ( at the time the National Security Council ’s Special Advisor to President Bush regarding counter - terrorism ) , who explained , “ In my presence , in the White House , the possibility of using Diego Garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed . ”
Although Clarke “ did not witness a final resolution of the issue ” , he added , “ Given everything that we know about the administration ’s approach to the law on these matters , I find the report that the US did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible ” and he also pointed out that using the island for interrogations or detentions without British permission “ is a violation of UK law , as well as of the bi-lateral agreement governing the island ” .

Zagorin ’s source did not name the prisoners , but it seems clear that the period he was referring to ( “ 2002 and possibly 2003 ” ) was when three particular “ high - value detainees ” — Abu Zubaydah , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al - Shibh — are reported to have been held on the island , and it seems entirely plausible , therefore , that after these three were transferred to another secret CIA facility in Poland , the prison was used not only to hold Hambali , but also to hold the two other “ high - value detainees ” captured with him — Mohammed bin Lep ( aka Lillie ) and Mohd Farik bin Amin ( aka Zubair ) .
The addition of Mustafa Setmariam Nasar , who , it seems , may have been held into 2006 , not only confirms that a secret prison existed , but that it was possibly in use for four years straight .
These damaging revelations seal Diego Garcia ’s reputation as a quagmire of injustice .
A British sovereign territory — albeit one that was leased to the United States nearly 40 years ago , when the islanders were shamefully discarded by the British government and exiled to face destitution and death by misery in Mauritius — Diego Garcia has long been a source of shame to opponents of modern colonial activity .
Until now , however , the only admission that any activities connected with the “ War on Terror ” had taken place on the island came in February 2008 , when , after years of denials on the part of the British government , David Miliband , the foreign secretary , finally conceded that requests for information from his US counterparts had revealed that , in 2002 , two rendition flights had refuelled on the island .
“ In both cases ” , Miliband stated with confidence , “ a US plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the US facility in Diego Garcia .
The detainees did not leave the plane , and the US Government has assured us that no US detainees have ever been held on Diego Garcia ” .
The British government had been provoked to action by critics within the UK , in particular the All - Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition , led by the Tory MP Andrew Tyrie , and the legal action charity Reprieve , which represents 30 prisoners in Guantánamo , but the story appeared to grind to a halt when Michael Hayden , the CIA ’s director , stepped forward to deny that Diego Garcia had ever been used as a “ War on Terror ” prison .
“ That is false , ” General Hayden said when asked if a secret prison had existed on Diego Garcia , adding , as the New York Times put it , that “ neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at Diego Garcia ‘ was ever part of the CIA ’s high - value terrorist interrogation program . ’”
He also explained that one of the detainees “ was ultimately transferred to Guantánamo ” , while the other “ was returned to his home country ” , which was identified by US State Department officials as Morocco .
“ These were rendition operations , ” he added , “ nothing more ” .
In July 2008 , however , the story resurfaced once more , as David Miliband reported the results of his latest request for information from his US counterparts .
This concerned a list of rendition flights , which , in the opinion of Reprieve and the All - Party Parliamentary Group , may also have passed through British territory , but the foreign secretary was confident that there was no further evidence to be mined , stating , “ The United States Government confirmed that , with the exception of two cases related to Diego Garcia in 2002 , there have been no other instances in which US intelligence flights landed in the United Kingdom , our Overseas Territories , or the Crown Dependencies , with a detainee on board since 11 September 2001 . ”
Yet again , the assurances of his US colleagues did nothing to assuage the critics .
Reprieve noted that the British government “ intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the US , and accepted implausible US assurances at face value ” and added , presciently , “ This remains a transatlantic cover - up of epic proportions .
While the British government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its US allies , the sordid truth about Diego Garcia ’s central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so - called ‘ War on Terror ’ can not be hidden forever . ”
Just three days after David Miliband ’s last attempt to draw a line under the story , the British Foreign Affairs Select Committee published its latest report on the British Overseas Territories ( PDF ) , and was scathing about Diego Garcia , declaring that “ it is deplorable that previous US assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false .
The failure of the United States Administration to tell the truth resulted in the UK Government inadvertently misleading our Select Committee and the House of Commons .
We intend to examine further the extent of UK supervision of US activities on Diego Garcia , including all flights and ships serviced from Diego Garcia . ”
TIME ’s latest revelations , of course , leave the US administration looking like bald - faced liars and the British government looking like myopic dupes .
Whether Michael Hayden was also duped is not known , but his strenuous denial , just five months ago , that a secret prison existed , which was staffed by his own employees , will do nothing for the credibility of the US administration , which likes to pretend that it does not torture and has nothing to conceal , but is persistently discovered not only being economical with the truth , but also behaving exactly as though it has guilty secrets to hide .
Whether this scandal will awaken much indignation in the US public remains to be seen , but it is hugely damaging to the British government , which is legally responsible for the activities that take place on its territory , however much it likes to hide behind “ assurances ” from its leaseholders that they have done nothing wrong .
It scarcely seems possible , but Diego Garcia ’s dark history has suddenly grown even darker .

Linus 's mid-merge - window reflections
From : Linus Torvalds < torvalds -AT- linux-foundation.org >
To : Linux Kernel Mailing List < linux - kernel-AT-vger.kernel.org >
Subject : Short update and pause in 2.6.27 merge window Date : Thu , 17 Jul 2008 09:47:45 - 0700 ( PDT ) Message - ID : < alpine .LFD.1.10.0807170919370.2959@woody.linux-foundation.org >
This is just a quick note to let people know that I 'll be off for an extended weekend starting later today , so the next few days will be very quiet from a merge standpoint .
Feel free to send the merge requests , just do n't get worried when I do n't act on them ;)
( There 's also a few merge requests that I did n't act on yet just because I wanted to take a closer look - but if you 're worried about it there is nothing wrong with re-sending it .
I _do_ just drop requests in the bottomless pit that is my mailbox at times )
We seem to be roughly half - way through the merge window , judging purely by number of commits , although part of my calculations there is that I 'm actually hoping / expecting that because a number of people are on vacation etc , this merge window might be smaller than some of the other recent ones ( 2.6.25 - rc1 in particular was huge ) .
In the last couple of days I _have_ merged 50 + trees , and while there 's been some ' heated discussion ' about some of them ( you know who you are ; ) , I 'm hoping that we 're actually in reasonably good shape even though it's in the middle of the merge window , and that people will test out the snapshot kernels even though I 'm not ready to do a - rc1 release .
So go out and test .
The fact that much of it has been in linux - next may or may not have helped , but it definitely meant that people knew of _some_ problems early .
Let 's see how people feel about that after the whole release is done , but it certainly does n't seem to have hurt .
My personal favorite merge is the BKL pushdown , which while not likely to matter hugely in practice for lots of people is nice to finally see .
We kind of dropped the ball on the BKL once it got to be small enough that it was n't very high on peoples radar any more .
Now the most noticeable user of the BKL in " core " kernel code seems to be fs/ locks .c .
Hint , hint .
I think somebody had some patches for that one too .
Matthew ?
But we 've had lots of other things ( in fact , the BKL changes ended up being much smaller than I expected ) , and the dirstat so far is 4.7 % arch / arm / 3.3 % arch / mips / 3.5 % arch / ppc/platforms / 14.9 % arch / ppc/ 3.3 % arch / x86 / 29.3 % arch / 8.3 % drivers / char / drm / 9.3 % drivers / char / 7.3 % drivers / gpu/drm / 7.3 % drivers / gpu/ 3.3 % drivers / s390 / 10.4 % drivers /usb/ misc / 6.0 % drivers/usb/ serial / 17.2 % drivers/usb / 45.0 % drivers / 7.1 % firmware / 4.3 % fs/ubifs / 5.0 % fs/ 6.7 % include / 3.3 % sound / where some of those percentages are a bit misleading ( the " gpu " part , for example , goes away if you enable renames , since that was all really just moving files around from drivers / char / - but at the same time it's one of the things people may notice more , so I chose the non-rename version of dirstat on purpose ) .
No network or driver core / USB merges yet ( the USB stuff in the dirstat is from the ARM , BKL and firmware merges ) so there are complete big subsystems lacking still , but it would be good to have people test the things we _have_ merged .
Linus PS .

And you can quote me on that .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Under pressure to make public its case against a U.S. Army scientist in the 2001 anthrax murders , the FBI is preparing to release its evidence on the researcher , who killed himself before he could be charged , law enforcement officials said on Tuesday .
Bruce Ivins is seen during a 2003 award ceremony at the Pentagon .
Under pressure to make public its case against a U.S. Army scientist in the 2001 anthrax murders , the FBI is preparing to release its evidence on the man , who killed himself before he could be charged , law enforcement officials said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / USAMRIID / Handout
The evidence could be released as early as Wednesday and includes anthrax spores found in the office of Bruce Ivins that were linked through DNA matching to the spores sent through the mail , the officials said .
They said the evidence also included e-mails sent by Ivins that implicate him in the anthrax attacks , the worst biological weapon attack on U.S. soil .
The FBI plans to brief victims and their families on the latest developments , most likely on Wednesday .
Court documents detailing the evidence against Ivins also would be unsealed , probably the same day .
Law enforcement officials have expressed confidence in their belief that Ivins acted alone and said they plan to close the investigation soon -- meaning there are no more suspects .
But some scientists have questioned whether Ivins could have done it by himself .
Ivins , 62 , was a microbiologist who worked on developing an anthrax vaccine and received a top Defense Department award in 2003 for his research at an Army facility in Fort Detrick , Maryland .
He took an overdose of painkillers and died on July 29 .
His death has been ruled a suicide .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey declined to say whether the anthrax investigation had been closed by the Justice Department .
“ The department has a legal and a moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families and then to the public , ” Mukasey said in Boston , adding that he hoped it would happen on Wednesday .
Paul Kemp , an attorney for Ivins , has said his client was innocent and that would have been established at trial .
He noted that Ivins had cooperated with the FBI probe .
The anthrax - laced letters were mailed to media organizations and politicians shortly after the September 11 attacks by al Qaeda in 2001 .
The mailings killed five people who caught the disease and sickened 17 .
The letters shut down a Senate office building and spread fear of further biological attacks among Americans already reeling from September 11 .
The attacks severely disrupted the national postal service , forcing billions of dollars in operational changes , and turned ordinary envelopes into something to be feared .
Critics have questioned the evidence against Ivins , partly because FBI investigators mistakenly focused for years on another scientist at Fort Detrick , Steven Hatfill .
Hatfill never was charged and the government agreed in June to pay him $ 5.85 million to settle his lawsuit against the Justice Department .
Former Sen. Thomas Daschle , whose office as Senate Democratic leader received one of the anthrax letters , has expressed concerns about the investigation .
He said the Ivins ’ suicide further complicates the FBI ’s ability to get all the answers .
Another critic , Sen. Charles Grassley , a Republican from Iowa , has vowed a thorough examination if the FBI closes its investigation into the attacks .
NDP Leader Jack Layton is refusing to rule out a coalition government with Stéphane Dion 's Liberals if that 's what it takes to oust Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
Blasting Harper on everything from the environmental damage in the Alberta tar sands to the war in Afghanistan , Layton said this morning it 's time to move Canada in a different direction .
Asked on CTV's Canada AM if he would " entertain even the notion of entering into a coalition with the Liberals in order to get the Conservatives out of power , " the New Democrat stressed he 's never allowed partisanship to trump the greater public good .
" Well , you know what , I 've worked with any other party .
I think people have seen that if they look back to my days on a municipal council , " said Layton , a former Toronto councillor and one - time president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities .
" You roll up your sleeves and you try to solve a problem , " he said .
" I think right now the problem we have is Stephen Harper and his Conservatives .
They 're taking the country down the wrong path .
They 're much too close to a ( U.S. President ) George Bush style foreign policy when it comes to the war in my view . "
Pressed on whether he would move toward some sort of formal arrangement with Dion if the Liberal and NDP seat tally is greater than that of the Tories after Oct. 14 , Layton was more coy .
" I think what I 'll do is hopefully sit down in the Prime Minister 's office and pull together the leadership of my party and say : ' how can we best serve the country ?
How can we best get that childcare program we committed to ?
How can we best get those doctors and nurses trained and deal with these wait times ? ' "
While the New Democrats have been accused of propping up Harper 's Conservatives and indeed help topple former prime minister Paul Martin 's Liberals by triggering the Jan. 23 , 2006 election , Layton 's attacks on Dion are infrequent .
Instead , he has been targeting Harper over their foreign and domestic policy differences .
Repeating his pledge to immediately withdraw Canadian troops from Afghanistan , he said it 's time " to chart a new course . "
" We 've seen soldiers ' deaths up , civilian deaths up , ( opium ) poppy production up , corruption is up .
More of the country is too dangerous now to even provide aid or development , " he said .

" Let 's use the instruments of the U.N. that we created to reduce conflict , let 's have a coordinated and comprehensive approach , " he said .
On the home front , Layton pledged to reinstate the cuts to arts funding by the Conservatives and then increase such programs to boost economic development .

I 've decided to post this here since it is pretty serious and there is no one vendor to blame .
Watch yourselves . :
Rewriting of links and URLs in cached pages to arbitrary strings by unauthenticated HTTP clients . : ANY site that does not validate HTTP Host : headers .
It is common practice for web programmers and web frameworks to rely on the value of the HTTP
Host header to write links .
This is for convenience , so that the same software will run on localhost , various testing servers , subdomains , secondary domains , etc , without modification .
For example : Looks familiar ?
This turns out to be a very , very bad idea in any language .
The HTTP
Host header is arbitrary text controlled by the client , but common practice treats it as though it were a safe environment variable .
The second half of the vulnerability comes when there is HTTP caching going on somewhere on the path between the site and users .
This could be a caching proxy run by the site itself , or downstream in ISP proxies , content delivery networks ( CDNs ) , syndicators , etc .
This allows an attacker to potentially rewrite URLs on any page he wishes , and embed that exploited page in caches that may be beyond the control of the victim site .
Let me demonstrate with a carefully scrubbed example .
I do n't wish to point anyone out , but I have successfully tested this exploit against several high - traffic websites , including a well - respected news organization .
Several popular web frameworks are vulnerable by default .
The odds are relatively high that your website is vulnerable .
Even if you do n't do page caching , most ISPs do .
Now , if there is any caching going on either by the site owners or any proxies along the way , other clients will get the exploited page .
Mitigation
I do n't know what else to say .
I have no hard data to prove this exploit has been used before .
Given its simplicity I would not be surprised to learn that it is as old as the protocol itself . : do NOT use the value of the Host header for anything .
If you must , apply very strict filters to only allow valid FQDNs , and then whitelist the FQDNs you allow .
Treat it as you would any arbitrary data coming from the outside .
If your webserver is configured to output the value of the Host header ( as in the example , and as by default in many webservers ) , disable that configuration .
I 've found only one reference that outlines the full consequences of this vuln , but it concentrates on the Zope framework .

Nvidia to ATI : Lets Align Our Marketing Plans
That anti-trust suit against Nvidia and ATI from back in 2006 is still ongoing , with some interesting developments occuring recently .
The two graphics chip manufacturers were hoping to keep certain evidence from being presented to a jury , but Judge William Alsup was not impressed .
Especially since this was emailed by Nvidia 's Dan Vivoli to ATI 's Dave Orton in 2002 :
" I really think we should work harder together on the marketing front .
As you and I have talked about , even though we are competitors , we have the common goal of making our category a well positioned , respected playing field .
$ 5 and $ 8 stocks are a result of no respect . "
The ongoing class action suit alleges that ATI ( now AMD ) and Nvidia kept prices artificially high by releasing products at the same time and at similar prices .
NVidia recently slashed prices after ATI released a highly competitive video card at a much lower price point .
Like many before me , I was searching ( unsuccessfully ) for a decent twitter client .
There are many , but most seem to be ad sponsored or based on a rather hefty framework like AIR ( which by now , I guess , has been silently installed on my computer anyhow ) .
Update :
This project is now deprecated and Twitter has removed basic authentication .
Custom apps have major implications for usability so I decided to roll my own .
I wanted to try out Fluid , the Prism - like app to contain web apps in their own process / window , to see if it is possible to build a complete open source ad - free twitter client in a single web page only using javascript and HTML .
So , I cuiled for a jQuery twitter plugin but had to google it to find it .
Some minor modifications to the code by the fine folks at SeaOfClouds and adding a method to post new status messages gave this native - looking OS X twitter client ( HUD - style to the left , default style to the right and HUD avatars style below ) :
Thank’s to the twitter json api it was trivial to query my own friend feed and display it in Safari .
Then , I used Fluid to create a self contained OSX app that displays my static HTML page .
Googling a nice application icon makes it much better - looking in the taskbar .
I decided to call it “ Twoot ” .
Twoot consumes little memory and plays nice with embedded URLs ( they open in a new Firefox tab ) .
Unfortunately , Fluid does not allow you to distribute the created app so you will have to roll your own by :
Download and install Fluid .
Create a folder called “ twoot ” in your home directory .
Download the twoot html , js and css files from github and place in the twoot folder .
Edit twoot.js and set your twitter username and password .
( Enter credentials in the basic auth form when launching app the first time ) .
Open Fluid and create a new app by pointing to the twoot .htm file ( e.g. file:///users/you/twoot/twoot.htm ) and set a nice icon .
Save the app as “ Twoot ” .
Your new twitter client is ready !
Run it and resize as required , set the window to floating , kill tabs etc .
Change the twoot.css and html file to customize it further .
Simple API :s are wonderful for usability !
Recently , a Florida teacher seeking relief from a challenging special - needs student named Alex Barton did the unthinkable :
She stood him before his kindergarten peers and encouraged them to say what they did n't like about his behavior .
Then she asked the students if they wanted him back in class after his reportedly disruptive actions earlier that day .
By a vote of 14 to 2 , they booted him .
Alex 's mom was understandably outraged ; she plans to sue .
The resulting media sound and fury has brought to light the quiet revolution in public schools across America : the placing of special - needs students into regular classrooms .
Federal law holds that children with disabilities have a right to a " free and appropriate public education . "
But free for whom ?
Not for the taxpayers , who must foot the bill for the testing , evaluation , special therapy , and classroom support needed by the differently - abled students , who are increasingly popping up in classrooms .
That has parents everywhere asking themselves an uncomfortable yet critical question :
Does the practice of inclusion detract from my child 's education ?
Is it really worth it ?
It all depends on your point of view .
Mine has changed in the past 30 years , a result of having raised two generations of children – and seeing some unexpected benefits from having my son Jonny , who has Down syndrome , enrolled in regular school .
My oldest went to school when " special ed " kids were housed in trailers behind the school .
That was a step up from the days when they were institutionalized , but the segregation still emphasized their differences .
But true to our country 's melting pot idealism – in which the public schools are traditionally called on to do the stirring – special - needs students were soon included in the mix .
It was a welcome change , but it created individual challenges that had to be confronted and hammered out between parents and educators on a case - by - case basis .
I was drawn into this drama 11 years ago when Jonny entered Kindergarten .
As a fiscal conservative , I actually struggled with the idea that our small , rural school district would bear the extra burden of a student who in the eyes of the world might never amount to much .
But as enrollment time approached , I became convinced that he could make a unique contribution to his class .
So Jonny became the first student with an Individualized Education Plan ( IEP ) at Liberty Elementary School in Petaluma , Calif .
The school welcomed us with professionalism and grace .
Looking back after 11 years ( and since we went on to adopt three other children with Down syndrome , I 've been through my share of IEPs – the good , the bad , and the downright ugly ) , I 'm impressed and grateful that every person involved made what we were doing look easy .
They did not add to my already significant burden as a parent .
Never once did they make us feel as though they were doing us a favor .
They treated Jonny with dignity .
My belief that Jonny had a vital role to play among his peers was confirmed when his teacher , Miss Bessie , wrote me a four - page letter at the end of the school year .
She wrote something I 'll never forget : " I am thankful to Jonny for teaching my students and myself unconditional love , sharing , acceptance , humor , and friendship . …
As the Bible says , ' Man looks at the outward appearance , but the Lord looks at the heart ' ;
Jonny certainly taught the children and me to look at the heart ; for he has a very big heart !...
Jonny has taught the very important " life skills " to his kindergarten friends .
Perhaps these will be the most valuable lessons they will learn . "
It 's a sentiment that echoes year after year .
Now in Virginia , Jonny has progressed to ninth grade – where at Harmony Intermediate 's awards ceremony recently , the principal and teachers said that in all their years of teaching , it was the most compassionate group of students they 'd ever seen .
Jonny 's teacher , Mrs. Beitz , told the assembly : " You look at your peers for what they can do as opposed to what they can't do . "
Shepherding a special - needs student through public school can be deeply frustrating for everyone involved .
But it can also produce some inspiring results .
Take Lauren Welsh .
Her Loudoun Valley High School peers in Purcellville , Va. , voted her Homecoming Queen several years ago .
The success and benefits of inclusion for every member of Lauren 's class were obvious – and well worth the 12 years of teamwork by the adults behind the scenes .
Such effort helped shape a graduating class of compassionate , caring citizens .
By contrast , Alex Barton 's teacher may have failed to grasp the opportunity she had to help his fellow students see him in a better light .
Instead , by emphasizing his faults , she unwittingly encouraged her class of kindergartners to think in terms of prejudice and exclusion .
Everyone involved in this sad situation will need remedial help .
Meanwhile , I hope every parent can come to see that our efforts to accommodate the differently - abled in public schools is not a burden , but an invitation .

プログラムやコマンドの使い方を言葉で、たとえば電話越しで説明しないといけない状況に陥ったときにハタと困ったんですよ。「これ、どう発音すれば相手はわかってくれるのか‥？」と。プログラムと言えば、{}だの、^だの、なんとも言い表しがたい記号があちこちに散在しています。調べてみたら、こんなブログがありました。英語のネイティブスピーカでもけっこう困っているんですねぇ。

冒頭には
" I responded with a single line of Ruby to do the same , and a single line of Lisp . "
" He wrote back : " Underscores , pipes , octothorpes , curly braces -- " 、、 、" What the heck is an octothorpe ? "
とあり、笑えます 。
このブログ本文はもちろんすばらしいのですが、ここにはものすごい書き込みがあって、面白いものがいくつもあるので一読の価値があり、です。例えば、Rubyではおなじみの"<=>( comparator method ) " や " =>( operator ) " はどう読むのか、とか。書き込みによると"<=>" は" spaceship ( UFOみたいな形だから ) " で " = > " は" hash rocket ( hashへ の 代 入に使うし、形がロケットみたいだから ) " だそうです。( spaceshipという読み方 は PickAxe本にも出ています ) Rubyは他にも、 <=( hash rocketの逆 ) や===(equal記号が3つ)などなど、読み方ナゾの記号が多くて音読には苦労します。
ちなみに 、Java言語では " =>" を" fat arrow " と読むことになるはずです。この記号はJDK 7で導入される予定のClosuresで使うのですが、Closuresの仕様作りにかかわっているNeal Gafter氏がそう読んでました( Considering Closures for Java ) 。C++など、他の言語では" goes to " と読む場合もあるらしく 、 " t= >t. Name " は"t goes to t. Name " と読むようです 。
中でも、 " # " の読み方は意見が分かれる記号のようでした。 " #" はプログラミングでは一般的 に" hash " と読むといっていいようですが、ふつーにその辺で見かけたら" number"です。電話のキーパッドの話だったら" pound" ですね。" octothorpe"は難しすぎ( 発音しずらい ) 、" tictactoe " は笑いました。確かにその形をしています。
でも 、" C#" 書いてあった ら" see sharp " ですね 。
" ^" はRegular Expressionのドキュメント関係で は " circumflex " と呼ばれていることが多いですが、" caret"
もよく聞くような気がします。
また、英語では " ( ) parentheses ; left parenthesis , right parenthesis " 、" {} ( curly ) braces ; left brace , right brace " 、 " [ [ ] brackets ; left bracket , right bracket ( bracket ははてなのブログでは解釈されてしまうのでちゃんと表示されていません ; _ ; ) " が一般的ですが、日本語直訳ふうの " ( ) small brackets " 、" {} middle brackets " 、 " [ [ ] big brackets ( ここも、bracketが表示されていません ) "
という呼び方をするという書き込みもあるんです。これでもわかってもらえるのかも、、？？？さらに、" " は" greater than " か" right angle " が一般的な読み方ではないかと思うのですが、
< - left quack
> - right quack <> - quack quack !
なんていう書き込みもあり、while (<>) だった ら" while left parenthesis quack quack right parenthesis " らしく、笑えます 。
いやぁ、プログラムの音読って難しいですねぇ。言語仕様を作るときには読み方仕様も一緒に作ってもらいたいものです。
ええっと 、1000000.times { puts " Thank You ! " } は " a million dot times left brace puts double quote thank you bang double quote left brace " で、# python -c " print ' Thankyou ' * int ( 1e6 ) " だったら 、" hash python negative see double quote print single quote thank you single quote asterisk int left parenthesis one eee six right parenthesis double quote " だから、、、この場合 はRubyの方が短くていいかも。
書き込みの中に 、" the Victor Borge ' Phonetic punctuation ' sketch " に触れている方がいるのですが、これはかつて、http://journal.mycom.co.jp/column/en/005/index.htmlの回で引用させていただいたものではないかと思われます。すでに、削除されてしまって見れないので残念です。どこかにないかなぁ、、、

Living the good life means different things to different people .
There is , however , a slightly ambiguous , mutual understanding .
“ The good life ” is the life that you would like to live broken down to its most basic form .
It deals with the simple pleasures that make you happy , the compassionate deeds you perform , the personal goals you strive to achieve , the relationships you nurture and the legacy you leave behind .
Sincere personal fulfillment is generally the collective end result .
“ The good life ” is also about appreciating all your time , not just your leisure time .
Far too many people get caught up in the mad rush of a corporate lifestyle and grow completely numb to the little moments , the simple building blocks of time that make life magical .
Time , after all , is the single greatest element of life .
This world , after all our science and sciences , is still a miracle ; wonderful , magical and more , to whosoever will think of it .
– Thomas Carlyle
Slow Down – Urgency and haste instantly diminish accuracy , awareness and happiness .
There is a big difference between getting things done and getting things done effectively .
Appreciate Life ’s Simple Pleasures –
The best things in life are free .
From a quiet lakeside sunset to sleeping in on a rainy day , life ’s greatest simple pleasures can only be purchased with mindful awareness .
Foster and Nurture Relationships – A happy , fulfilling life is a life shared with family and friends .
Be Self Sufficient – Freedom is the greatest gift .
Self sufficiency is the greatest freedom .
Learn About Different Things –
In life , a jack of all trades is far more equipped than a master of only one .
Combining the two is the key .
Concentrate on Your Passions – True wealth comes naturally to those who are passionate about their endeavors .
Travel to Distant Places –
There are places in this world that will open your mind to realities you ’ve never imagined in your wildest dreams .
These realities will inject your conscience with healthy , new perspectives .
Talk to Strangers – Quite simply , this is how you will meet great people .
Exercise Your 5 Senses – Sight , hearing , smell , taste and touch .
Each provides a gateway to rewarding personal experiences .
Use What You Have – Success is not the byproduct of limitless resources .
Success happens when you stretch the limits of the available resources .
Assist Others –
What goes around comes around .
Nuff said .
Be Clear on Your Goals – You will never get where you want to go if you do n’t know what you want .
Make a Decision – Indecision is the leading cause of missed opportunity and wasted time .
Practice General Time Management – Trying to achieve your goals without doing a little time planning is like sailing the open ocean without a compass and map .
Leave Time for Spontaneous Excursions – Opportunity sometimes knocks at unexpected times .
Make sure you have enough flexibility in your schedule to respond accordingly .
Educate Yourself on the Facts – Ignorance is only bliss in a vacuum .
In the real world you will eventually be confronted with the facts , and by then it may`be too late .
Be aware of reality , get your facts straight and make educated decisions .
Think More , Talk Less –
The more you think and the less you talk , the more you will learn and the less you will miss .
Own Up to Your Actions – Either you own up to your actions or your actions will ultimately own you .
Keep Your Promises – Not doing so guarantees loneliness and failure .
Always Find the Positive Lesson – Every negative outcome holds a positive lesson .
Finding it is the key to greatness .
Forget Perfection , Find Satisfaction – Perfect is the enemy of good .
The idea of perfection is based primarily on personal opinion , circumstance and flexibility .
Instead of searching for perfection , find something that satisfies your needs .
Eat Clean – Never doubt the old adage “ you are what you eat ” .
Sleep Well – A tired mind is inefficient and unhappy .
Laugh –
Some of the most memorable moments in your life will be moments spent in laughter .
Be Here Now – Right now is the only moment guaranteed to you .
Right now is life .
Do n’t miss it .

Institute pulls plug on basic research .
It generated six Nobel prizes in as many decades , but after a string of staff departures , physicists claim that the once iconic Bell Laboratories has finally pulled out of basic science .
Just four scientists are left working in Bell 's fundamental physics department in Murray Hill , New Jersey , Nature has learned .
Others have either left or been reassigned to other parts of the company , and a major materials - fabrication facility has been shut down .
" Four people can't be called a basic research group , " says Ronen Rapaport , who left the laboratory last summer for a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
" It 's a single project . "
The invention of the transistor earned researchers at Bell Labs a Nobel prize .
SCIENCE MUSEUM / SCIENCE & SOCIETY
But officials at Alcatel - Lucent , Bell 's parent company , say that reports of the lab 's death are greatly exaggerated .
Fundamental science remains , but it has moved away from physics , says Gee Rittenhouse , vice - president of research at Bell Labs .
" We 've shifted the fundamental research over to include mathematics , computer science , networking and wireless , " he says .
Founded in 1925 , Bell Labs was once considered the world 's pre-eminent industrial laboratory for physics ( see ' Moving with the times ' ) .
Scientists working there regularly won Nobel prizes , including ones for the invention of the transistor and the laser .
Much of the early work was funded by the enormous profits of Bell 's then parent company , AT&T , which held a monopoly on US telecommunications for more than half a century .
But deregulation forced AT&T to split off Bell and other parts of the company into Lucent Technologies in 1996 .
Lucent struggled to finance its new research arm and the situation rapidly deteriorated after demand for telecommunications equipment collapsed in 2001 .
Faced with redundancies and cutbacks , the lab 's reputation was dealt a further blow in 2002 , when one of its star researchers , Jan Hendrik Schön , was found to have falsified data in more than a dozen papers ( see Nature 419 , 419 –421 ; 2002 ) .
Some believed that the lab 's fortunes could be reversed by Lucent 's merger with French telecom firm Alcatel in 2006 ( see Nature 440 , 1111 ; 2006 ) .
But Alcatel - Lucent has faced six consecutive quarterly losses and its stock value has halved since the merger .
On 29 July , Serge Tchuruk , the company 's chairman , and Patricia Russo , its chief executive , both announced that they would step down .
The latest troubles of the parent company have been mirrored at the lab .
Alcatel - Lucent does not provide information about redundancies , but Bell 's Murray Hill campus has been " heavily consolidated " since the merger , according to Bettina Tratz - Ryan , a telecoms analyst with Gartner , an IT market - research firm based in Stamford , Connecticut .
Staff levels have been cut and some buildings have been sold to property speculators .
In February , Bell shut down a top - of - the - line silicon fabrication facility once used by materials scientists .
Rittenhouse confirmed that around 20 people were made redundant or reassigned as a result of the shutdown .
Given the grim outlook , many scientists started to look for other work to avoid redundancy , according to Vladimir Aksyuk , a visiting professor at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , Maryland , who left Bell Labs in May .
Throughout the turmoil , a small and talented group of roughly 30 physicists remained committed to basic research , but most have now left for more stable jobs .
" The company just ca n't support research anymore , " Aksyuk says .
" Walk down the halls and there 's a bunch of empty rooms . "
" Almost everyone has gone away now , " agrees Dick Slusher , a former Bell researcher now at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta .
Slusher and others say that just Mike Manfra , Lauren Pfeiffer , Steve Simon and Robert Willett continue to conduct basic physics research at the laboratory .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rittenhouse does not deny that the lab 's focus has changed , but says Bell 's research needs to be aligned with the company 's needs .
Lucent spun - off its semiconductor business in 2002 and its business needs have since moved away from materials science and towards networking , he says .
" We 've had to adjust our physics group 's focus . "
In addition to quantum computing , he says , Alcatel - Lucent 's 850 or so researchers continue to work on high - speed electronics and micromechanical electronic devices .
" We can still do good research , " he argues .
For physicists such as Rapaport , however , the halcyon days are over .
The stock certificates he brought with him from Alcatel - Lucent are so diminished in value that he wo n't even bother to sell them , he says .
Instead , " I can hang them on the wall as a memory of Bell Labs . "
In 1962 someone at the Genetics Institute in Pavia , Italy , turned up the temperature in an incubator holding fruit flies .
When Ferruccio Ritossa , then a young geneticist , examined the cells of these “ heat shocked ” flies , he noticed that their chromosomes had puffed up at discrete locations .
The puffy appearance was a known sign that genes were being activated in those regions to give rise to their encoded proteins , so those sites of activity became known as the heat shock loci .

EA : Second - hand sales are a " critical situation " Publisher hopes online content and services can stop consumers trading in games to the second - hand market
Matt Martin Thursday 28th August 2008
Share this article Share
Companies in this article Electronic Arts
Publishing giant Electronic
Arts has said that it 's currently trying multiple new business models to help battle the critical problem of second - hand videogame sales .
While retailers reap the benefits of selling the same product multiple times , publishers and developers do n't see any income once a title hits the second - hand market .
But realising it 's powerless to stop retail from selling second - hand goods , EA is looking to combat the problem by capturing the consumer with online content and services .
" I 'd actually make the point that for us second - hand sales is a very critical situation , because people are selling multiple times intellectual property , " said Jens Uwe Intat , senior VP and general manager for European publishing at EA , speaking exclusively to GamesIndustry.biz .
" What we 're trying to do is build business models that are more and more online - supported with additional services and additional content that you get online .
So people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone , but actually playing those games online and paying for them . "
The argument that the second hand business model exists in other industries is n't comparable , says the senior VP , as videogames do n't wear and tear and become an inferior product as they are passed from consumer to consumer .
" In our understanding of the business model we are actually giving away the rights to play , and if you just pass it on , pass it on , pass it on , that is not comparable to second - hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear - out - second - hand cars , second - hand clothes , second - hand books ... they 're all physically wearing out , so you have an inferior quality product . "
" But digital goods is not actually becoming inferior in quality , so people passing that on is actually very challenging for us , " he added .
EA is n't planning any confrontational tactics with the retail community , with Intat suggesting that stores should ask themselves whether they are eating into their own market by stocking so many pre-owned titles .
" It 's actually also a very interesting discussion to ask how much cannibalisation do you really have on second - hand sales ?
" That 's such a complex subject , we 're not going to be overly confrontational , we 're going to solve it with better , more interesting and online offering going forward - and that should actually solve the whole current dilemma , " concluded Intat .
A full interview with Jens Uwe Intat will be published on GamesIndustry . biz tomorrow .
Mother awarded £ 800,000 after ' six pints of water a day detox diet ' left her brain damaged
A dieter suffered permanent brain damage after being advised to drink six pints of water a day and cut salt intake to lose weight .
Dawn Page , 52 , has been awarded £ 810,000 in damages from her nutritionist , although the practitioner denies fault .
Mother of two Mrs Page , who weighed 12st , became ill within days of taking up the Amazing Hydration Diet .
Brain damaged : Dawn
Page became ill within days of taking up the Amazing Hydration Diet
She had been told by the nutritionist to drink four extra pints of water a day and drastically reduce her salt intake .
The first stage of the regime left her suffering from severe vomiting and stomach cramps , but she was told these were just part of the detoxification process .
She was then told by her nutritionist to increase the amount of water to six pints and consume still less salt .
Days later she suffered a massive epileptic fit and brain damage caused by severe sodium deficiency .
Settlement : Nutritional therapist Barbara Nash
It has left her with ' cognitive deficit ' which affects her memory , concentration and speech and she suffers frequent mood swings .
She has been forced to give up her job as a conference organiser and has relied on her husband Geoff , 54 , for help since going on the diet in 2001 .
Practitioner Barbara Nash , who refers to herself as a ' nutritional therapist and life coach ' , continues to deny any fault following the payout from her insurance company , which was made without mention of liability .
The award was ratified by High Court in London at a hearing on Friday .
Yesterday Mr Page warned others of the dangers of ' fad ' diets .
Speaking from the family home in Faringdon , Oxfordshire , he said : ' She was not obese or even mildly obese , but like a lot of women , Dawn liked to look after her weight .
' She had tried Weight Watchers and calorie control diets .
This was just another potential route for her to lose weight .
Her life has been seriously affected , perhaps ruined , by this fad - type way of losing weight , which I can only say is a
dangerous method of weight loss . '
Mrs Page had paid £ 50 for a consultation with Mrs Nash .
But less than seven days later she was struck down with stomach cramps and sickness .
She contacted the nutritionist about the side effects , but was assured that vomiting was a normal part of the detox programme .
In October 2001 , Mrs Page collapsed at home with a serious epileptic fit and was rushed to hospital in Swindon where doctors diagnosed a shortage of plasma sodium levels .
The salt - rich plasma acts as a protective layer around the brain , but because Mrs Page 's contained such low levels of the mineral , water had entered the brain , causing permanent damage .
Dependent : Dawn Page has relied on husband Geoff since her severe epileptic fit in 2001
Since the fit , she has had to rely on written notes to remember basic instructions , and finds it hard to recall simple information .
Mr Page , a project manager for a packaging company , said : ' Everything 's so difficult for her now .
She can't comprehend what 's being said or relate to what 's going on around her .
' She can't drive , ca n't work , and takes medication every day and will for the rest of her life . '
Mr Page , who launched the six and a half year legal action , added : ' It 's important that people understand how dangerous diets like these are , and not to enter into them without knowing all the dangers . '
Mrs Nash , who is based in Wheatley , Oxfordshire , has a diploma of natural nutrition gained from the College of Natural Nutrition , based in Tiverton , Devon .
She was unavailable to comment last night .
Plexus Law , the firm which represented her in court , released a statement after the hearing , which read : ' We wish to make it clear that all allegations of substandard practice made on behalf of Mrs Page in the litigation have always been and continue to remain firmly denied .
' In our view as a recognition of this , the settlement amount agreed to be paid was less than half of the total amount claimed and the compromise which was offered and accepted was on the basis of no admission of liability . '
Warning on ' Hydration '
Hydration diets are sometimes prescribed to those suffering from fluid retention , which can cause weight gain in the fingers , ankles and legs .
Fluid retention can be caused by the kidneys not working properly and it is thought some nutritionists claim additional water can ‘ kick start ’ the kidneys .
But registered dietician Nigel Denby said : ‘ If hydration ever leads to weight loss , it is simply because the extra water makes you less inclined to eat because you feel full .
Hydration diets do not work .
I have no idea what the reduction of sodium is supposed to achieve , but no qualified professional would recommend this sort of diet . ’
A serious loss of sodium can lead to weakness , dizziness , memory loss and nausea .
If the deficiency becomes severe , the circulatory system can collapse and the body can go into shock , causing fatigue , muscle twitching and fits .

The bar is painted on the floor for Sarah Palin Estimable Newsweek columnist Fareed Zakaria has jumped on the pile :
Can we now admit the obvious ?
Sarah Palin is utterly unqualified to be vice president .
She is a feisty , charismatic politician who has done some good things in Alaska .
But she has never spent a day thinking about any important national or international issue , and this is a hell of a time to start .
... In these times , for John McCain to have chosen this person to be his running mate is fundamentally irresponsible .
McCain says that he always puts country first .
In this important case , it is simply not true .
Zakaria was piqued , as so many have been , by Palin 's flabbergasting performance in an interview with Katie Couric last week , an interview in which she gave such rambling , dim - witted responses to predictable questions that " Saturday Night Live " lifted whole hunks of actual transcript verbatim and inserted them into a parody sketch over the weekend .
Syndicated liberal radio talk - show host Ed Schultz ( heard locally from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on WCPT AM 820 ) has been saying this : Capitol Hill sources are telling me that senior McCain people are more than concerned about Palin .
The campaign has held a mock debate and a mock press conference ; both are being described as " disastrous . "
One senior McCain aide was quoted as saying , " What are we going to do ? "
The McCain people want to move this first debate to some later , undetermined date , possibly never .
People on the inside are saying the Alaska Governor is " clueless . "
( From his Web site )
All of which makes me wonder :
Is it possible that the Couric interview -- so much worse , even , than Palin 's unimpressive interview with Charlie Gibson -- and the supposed leaks to Ed Schultz are part of an audacious attempt to lower the bar down to floor for Palin in her debate Thursday with Democratic vice - presidential candidate Joe Biden ?
Yes , lowering the bar for one 's own candidate is a time - honored political tactic ( or is it a strategy ? ) .
Our candidate does n't really shine in the debate format , whereas our opponent is a veritable forensic champion .
Yet we will do our humble best .
This positions your candidate to " win " the debate simply by exceeding expectations .
And it 's fair to say that expectations for Palin almost could n't be lower .
Her ditzy ramblings have reinforced the image of her as a sparkly naif that the late - night comics have seized on : John McCain wants to suspend his debate with Barack Obama until the economic crisis is over .
And Sarah Palin wants to suspend her debate with Joe Biden until she can find Europe on a map ..... Jay Leno Similarly bar - lowering was the campaign 's decision ( tactic ? strategy ? ) to keep Palin under wraps after Friday night 's debate instead of coming forward , as Joe Biden did , to speak to reporters and declare victory for the running mate .
So now Palin does n't have to do better than Joe Biden on Thursday night to " win . "
She just has to do better than Miss South Carolina did in the Miss Teen USA pageant in 2007 .
Which , of course , she will .
Wo n't she ?
UPDATE -- I 'm going out on a limb here and predicting , at 3 p.m. Monday , that Thursday 's debate will not go on as scheduled , and that this will be the result of some annoucement or decision from the McCain camp .
Palin will cite a need to return to Alaska to help the state cope with the economic crisis or she will say it 's inappropriate to have such a debate when things are so up in the air or she will be ill or she will withdraw from the race to spend more time with her family .
Feel free to come back here and taunt me Thursday night when I 'm proven wrong .
UPDATE TWO -- Poor , poor victimized Sarah Palin : A Voter Asks A Question , And It 's " Gotcha Journalism " ONLINE :
• `If BS were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself . ' ( re. Kathleen Parker column )
• Palin's foreign policy chops James Wolcott on the lowered bar :
It 's the conservative men who are now the most condescending to Palin , treating her gaffes and knowledge gaps as trifles because she brings something fresh and telegenic to the ticket .
Today on Chris Matthews , David Brooks , setting the bar so low for Palin a cricket could hop it , lamely defended her as " smart " and said that if she improved in her debate with Biden , she might rise to the level of " mediocre , " the shruggy wave of his hands indicating that mediocre was enough to pass muster with him .
Over at NRO , that little scamp Mark Steyn , echoing the cry of Let Sarah Be Sarah , conceded that Palin Unfiltered might be Malaprop City , but what the hey : All Governor Palin should insist on ... is that every interview be live .
And , if they 're all disasters , they 'll wind up like Biden 's gaffes or Clinton 's adulteries .
As Stalin remarked in another context , one is a tragedy , a million is a statistic .
Not the choicest analogy .
The Moderate Voice : All [ Palin ] has to do in her debate with Democratic Sen .
Joe Biden is to put in a credible performance and not make any gaffes .
She has been kept away from the press by McCain ’s high command so she already suffers from a bad press due to her inaccessibility .
She has become a comedian ’s punchline .
And she has been lampooned mercilessly by satirists .
If she comes across the debate as being serious , thoughtful and able to respond aggressively with accurate facts to back up her responses , many will consider it a win .
Expectations — and Fey ’s two SNL parodies — have now been set so low that even a blah performance with no major gaffes will allow Palin ’s partisans to proclaim it a home run and Biden in the eyes of public opinion could indeed be overshadowed Jeffrey Goldberg at the Atlantic , com : How can it be that some people still pretend that Sarah Palin is suited for high office ?
This country has never seen someone so comprehensively unprepared for the vice presidency ; Dan Quayle was Metternich by comparison .
I 've watched Sarah Palin 's interview with Katie Couric three times , and my astonishment does not diminish .
Her nonsensical answer about Russia has deservedly been highlighted , but let me focus on another question ... The issue here is not that Palin did n't know the answer .
... The issue here is that she did n't know the question .
Andrew Malcolm at LATimes.com on the lowered bar : [ The Democrats ]
They have so successfully mocked , derided and lowered expectations for Palin in Thursday night 's VP debate that if she does n't drool or speak in tongues , many millions still open to persuasion will be impressed .
Al Gore 's campaign made the exact same mistake going into the 2000 debates .
So all Texas Gov. George W. Bush had to do was not lose .
In that sense , Democrats may have played right into a PR cul - de-sac .
Biden , for instance , described Palin as merely better - looking than him .
A far better communications strategy would have been to insincerely portray Palin with superlatives as a superwoman , making it harder , not easier , for her to impress .
Too late now .
Over at Salon , Joan Walsh lowers the bar still further : Palin " did n't blink " when McCain asked her to join the ticket , did n't think twice , because she 's a supremely self - confident woman with a limited worldview , impressed with her own greatness and not terribly curious about anyone else .
... McCain risked his entire reputation for integrity with his cynical choice of Palin , and he 'll have to live with the consequences .
One consequence is the loss of respect by many journalists who once admired him .
...
Boy , Republicans have to be dreading the Thursday debate , huh ?
... and Rebecca Traister muses on what might have / should have been :
Let 's consider that there are any number of women who could have been John McCain 's running mate -- from Olympia Snowe to Christine Todd Whitman to Kay Bailey Hutchison to Elizabeth Dole to Condoleezza Rice -- who would not have provoked this reaction .
Democrats might well have been repulsed and infuriated by these women 's policy positions .
But we would not have been sitting around worrying about how scared they looked .... [ Palin ] boldly tries to pass off incuriosity and lassitude as regular - people qualities , thereby doing a disservice to all those Americans who also work two jobs and do not come from families that hand out passports and backpacking trips , yet still manage to pick up a paper and read about their government and seek out experience and knowledge ....
When you do n't have enough regard for your country or its politics to cram effectively for the test -- a test that helps determine whether or not you get to run that country and participate in its politics -- I do n't feel bad for you .
Andrew Sullivan makes an important point about the gender issue : Until Sarah Palin agrees to a full and open press conference , she should not even be considered as a possible vice - president of the United States .
What has been going on with her and access to her is an outrage to democratic discourse and the entire electoral system .
Since she was selected , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has held more press conferences with American reporters than she has .
Forget all this debate spin or pre-spin .
Just give her a microphone , a roomful of inquisitive reporters and be done with it .
If she were a man , this would n't even be debatable .
That we are being told these lower standards are acceptable for a woman candidate is sexist cant .
When will the press simply stop cooperating with this farce ? .

The word out , via Howard Kurtz , is that there are two other even worst segments of Palin 's comments in her interview with Katie Couric that CBS chose not to run , apparently under the long - standing journalistic practice of trying to save interviewees from themselves .
This practice I find legitimate to a degree in correcting grammar , in excising libelous statements , omitting statements made while drunk , etc .
Whether CBS was correct to not run those segments would depend on what we hear ( if we ever hear them at all ) .
Posted by : Robert Pruter | Sep 29 , 2008 11:58:17 AM
I was thinking about just this thing the other day .
Especially in light of the " tie - goes - to - the - frontrunner " post - debate analysis that has allowed Obama to claim victory in the first debate vs.
McCain , I say all Palin has to do is show up , stand upright and simply speak coherent English and she could easily be declared the winner .
We 've been led to believe that she is the stupidest person in the history of American politics .
I suspect that , assuming she does n't say something incredibly stupid , Biden is a no-win situation .
Much like Michigan playing Appalachian State in football a couple years back , Biden is expected to win , and win easily .
But the fallout could be disastrous should he be perceived in any way as having lost to a nitwit .
ZORN REPLY -- I think your analysis is fairly spot-on .
I 've yet to see Palin speak in coherent paragraphs when she 's off - script , however .
Posted by : JB | Sep 29 , 2008 12:16:08 PM
Well , the Trib declared McCain the winner of this first presidential debate , despite everything , and I have no doubt in Palin 's ability to be equally dishonest and unlikable .
So will she win ?
No .
Not in a factual sense .
But your paper will say she did .
Posted by : chigal | Sep 29 , 2008 12:27:04 PM
" I 've yet to see Palin speak in coherent paragraphs when she 's off - script , however . " Which is where the SNL skit failed .
Other than when she was quoting the segments lifted verbatim from the Couric interview , the actress who portrayed Palin spoke in complete , grammatical sentences , and thus gave an inaccurate portrayal .
Posted by : jlp | Sep 29 , 2008 12:49:27 PM
The key to the debate will be for either the moderator or Biden to dig beneath the thin veneer of rote memorization that will be the basis of her performance .
She has had plenty of time to memorize some statistics and talking points to certain questions she knows will be on the test , and even someone with her intellectual paucity can do that somewhat convincingly .
It 's when you dig slightly beneath the surface that she implodes .
As anyone who has ever B.S.ed their way through anything knows , your goose is cooked when you 're asked to explain the basis of your statements .
Being able to give simple , concise answers to complicated questions is way harder than it looks .
You need to have a deep understanding of what you 're talking about - an understanding of international and domstic affairs that are the result of years and years of study and analysis , not just a few weeks of cramming .
Given the what we 've seen of her , I can't envision any scenario in which she passes this test .
But it 's really up to Biden and the moderator to not let her get away with parroting rote talking points , and actually probing into the basis for those talking points .
If they do that , I 'm quite certain her performance will be a disaster .
If they just let her blather on without a challenge , given the height of the bar that 's been set for her , it 's possible that she 'll be able to declare victory .
Either way , it 's gripping reality television .
Posted by : tb | Sep 29 , 2008 1:43:50 PM
Eric 's theory is interesting .
I think it 's possible that this was part of a plan to lower expectations and launch a sneak attack on Biden but I doubt it .
The more likely scenario is that she had a couple of bad interviews and now the McCain team is lowering expectations even further by claiming she is n't doing well in mock debates .
The problem with the McCain team is that their strategy of keeping a tight leash on McCain works for him but does n't work for Palin .
McCain is a smart , competent , knowledgeable , and good person but he 's not a nice person .
Keeping a tight leash on him makes sense because it controls his temper and reduces the chance that he 'll anger the base .
Palin is a likeable person and people would forgive a few gaffes here and there .
The problem is that by tightly controlling her message , she sounds like she 's robotically spewing a set of talking points ( because she is ) .
She does n't have experience dealing with handlers like McCain does .
Governors who run for president should talk about national issues in the context of how they addressed similar issues in their state .
Palin is n't doing that because the McCain team is so worried about a gotcha question that they wo n't let her speak freely .
The problem with that strategy is that it 's not natural for her and she looks uncomfortable and incapable of putting together a coherent answer .
I 'm not saying that she 's going to be as smooth as Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton if they let her loose but I 'm sure she wo n't do any worse .
So I 'm with Steyn - let Sarah be Sarah and we 'll see what happens .
ZORN REPLY --
These are n't classic gaffes , though .
A classic gaffe is when McCain talks about the Iraq / Pakistan border , Obama says he 's visited 57 states or Biden says FDR went on TV after the stock market crash to reassure the nation ---- a strange little slippage of the thought gears ... a misstatement ... a garble ... a botch .
No one seriously thinks McCain does n't know there is no such border , that Obama does n't know there are 50 states or that Biden does n't know FDR was n't the president and there was TV when the stock market crashed in 1929 .
Neither are these Kinsleyan gaffes -- named for pundit Michael Kinsley 's memorable one - liner that a gaffe in Washington is when you mistakenly say what you actually believe to be true .
Neither are they mistakes -- such as McCain 's assertion that Ike wrote a letter of resignation before D - Day just in case -- or lies .
They are just weird , parted ramblings in the rhetorical thickets .

I do n't think anyone in this fine country truly believes Sarah Palin is educated enough or bright enough to handle the job that John McCain has chosen her for .
The other real scary thought is What If : john McCain is elected to the nations highest office and shortly thereafter passes away from the stress of the job .
Take a long hard look America , at what we as a nation would be left as a leader of this great nation .
It nauseates me just thinking about it .

Oh wow I just got a flashback to Bush 2000 .
I seem to remember someone saying at the time that after Bush got his clock cleaned by Gore in the first debate , all he needed to do to win the second one was to walk over to the podium without falling on his face .
Also , I recently saw it written somewhere ( forgetting where ) re : Palin that she is like a less - educated , less politically talented George W. Bush .
Now THAT'S some scary stuff right there .
Posted by : Marlissa | Sep 29 , 2008 2:15:14 PM
After hearing the clips from the CBS interview , I honestly felt a little sick to my stomach imagining the debate -- for her and for its reflection on McCain 's legacy as a candidate ( not that he 's helped himself much ) .
Both of them seem like good people , and I do n't think most people are interested in seeing a decent person melt down in public .

Just finished reading a story comparing Palin and Biden : http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/sns-ap-the-veep-debaters,0,1337583.story which suggests that Palin might not be a complete pushover in the debate .
My favorite quote : " " She did such a great job with just the glittering generalities and filling the room with her presence that people did n't care what she said about agriculture , " Halcro says now .
" Palin 's a master at spending 45 seconds telling you what color the sky is , " he adds , " and people will say , ' That 's the greatest thing I ever heard . ' "
Sounds like the McCain campaign might be better off not trying to fill her ( pretty little ) head with facts and figures , as that just makes her sound stunted and unnatural ( as we 've seen a few times now ) .
If they just let her be Sarah , she wo n't say anything , but she just might sound good not saying it .

I saw the Charlie Gibson interview and within three mins said to my wife , " this woman is clueless ! "
I did not see Katie 's interview with Palin but if it's worse than the Gibson interview , she 's in real trouble with Biden .
It wo n't be so much what Palin says but rather how Biden will cut her to shreds for saying what she does say , and therein lies her greatest danger .

We need people who can think and speak coherently .

One has to wonder what other , far more qualified Republican women must be thinking -- what an insult to them .

No , Eisenhower wrote a note to be used in case the D - Day landings failed that stated if there was any blame , it was solely his .
Essentially it was a resignation that was never used for if the landings had failed , he would have been replaced immediately .
One of his aides asked to keep it & saved it for history .
I can't think of one person currently in public life that would do the same .
But to get back to Palin , if she cancels out of the debate , she looks even dumber than now , which means she makes Quayle look like a genius & probably dooms McCain 's candidacy !
ZORN REPLY -- No , Garry .
There is no " essentially " about it , and you can't spin fast enough to make that so .

The analogy of Sarah Palin to Dan Quayle is a good one .
Of course to complete it ( with intellectual honesty ) is to relate Palin now to Quayle circa 1988 .
Then dig for some less politically charged retrospectives on Dan Quayle .
Meaning , what was Dan Quayle really like ?
That fact finding mission might be disappointing .
Unless you think a stand - up father and businessman who has and has had a great marriage and normal kids is sucks .
If so be filled with glee .
In all honesty , I do n't know if all that I do n't know about Sarah Palin is less disconcerting to me than all I do know about Joe Biden .
I sincerely hope neither actually gets to be president .
I do know that much .
And I know that all the anti-Palin theatrics is strictly for entertainment value .
Personally , I 'm not impressed with Sarah Palin OR TIna Fey at this point .
I 'm far less impressed with those who think either is important .
Priorities folks .
They matter .

I was just reading Zakaria 's article on my lunch .
In the same issue of Newsweek , a strategist points out that Biden will have to do his best to not seem condescending in his debate with Palin .
How do you avoid that when the person you 're speaking with has zero experience nor the knowledge of how to cover that up ?
With Biden 's lengthy resume , no matter what , he will seem like he 's talking down to her ... and he will be , albeit unintentionally ( probably ... how could you resist the urge to do it on purpose ?? ) .
Biden runs the real risk of looking like a thug .
A Politico over the " average American " .
Look at the Bush - Gore debates .. and Bush - Kerry debates , for that matter .
Smart talked to Stupid and Stupid got elected ... TWICE !
The funny thing is , Biden might come off looking too cerebral .
I love that .
Like it 's a handicap to have a smart president .
Like that 's a bad thing .
Grrrrrrr .
I hope they do delay the debates .. although I would miss watching the Republican party bleed out .
Any delay and it's obvious to everyone and their dogs that the Republicans are deeply regretting their decision .

Posted by : Tootie | Sep 29 , 2008 4:07:11 PM
McCain can't let Palin resign from the race because , no matter how noble the stated reason is , enough undecideds will know the real reason .
And the conspiracy theorists will immediately begin claiming she was pushed .
McCain can't push her out as it confirms his poor judgment in selecting her in the first place .
[ Of course we know , but he can't be the one who says the elephant is in the room .
He does and he loses . ]
Perhaps they will try a pretext to cancel the debate ( postponing does them no good - it just moves it closer to election day . )
But given McCain tried to reschedule last week , that is n't going to fly very well .
And his staff must realize that his rescheduling attempt contributed to his slipping on the slope last week .
I predict the debate will go on , she will do mediocre to moderate , Biden will trip all over himself not to insult her , and the debate will be considered a wash .
Watch for Biden to be formal ( he will call her " Governor Palin " ) and direct all his attacks at McCain , almost as though she is n't there .
Watch Palin ( in her scripted remarks ) to continually tweak Biden for being a long time DC insider .
She might even intentionally spin in a couple of subtle faslehoods in an attempt to get to him and cause him to go off script .

I guest all you need to be qualified as a Vice - Presidential candidate , is be a democrat and a liberal one at that according to your standards .
What made Hillary Clinton so qualified she is just a Senator .
Is she so qualified because she was married to a President ?
You need to get a life .
Sarah Palin has as much qualifications to be Vice - President as Barrack has to be President .
Here stealing your own words and using them where they fit best .
Barrack is utterly unqualified to be President .
He is a charismatic politician who has done some things in Illinois .
But he has never spent a day thinking about any important national or international issue , and this is a hell of a time to start .
... In these times , for the democrats to have chosen this person to be a Presidential candidate is fundamentally irresponsible .
Democrats want to say that they always put country first .
In this important case , it is simply not true .
Posted by : | Sep 29 , 2008 4:13:49 PM
To the people wondering why McCain chose Palin - on paper , she represented what his campaign needed .
McCain had a choice - he could go with Lieberman ( his first choice ) and appeal to independents and moderates while totally alienating the Fundamentalist Whackjob set that makes up about 35 % of the GOP base .
Or he could go with a Fundamentalist Whackjob Neocon and secure the 35 % F.W. set , while risking alienating independents and moderates .
Because of the overhyped " P.U.M.A. " problem , he thought he could kill two birds with one shotgun - toting Whackjob by getting the Fundamentalists and the resentful Hillary women on board by picking Palin .
He just forgot a little thing that tends to be " left behind " by the Rovian strategy - the person has to actually appear somewhat competent , something Palin is failing miserably at doing .
And I do n't blame her - it 's really , really hard to pretend to know stuff you do n't , especially when that stuff is very complicated and every word you utter is dissected to the molecular level .
It 's a lot of pressure , and very few people are up to the challenge .
I really do n't think she ever had VP or Presidential aspirations , at least not in the short term , but the demographics to which she appeals made her the perfect running mate ( on paper ) for the GOP .
Now of course that speaks volumes about what the GOP has become , but that 's another topic altogether .
Ultimately , she will probably be a large reason McCain loses , which will be all for the better because under no circumstance does he deserve to win .

I 'm paraphrasing , but he said " we need someone who knows what they are talking about "
Then followed with his FDR gaffe .
Add that to his asking a guy in a wheel chair to stand up and claiming that HRC would have been a better VP choice , and multiple charges of plagiarism .

The worst part of all this is that McCain selected Palin as a publicity stunt .
His erratic behavior in this campaign , and his choosing a mannequin as running mate , display just how desperate for a candidate the Republicans have become after the failed administration of the very unpopular George W Bush .
Wait , I was wrong .
The worst part is that it 's still a pretty close race .

Assuming nothing truly serious happens between now and Thursday , I disagree with your prediction .
By " truly serious " I mean real - world serious ( e.g. , terrorist attack , serious illness or death in a candidate 's family , or something else that would be generally accepted as a reason to miss an important business appointment ) , not political - serious .
The one political event I would include is if Palin does , in fact , withdraw .
Very unlikely but possible .
Canceling the debate is all but an admission that she is not up to it .
The Republicans are better off sending her out to take her chances .
Maybe she waffles artfully enough to get away with it .
Maybe Biden says something absurd .
( It is not just conservatives who get worried when a VP candidate starts talking . )
Maybe he is perceived as beating up on her .
As long as Palin does not drool -- and she wo n't because she is a pretty good performer -- the McCain team will be able to flood the news shows with surrogates arguing with a straight face that she won and 30 percent of the country will believe it .
That is a better result than not showing up .
Now that I think of it , Bush did all but drool on a couple of questions in one of the 2004 debates and he still got reelected -- for president .
My prediction is that Palin debates .
My somewhat less confident prediction is that independent post - survey polls show at least 35 percent of people who express an opinion saying that she won .
ZORN REPLY -- I agree with the prediction above that , if she debates , she will come armed with a series of attack points and will try to get Biden off his game , which almost certainly will be NOT to criticize her or get into a back and forth , but to criticize McCain and McCain 's record , and to challenge her on THAT .
It will be his job to respond in a way that seems strong , fair and non-patronizing .... none of this " what Gov. Palin does n't understand " condescending crap that John McCain laid down .
That wo n't work .
And to try to get her to talk away from her memorized debate points as much as possible .
She will appear glazed at times , robotic at others , utterly nasty at others .
She 'll smile ten times more than McCain smiled .
There will be at least a few themes -- words , expressions -- that she repeats more than five times .

Eric , the McCain people do n't need to lower any expectations , as the media and the Democrats have already done that .
It 's disingenuous for liberal democrats and the media to complain that the " bar is too low " when they had a primary role in setting it there .
I read the comments above , and you would think that John McCain put Minnie Pearl on the ticket !
In any event , I do n't understand why Democrats think that attacking Gov. Palin makes any sense .
You guys played this game in the days following the convention , and it did not work .
The problem here is that the Democratic platform is generally not appealing to types of voters Barack needs to attract .
Perhaps Barack should focus on this aspect of his campaign ....

Well , no I think the " attacks " on Palin have been effective and for the most part fair .
Many independents , moderates and even honest Republicans have confessed to me their profound dis-ease with Palin 's place on the ticket .
I doubt that will change any Republican votes , but I also doubt that , in the end , she will attract many moderates or independents .
Those who do end up voting for McCain will do so in spite of Palin , not because of her .
I 'm not complaining that the bar is low , I 'm just pointing it out .

PALIN PRE - DEFEATS BIDEN IN DEBATE !
By planning to show up and not drooling over the moderator , and by not speaking in incoherent gibberish , Palin has already won the VP debate , days before it is to take place .
Asked how she did it , Palin explained that she agreed to memorize a series of 45 - second speeches and deliver them , no matter what the moderator says and no matter what her opponent says .
Because the speeches were carefully written by GOP staffers to be gaffe - free , the media wo n't have any juicy bits of idiocy to quote .
They 'll be reduced to trying to show how her speeches are not connected to the questions being asked in any way .
But that will require a longer attention span than her supporters have , so they 'll run out of the room chanting , Drill , Baby , Drill !

Getting ready for a debate that you are unprepared for is a lot taking the final in a course that you never attended , did n't do the homework and never cracked a book .
You could get lucky , but chances are you wo n't and everyone will learn you are loser .
I 'm betting on Palin looking like the loser she is .

I 'm going to have to go with the McCain - Camp - Postpones - Debate scenario .
I think McCain will cancel Palin 's participation " until an economic rescue bill is passed " or Palin will need to return to Alaska because one of her children is ill , etc .
I believe they will try to buy time and postpone ( or downright cancel ) the debate .
I 'm not sure you can lower the bar enough to make her appear intelligent in this arena .
She may know Alaska , but she certainly does not have a sound view of either the rest of the country , or the world .
That 's more than obvious .

The Republican Party has always had the uncanny ability to make many Americans simply ill at ease and embarrassed .
So often their platforms and " go it alone " attitude are emblematic of the " Ugly American " as seen by those in other countries overseas .
Now , with Sarah Palin , they have taken this self - loathing to a new level by making even many of their own party members uncomfortable and ashamed .
A McCain presidency ?
Probably WORSE than Bush , the world 's most unpopular miserable failure .

Even without gaffes , Joe Biden has his work cut out for him .
Think of how McCain has been criticized for not looking at Obama .
So Biden has to look at Sarah , and project a stern , dismayed yet non-condescending disagreement .
Can he even get away with stern , I wonder ?
But if he plays it too gentlemanly , that 's a condescension in itself .

At this point , both presidential candidates probably wish they could go back and rethink their running mate selections .

I think she will do the debate .
They already tried to postpone ( cancel ? ) the VP debate last week with McCain suggesting that Friday 's debate be canceled and done in place of the VP debate .
For her to not come for any reason now would be too obvious a dodge .
I 've heard two strategies they have for helping her out - one is that if her hair is down , it means they have put a transistor in her ear so someone can feed her the answers .
The other is that she will just roll out snarky comments like in the acceptance speech , no matter if it relates to the question .
We 'll see what happens Thursday eve .

Now that RedEye has gone broadsheet today and been renamed The Chicago Tribune and is called a newspaper , it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Sarah Palin is , in fact , the most qualified person to ever run for the Vice Presidency .
All part of the new reality .
Posted by : JustWondering | Sep 29 , 2008 6:45:35 PM
Add to these questionable tactics the McCain campaign 's tendency to inflate - well okay , lie about - the turnout figures for their rallies .
For example , the Miami Herald on the Sept. 21 Florida rally : " But Palin drew thousands more than the estimated 20,000 people that turned out for Bush .
A fire rescue official estimated the crowd at 25,000 to 30,000 , while the Republican Party of Florida pegged the audience at twice that size . "
Miami Herald Bloomberg on earlier rallies : " Senator John McCain has drawn some of the biggest crowds of his presidential campaign since adding Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to his ticket on Aug. 29 .
Now officials say they can't substantiate the figures McCain 's aides are claiming . "

Funny this is that if you hold what she says against facts , then she admits the republic party is unsophisticated and based on ignorance .
Here 's a transcript from http://www.hayibo.com/articles/view/863
It [ claims against evolution ] has been an argument as sophisticated as our Grand Old Party ...
Here 's the basis of her rejection of evolution :
Our primary argument for Creation and against the communist satanic onslaught of evolution has always been : ' Well I 've never seen a chimp turn into a man ' or ' Show me a gorilla giving birth to a human baby and I 'll believe in evolution '
Let 's find the errors .
First communist and satanic contradict each other .
Second evolution is neither .
Third evolution never says that individual members of a species change their genetic structure to become a member of another species .
Fourth , evolution says the change from one species to another is done gradually through mutations , not one species giving birth to a radically different species .
Her argument demonstrates her ignorance , hatred of science and need to break things she does not want to understand into inaccurate sound bites .
One has to wonder what she 'll do when presented with other facts that do n't fit into her nilhistic world view .

The main thing to remember is that McCain 's judgement in picking Palin , even had he known her and had vetted her appropriately , has to be suspect here .
It 's one thing to think that this 72 year old cancer survivor has a 4 in 5 chance of surviving through his first term as president , but quite another to imagine this complete neophyte , Palin , in the most powerful and influential job on earth should McCain die in office .
It is terrifying .
I think for this running mate selection alone , McCain should be fired as a candidate ( if such a thing were possible ) .

In the " If she shows up and does not gaffe she can win category " , what we need to consider are not just the people who were frightened by the Couric interview .
But the other mass of people who will embrace her no matter what comes out of her mouth , they are not listening for facts or correct content , only delivery , and she does have that part down .
Be wary .

My husband and I have a bet as to whether or not Palin will " be able " to attend the debate .
I think there will be some reason why the event just wo n't happen ; he thinks that would be deadly for the campaign and that the show MUST go on .
We 'll see .
I 've found myself over the last couple of days with a thought that is truly frightening .
Imagine we have another national crisis on a scale with our current economic crisis -- only this time , the president is Palin , who took over the job upon the demise of McCain .
( Do n't worry , this is just a theory and not some kind of plan . )
Or ... Palin is in charge and there is some international crisis , let 's say involving Pakistan , their border region , bin Laden .
You get the idea .

What 's surprising is that ANYONE could see\hear her interviews and not immediately recognize she is totally ignorant of anything beyond her limited experience , and is struggling to cover it up with BS .
But , alas , many of our countrymen view knowledge and intelligence as lower priorities in their candidate of choice than believing the bible literally , being a soccer mom , or several other attibutes some of us might characterize as shallow .
But remember , the debate is about winning over undecided voters .
Biden should not find it difficult to draw her into uncertain territory ( it 's a pretty big space ) , but he ought to inject some definitions of what it takes to be ready to assume the presidency ; maybe we can raise the bar again while she 's trying to crawl over ...

The McCain camp has completely " Bush Doctrined " the Obama camp in choosing Sarah Palin for the vp slot .
Tactical or Strategical error ?
Send in the surge , or the casualties after the October 2nd war will have us loony liberals gloating with glee .
There is a comment here comparing Senator Obama to Governor Palin .
I am not clear on how a comparison can even be made between a Senator with a fairly hefty understanding of foreign policy and an understanding of the diplomatic failures of the Bush administration to a Governor who not only can't convey a complete thought while speaking , but seems to lack a complete thought altogether in that pretty little head of hers .
She does n't even know her own running mate 's positions on foreign policy .
And if she did could she even agree being as she is utterly clueless ?
As for the debate she absolutely better show up unless McCain ( unlike the Bush administration ) can admit he made a mistake .
I will have my popcorn ready .
Posted by : Shannon | Sep 29 , 2008 9:24:00 PM
I 'm not much for political niceties and nuances .
I 'd like to see Biden walk all over Palin and show the world how unprepared she is .
If we are to have women running for the highest offices in the land ( and , indeed , we should ) , they need to be competent to go toe to toe with the opposition and forget about the " sympathy card . "
Hillary lost it emotionally once during her campaign ( probably intentionally ) , but she is a fearsome debater who can easily take on a lightweight like Biden ( as she has ) .
She would never stoop to the level of expecting others to feel sorry for her mistakes .
She would n't be getting cutesy on camera .
She 's a genuine " pit - bull with lipstick . "
She has the level of political intelligence and courage that a woman must have as a top - rank campaigner .
Sarah Palin ?
I 'm sorry .
Probably a really nice lady , mother , wife -- even governor of 650,000 Alaskans .
But at this level , she pales in comparison to Clinton .
Something more like a French poodle with lipstick .
Is she ready to negotiate with sharks like former KGB director Putin ?
Even little piranhas like Kim Jong Il ?
Because if McCain ( God forbid ) has " the big one " in office , that 's what America gets .
I have to believe that the GOP recognized the unlikelihood of a Republican win this round , given the unpopularity of the current administration , and decided not to waste any " good " candidates , presuming they even have any .

Whoever you are , you 're a perfect example of why it's hard to take the " Obama is inexperienced " argument seriously .
He 's a U.S. Senator , he was a professor of Constitutional law , he 's been in politics most of his adult life , and you want us to believe that he 's never spent a day THINKING about any important issue ?
Sheesh .
As for Palin , I think she 's perfectly capable of memorizing enough talking points to get by in the debate , which , as EZ posits , will be enough .
I also disagree with those who dismiss her as a dummy .
Check out Philip Gourevitch 's interview with her in a recent New Yorker ( which , although he never says so , I surmise was conducted before McCain picked her ) .
She comes off as bright enough and surprisingly sympathetic .
Surprising to me , anyway .

You are right about the McCain campaign creating a real or imagined excuse that the Thursday evening debate is off .
It all depends how the " coaches " briefing Palin evaluate how she is doing .
If the stories are true , they are going to bail on her , but each day that goes by , makes the judgment tougher because of the political heat they would take .
Under no circumstances would they put the Sarah Palin interviewed on CBS in a debate with Joe Biden .
If she can reinvent herself over the next 48 hours , then she is on .
If not , her political career is over because the voters in Alaska also are going to be watching and listening very closely to determine if they have been conned or not .
And a word on lowering the bar .
The American people know this is not a time for forgiveness or charity in the political process .
We are in terrible shape as a country , and they are not going to tolerate any nonsense from any candidate .

Why does the Chicago Tribune spend most of its time tut tutting Sarah Palin and examining her city council votes while it has n't once examined Barack Obama 's board chairmanship of a $ 160 million education " reform " grant program in Chicago that was judged to be a failure and whose founder was a domestic terrorist ?
Until Stanley Kurtz showed up , apparently the Tribune did n't even know this part of Obama 's resume existed .

And it 's really , unbelievable in light of this nitwit you apparently are fine with foisting upon the American people as a plausible vice president .
Did you read her response to the question about Democracy and Hamas ?
Dan , if your consulting firm were hiring help and an applicant for a junior position gave you such an answer to a political question , you 'd show her the door .

Here you go Democrats - you can jump all over me .
I 'm a woman who has voted strictly Republican since 9/11 .
I do n't know enough about Sarah Palin yet , and am looking forward to the debates .
That , to me , is the best way to judge our candidates .
Not by watching SNL , or " fake " news a la Comedy Central .
But even if she tanks , I will vote Republican .
I am not a right wing religious fanatic .
I am somewhat liberal when it comes to social issues .
But I really do believe there are evil people out there who want to destroy America .
Obama stating that he would attack Pakistan , who we are TRYING to continue an alliance , shows such a naivete ... THAT is what scares me .
And for those of you bringing race into the conversation ?
The Republicans I know will only vote their ticket .
So that " racist " attitude must be coming from your own party .
Sorry , we can't be blamed for that .

He did n't say he was going to attack Pakistan , Pat , calm down .
He said just what Sarah Palin said the other day , which is just what any top American official would say , whch is that it 's obviously American policy that we 'd attack high - value terrorist targets inside Pakistan with or without the permission of the Pakistani government .
You and your Republican friends seem to think this is some big secret ... we should n't speak the truth , we should n't talk to anyone .
And how 's this been working out for us ?
And how do you think your view on social issues are going to fare if and when McCain / Palin further transform the Supreme Court ?
Posted by : pat | Sep 29 , 2008 10:15:12 PM
I actually concluded this after reading Kathleen Parker 's article and I blogged as much in response to her article .
Of course the goal is to set the bar low .
THAT'S ALWAYS THE GOAL .
Only Democrats think that it 's good for people to go in to a debate thinking their candidate is the best one .
People at home usually decide otherwise , not because the Republican candidate proves himself / herself so much better qualified , but because the Republican candidate delievered a crisp one - liner .
Seriously , look back at Reagan 's performances and you do n't remember facts , only " There you go again " and " Are you better off today than you were 4 years ago ? "
Of course , Carter was right on the facts and , in reality , America WAS better off than it was 4 years prior .
Nixon 's corrupt presidency had almost caused a constitutional crisis .
If you 're old enough to remember , Reagan did n't just magically lift the US out of recession .
That did n't happen until late 1983 , two and a half years in to his first term .
Then he squandered any goodwill with Iran - Contra , again almost causing a constitutional crisis .
But the Democrats let him off the hook , allowing Reagan " plausible deniabilty " rather than put the nation through another impeachment threat .
In the case of Palin , if she just shows up she will have " shown courage and strength and the resolve we need in a leader . "
Biden 's challenge is to keep his answers short and on - point .
The less he talks , the more opportunity he gives for Palin to repeat herself as if she 's trying to remember her lines in a play .

[ [ I guest all you need to be qualified as a Vice - Presidential candidate , is be a democrat and a liberal one at that according to your standards .
What made Hillary Clinton so qualified she is just a Senator .
Is she so qualified because she was married to a President ?
You need to get a life .
Sarah Palin has as much qualifications to be Vice - President as Barack has to be President .
Here stealing your own words and using them where they fit best .
Barack is utterly unqualified to be President .
He is a charismatic politician who has done some things in Illinois .
But he has never spent a day thinking about any important national or international issue , and this is a hell of a time to start .
... In these times , for the democrats to have chosen this person to be a Presidential candidate is fundamentally irresponsible .
Democrats want to say that they always put country first .
In this important case , it is simply not true .
Posted by : | Sep 29 , 2008 4:13:49 PM ] ]
Well , your premise is flawed .
Obama decided to run for president , presumably after having consulted with friends and advisors .
He mounted a successful campaign for the Democratic nomination .
and , also presumably , had been grounding himself in the issues of the day .
Governor palin , on the other hand , has literally been plucked from obscurity .
I think the average American can name , perhaps , five governors from states other than their own , and palin would not have been on that list for illinoisans .
Senator Clinton could have had the nomination , except that she ran a sloppy campaign .
that aside , she obviously had the intention of pursuing the nomination and had paid attention to the necessary issues .
The other thing about Clinton is that had she not sought to tear down Obama , she could possibly have brought some of his supporters into her tent .
This is a funny piece about McCain on the Palin choice .
http://thecahokian.blogspot.com/2008/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-john.html
At the end of the day , a great deal can be inferred from the McCain camp 's decision to keep Palin away from the media .
the repubs always claim media bias .
It 's an amusing tactic , and too often successful .
nonetheless , I think people are beginning to sense that something is awry with this pick .
Posted by : HMFIC | Sep 29 , 2008 10:41:22 PM
We seem to be seeing the two faces of Sarah Palin .
The confident Sarah follows a script and leads the cheers and jeers .
And our initial assumption was that the governor would display a better - than - average level of competence .
However , we 've also seen the " deer in the headlights "
Sarah who emerges when the candidate is in over her head .
Then her persona is the sweet - little - girl Sarah who would not be held responsible for making informed statements or decisions .
And this Sarah speaks gibberish !
On SNL it 's funny ; as a VP choice , funny it 's not !

I predict that she will show up for the debate , goad Biden into some attack on her and , while under attack , she 'll have a Charles Percy - like fainting spell , people will rush to her side in a wild , dramatic scene , she 'll be rushed to a hospital and end up hospitalized ( and unavailable to the press ) through election day ( with occasional , adorable pictures of her recuperating in her hospital bed released to the press ) , Biden will look like a mean old man and McCain / Palin will ride to victory on the negative fallout against the democrats for same .

Are you kidding ?
In the span of less than a week Joe Biden displayed jaw dropping ignorance of American history identifying FDR as the President in 1929 who addressed the nation on television .
I think I knew bettter in the eighth grade as did my classmates .
Biden contradicted Obama on his energy policy , has formerly declared Obama to be too inexperienced to be president and proposed partitioning Iraq into 4 distinct states .
He could screw up a one car funeral .
Clinton and Reagan had absolutely no foreign policy experience when they assumed the presidency .
Reagan is credited with ending the Cold War and Clinton did well .
Its typical of a journalist to put greater weight on how someone says something rather than what they have done .
Palin will be laughing all the way to the White House because she connects with the average American .
ZORN REPLY --
Again , I 'd argue that the FDR mistake was similar to all kinds of little errors that McCain has made -- more brainos than anything else .
I do n't fault him for not being in lockstep with Obama and it's hardly surprising that you can find critiques in the past rhetoric of a primary foe .
Partitioning Iraq may or may not be a workable idea .... ditto , though , with McCain 's big idea of invading the place , toppling its leader , throwing gasoline on the civil / religious tensions there and then trying to enforce Democracy and peace by force with the idea that we 'll be able to step away any time soon and say " victory ! "
Gen .
Petraeus has said over and over that Iraq is not the kind of conflict in which we will be able to declare " victory ! " but ol ' John McCain keeps saying it and taunting Obama for not saying it .
So let 's not anyone get up on his high horse about bad ideas and Iraq .

There are so so many important Supreme Court cases .
After all , the Court sets the law of the United States .
This is a national disgrace .
All of you people that continue to support her , you folks are showing total ignorance and denial .

Just the thought of Palin ever being put into the position of casting a deciding vote in the Senate , should be enough for all of you to look across the water and see if you can see Russia ... because Putin will have to fly over the Alaskan cuckoo 's nest , to get anywhere .
I 'm looking for Marvel Comics to come - up with a sensible " eternity for Palin in Pulp . "
J.K. Rowling could never even write such an unbelievable fictional account of United States Politics , such as John McCain has foisted on us with the Palin VP choice .
What a shame for all concerned .
And the " all concerned " are the US citizens , whether they know it or not .
There should be no hatred for Palin , only pity .
Hatred in political opinion usually always eliminates facts .
We ;ve been given all the verbal and visual facts we need to just say that ... " ... this situation is Pitiful . "
America not only needs a financial Bail - out , it also needs a political Bail - out by removing the Republican VP Candidate from the ticket .

Eric to enlighten Dan and similar posters should have either linked to the Atlantic item on Palin and her utterly clueless response to Hamas winning democratic elections , or explain what happened .
Palin was asked whether she was OK with the fact that Hamas won democratic elections .
Her answer indicated she did not know what Hamas was , that they won elections in the West Bank and Gaza , that she did not know what Gaza was .
She appeared completely ignorant .
On another subject , you banished the comments of another poster for " name calling , " yet you in response to another poster referred to Palin as a ' nitwit . "
I do n't disagree with that sentiment , I just wonder where you are setting the bar on name calling .
ZORN REPLY --
A certain amount of name - calling of public officials is part of the robust debate , and I let it go as long at it 's backed up by some kind of argument .
I 'm much stricter about those who call other posters or me names in the context of attacking an argument or addressing an issue , as these other posters and I are NOT the issue at hand .
If a commenter says " Sarah Palin is a nitwit because ..... " on a post about Sarah Palin that 's different , to my mind , than saying " Robert is a nitwit for criticizing Sarah Palin . "
All that said , I admit that my standards shift with the overall tone of the comment -- if it feels nasty and splenetic , I 'm quicker on the " BLOCK FOREVER " button than I would be if , in the middle of an otherwise thoughtful comment someone crosses what I consider to be the line .
I think of it , in some ways , like a big dinner party at my house .
Lots of points of view are welcome and encouraged , but rank incivility is not .
I hope this makes for a more pleasant reading experience for those who tarry here .
As one who has visited many times and who has disagreed with me strongly on occasion , I think you can attest that this blog frequently presents strong criticism of the host 's point of view .
So it 's not about " censorship . "

The problem with Palin is not the high number of gaffes , it is the low number of non -gaffes .
Ideally one would want to balance the gaffes by pointing to the moments that a candidate has shown some understanding of a major issue .
And that is what Palin lacks , and what her supporters are not in a position to do .
Maybe the Bush doctrine question was unfair , or the Pakistan question ( not clear why , but maybe ) so which of her answers when she was not simply reading of a script provided for her , shows that she understands some issue in foreign policy .
And the same can be said about economic issues .
So despite being the top expert on energy issues in the country , she does n't know how much energy is produced in her home state , but to what compensatory question has she given an answer that shows an understanding of anything ?
My guess is she goes to the debate , she does better than expected , because expectations are so low .
But that is not enough to erase the picture of her as someone unqualified .
Winning the vice presidential debate is not enough to be a major factor in the presidential race .
Bush was not nearly this incompetent in 2000 .
And that was a race about inconsequential things when we were not feeling threatened as a country .
I am surprised there is no Obama / McCain debate thread at Change of Subject .
But it seems clear that they made interestingly different choices .
McCain chose to be a jerk , Obama chose to be a gentleman .
( McCain 's most common line was the condescending " Obama does n't understand " Obama 's was some form of " McCain is right , but " .
McCain actually has a commercial in which he quotes these Obama comments without the " but " as if anyone will miss that a disagreement is coming .
I suspect the model for the VP debate will be similar .
Palin will try to do as many condescending putdowns as possible , since her fanbase seems to see that as a sign of intelligence , and Biden will try to be as gracious as possible .
He does have the tough task of not sounding condescending .
Oddest thing I have seen from Palin though was a clip yesterday of her making fun of Biden for being old .
Did no one point out to her why that might be a short sided line of attack in this particular election .
Posted by : Lon | Sep 30 , 2008 8:50:15 AM
Oh come on .
CBS would absolutely put out anything that would " embarrass " Sarah Palin .
I just do n't see them being so caring and concerned for her that they would " hold back " .
Their editors would do all they could to make her look less than human .
That 's my take on the media .
Yes , I 'm one of " those " that see a serious liberal bias at CBS , NBC , New York Times , even our Tribune , which , by the way , looks more like USA Today than the serious newspaper that it once was .
Not a fan of the new look .
More dumbing down .
Could 've done without the " let 's scare everybody " soup kitchen line photo on the front page .
Um , and I do n't think Sarah will have a fainting spell during the debate .
Sexist ?

I think the Dems are in for a rude awaking with this debate - it 's called an ambush and Barry O and Biden are walking right into it .
I did n't realize that Katie Couric is now the ' know all - be all ' WRT the dynamics of world politics .
Biden gets a pass on TV even existing in 1929 and Ms. Palin gets destroyed because the media does n't understand her answer which contained references to International Maritime Law ( a very complex system unknown to the majority ) and triva questions about McCain 's policies from years ago .
It 's unfortunate that the media would rather personally insult people that do n't share their political opinions vice paying attention to the details of the discussion .
The trouble here is that she 's talking above your heads .
I 'll admit that her responses do not make for good evening news sound bites ( AKA if it does n't fit on a bumper sticker a Democrat can't figure it out ) .
The Chicago Bar " Olde Ale Town " with the nude cartoon like painting is a prime example of how insulting the Dems can be .
As the ' artist ' - which is a huge stretch - used his daughter as the model I am surprised it has n't been twisted into an incest joke ( although had it been a Republican artist it no doubt would have ) .
No doubt the Obama ' Truth Squad ' will fly in if things get too ugly .
Welcome to the ambush , the show 's about to start .
ZORN REPLY --
Let me get this straight , Bob :
The problem is that Sarah Palin has been talking above our heads ?
That 's your take on her desultory rambling answers to obvious and simple questions for any candidate for federal office ?
Posted by : Bob in NC | Sep 30 , 2008 9:19:47 AM
Rambling , no doubt it depends on your political point of view .
Old Joe has done it more than a few times .
And Barry 's qualifications are ?
Zero executive experience other than running for office with a staff of 2500 ... and being present .
Heaven forbid he take a position prior to knowing which way the political winds are blowing .
Again , the show 's about to start .
Thanks for posting my note(s ) .
ZORN REPLY -- Sure .
Calling him " Barry " is very sophisticated and impressive , Bob .
Really makes an excellent point .
Does that go over well in your circle ?
You think independents and moderates find it impressive and funny and persuasive ?

I would encourage everyone to view the movie " Being There " with Peter Sellers and Shirley McLaine .
It clearly depicts what has been going on within the Republican party since Reagan took office .
The candidates for the highest offices in the United States are clueless .
ZORN REPLY -- I 've objected to parallels between this movie and real life in a bi-partisan way and must do so again .
One can disagree with a political figure without implying that they are literally mentally challenged / developmentally disabled as Chance the gardener is in " Being There . "
I do n't think Palin is all that smart , but I think it truly degrades our discourse to suggest , as this does , that she 's on the autism spectrum .

Ca n't you liberals pull out a new playbook ?
We all know the old playbook : all those Repubs ( Reagan , Bush I , Bush II ) are dumb , dumb , dumb , and all those Dems ( Carter , Clinton , Kerry , Gore ) are so smart , only they can recognize the stupidity of the Repubs .
This is a poor election to bring up Quayle - style speaking gaffes , as Obama and Biden have been prolific serial gaffers .
Citing another lib columnist does not establish a fact , by the way .
On the Gibson interview , the big " gotcha " moment on the " Bush Doctrine " was turned back on Gibson effectively by Palin , and backed by Charles Krauthammer ( who coined the " Bush Doctrine " and four separate iterations of it ) .
ZORN REPLY --
Well , no , Steve , Palin had no freakin ' clue what the Bush Doctrine was and her answer was as lame as the answer that the high school gives on an essay exam she did n't study for , akin to : " The Bush Doctrine is one of the more important doctrines of our time , given that it comes from President Bush and the doctrines of presidents are always important .
Doctrines are sets of positions that influence policy , and it's clear that the positions and policies of our president have played a major role in shaping our world .
Among all the doctrines now in the world , it 's safe to say the Bush Doctrine is , if not the most important doctrine then among the top several doctrines that keep America strong and in the forefront of national affairs .
Specifically , I feel the most important aspect of the Bush Doctrine , and the one one that I agree with most and is the aspect that deals with ---" TIME'S UP !

I just noticed that Mr. Zorn calls out posters for use of Senator Obama 's former favorite moniker " Barry " .
I 'll await Mr. Zorn to call Senator Obama out on his irritating debate tactic of failing to use Senator McCain 's title and surname .
It is not presidential ( or proper in a courtroom or presidential debate ) to be condescending by dispensing with titles and surnames .
Obama eventually used McCain 's title and surname as McCain had did for Obama throughout , but in the first half of the debate continually referred to McCain as " John " .
This appeared to be some sort of early and silly tactic by Obama that he eventually abandoned .
Please also publish the liberal rules for referring to Senator Obama .
Barry is out .
Barack is in ?
Barack Obama is OK , but Barack Hussein Obama is not OK ?
Is Barack H. Obama OK ?
I wish to avoid offense in future posts and seek your guidance .
ZORN REPLY --
Oh , poor you , you just do n't understand , do you ?
You call him " Barack " you call him " Barack Obama " you call him " Sen. Obama . "
You do n't throw out his middle name in an attempt to suggest in a bigoted way that there 's something different and scary and foreign about him , even if that 's what you truly believe .
He does n't use his middle name , so why would you ?
Just to be a jerk ?
I thought so .
Obama referred 35 times to " Senator McCain " in the debate , and used that form of address throughout .
He called him " John " just 11 times .
McCain referred to " Senator Obama " 45 times .

Steve , The Palin comment in response to the Bush Doctrine was " In what respect ? "
I assume you can see that while that is consistent with having some knowledge of the Bush Doctrine , it is also consistent with having no knowledge of the Bush Doctrine .
I posed this issue above in general , but as someone who thinks that Palin is being treated unfairly , can you point to some moment in any unscripted interview she has given which actually shows that she has some knowledge of an important issue ?
Obviously if Bob in NC has one I would be as interested .
If he can show how one of Palin 's answers shows an understanding of Maritime law I would be impressed .
( Referring to Maritime law is not itself impressive .
It does have to be a reference that shows some understanding . )
Posted by : Lon | Sep 30 , 2008 10:31:08 AM
C'mon ... Palin was n't a mistake ... and all this handwringing by McCain 's people is just show .
As Rebecca Traister put it , there were plenty of GOP women , even conservatives , like Liddy Dole , Kay Bailey Hutchison , and Condi Rice who McCain could have chosen .
Maybe they said no ?
Maybe they were n't asked ?
Or maybe this is PRECISELY who McCain wanted .
Why ?
Look at it this way .
McCain hates the right , particularly the christian right , of the GOP .
But , he needs their votes and activism .
Also he wants to kill the " Cheney " effect where conservatives run to the VP when they 're unhappy with an Admin policy .
What to do ?
Pick a candidate the Right will love who no one in Congress or the Admin give two cents about , tack on a pretty face and presto !
Sarah Palin !

I 've said it before , and I 'll keep saying it .
" Experience " alone , does not a good president make .
People keep harping on both candidates on their experience or lack thereof .
What about learning how to help the American people ?
What about that ?
What about those who have no health insurance ?
What about those who work and slave to earn a minimum wage that barely pays the bills ?
I find it interesting that no one really talks about that .
It 's all foreign policy and TV gaffs .
No wonder the population has no faith in voting .

I do n't doubt that Palin 's Republican " extreme makeover : vice presidential edition " team are working overtime to make her appear at least small town mayor competent and at most , small state ( population wise ) governor competent with respect to her fluency on national and global issues .
The banana republic style of governing in Alaska is so far removed both geographically and ideologically from our lower 48 ( and the rest of the world ) , the stark shortcomings of former beauty queen , mother of five Palin might be tempered by chauvinistic chivalry and a large dose of pity .
If Palin can remain composed , speak in complete sentences and appear earnest and passionate during the debate , regardless of her desultory train wrecks of thought , she will crowned Miss VP Debate 2008 and deemed ready to lead by her existing base of rabid supporters .
Regardless of her performance , this debate will not alter the outcome of the presidential race .
I am also humbled by history and those 2 terrifying words : Dan Quayle .

From Zorn 's reply : " Obama referred 35 times to " Senator McCain " in the debate , and used that form of address throughout .
He called him " John " just 11 times .
McCain referred to " Senator Obama " 45 times .
( quick counts using search on this transcript " I would add to that that Obama called McCain " John " when he was addressing him directly , as he was supposed to be doing based on the format of the debate .
McCain , on the other hand , never managed to address Obama directly , so his only other option was to refer to " Senator Obama " as if Senator Obama was n't standing 20 feet away .
If you object to such informality on Obama 's part , I will remind you that Obama and McCain have been senatorial colleagues for four years now .
How often to you address your co-workers as Mr. or Ms. ( or any other title ) ?
Posted by : Dienne | Sep 30 , 2008 10:49:06 AM
Eric , how about stepping outside of your liberal echo chamber and read what is being posted on National Review ?
You would find that " The Bush Doctrine " has undergone six revisions and so it was entirely appropriate for Gov. Palin to ask Charlie Gibson for clarification .
I am also sure that if the network anchors deviated from their softball interviews with Sen.
Obama and asked him tough questions about the Annenberg challenge and his raking in the campaign cash from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae while voting against Sen.
McCain 's bill to improve the oversight of these organizations he might have , uh , you know , some trouble actually answering these questions .
Posted by : Scott | Sep 30 , 2008 10:49:40 AM
For anyone who 's a Myers - Briggs Personality Type believer , it appears Palin is an ESFJ , which brings with it the following personality weaknesses : - May be unable to correctly judge what really is for the best
- May become spiteful and extremely intractable in the face of clear logical reasoning .
- May be unable to shrug off feelings that others are not “ good people ” .
- May be unable to acknowledge anything that goes against their certainty about the “ correct ” or “ right ” way to do things
- May attribute their own problems to arbitrary and unprovable notions about the way people “ ought ” to behave .
- May be at a loss when confronted with situations that require basic technical expertise or clear thinking .
- May be oblivious to all but their own viewpoint , valuing their own certainties to the exclusion of others .
- May be unable to understand verbal logic , and quickly cut off other ’s explanations
- May be falsely certain of the true needs and feelings of others .
- May be extremely vulnerable to superstitions , religious cults and media manipulation .
- May react too quickly and too emotionally in a situation better dealt with in a more pragmatic fashion .
Is this the type of person we want leading our country ?

I find referring to another state 's system of government " banana - republic style " at least as objectionable as referring to Barack Obama as " Barry . "
Both are dismissive and condescending , without offering substance of illumination of any issues .
I BELIEVE I read on Saturday -- but did not check -- that Obama called McCain " John " 23 times , and McCain referred to Obama as " Barack " zero times .
I know Jake Tapper referred to it on the ABC site on Saturday , and said he did n't think it would have gone over too well if McCain had called him Barack .
Personally , to me they could have each called each other by their first names just because they ARE colleagues , though not of such long standing as McCain and Biden , and McCain and HRC .
I think Obama should have noted the disparity and adjusted more quickly than he did .

Why did Gov. Palin look attractive as a running mate to Sen. McCain ?
It was because of her record of reform in the Alaska statehouse .
She unseated an incumbent old guard Republican in the primary and did ultimately kill off the " bridge to nowhere " .
Sen .
Obama 's bestest buddy , Sen .
Coburn offered an amendment to redirect the money allocated for the bridge to the post - Katrina rebuilding efforts , but both Sen. Obama and Sen. Biden voted to defeat Sen. Coburn 's amendment .
Add to that , Sen . Obama 's support of Todd Stroger in the general election for Cook County Board President and his complete lack of reform at any level of government , it begs the question , " Where is the change in which we are supposed to believe ? "

Okay maybe Sarah Palin is n't the best candidate for VP but she beats Joe Biden any day .
How does this man get re-elected to office ?
You can almost be guaranteed a cringe - worthy moment any time the man opens his mouth .
Do people ever stop and think if Obama is elected and anything ( hopefully not ) would ever happen to him that Biden would be president ?
We 've certainly had our embarrassments with " Dubya " in office but nothing like you would see if Biden ever succeeded Obama .
If we are n't supposed to accept Palins shortcomings why are democrats so quick to accept Biden 's bumblings ?
After all he is the one with experience but you would n't know it from the way he thinks and acts .
Democrats look at your own VP candidate before you throw stones at glass houses .

Although legitimate , in the context of the presidential controversy , vetting Sarah Palin 's credentials for vice president goes too far as a scapegoat for the argument against Obama - - first term US senator with a law degree and background in Chicago and Illinois politics , he has no executive , national security , or foreign policy credentials ; and generally , in this regard , his campaign image , rhetoric , and politics are criticized as style - over - substance .
The supposed point of comparison with Sarah Palin -- Alaska governor with a background in political science -- rests on the hypothetical but realistic possibility that as vice president she , if called , at a moment 's notice would assume the presidency .
And although readiness is considered , going beyond it to discredit her is unfair : criticism of Mrs. Palin 's foreign policy knowledge ( as an executive she carries national security responsibilities ) aims at revealing possible insufficiency , but when the media interpretation , especially if errantly asserted as fact instead of opinion , rests on the often not impartial judgment of undisclosed Obama advocate - journalists , political motivations distort the analysis .
If Sarah Palin 's foreign policy knowledge is important , all the more important is Obama 's frequently cited " inexperience , " since if elected president he immediately assumes responsibility for national security , executive decision - making , and foreign policy -- War on Terror , distressed trade and economy , NATO relations around the world with aspiring partners like Russia .
If Sarah Palin 's foreign policy knowledge is a measure of her readiness to assume the presidency in a hypothetical situation , Barack Obama 's lack of experience is all the more important if immediately assuming the presidency .
If the " bar is painted on the floor for Sarah Palin , " by similar measures ( the Palin comparison dismisses governing experience for textbook knowledge ) it is a concrete basement foundation for Barack Obama .

I do n't know about Dole , who is currently having difficulty getting reelected to the Senate in a red state , but my impression is that the other women on the list of top republican officeholders are all pro-choice .
I suppose it is an interesting question why so many of the competent women in a pro-life party are pro-choice .
It seems that Hutchinson would have been a formidable vp nominee , and would have done much better with the Hilary voters .
But apparently McCain feared an abandonment from the evangelicals if he went with a pro-choice candidate .
( This may have derailed a Lieberman pick as well ) .
Posted by : Lon | Sep 30 , 2008 1:31:14 PM
Here is my prediction : Sometime before Thursday 's VP debate , Palin will be removed from the ticket , and it will be McCain 's decision .
This will be seen ( spun ? ) as a positive trait in McCain , because it will illustrate both his ability to make difficult but necessary decisions , and his ability to admit mistakes and rectify them , an attribute severely lacking in the Current Occupant , for which he has been rightly criticized .
Then he will stick Lieberman or Ridge in there and move on , the right wing nut jobs be damned .

Unfortunately , most Americans are too stupid to NOT be swayed by Hollywood , the media , and the political parties .
Why do n't you all wait and see how the debate goes ?
Have any of you ever heard of an open mind ??
I can't believe so many people hate this woman when they can't POSSIBLY know much about her , her ideas , OR her intelligence .
She 's only had 3 ( EDITED ) interviews , two of which were deliberately edited to show her in her worst light and the other the opposite .
We are a nation of SHEEP !

First of all , I NEVER delete comments based on the opinion or party or candidate .
I delete them when they cross the line into incivility , and I delete from both sides ( though , given that many of the incivil folks come to attack my point of view , those who are pro-Palin get clipped somewhat more often ) .
I generally leave a marker where I 've deleted a comment so people can at least get a sense of what 's going on .
But not always .
I suspect overall the thousands of people who come to this blog every day lean Democratic , as I do .
Her interviews were not highly edited , and if you want a skewed reason for having an opinion about someone , how about the delirious enthusiasm with which Republicans greeted Palin 's ability to read speeches off a TelePrompTer .
This has given rise to the fiction , I believe , that she 's got real chops on the public stage .
I hear calls for the McCain team to let Sarah be Sarah so she can dazzle `em like she did in St. Paul .
Uh .... she was totally scripted in St. Paul .
And , frankly , she was n't very impressive even when Sean Hannity was lobbing mush balls over the heart of the plate to her .

Biden is going to have to be careful if he goes too rough and he will be reported as “ combative ” , too soft and she will win even bigger .
To her base she will prevail regardless of what she actually says obviously the package is all the matters .
There are some interesting points raised here in regards to what do they really think , guess we will find out .
Second , if you are an Independent or even if you considered this a draw or were leaning towards McCain clearly this choice for VP is such a demonstration in poor judgment that you must now rule the Republicans out .
He picked the least qualified person in the country for quick strategic ratings and demographic / polls hit , ( which is now backfiring ) I would not consider that " Country First " and I am not a liberal .
Moreover , the fact that a grown adult , a Governor has not stood in a room full of reporters since the announcement of her running for the second highest position in our country means only one thing , that she can not stand in a room full of reporters or she already would have .
There own party should throw them out as candidates as an insult to the people .

Independent Voter -
It seems unlikely that the election is actually that close among people who read newspaper blogs .
And it is almost certainly not that close among people who read blogs by liberal columnists .
Self - selection would do plenty to explain the slant here .
Palin 's support is strongest among people who see a conspiracy in the fact that there are no clips of Palin being coherent on a federal matter during an interview .
Posted by : Lon | Sep 30 , 2008 3:47:32 PM
Maybe this is all an act or a setup to trap Joe Biden at the debate .
Maybe Sarah Palin is not dumb as a rock .
I 'm not convinced that any candidate can be that awful .
This would have to be planned weeks ago by a very unimpressive campaign .
It is hard to imagine .
If so , what is the upside ?
If not , then McCain put campaign first and America last .
This is unforgivable .

Hey , if you do n't think Sarah Palin is qualified to be the Vice President , then do n't vote for her .
The amount of screeching coming from the left is amazing .
It seems like you 're actually worried that she and McCain will win .
As for me , I laughed when Obama selected Talkin ' Joe Biden .
Nothing says change for the country like selecting a 35 year veteran of Washington .
His command of foreign policy is breathtaking , so much so that one of his first responses following 9 - 11 was to send a check for $ 200 million to Iran with no strings attached .

-- Co-wrote and passed the so - called " Google For Government " Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act ( S.2590 ) with a Republican senator , the site is at http://www.usaspending.gov/
-- Passed the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief , Security , and Democracy Promotion Act of 2005 ( S.2125 ) which Bush passed in 2006
-- Co-wrote and passed the Lugar - Obama initiative , which expands U.S. cooperation to destroy conventional weapons .
It also expands the State Department 's ability to detect and interdict weapons and materials of mass destruction .

Palin will eat Biden 's lunch .
No contest .
He could n't debate his way out of a wet paper bag .
He 's as boring as brown loafers .
Speaking of brown loafers , Obama will never be president .

Biden does not know who was President in 1929 or when TV was invented .
The press is shamelessly biased toward Obama , who has yet to be looked at even superfisiously .
IMO , she is better experienced to be an executive than Obama who has done zero other than running for President since being elected to the Senate .
ZORN REPLY -- Yeah , and McCain does n't know that Venezuela is n't in the Middle East and Iraq does n't border Pakistan .
Give it rest .

Well , at least our conservative women are worth having fantasies about .
It 's a pain when your liberal broads are Hillary , Pelosi , and the rest of the Congressional lady yahoos .
Ugh , makes me sick thinkin ' about it ...

Liberal commentators are spewing anti-Palin garbage 24 / 7 .
The hatred is bordering on psychotic .
She showed more political courage in several years in Alaska than Obama has his entire career .
She actually stood up to corruption in her own party .
She did n't jointly buy her house with a crook .
While the MSM fly specks her every word , the media in Chicago refuses to examine the Rezko - Jarrett - Davis slum scandal , aided and abetted by Obama , his ties to William Ayers , his stewardship of the failed $ 160 million education grant program , his refusal to turn over HUD - 1 documents related to his house sale , etc. etc. etc .
The biggest scandal in this election is not some phony game of elite media " gotcha , " it 's the massive tank job by the media on behalf of their beloved Barack .
Have you seen the polls ?
The public is laughing at your " impartiality . "
ZORN REPLY --
I thought maybe you , of call people , could distinguish between criticism and " hatred . "
And that you'd have the integrity to admit that McCain is largely a media creation himself , and that Palin is vastly unqualfied to be the vice president .
The non wild - eyed , a category I used to put you in , have acknowledged that but moved on and said , yeah , but I prefer McCain .
Fine .
But this attempt to smear Obama with nonsense -- look at this " jointly buy his house with a crook . "
I wo n't even bother to point out what 's wrong and unfair about that because you know it , Dan .
The polls I 'm seeing have Obama up .

Eric :
Got to say I enjoyed your comments about capitalization to either Bob or poor , was n't clear to me .
I posted a short comment to HuffPost last week , along the lines of " Do spelling and grammar count for nothing anymore ? "
It was ignored .
Maybe no matter what our political opinions may be , we should try to spell correctly , and print real sentences .
Not saying mine are totally correct , but I do try , at 60 anything I try is ok with me .

BBC News , Achham district , western Nepal
The people of the remote terraces and hills are getting hungrier
Rising food prices and destroyed crop harvests are hitting Nepal very hard .
Although few people if any are starving , many are going hungry and the United Nations says several hundred thousand need urgent food assistance .
Most of the hungry are living in remote parts of the mountainous country , inaccessible by road .
In the village of Sokat in what is known as the Far West , I met a destitute family .
' Not enough to eat ' Jamauti Kami blows onto a fire in the dark kitchen of her mud - built house .
She is cooking a meagre lunch for her six children : a bit of rice for the first time in three days , with a leaf vegetable .
People can't survive by eating mud
Dharma Singh Saud
Her husband is far away in India , looking for work .
He left so there would be more food for the family and to bring money home .
The children were crying this morning , Jamauti said - still hungry from the night before .
" There 's not enough to eat , " she says starkly , her three - year - old daughter Tara nestled by her legs .
That prompts Tara to ask when she can eat .
" Yesterday morning the children shared one roti and in the evening another roti , a leftover , " Jamauti said .
" That was all they had .
They ate and then slept .
I did n't cook for myself because we 've only a little flour left , so I 'm hungry now . "
Once the food is cooked , it does n't last long .
The ravenous children wolf it down .
When the incessant rain finally stops , Jamauti leads me through the crumbling , muddy paths to her tiny terrace of farmland .
In the ever - shifting cloud , she does a bit of weeding and shows me one reason the family are suffering .
Disease " There was no rain so my winter wheat crop was ruined , " she says .
People have meagre resources to eke out a living " Later it grew a little but then it was destroyed by hail .
I have n't harvested any wheat for two or three years .
She shows me the paddy she is now growing on the same patch .
Some of the blades are yellowish - green and pockmarked , something Jamauti says is caused by a pest spreading a disease .
" I 'm afraid it will be ruined too . "
In Sokat and much of western Nepal many low - caste people like Jamauti struggle to survive .
Children have torn clothes .
Some have distended bellies .
The rains beat down , especially at night , and the air cracks to the sound of thunder .
Too much rain is as damaging as too little .
The countryside looks lush now - but that is deceptive .
This is the hungriest time of year .
A long dry spell has just ended and the newly planted crops wo n't be ready for months .
With centuries of toil , families have still managed to carve out the terraces in these densely populated hills .
They have been subdivided many times .
' No control '
So even if the yield is good , home - grown crops will only feed a poor family for one or two months a year .
There are many mouths to feed and not enough food to go round
So they must buy food - but at a price .
The nearest roadside village and market is Chaukhutte , a collection of iron shacks more than four hours ' walk from Sokat .
Sacks of rice from the plains are unloaded from trucks and into a store room .
The people buying it , mostly women , face a long slog back to their villages carrying the heavy , 50kg bags .
It has rocketed in price .
" Last year it cost me 800 or 900 rupees ( $ 13 ) says one woman , Jhakri Parki , who has come from Sokat with friends .
" Now it 's 1,400 rupees ( $ 20 ) .
But we have to buy it to save our own lives and our children 's lives .
We take it on credit .
We 'll pay after three or four months , when we have the money . "
The price of rice has risen by at least 50 % in a year ; that of cooking oil by 30 % in six months .
Shopkeepers like Dharma Singh Saud say they are sorry but they have no control over it .
More and more people in the village are becoming destitute " Everyone around here is affected , " he says .
" People with the right connections can get credit or help from their relatives .
But others are selling their pots and pans , or jewellery , just to survive .
People can't survive by eating mud . "
There are many things that push up the food prices .
This year India banned most rice exports .
China has for months closed the the Nepal - Tibet border , which has undermined supply networks in the high Himalayas .
And like other countries , Nepal recently had to raise diesel and petrol prices sharply .
The scarcity of fuel here is also caused by the oil corporation 's massive debts to its supplier .
All this increases food prices and makes the poor poorer .
The UN's World Food Programme ( WFP ) believes two and a half million Nepalis around the country need immediate food assistance .
In certain villages it runs some feeding programmes , including monthly ones to mothers and young babies , extended in conjunction with medical check - ups by doctors .
These have helped reduce malnutrition .
But the ruggedness of the terrain means the WFP is constantly having to assess the places of greatest need - laborious and time - consuming work .
The people of these remote terraces and hills are suffering .
They are getting hungrier .

What are these ?
ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) 
Turkey ’s interior minister said Saturday that several suspects had been arrested in last week ’s bombings in Istanbul that killed 17 people , and he blamed the separatist Kurdistan Workers ’
Party for the blasts .
“ Our judgment is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist terror group , ” said Interior Minister Besir Atalay .
He declined to say how many people had been arrested .
Officials had said they suspected that the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party , known as the P.K.K. for its initials in Kurdish , was behind the attacks .
The party has denied involvement .
Seriously .
You ’ll thank me later .
What do I mean , exactly ?
Well , let ’s say you ’re working on a small Rails team .
You decide to start using test / spec .
Be dee dee .
As usual , you gem install test - spec then Pistonize the plugin .
You start writing specs and begin converting existing tests to specs .
You ’re on a tear .
Nothing can stop you .
Behavior is king .
You commit your changes .
You break the build .
What ?
Why ?
Well , all your new specs depend on the test - spec gem , a gem your comrades and continuous integration builder do not have .
Quickly : fix it !
Tell everyone to install the gem locally .
Install the gem on your staging server .
Carefully install the gem on your production server .
Phew .
Everyone ’s got the same version , right ?
Right .
Well , maybe .
( At least the build works . )
See , there ’s something wrong with this scenario : it ’s not very DRY .
Why should only our code be DRY ?
Why not our environment , too ?
It should be .
The solution we ’ve come up with is to throw every Ruby dependency in vendor .
Everything .
Savvy ?
Everyone is always on the same page : we do n’t have to worry about who has what version of which gem .
( we know )
We do n’t have to worry about getting everyone to update a gem .
( we just do it once )
We do n’t have to worry about breaking the build with our libraries .
( we leave that up to the internet entrepreneurs )
Adding Depended Sees
test - spec
vendor
$ ls - 1 vendor / bin data gems plugins rails
Alright , alright , let ’s see how we ’d vendor thegem .
First , thedirectory :
We obviously added a few directories , namely gems , data , and bin .
The rails and plugins directories should be familiar , one hopes .
vendor / gems
$ ls - 1 vendor / gems / RedCloth - 3.0.4 RubyInline -3.6.2 crypt-1.1.4 image_science -1.1.1 memcache-client-1.3.0 session - 2.4.0 sphinx-0.9.7-rc2
cd
gem unpack
test - spec
$ gem unpack test - spec Unpacked gem : ' test-spec-0.3.0 '
Let ’s focus on the thedirectory :
We ’llin there and then use the handycommand to , erm , unpack the contents of ourgem :
Cool .
Now we need to dive into our config / environment.rb file to ensure Rails knows to look in vendor / gems / test - spec - 0.3.0 / lib when we try to require ‘ test / spec ’ .
It ’s easier than you think .
Add this to your Rails : : Initializer.run block :
config .
load_paths += Dir [ " #{RAILS_ROOT} /vendor / gems /** " ]. map do | dir | File .
directory ?
( lib = " # {dir} / lib " ) ? lib : dir end
Now all the libraries in vendor / gems will automatically be included in your load path , complete with a lib check for libraries like RubyInline and crypt ( which do n’t come with lib directories ) .
Want to only include some libraries in a specific environment ?
Maybe you do n’t want RubyInline or image_science in development mode .
Put this under the above snippet o’ code :
if %w ( development test ) . include ?
RAILS_ENV config .
load_paths .
delete_if { | f | f =~ / RubyInline|image_science / } end
Good to go .
It should be noted that this trick will not auto - require the gems for you .
You still need to do that in your config file , or in your gems , or wherever .
Maybe with a line like % w ( crypt / blowfish redcloth ) .
each { |f| require f } in your config / environment.rb if it pleases you .
Other Approaches
For one , Dr Nic has something cool : this patch .
It lets you run tasks from within vendor / gems right from your RAILS_ROOT .
Nifty .
He ’s also got his gemsonrails plugin which is a similar ( but different ) approach than we illustrate here .
Jay Fields has his own method for autoloading gems in vendor .
Worth a look , and a listen .
Classic Railer topfunky , back in the day , rolled a rake task to scratch the same itch .
Then there ’s this thread on Rails - Core about adding some kinda gemy - ness to Core which , unfortunately , has n’t yet transpired .
The gem in question , the one to metaly manage other gems , lives in technoweenie ’s repository .
I even do this ( for better or worse ) with cache_fu , btw .
I am starting to really like not being dependent on the environment .
All Set !
The goal here is simple : always get everyone , especially your production environment , on the same page .
You do n’t want to guess at which gems everyone does and does not have .
Right .
There ’s another point lurking subtlety in the background : once all your gems are under version control , you can ( probably ) get your app up and running at any point of its existence without fuss .
You can also see , quite easily , which versions of what gems you were using when .
A real history .
Longannet in Fife is one of Scottish Power 's two coal - fired power stations A coal - supply deal worth up to £ 700 m has been announced which is believed to be the biggest ever in Scotland .
The five - year agreement between Scottish Power and Scottish Coal will mean the creation of more than 100 jobs .
It was described by First Minister Alex Salmond as a " declaration of faith " in coal as a fuel source .
A significant proportion of Scottish Power 's supply requirements will be met under the deal .
It will be worth up to £ 700 m , depending on the amount of coal needed .
Ignacio Galan , chairman and chief executive of Scottish Power 's parent firm , Iberdrola , discussed the deal with Mr Salmond on Wednesday and also met Finance Secretary John Swinney .
Mr Galan said : " Through this agreement , Scottish Power is also demonstrating its support for Scottish coal , offering important opportunities for Scottish jobs and the Scottish economy , while reinforcing our commitment to coal generation in Scotland . "
' Protect workforce '
Mr Salmond said he met with Mr Galan on the day he became first minister on a trip to Longannet to discuss the firm 's plans for coal .
He described the deal as " a declaration of faith in coal " and said it " shows that coal is a fuel of the future and not the past " .
The coal is expected to come from reserves in Fife , the Lothians , Lanarkshire and Ayrshire .
The firm currently mines in nine separate sites spread across the central belt of Scotland .
Scottish Power uses between four and six million tonnes of coal per year at two coal - fired stations , Longannet in Fife and Cockenzie in East Lothian .
Brian Staples , deputy chairman of Scottish Resources Group which owns Scottish Coal , said the deal would protect the current workforce and create more than 100 new jobs .

What are these ?
Want to save gas ?
Do what the professionals do .
Make the right choice .
Literally .
If you want to squeeze the most out of each gallon of gasoline , turn right whenever possible .
UPS drivers have been doing it for several years and they say the savings are substantial .
" UPS drivers are trained to map their routes to turn right whenever possible , " UPS spokeswoman Kristen Petrella said in a telephone interview .
" It saves fuel and reduces emissions by minimizing the length of time our trucks are idling .
And it 's safer too , because you do n't have to cross traffic . "
With left turns more time is spent idling while waiting for oncoming traffic , and right - on - red regulations also help save fuel .
Petrella said UPS managers used to drive around to find the routes with the most right turns .
Now they have a combination of not just experience but computers , codes , and programs that allow them to plot out right - turn routes in seconds .
Petrella said the company estimates that in 2007 the company saved 3.1 million gallons of fuel , and avoided discharging 32,000 metric tons of emissions into the air by turning right whenever possible .
" Our drivers are so accustomed to driving right , they say it 's difficult for them to turn left when they 're off duty , " she added .
This may suit you to a T
It 's going to take more than just turning right to take the sting out of prices at the pump .
If you 're wondering how much you 'll save by leaving the car in the garage and taking public transportation , check out the " transit calculator " at the MBTA 's website , mbta.com .
You can plug in your car 's miles per gallon , the price of gas , length of commute , and parking cost , and it will calculate your yearly commuting costs .
Then compare it with what it would cost to take the T .
Congestion ahead
Commuters on Interstate 495 can expect more company in the coming years , according to a study released last month .
For the past two years , the I -495 Study Committee composed of representatives of the Executive Office of Transportation , the North Middlesex Council of Governments ( representing Lowell area cities and towns ) , and the Merrimack Valley Planning Commission has been examining congestion along the 40 - mile stretch of highway from Westford to Salisbury .
A study conducted for the group predicted that by 2030 , there will be another 20,000 cars per day clogging the already congested road .
The group is examining a number of alternatives to relieve congestion along the corridor , including widening the highway .

In the second decade of the twentieth century , it was almost impossible to build an airplane in the United States .
That was the result of a chaotic legal battle among the dozens of companies — including one owned by Orville Wright — that held patents on the various components that made a plane go .
No one could manufacture aircraft without fear of being hauled into court .
The First World War got the industry started again , because Congress realized that something needed to be done to get planes in the air .
It created a “ patent pool , ” putting all the aircraft patents under the control of a new association and letting manufacturers license them for a fee .
Had Congress not stepped in , we might still be flying around in blimps .
Illustration by Marc Rosenthal
The situation that grounded the U.S. aircraft industry is an example of what the Columbia law professor Michael Heller , in his new book , “ The Gridlock Economy , ” calls the “ anticommons . ”
We hear a lot about the “ tragedy of the commons ” : if a valuable asset ( a grazing field , say ) is held in common , each individual will try to exploit as much of it as possible .
Villagers will send all their cows out to graze at the same time , and soon the field will be useless .
When there ’s no ownership , the pursuit of individual self - interest can make everyone worse off .
But Heller shows that having too much ownership creates its own problems .
If too many people own individual parts of a valuable asset , it ’s easy to end up with gridlock , since any one person can simply veto the use of the asset .
The commons leads to overuse and destruction ; the anticommons leads to underuse and waste .
In the cultural sphere , ever tighter restrictions on copyright and fair use limit artists ’ abilities to sample and build on older works of art .
In biotechnology , the explosion of patenting over the past twenty - five years — particularly efforts to patent things like gene fragments — may be retarding drug development , by making it hard to create a new drug without licensing myriad previous patents .
Even divided land ownership can have unforeseen consequences .
Wind power , for instance , could reliably supply up to twenty per cent of America ’s energy needs — but only if new transmission lines were built , allowing the efficient movement of power from the places where it ’s generated to the places where it ’s consumed .
Do n’t count on that happening anytime soon .
Most of the land that the grid would pass through is owned by individuals , and nobody wants power lines running through his back yard .
The point is n’t that private property is a bad thing , or that the state should be able to run roughshod over the rights of individual owners .
Property rights ( including patents ) are essential to economic growth , providing incentives to innovate and invest .
But property rights need to be limited to be effective .
The more we divide common resources like science and culture into small , fenced - off lots , Heller shows , the more difficult we make it for people to do business and to build something new .
Innovation , investment , and growth end up being stifled .
Opportunities forgone are n’t always easy to see .
The effects of overuse are generally unmistakable — you ca n’t miss the empty nets of fishing boats working overfished oceans , or the scrub that covers an overgrazed field .
But the effects of underuse created by too much ownership are often invisible .
They ’re mainly things that do n’t happen : inventions that do n’t get made , useful drugs that never get to market .
In theory , one should be able to break a gridlock by striking a deal that would leave all sides better off .
Sometimes that happens .
Just the other week , for instance , Nokia and Qualcomm settled a three - year - long patent battle , which could accelerate the spread of third - generation cell - phone technology here and in Europe .
In a less contentious fashion , products like the DVD player quickly became mainstream and affordable because many companies worked together to form patent pools .
Even the fact that there ’s music on the radio is the result of songwriters ’ collectively allowing two main groups , ASCAP and BMI , to handle the licensing of their songs to radio stations .
One reason deals founder is that there are simply too many interested parties .
If , in order to create a new drug , you have to strike bargains with thirty or forty other companies , it ’s easy to decide that the price is too high .
But often things go awry because owners wo n’t make a deal at a reasonable price , as with America ’s nascent aircraft industry .
Or take a problem that bedevils the oil - and - gas industry .
When different companies own adjacent patches of an oil field , each will be tempted not only to drill its own patch but also to try to suck out the resources of its neighbor ’s patch .
For geological reasons , overdrilling actually reduces the total amount of oil you can get out of the field — all sides end up worse off .
An obvious solution is to have one company do the drilling and share the revenues with the other players .
But , as the economics professor Gary Libecap has shown in a historical analysis , such agreements are often reached only belatedly , if ever .
Recent experimental work by the psychologist Sven Vanneste and the legal scholar Ben Depoorter helps explain why .
When something you own is necessary to the success of a venture , even if its contribution is small , you ’ll tend to ask for an amount close to the full value of the venture .
And since everyone in your position also thinks he deserves a huge sum , the venture quickly becomes unviable .
So the next time we start handing out new ownership rights — whether via patents or copyright or privatization schemes — we ’d better try to weigh all the good things that wo n’t happen as a result .
Otherwise , we wo n’t know what we ’ve been missing . ♦
" Think of it as WiFi on steroids , " says Phil Gossett , software engineer for Google .
" The obvious application for this spectrum is for Internet connectivity , everywhere all the time . "
Gossett is talking about the potential that unlicensed use of " white space " could offer consumers , and he 's talking about it in a YouTube video on Google 's new Web site : freetheairwaves.com .
The site is clearly an attempt to frame the white space cause in lay person 's terms .
" Remember that fuzzy static between channels on the old TVs ? " Freetheairwaves.com 's home page asks .
" Today more than three - quarters of those radio airwaves , or ' white space ' spectrum are completely unused . "
Letting consumers tune into that vacant spectrum to send and pick up broadband could spark a " revolution , " Google says , fostering " universal wireless Internet . "
Made public this morning , Freetheairwaves ( .com or .org ) also represents Google 's bid to lift the debate over unlicensed broadband from the nasty ditch in which it currently wallows .
The Federal Communications Commission has just completed a month of tests on unlicensed device applications , especially testing whether they 'll interfere with wireless microphones at a Broadway play and a football game .
Every one of these demos was followed by press releases from warring industry players who insisted that the latest tryout succeeded or failed — depending on whether they use or make wireless mics , or want to use or make unlicensed broadband applications .
So a goal of the site is to avoid " getting really deep into the weeds " on the technical side of the issue , as Google 's Dan Martin put it in an interview with Ars .
The FAQ page emphasizes that the technology to prevent interference exists .
Beyond that , freetheairwaves.com focuses on unlicensed broadband 's potential : making it more available to schools , public safety providers , and rural / low income areas .
Google 's dedicated YouTube page includes testimony from Matthew Rantanen , Director of Technology for the Tribal Digital Village , which provides high speed WiFi access to all Native American communities in San Diego County , California , and three tribes in nearby Riverside .
The big ISPs , Rantanen says , provide no service to these areas , " so we took it upon ourselves to take advantage of that and go get it ourselves . "
But while WiFi is a start , Rantanen explains , it only goes so far in these rural regions : " We need bigger pipe , " he says .
" White space opens that up .
It drops the cost of end - user equipment .
It increases the ability of us to broadcast , to not have intermediate repeating towers , to support going through a grove of trees . "
Visitors can submit their own YouTube videos to freetheairwaves.com .
They can sign a petition to the FCC , which may make a decision relatively soon as to whether to allow unlicensed broadband devices .
But while Google does n't say it in any of freetheairwaves .
com 's promotional literature , the search engine giant is obviously sensitive to the charge that it 's running a phony consumer " astroturf " campaign , and is up front about its objectives in this fight .
" There 's clearly a business interest for Google in this , " Google 's Martin told Ars .
" Because expanded access to the Internet hopefully means more users using Google .
And more users using Google means more people hopefully clicking on the ads . "
That said , the company has identified an array of groups and individuals who have various pro-white - space agendas that parallel Google's .
Other YouTube videos feature statements from Inez Gonzalez of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , Joshua Breitbart of New York City 's People 's Production House , Tessie Guillermo of Zero Divide , and Columbia University professor Tim Wu .
" We 're not pretending to speak for people , " Martin says .
" But we do think that once Americans learn more about the issue , they 'll agree with us . "
The same group of researchers that published a paper last February detailing how their team hacked into and recovered data from a group of supposedly secure laptops have now released the source code to the programs they used in their " cold boot " experiment .
Such software could be useful to any law enforcement agency looking to take advantage of the group 's research , as well as to any security vendor attempting to plug the hole .
We covered the initial announcement of the exploit in some detail back in February , but I 'll summarize it here .
Contrary to popular belief , the data stored within a computer 's RAM chips is not immediately lost when the system powers down , but instead fades slowly over a period of seconds .
This dissipation period can be substantially extended by cooling the DIMMs — repeatedly spraying the DIMMs with inverted cans of air resulted in just one percent of data degrading after 10 minutes .
The team demonstrated that it was possible to remove a DIMM from one computer , transport it to a second unit , boot that unit using a specially designed microkernel , and then dump all data on the RAM chip to physical disk .
The amount of bad ( decayed ) data depended on both the time a DIMM spent unpowered and the temperature at which it was kept , but the group was able to successfully reconstruct 128 - bit AES encryption keys within seconds , even if 10 percent of the key had already decayed out of memory .
The team 's paper ( PDF ) notes several ways the danger from this type of attack might be mitigated , but there appears to be no simple remedy at this time .
The nature of the attack requires physical access to the system in question , but the growing popularity of laptops makes this less of an issue than it might be otherwise .
Once physical access has been obtained , the hack itself can be performed in mere minutes .
Let 's try not to read too much into this one .
Here are the facts : two dweebs thought it would be a good idea to hook up treadmills to their PCs , don brightly - colored wigs and cardboard swords , and race their avatars across about a mile of virtual turf by jogging in place with only a modicum of coordination and zero athletic ability .
The folks at Mana Energy Potion were complicit in the event , which failed to prove treadmill gaming is a good idea , but made great strides in proving just how low World of Warcraft addiction has brought certain members of our society .
Video is after the break , we recommend you look away .

Marco Peereboom ( marco@ ) has just completed a major step in rewriting the metadata component of the software raid stack in OpenBSD ( softraid ( 4 ) ) , and he needs your help to test it sufficiently so it will make the next release .
Update ( Sat Jul 12 2008 , 18:13:00 CEST ) : As pointed out by Lawrence Teo ( thanks ! )
Marco has posted a new version of the diff here .
Marco explains the diff :
This is a full rewrite of the metadata code .
This change does several things :
1. Eliminate bad checksums being caused by power failures or crashes
2. Unravel metadata code so that we can support multiple formats
3. Clean up name space
4. Merge thib 's ( thib@ ) pool diff
The missing portion right now is autoassemble .
I 'll work on that when this is in good enough shape to go in .
Even though I am not aware of any bugs at this point I suspect that something silly might have snuck in .

Editor 's note : Glenn Beck is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET and also hosts a conservative national radio talk show .
Glenn
Beck says he wo n't vote for Obama but may not vote for McCain , either .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A lot of people do n't believe it , but the truth is that I really do n't know whom I 'm going to vote for this November .
It wo n't be Barack Obama -- he and I simply disagree on too many fundamental issues -- but it also may not be John McCain .
As much as the media and the analysts try to pigeon - hole people as having only one political ideology , the fact is that most people ( at least , most " real " people ) , do n't fit neatly into one predetermined set of political beliefs .
I 'm no exception .
Although I am a " conservative , " I 'm not a " Republican , " and there 's a big difference .
A true Republican , or a true Democrat , is someone who puts their party above their principles and their candidate above their conscience .
But most of us ( or at least those of us who live outside the Beltway ) are n't like that .
We 're more like the mad scientist Frankenstein :
We 'd like to take a piece of this candidate , a touch of that one and a little slice of the one over there , mash it all together and create someone who 's lines up perfectly with our values and beliefs .
Which brings me back to John McCain .
Like Obama , McCain and I have fundamental differences on a host of important issues .
Sure , I disagree with him less than I do with Obama , but is that really the standard we should use in choosing their candidate ?
Our country is n't a reality show where we simply elect whoever 's left after all the backstabbing and lying is finished .
Is it ?
On my radio program , I talk a lot about voting for your values .
But as time goes by , we all tend to get buried in the minutiae of campaigns and lose sight of those things .
Day after day , the media and analysts feed us stories that line us up against each other like armies getting ready for battle .
Standing in the middle is n't an option , so people tend to take a side , even if they do n't feel completely comfortable there .
The only way out of that trap is to try to define what it is you really stand for and believe in .
After all , how can you say that Obama or McCain reflects your values if you do n't even know what those values are ?
Chances are that your definition will slant heavily to the values advertised by one of the parties .
That 's fine , but keep in mind that just because a party says they stand for something does n't mean it 's true .
After all , the Republicans said they stood for smaller government , but the size of our government grew enormously under a Republican president and a Republican majority in Congress .
Democrats said they stood for an end to the war in Iraq , but for better or worse , nearly two years after taking over Congress , they do n't even have a timetable for withdrawal .
My point is that actions speak louder than words .
The " R " and the " D " do n't matter if the people we elect do n't follow through on their promises .
So what are my core values , the things that I refuse to compromise on ?
To figure that out , I decided to try to define what I think a conservative really believes .
A conservative believes that our inalienable rights do not include housing , healthcare or Hummers .
A conservative believes that our inalienable rights DO include the pursuit of happiness .
That means it is guaranteed to no one .
A conservative believes that those who pursue happiness and find it have a right to not be penalized for that success .
A conservative believes that there are no protections against the hardship and heartache of failure .
We believe that the right to fail is just as important as the chance to succeed and that those who do fail learn essential lessons that will help them the next time around .
A conservative believes in personal responsibility and accepts the consequences for his or her words and actions .
A conservative believes that real compassion can't be found in any government program .
A conservative believes that each of us has a duty to take care of our neighbors .
It was private individuals , companies and congregations that sent water , blankets and supplies to New Orleans far before the government ever set foot there .
A conservative believes that family is the cornerstone of our society and that people have a right to manage their family any way they see fit , so long as it's not criminal .
We are far more attuned to our family 's needs than some faceless , soulless government program .
A conservative believes that people have a right to worship the God of their understanding .
We also believe that people do not have the right to jam their version of God ( or no God ) down anybody else 's throat .
A conservative believes that people go to the movies to be entertained and to church to be preached to , not the other way around .
A conservative believes that debt creates unhealthy relationships .
Everyone , from the government on down , should live within their means and strive for financial independence .
A conservative believes that a child 's education is the responsibility of the parents , not the government .
A conservative believes that every human being has a right to life , from conception to death .
A conservative believes in the smallest government you can get without anarchy .
We know our history :
The larger a government gets , the harder it will fall .
Those are the things a conservative believes in , and they 're the things that I believe in .
Now , if only I could find a candidate to match .

CSIRO scientist discovers natural ' invisible ' gold
The search for these natural but ' invisible ' nanoparticles is important .
If they can be proved to exist , the knowledge will help give us a deeper understanding of how gold can be transported and deposited by geological processes , and therefore help explorers to find new gold deposits in Australia .
Now , hard evidence that gold nanoparticles have finally been seen in nature is presented in a paper published in GEOLOGY and authored by CSIRO Scientists from the Minerals Down Under National Research Flagship and CRC LEME , in collaboration with scientists from Curtin University and the University of Western Australia .
Lead author , CSIRO 's Dr Rob Hough , explains that the particles were discovered in Western Australia .
" In the southern areas of the State , groundwater is very salty and acidic .
This water dissolves primary gold and re-deposits it as pure gold crystals on fracture surfaces and in open pore spaces , " he says .
" On investigation of these crystals , there appeared to be a dark band across them .
However , high magnification imaging showed the band was in fact , a mass of gold nanoparticles and nanoplates .
These are identical to those being manufactured in laboratories around the world for their unique properties . "
Clays from the fracture surface were then analysed .
There was no gold visible , but analysis showed the clays contained up to 59 parts - per-million of gold .
The research team concluded that the nanoparticles of gold they had imaged represented the ' invisible ' gold in the clay , and that this nanosized gold was common in similar environments .
" The gold nanoparticles have not been identified earlier because they are transparent to electron beams and effectively invisible , " Dr Hough says .
" However , they are probably a common form of gold in this type of natural environment worldwide , where saline water interacts with gold deposits .
They also provide the first direct observation of the nanoscale mobility of gold during weathering . "
With gold fetching around ( AU ) $ 950 an ounce and expected to rise , this research is good news for Australia 's gold explorers .
Playing Full
Throttle is like tasting a rich bowl of roadhouse chili filled to the rim with biker gangs , chick mechanics ( covered in engine grease too ) , and truckers with badass tattoos .
An action packed , comical ( albeit short ) , animated graphical adventure set in the backdrop of an apocalyptic future , Full Throttle touches on the subculture of motorcycle gangs and their steel horses .
It is also a story about Ben , a renegade biker who lives and dies by his own rules .
Ben 's voice ( played by the late Roy Conrad ) is every bit as gravelly as the Old Mine Road where he does battle .
In this alternate world , cars hover , transport trucks are armored , and desolate towns like Melonweed are sinking fast into the sand .
It is a land with many strange locales and even stranger inhabitants .
Released by LucasArts with much fanfare , Full Throttle was an instant hit among critics .
Over time , the game grew to become a cult classic and developed a huge fan base .
Yet , behind the success of Full Throttle was a detracted story of developer heartbreak .
Since the game 's initial release , LucasArts had twice attempted to develop a sequel for the game , but both ended as abruptly as they began .
Very little was known about these sequels behind the scenes , except for their names — Full Throttle : Payback and Full Throttle : Hell on Wheels .
This is the story about the rise and fall of Full Throttle .
Bill Tiller
There was , however , a single person who could lift the veil of secrecy over this sad story : Bill Tiller — who , from 1993 to 2001 , worked at LucasArts and was a member of development team for Full Throttle : Payback ( which he also affectionately called Full Throttle 2 ) .
Much to our surprise , we were granted a rare opportunity to interview him about these events , where he spoke to us candidly about the truth behind the failed development of the Full Throttle sequels .
He even granted us access to many artworks , most of which were previously unpublished , that he had created for the project years ago .
So check out our gallery of concept art from Full Throttle : Payback sent to us by Bill Tiller himself !
Full Throttle
The population is greatly decreased
And now the odds are greatly increased
That I may someday get a chance
To kiss your lips
I thank the Lo-o - ord each day
For the apocalypse - Increased Chances ( by Chitlins , Whiskey & Skirt )
Full throttle was originally released for DOS in 1995 .
The game was packaged in a beautifully illustrated box , with the lead character Ben on his Corley motorcycle riding out of an explosion and the subtext “ A Heavy Metal Adventure ” appearing beneath the main title .
As with other LucasArts games of the time , a number of special box set editions were released for retail sale .
A limited edition box set included an additional mini-strategy guide by Jo Ashburn , and an even rarer bandanna edition included a real bandanna bearing the Polecats insignia .
The original box set included 1 CD ( in a case ) , a LucasArts catalog , a registration card , a troubleshooting card , a mail - in questionnaire , and a demo CD for other LucasArts games .
A version of the game for the MAC was released later in 1996 , and a jewel case version for Windows was released finally in 2001 .
Full Throttle was built using a specially tweaked version ( v7 ) of the SCUMM ( Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion ) engine .
The game also incorporated the IMUSE ( Interactive MUsic Stream Engine ) system to synchronize ambient music with in - game actions and the INSANE ( INteractive Streaming ANimation Engine ) system to compress in - game moving images to optimize full screen playback .
Because of the game 's use of cartoonish graphics , INSANE 's rendered environments had to be scaled down to maintain continuity of the vehicles that were then separately rendered and animated .
This way , the engine was able to maintain visual parity for all the graphics in the game .
Full Throttle was the 10th game to use the SCUMM engine .
The development team read like a dream list of the greatest game designers , artists , and programmers ever worked at LucasArts — lead designer Tim Schafer ( other credits included Monkey Island , Grim Fandango , Psychonauts ) , lead artist Peter Chan ( other credits included Sam & Max Hit the Road , Maniac Mansion : Day of the Tentacle , The Dig ) , lead animator Larry Ahern ( other credits included Maniac Mansion : Day of the Tentacle , The Curse of Monkey Island ) , and lead programmer Stephen Shaw ( other credits included The Dig , Outlaws ) .
Some of them would eventually worked on the failed sequels years later .
The game starts with an introductory cut scene showing Malcolm Corley , President and CEO of Corley Motors ( the last manufacturer of motorcycles in the country ) , and his Vice President Adrian Ripburger ( voiced brilliantly by Mark Hamill ) riding down Highway 9 in a hover limo .
A biker gang suddenly passes by , and the gang 's leader ostensibly rides his bike over the top of Corley 's limo .
Rather than being annoyed , Corley is quite impressed by the bikers ' rebellious demeanor and decides to seek out the gang 's leader .
To the eccentric owner , Corley Motorcycles represents more than just lifeless machines but a way of life , and who better to show off this ideal to the company 's shareholders than real hardcore Corley bikers .
Corley follows the gang to a local biker bar called the Kick Stand , puts on a mean face , walks into the bar , and asks , " Which one of you ran over my car ? "
He spots Ben , who immediately dawns a guilty look on his face .
Just as Ben and Corley are putting aside their quarrel to enjoy a few drinks together , Ripburger enters the bar and insults the gang by trying to hire them as petty thugs .
Ben commands Ripburger to step outside to settle their differences , but once outside , Ripburger tells Ben about Corley 's failing health and asks Ben again if he and the Polecats are willing to escort Corley to the shareholders meeting .
When Ben again refuses , he is knocked out by Ripburger 's thugs and left for ruins in a dumpster .
This is where the game begins .
Full Throttle employs a novel combination of third person and first person perspective gameplay that is unlike any previous LucasArts game .
To speak to another character , you select from a list of fixed responses ( usually 4 of them at a time ) for Ben from a third person view .
When you need to fight , however , the camera automatically switches to a first person view with Ben behind riding the bike .
When he drives up to an opposing gang , the camera again changes to a third person view looking from the front of the bike .
A small fist icon then appears in the bottom left of the screen .
This is the weapon selection interface , where you can access all of Ben 's weapons in his arsenal .
To change weapons , you simply click with the right mouse button .
The more fights you get into , the more weapons you will accumulate .
Full Throttle also introduces a new graphical verb coin interface which is used to guide Ben 's actions .
You interact with a puzzle by accessing the new action menu with the left mouse button ( all the while you can listen to Ben 's endless reticule over the object or character in front of him ) .
The menu resembles an animated skull tattoo and has several icons to depict the different functions ( an eye , a mouth , a fist , and a boot ) .
The inventory menu is accessed by clicking the right mouse button .
Both menus can be accessed seamlessly at anytime during the game .
In addition , the menu allows you to save your game at anytime ( and anywhere ) by hitting F1 , unless Ben is on the Old Mine Road .
With Full Throttle , LucasArts has created a cast of biker characters that are both colorful and original .
There are the Polecats ( a moral gang of bikers led by Ben ) , the Rottwheelers ( a brutal gang of petty thugs ) , the Vultures ( a tough gang with biker women ) , and the Cavefish ( a deadly gang of nearly blind bikers ) .
The story shifts into high gear when Ben embarks on his quest to save his gang and Corley Motors , and only then does the story noticeably take on a more humorous lighter comedic tone .
The tension between Ben and Maureen is particularly well played and shows off a softer side of Ben 's personality .
The game is very short and can be completed in just a few hours of play .
Most of the puzzles are quite easy to solve and are utilized mainly to complement the storytelling .
However , a few puzzles impose unnecessary time limits that exist solely to extend the game through repetition .
Still , the overall gameplay is so all encompassing that it is easy to forgive the game 's few minor flaws .
Full Throttle : Payback
Understandably , the development of Full Throttle : Payback had been a sore subject for many workers at LucasArts .
In fact , it was not until almost a decade later that those who had been involved in designing the game were willing to speak out about the ill - fated project .
While LucasArts had never released an official statement regarding the cancellation of this sequel , it was eventually revealed that all development on the game had completely ceased by 2000 .
Bill Tiller was named as the Art Director , and Larry Ahern was named as the Project Leader .
Larry Ahern had previously worked as a lead on Full Throttle , making him an excellent candidate to assume responsibility for the franchise .
According to Larry Ahern ( whom we also contacted ) , the project was only officially known by the working title Full Throttle 2 , but the name Full Throttle : Payback had been suggested and seemed to have become its title after the fact , if for no other reason than to differentiate its development from the others .
By this time , Tim Schafer had already left LucasArts and was not involved in the project .
It was unclear how turbulent within LucasArts was during the game 's early development .
It was known , however , that both Larry Ahern and Bill Tiller left LucasArts in 2001 in great frustration about the project , so it was conceivable that the game was already in jeopardy long before that time .
We asked Bill Tiller to compare the production environment of today to that of the past when he was still at LucasArts during the early preproduction phase of the project .
He said ,
" I did n't work on the first Full Throttle beyond training Gordon Baker , the special effects animator on Full Throttle , how to use dpaint animator .
But the biggest difference in the development environment between when I worked on * FT2 Payback * and now is that we had a lot more time for preproduction than we did now .
Seems like publishers really want the developers to hit the road pretty quick , which can be a good thing sometimes .
If you 're given too much time , sometimes it gives you too much time to second guess your initial decisions , which may actually have been correct .
Nowadays you have to make decisions fast , so that is where having a lot of experience in game development really pays off .
Plus , you are forced to get right into production , which is more fun than waiting around . "
The internal feedback within LucasArts towards the sequel was generally positive early on , as he recalled ,
" When we first starting working on the sequel , we got a lot of positive feedback from other people inside the company , especially the marketing department , because we used their conference room a lot to do brain storming and we left the sketches we had done on the marker board for the next day , so the marketing people would come in and give us positive feedback of the ideas we left up the day before .
It 's always a good idea to get marketing on your side early , and this was sort of a serendipitous way of doing just that . "
However , there was always an exception , as he went on to explain ,
" One bummer thing that happened was that one of the big mucky mucks in management was reviewing the game design and said they did n't like it .
When pressed for more specific criticism , this person pointed out that the Cave Fish gang , saying that the " Cone fish " - which is what this person called them - did n't belong in the Full Throttle franchise .
This person was criticizing the game design without clearly having played the first game !
That was a bummer . "
The storyline for Full Throttle : Payback was never officially made public , though it was widely rumored that its descendant would form the basis for the storyline for Full Throttle : Hell on Wheels .
This was refuted by Bill Tiller , who instead told us a synopsis of the original story pitched for the sequel ,
" The story line we wanted to be similar in them to FT1 , so it revolved around a large corporation and the territorial governor concocting a plot to replace all paved highways with hover pads to help make the hover mini vans and family hover cars safer and faster .
Of course , this plan did n't sit well with the bikers and truckers , who were going to unit to fight this plot at a rally .
The evil governor had secretly hired the Rotwheelers to assassinate Father Torque , the leader of this new alliance at the rally .
Ben is in hiding , after being hounded by the media incessantly after he was acquitted of Ripburger 's murder , a charge trumped up by the governor because Ripburger was part of their plot .
So the first half the game Ben tries to stop the assassination , and the second half he teams up with a persistent undercover female reporter to bring the governor down and uncover his nefarious secret .
The story would include a bunch of new locations in that area : a abandoned power plant , a ruin freeway under construction , a dam , a train , a gated community , the territorial capital , the capitol building , a refinery , a police station , a new motel / bar , the cave fish colony and grave yard , and even a hippie commune .
I thought it was going to capture the feel of the first game yet expand upon the milieu . "
Sadly , despite the early positive progress , production of the sequel did not proceed far , as he vividly remembered ,
" I started work on FT Payback in the Spring of 2000 and was off the project by November .
We got as far as detailing out about 25 % of the levels and doing about 40 % of the preproduction art , and we had just started on the 3D character models when it was canceled . "
We then asked him to explain , in retrospect , why the project fell apart in the end and what the circumstances were that led to his own decision to leave LucasArts .
He replied ,
" My opinion is that there existed some major difference of opinion between the team and a particularly influential person , who did n't like the direction we were going .
And in the end those differences could not be resolved .
So in the end instead of a team that had worked on Full Throttle 1 working on the sequel , LucasArts went with a team that had n't worked on the first game instead .
And again , in my opinion , that was a mistake .
After that I just happened to have gotten two calls from two ex LucasArts friends of mine to come work on Guild Wars and EA 's Two Towers game .
So I decided that it may be time to leave - nine years is a long time at any one company it was time to learn about developing games at other companies .
So that is why I left .
LucasArts is a great company to work for and I never regret working there .
It was awesome .
Though I may not agree with them always , I still respect them and have great memories of the place , so I easily say ' Thanks George !
It was a load of fun . ' "
Full Throttle : Hell on Wheels
By contrast , much more was known about the official but canceled sequel Full Throttle : Hell on Wheels .
In mid 2002 , LucasArts announced the development of a sequel to Full Throttle for the PC , PlayStation 2 , and Xbox .
This was the first time that the franchise would appear on the consoles .
Simon Jeffery , then president of LucasArts , said in a press release ,
" Full Throttle is one of LucasArts ' greatest and most beloved original games .
We can't think of a better brand or character to lead LucasArts ' charge into a new era of original game development .
Ben so perfectly symbolizes our legacy and yet has just the right mix of attitude and edge to appeal to a new generation of game players . "
Details about the highly anticipated sequel emerged quickly .
It was to be a 3D action adventure game .
This time , Sean Clark was named as the Project Lead .
Unlike Larry
Ahern , he had not worked on Full Throttle previously , though he was ready to make the critical transition in genre for the franchise .
The game was in full development over the ensuing months , to the extent that both a trailer and a hands - on demo were revealed for the first time at the 2003 E3 ( Electronic Entertainment Expo ) .
Bill Tiller , who was not involved in the development of this sequel , was surprised that Sean Clark had agreed to take on the project .
He said ,
" To be honest , I was surprised Sean wanted to do FT2 because , while working on The Dig , he did n't seem all that impressed with FT1 .
A friend of mine always had that impression of his opinion of FT1 , so I do n't think it was just to me that he expressed his pessimistic view .
So you can see why I was surprised when he took the job . "
In Full Throttle : Hell on Wheels , Ben discovers that the roads of his old stomping ground , El Nada , have been mysteriously dug up and destroyed .
His pursuit leads to the discovery of a rival gang called the Hound Dogs , whom he believes to be responsible for the wreckage .
However , Ben also uncovers a more sinister and murderous plot that is in operation .
In the end , Ben agrees to join forces with his old friend and mentor Father Torque and his ex-love Maureen , in order to foil the hideous plans of a nefarious villain and protect the freedom of the open road .
The gameplay in Full Throttle : Hell on Wheels is to be changed dramatically from the original .
The game will be more action than adventure oriented .
Whenever Ben engages in a fight , the game is switched to an action mode where you can control his actions by pressing on an attack button in rhythm to generate combo attacks .
A power meter dictates how powerful Ben 's throws will be against his enemies .
During a melee combat , you pick up nearby objects , such as chains , chairs , bottles , and even pool cues and use them as weapons .
About 40 weapons are expected in the game .
Ben can even switch motorcycles with Mo to ride on an old cargo blimp .
The game will be played over 35 levels set in around 20 different environments , including the old Kick Stand biker bar from the original game .
Little was known about the reasons behind the cancellation of the project .
In late 2003 , only a few months after the game 's debut showing at E3 , LucasArts abruptly announced that Full Throttle : Hell on Wheels had been canceled .
Simon Jeffery responded to the press only with a brief statement ,
" We do not want to disappoint the many fans of Full Throttle , and hope everyone can understand how committed we are to delivering the best - quality gaming experience that we possibly can . "
No further explanation was officially given by LucasArts .
The cancellation took both fans and critics by surprise .
Rumors surfaced that LucasArts was unhappy about the graphical look of the game , especially when compared to other 3D adventure games in development at the time .
The lack of involvement of Tim Schafer in the sequel might have also irked many diehard fans in the adventure game community , attracting too much unwanted negative publicity .
Lastly , Roy Conrad , who did the original voiceover for Ben , had died in 2002 , so that his role had to be recast for the sequel .
When we asked Bill Tiller that , judging from what he saw in the promotional materials released by LucasArts , how much of Full Throttle : Hell on Wheels he could recognize as having been recycled from Full Throttle : Payback , he replied ,
" I do n't think any of it was used to be honest .
I think the new team had a completely different idea and direction they wanted to go in , so I do n't think any of what we did was in FT Hell on Wheels .
I talked to some people who worked on that game but I never got a lot of story details , but I did n't really ask .
I had kind of gotten the whole thing out of my system so I was n't too interested in the game design details .
I was more interested how the game went so far down the road to being finished when the plug was pulled .
I hate wasted time art and effort so I was pretty shocked by that .
Usually publishers release games even if they are n't happy with them to try and recoup some of the money they spent on it , so I was surprised Lucas had n't done the same . "
The future of Full Throttle
With LucasArts ' focus now firmly away from the adventure genre , it is unlikely that another sequel of Full Throttle will ever be developed as a pure adventure game .
The twice failure of developing a sequel as an action adventure also means that the chance of another hybrid sequel is minimal .
Furthermore , given that most members of the original development team for Full Throttle are no longer working at LucasArts , any new project related to this franchise will be led by someone at the company who has not played a major role in the development of the original game title .
It may be true that the third time is a charm , but in the case of Full Throttle , this is more likely an exception than the rule .
After two prereleases and a lot of bugfixing , we are proud to announce a new release of the 1.4 branch : 1.4.20 is finally out .
We would like to thank everybody who tested the prereleases and / or reported bugs in our ticket system .
Please pay special attention to the security announcements :

( Natural News ) Drinking as little as 10 ounces of coffee per day may double a pregnant woman 's risk of miscarriage , according to a new study conducted by Kaiser Permanente researchers and published in the Researchers interviewed 1,063 pregnant women , including 102 who had already suffered a miscarriage , about their caffeine intake .
The median length of pregnancy for the women at the time of interview was 71 days .
Another 70 women miscarried before the end of their pregnancies , bringing the total to 172 , or about 16 percent - a fairly normal miscarriage rate .
Women who said that they never drank caffeine had a 12.5 percent chance of miscarriage , while women who reported drinking 200 milligrams or more of caffeine per day had a 24.5 percent miscarriage rate .
This represented nearly twice the miscarriage risk of the non-caffeine drinkers .
The effects of caffeine on miscarriage remained even after researchers adjusted for other risk factors , including age and smoking habits .
Previously , some researchers have suggested that a connection between caffeine intake and miscarriage rate is illusory , and is caused instead by the fact that women who experience morning sickness tend to have healthier pregnancies due to hormonal changes in the body .
Because women with morning sickness are less likely to drink caffeine , it then appears that reducing caffeine intake reduces miscarriage risk .
But the current study found that the association between caffeine and miscarriage remained strong even after adjusting for different rates of morning sickness .
Lead author De-Kun
Li recommended that pregnant women give up caffeine for at least the first three to four months of pregnancy .
" If , for whatever reason , they really can't do it , think of cutting to one cup or switching to decaf , " Li said .
" Stopping caffeine really does n't have any downside .
" Two hundred milligrams of caffeine is approximately the amount found in 10 ounces of coffee or 25 ounces of tea .
The reform restricts the use of the government 's so - called parliamentary " nuclear " option , which currently allows it to push through legislation without a debate .
The President will now be required to inform parliament of any troop deployment overseas , and to win parliamentary backing for any such deployment lasting more than four months .
You can spot Dawn Wynne at the grocery store .
She ’s one of those conscientious label readers busy studying cans , bottles and jars in aisle after aisle .
But it ’s not calories , sodium or preservatives she is looking for .
She is on patrol for high fructose corn syrup ; it ’s an unadvertised part of sauces , cereal , candy and especially soda , and she wants none of it .
The Redondo Beach resident looks for foods sweetened with “ pure cane sugar , honey or fruit juice . ”
Wynne believes “ they are healthier and break down in the body more easily . ”
Consumers -- at the grocery store and restaurants -- are increasingly demanding sodas and other products sweetened with sugar , not corn syrup .

The trend is so strong that the Corn Refiners Assn. has launched a major marketing campaign and Internet site , www.sweetsurprise.com, to defend the sweetener .
They are battling signs like the one saying , “ Get Real ! . . . No High Fructose Corn Syrup ” that faced the parking lot at the Jamba Juice shop in Seal Beach on Thursday .
High fructose corn syrup has become a favorite target of the health - conscious as an alleged cause of America ’s obesity boom .
A typical 2 - liter bottle of soda contains 15 ounces of corn syrup , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Whether it ’s really at fault is open to debate .
The Corn Refiners Assn. contends that high fructose corn syrup is just as natural as table sugar and honey .
Others say it ’s not natural at all , because it is manufactured through a chemical process and does not occur in nature by itself .
The Center for Science in the Public Interest called the corn refiners ’ campaign “ deceptive . ”
Most medical research says it is the calories , rather than the sweetener , that make a difference to a person ’s health .
And sugar and high fructose corn syrup have identical calorie counts .

“ Our message is that people should cut down on both , ” said CSPI Director Michael Jacobson .
Likewise , the American Dental Assn. says sugar is equally bad for teeth regardless of whether it comes from corn or cane .
The Corn Refiners Assn. is reacting to a steady slide in sales of high fructose corn sweetener .
“ We have been very concerned about the misunderstanding of our product in the marketplace and want to provide the facts so that consumers can make their choices based on science rather than urban myth .
HFCS and sugar are treated by the body the same , they contain the same calories , and nutritionally are no different , ” said Audrae Erickson , president of the Corn Refiners Assn .
Even so , so many consumers have become wary of corn sweeteners that smaller drink makers such as Hansen , Jones and Thomas Kemper have reformulated their sodas to use cane sugar .

Taco Bell and other fast - food chains have added sugar - sweetened beverages as alternatives to their corn sweetener - laden soft drink menu .
Meanwhile , U.S. sales of Coca - Cola Classic made with corn sweetener fell 5.5 % last year , according to the Beverage Industry 2008 Soft Drink Report .
Sprite dropped 9.2 % , Pepsi-Cola was down 8.9 % and Mountain Dew declined 3.1 %
The growing popularity of bottled water and other drinks is one reason for the decline of sweet carbonated drinks .
But shoppers say drinks made with sugar cane just taste better .
“ It has a crisper flavor , not as cloying .
I think it is a better - flavored drink , ” said Charlie Howell , who periodically finds cane - sugar - sweetened Coca - Cola imported from Mexico at the Costco in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles .

The shift in consumer taste and uncertainty about high fructose corn sweetener is apparent to John Nese , owner of the Galco ’s Soda Pop Shop , a 10,000 - square - foot soft drink emporium in Highland Park .
“ Our sales are up 20 % . ”
“ There ’s just a lot more awareness about high fructose corn syrup among the public , and once people taste a soda flavored with cane sugar they like it better , ” he said .
Nese sells 500 different soft drinks , including cane - sugar Coca - Cola , Dad ’s root beer and Nesbitt ’s orange soda , an 80 - year - old Los Angeles brand .
His Coke comes from Mexico through a third - party supplier .
Mexican bottlers still use cane sugar because the crop is plentiful in Latin America .
They also do not have to contend with U.S. trade barriers that drive up the price of cane sugar imports .

Soda makers are also reacting to the trend .
Hansen abandoned corn syrup last year , when a third of the calls to its customer service center were from consumers objecting to the sweetener , said Gregg Arends , vice president of marketing for Corona - based Hansen Natural Corp .
Natural foods retailers had complained about the same issue for years , and some threatened “ to kick Hansen ’s out , ” Arends said .
It took the beverage company the better part of a year to make the switch because of the difficulty in reformulating the drinks to maintain the same flavor profiles .
It ’s only been in the last few months that the cane sugar soda has been widely distributed .
Most research about the nation ’s collective fatness blames calorie intake and couch potato sloth , rather than any sweetener .
Some scientific research points to adverse health effects from fructose , a type of sugar that makes up 55 % of the sweetener in soft drinks with corn syrup .
Although chemically different , cane sugar is half - fructose .

Whether that extra shot of fructose is any worse than identically caloric soda pop made with cane sugar is n’t clear , said Dr. Peter Havel , a UC Davis nutrition expert who is launching a National Institutes of Health study that will look at the effects of fructose .
“ This is really an area that needs further study , ” Havel said .
Still , angst over high fructose corn syrup has taken a toll on the business .
Annual per-capita consumption of the sweetener in the United States peaked at 63.7 pounds in 1999 .
But it has dropped steadily since then and stood at 56.3 pounds in 2007 , 12 % off its peak .
That ’s the lowest consumption level since 1994 .

Cane sugar consumption also has dropped during the period , but by a smaller 6 % and now is at 62.1 pounds .
Beverage makers started the switch to high fructose corn syrup in the 1980s because it ’s less expensive than sugar , decays less quickly , and is easier to transport and mix into formulas .
Even with the recent increase in corn prices , it is still less expensive to use corn syrup than sugar .
The big beverage makers are n’t likely to spend money on retooling to go back to sugar , said beverage consultant Tom Pirko .
Some shoppers say they do n’t want to consume the sweetener but do n’t have time to worry about it .

“ I ’m aware that edibles would be healthier -- and probably taste more natural -- without the addition of corn syrup or that high fructose junk , ” said Michele Mooney of Van Nuys .
“ But I do n’t look for that ingredient when I purchase foods mostly because the labels are too long , the ingredients too numerous , the print too small and the chemicals too frightening . ”

CNS News
August 8 , 2008
The ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee said the U.S. government is headed toward bankruptcy if it stays on its current fiscal course .
“ We know that for a fact , ” Rep. Paul Ryan ( R - Wis. ) told CNSNews.com in a video interview .
“ All the actuaries , all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government , are predicting this . ”
To back up this claim , Ryan cited an estimate by the non-partisan Government Accountability Office that says the government faces a $ 53 - trillion shortfall to cover the costs of promised benefits in its entitlement programs .
“ They say we are $ 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the American people , in today ’s dollars , ” said Ryan .
“ Meaning that if we want to keep the promises of Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security , which are basically the three major entitlement programs , today we would have to set aside $ 53 trillion dollars and invest them at Treasury rates in order to do it , ” he said .
Ryan said that to deal with this situation the government must either reform the entitlement programs or eventually impose massive tax increases on American workers .
“ For the last 40 years , the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in America at 18.3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government , ” said Ryan .
“ By the time my three children – who are three , five and six years old — are my age , the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in America just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time , ” he said .
Ryan asked the Congressional Budget Office to determine what the tax rates would need to be to cover federal spending at that level .
“ What they told me was really startling , ” said Ryan .
“ They said that the current low rate , the 10 - percent bracket for low - income Americans , would have to go up to 25 percent .
The middle - income tax rate for middle - income Americans would have to go up to 66 percent , and the top rate , which is what small businesses pay , would have to go to 88 percent .
“ Those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem , ” he said .
“ And if you did that , all experts conclude , you would literally crash the American economy . ”
Ryan portrayed the long - term budget crisis he believes the country is now facing as a generational challenge .
“ The legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off , ” said Ryan .
“ In the past , we brought down the Iron Curtain and won the Cold War .
We got through World War I .
We got through World War II .
We won the war on the Great Depression .
“ The problem that we have right now — putting foreign policy aside and our fight with Islamic radicalism — is that we have an economic crisis , we have a fiscal crisis , and , that is , we will bankrupt this country , and the best century in America will be the last century , ” he added .
“ Unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt , and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path , the next generation will have inferior living standards , ” said Ryan .
Ryan and his Budget Committee staff have developed a comprehensive plan for reforming federal taxing - and - spending policies that they believe will restore long - term solvency to the federal government .
Entitled “ A Roadmap for America ’s Future : A Plan to Solve America ’s Long - Term Fiscal and Economic Crisis , ” the plan has been introduced as legislation ( H.R. 6110 ) in the current Congress .

AT the end of a five - hour drive along the Interstates of New England and into an out - of - the - way corner of Portland , Me. , past a Hannaford ’s Supermarket and into an anonymous - looking industrial park , alongside businesses with names like North Atlantic Scaffolding and Lynox Cleaning Systems , it was the sweet smell that hit us first .
We were just inside the front office of the D. L. Geary Brewing Company , where two black Labs lounged among the cubicles .
The sound that followed , as we passed through a plain door into the back brewery after half a day on the road , was even sweeter , in its own way : Thaddeus Mullen , a stubbled 35 - year - old brewer in a T - shirt , jeans and Boston Bruins hat , looked up and said , “ You guys want a beer ? ”
Yes .
And we had come to the right place .
It may be the blustery weather or it may be the local populace ’s stubborn independence , but Maine has grown into a hub of craft brewing , a smaller - scale East Coast answer to Oregon .
D. L. Geary , in business since 1986 , was a Maine microbrewing pioneer , the first in the state , and for us — a dedicated craft brew drinker and his designated driver who , all things considered , prefers Coors Light — it was the first stop on a satisfying beer tour 170 miles up the coast to Bar Harbor .
Over the course of the weekend , we would find two barns , one shaggy old mule and a tasty blueberry pie , but here at Geary , toting ice - cold bottles of the company ’s signature pale ale on a tour through the entire brewing process in the company ’s factory , we were surrounded , Willy Wonka - style , by canvas sacks of fragrant hops and big open fermentation tanks of bubbling brew .

After Michael Jordan hung 63 points on the Celtics in a playoff game at the Garden in 1986 , there was no doubt : he was the greatest basketball player in the world .
Incredible and credible sources echoed the sentiment .
Larry Bird famously remarked following the game , “ He is the most exciting , awesome player in the world .
I think it ’s just God disguised as Michael Jordan . ”
For the next decade , Jordan ’s title as greatest player in the world ( and heavens ) would n’t face serious challenge , even during retirement from the game .
In an era full of stars , Jordan outshone the basketball galaxy and dimmed any debate .
After Michael Jordan hung up his Air Nikes for the second time as a member of the Chicago Bulls , the debate over who was greatest player in the world finally flickered again .
For the last decade , easily more than a half dozen players have fought over the title , with none able to hold a firm or convincing grip for very long .
If you ’re reading this , well , then you can names the names .
Shaquille O’Neal .
Allen Iverson .
Tim Duncan .
Kevin Garnett .
Kobe Bryant .
Steve Nash .
Dirk Nowitzki .
Dwyane Wade .
Chris Paul .
Paul Pierce .
And the list goes on .
O’Neal and Duncan are the two most dominant and accomplished post - Jordan players .
If bloggers could re-award individual honors – and who ’s really stopping us ?
– Shaq would absolutely have more than a single MVP to his name .
And there ’s no steadier superstar than Duncan in the 2000’s .
But their similar greatness always made the top player question hotly debatable , and neither is a prime suspect today anyway .
While they ’ve both won titles recently ( O’ Neal in 2006 and Duncan in 2007 ) , neither fetched Finals MVP honors , after both were three - for - three in previous championships in this regard .
No post players today are close to vintage O’Neal or Duncan , with all due respect to Dwight Howard .
Instead , Bryant is the current chic choice as hardwood ’s hero , fresh off his first MVP award and just a few seasons removed from wowing the world by scoring 81 and 62 points in two respective games – in the same month , no less .
His resume also includes three titles , and the inevitable and impossible early - career Jordan comparisons .
Oh , about those ?
After the Celtics ’ unexpectedly sank the Lake - show , they ’re like the Boston Tea Party : history .
That ’s for the best , because as the second best player on three championship teams , Kobe was more Pippen in the first place .
But unfair Jordan comparisons ( and by nature , they all are ) aside , how can we give a pass to the “ greatest ” going into the Finals as a clear favorite and losing handily ?
At the very least , it draws into question who exactly is the greatest player in the world .
So , are we left to argue for yet another decade ?
On the contrary .
A new number 23 in America ’s heartland will win his first MVP as he enters his mid-twenties , just as Michael Jordan did in 1988 , though the performance wo n’t be a replica .
And while I ’m taking clairvoyant notes , he ’s also going to lead Team USA to gold in a short time from now .
Yes , lead .
Because King James is the most royal of all to proudly wear the red , white , and blue in Beijing , a fact only sometimes blurred by Dwyane Wade ’s brilliance thus far .
The windmill dunk here , and no -look pass there were expected , but the blocks and steals everywhere have marked James as a defensive force in the tournament that Bryant dubbed himself the Doberman .
And yes , gold .
Not to be a brash American , because I know it ’s been eight ( gasp ) years .
But LeBron straight - up just does n’t lose to teams he should beat , and frequently slays superior teams .
That ’s the crux of the argument here .
He ’s not only a statistical champ , though he is that too , as John Hollinger and the guys at 82 games show .
LeBron more than doubled the Cavs ’ wins as a rookie from the previous year .
Since then , he ’s trashed the more talented Wizards thrice .
And the memory of 2007 still haunts the Pistons ’ reverie .
For now , the Celtics are the top team , because a series of playoff games clarified that .
We do n’t have a similar formula to decide who is the greatest player in the world .
Yet , for the first time in a decade , there is clearly a correct answer both now and going forward .
By the end of the upcoming NBA season , this debate wo n’t be so contentious , and the heap of contenders wo n’t be quite as close .
The answer to the question though , will it be a nail - biter ?

Some chess players are devastated by losses , letting them infect their mood and their subsequent play .
Losing at chess does not bother him that much , Magnus said .
“ I get more upset at losing at other things than chess .
I always get upset when I lose at Monopoly . ”
So much so that his sisters team up to beat him .
Their fervent sibling rivalry is the rare blot on a home life that seems almost idyllic .
His father , Henrik , is an information technology consultant who has spent a good deal of time traveling with his son when not working ; his mother , Sigrun Carlsen , is a chemical engineer .
Both are active and down to earth .
Magnus has three sisters : Ellen , 19 ; Ingrid , 14 ; and Signe , 11 .
Ingrid said her brother often teases her , almost to the point of bullying , something that he admitted with a devilish grin .
“ What kind of brother would I be if I did n’t tease her ? ” he asked .
Stories of chess prodigies often begin with a eureka moment when the child discovered the game or displayed some heretofore hidden talent for it .
Magnus ’s interest can be traced to competition with his sister Ellen .
Their father , a good tournament - level player , tried to teach Magnus and Ellen to play when they were 5 and 6 , but neither showed much interest .
It was three years later , after Ellen had begun to play seriously , that Magnus started learning the game , mostly because he wanted to beat her .
One day , when he was 8 , he challenged Ellen to a game and won .
“ The sad thing about that , ” their father said , “ was that she then quit for four years . ”
The boy , meanwhile , was hooked .
He began playing regularly in tournaments , and his progress was , by chess measures , spectacular .
A year after playing his first tournament against children his own age , he was competing against adults and beating them .
For a while he studied with Simen Agdestein , a grandmaster and former Norwegian champion , but Magnus has now surpassed him and studies on his own to supplement the vast catalog of positions he has memorized .
Last year he spent more than 200 days on the road playing and earned $ 250,000 after expenses , his father said .
Given his results this year , his earnings will surpass that .

Henrick Carlsen said his son ’s progress in chess was typical for him .
“ Sometimes , he ’s been thought to be slow , ” he said .
But when he gets interested in something , “ then he accelerates . ”
He added , “ I do n’t think he is conscious of this approach .
It is innate . ”
He said that his son , from a young age , exhibited an ability to focus single - mindedly .
One day , the father recalled , when Magnus was 4 , he spent six hours building a train out of Legos .
A half - hour after he went to bed , Mr. Carlsen found him in the dark “ wide awake and staring into space , and I thought , ‘ O.K. , this is too much . ’ ”
Top -15 Richest Monarchs of the World
September 9 , 2007 at 1:06 am
Calling Queen Elizabeth II as the richest royal across the globe is a passé .
The list is updated by Forbes .
To your much astonishment , Queen is worth $ 600 million that clearly puts her on eleventh position in the list of top - 15 monarchs identified .
But the solace lies in her for being the world ’s wealthiest female sovereign as hardly one - or - two women could only make up to the list .
The top pedestal is given to the Sultan of Brunei as his royalty is worth $ 22 billion , which is 36 times more than the Queen ’s royalty .

I think I can speak for many Americans when I say that our government has been less than responsive as far as ending militarism and holding our civil liberties sacrosanct .
In fact , less than responsive is being generous , as we have seen this nation totally scrap the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , station troops in bases world - wide in over 130 different nations , and wage aggressive war on three nations , become complicit with another nation to wage war ( Georgia ) and institute trade sanctions ( another Act of War by International law ) on Iran .
During the past two terms of this Presidency we have learned in - depth about signing statements , the “ Unitary Presidency ” , numerous Executive Orders that remain secret from the Congress , extraordinary “ rendition ” , and torture to include inflicting injuries on another human being “ to the point of , but not exceeding organ failure ” .
We know of places such as Abu Graib , and Guantanamo and watched as our Army dropped white Phosphorus on innocent civilians in a city called Fallujah where photographs of women and children showed burned blackened corpses while the clothes and blankets they were wrapped in were n’t even singed .
We learned about depleted uranium and exposed our soldiers and Iraqi citizens to ionizing radiation that causes cancers , leukemia , and birth defect among other things .
Radiation that we brought to Iraq and Afghanistan has a half - life of eight billion years .
We watched as Congress enabled the President to commit vast sums of money on an aggressive war in the Middle - East , taking money away from the taxpayer that could have been used to build schools , hospitals and to fix crumbling infrastructure in this country .
We could have offered every American student tuition free higher education instead of dumping it into Iraq in the quest for global resources like oil .
We could have taken the trillion dollars that we spent on these wars and used it to promote alternate energy resources .
Instead of looking out for the taxpayers , the Congress , controlled by BOTH major corporate political parties , squandered our nation ’s wealth on war and weapons of war for a global empire nobody voted on and nobody wants save those that are now in government .
Congress voted for The Patriot Act , The Military Commissions Act , The John Warner Defense Bill ( The re-vamped Insurrection Act ) , the enhanced FISA Bill that gave the telecom companies retroactive immunity for illegally wiretapping American citizens for the Executive Branch which was against the law .
Congress ignored Articles of Impeachment against the President and Vice - President time and time again .
Congressional subpoenas have been ignored by members of the Executive Branch and Congress does not impose inherent contempt charges on these individual and send Capitol Police to arrest them for willfully disobeying Congress .
The checks and balances that were built into our Constitution are broken from neglect and disuse .
Congress has allowed the Executive Branch to supersede those powers that were expressly given to Congress by our Constitution .
We are now facing an election in which the nominees were presented to us by a compliant corporate led media .
Before a single vote had been cast , two of the Democratic nominees had been barred from taking part in the Primary Debates .
We saw , according to The Center for Responsive Politics ( opensecrets.org ) , corporate money in bundles campaign donations go to two Democrats almost exclusively before a vote was cast in the primaries .
The two major party nominees both support more war and more military spending , while ignoring the fact that we have lost a majority of our civil liberties that were stated in the Bill of Rights .
Meanwhile the media is controlled by the same interests that now control our elected officials from the two major parties , and tout only two candidates , the Democrat and the Republican .
To illustrate that there is hardly a difference between them , they must rely on “ straw man ” arguments such as gay rights , abortion , taxes and education .
These are the same issues that are brought up time after time , election after election , yet most of these issues should be settled by the States , not the Federal Government .
They fail to bring up the loss of our constitutional rights like freedom of speech and the press , unrestricted search and seizures without a warrant .
Non-lethal force such as tasers , rubber bullets and riot gas being used on demonstrators in violation of their free speech rights , as they are rounded up from “ free speech ” zones .
The candidates neglect to bring up the fact that the Unites States of America spends 48 % of the entire world ’s spending on the military .
The candidates threaten Russia as we encircle them with nuclear –tipped missiles and American military bases .
We demonize Venezuela and Hugo Chavez while we interfere in the internal affairs of Bolivia against the democratically elected government of Evo Morales by giving five provinces rich in natural gas , hundreds of thousands of dollars to succeed from Bolivia .
Our Federal government has allowed unchecked predatory capitalism to thrive in this country , offering mortgages to people with suspect credit , knowing full well that these people would never be able to pay the ballooning mortgages in the future in order to make a quick buck .
Our economy is going belly - up by these “ lassie faire ” practices that have raped the taxpayers while the government bails out the banks and brokers with “ corporate welfare ” .
The top 10 % of the wealthiest people in this nation own 71 % of its wealth !
This gives the remaining 90 % of us 21 % to share together .
I have written about all of this before .
There are examples that for sake of brevity I have not mentioned instances which are just as egregious as those mentioned above like the Federal assistance after Katrina and the saber - rattling towards Iran .
I needed to restate all of these things to illustrate that our federal government is totally out of control , and is not concerned about the well - being of the American taxpayer .
The simple fact is that after this election , with the two candidates they are running and the third parties shut out of participating in an honest election because of impediments set up by the two - party duopoly , we will have no change in the foreseeable future .
Others besides me have predicted that we will have more of the status quo if McCain or Obama are elected .
Unless this nation comes to an epiphany and all at once gets behind Nader or McKinney which is very doubtful , our votes will not win this election .
This election will be decided by the mass media ’s coverage of the two corporate candidates that are both more of the same , and the general public that has been dumbed - down by the same media and the lack of honest news .
So what can we do ?
I propose a “ Shadow Government ” that be made up of all the third parties and the disaffected Republicans and Democrats that are tired of the American Empire and the squandering of our nation ’s wealth on wars while our civil liberties are being taken from us .
It can be formed at a conference much like the one last week - end at Andover , Mass .
We are looking at a police state that operates outside the rule of law that we have operated on for over two hundred years .
This shadow government will be divided up much like the Federal Government .
Instead of individuals holding office however , there will be committees that will monitor every action by every part of every branch of this government to insure that they are following the laws , and not operating outside the rule of law which is US code and the Constitution .
These committees will have not power but to seek indictments against those in the federal government that break US law .
They can seek relief in local , State and Federal Courts .
Every move that this corporate government makes will be followed closely by this shadow government to insure that the excesses that happened in the last decade are not allowed to continue .
The shadow government can also lobby for campaign finance reform to get corporate money out of political elections .
All other partisan issues will be left to political interests lest they take the focus off of what the shadow government was designed to do .
Drastic times call for drastic measures .
This country is rapidly coming apart at the seams and our government continues as if this is what is expected of them .
It ’s time to tell them what is expected of them by banding together , left , right , liberal , conservative the old paradigms ’ no longer matter .
So for now it is not between left and right , only between right and wrong , and it ’s about time .

Marco Polo is one of a number of competing ideas
European scientists and engineers are working on a potential new mission to bring back material from an asteroid .
The venture , known as Marco Polo , could launch in the next decade , and would be designed to learn more about how our Solar System evolved .
The plan is to select a small asteroid - less than 1 km across - near Earth and send a spacecraft there to drill for dust and rubble for analysis .
Mission plans are being worked on by UK Astrium and OHB in Germany .
Both satellite manufacturers have been asked to undertake a feasibility study , to assess the type of spacecraft architecture that would be needed to carry out the project .
A final decision on whether to approve the mission will be made by the European Space Agency ( Esa ) in a few years ' time .
The mission would launch towards the end of the next decade , in about 2017 .

Advertisement Asteroids are the debris left over from the formation of the Solar System about 4.6 billion years ago .
Studying their pristine material should provide new insights on how the Solar System came into being and how planets like Earth evolved .
Asteroids are the rubble left over after the planets formed
Rosetta probe makes asteroid pass " We 'll be looking at the best solution for getting there and back , " UK Astrium 's Dr Ralph Cordey told BBC News .
" We 've got to look at all elements of the mission - how we would design the mission , how to design the trajectory to one of a number of possible asteroids , how to optimise that so we use the smallest spacecraft , the least fuel and the smallest rocket . "
Marco Polo might work like this : •
After the launch on a Soyuz rocket from Europe 's Kourou spaceport , a propulsion unit would take the mission out to its target asteroid •
The main spacecraft unit would undertake a remote - sensing campaign , gathering key information on shape , size , mass , spin and global composition •
It would then attempt to land , drilling a few cm into the surface .
Up to 300g of dust and pebbles would be stored away in a sealed capsule •
After lifting off the asteroid , the spacecraft would put itself on a homeward trajectory , releasing the capsule close to Earth for a re-entry •
The capsule would land without parachutes .
It would be opened in a clean facility to ensure there was no Earth contamination Marco Polo would map the asteroid as well as grabbing a sample
Esa has an exploration roadmap for the missions it wishes to conduct in the coming years .
Marco Polo is being considered under its Cosmic Visions programme , and is one of a number of competing ideas in a class of missions that could cost in the region of 300 million euros .
It is quite possible that Marco Polo , if approved , could be undertaken in partnership with Japan .
Sample return missions are of significant interest to scientists .
Although in - situ measurements provide remarkable insights , so much more would be learnt if materials were brought back to Earth laboratories , where the full panoply of modern analytical technologies can be deployed .
The small return capsule would be released just prior to re-entry
An asteroid sample return mission would have huge scientific merit in its own right but it would also help develop the technology needed for the more challenging task of getting down and up from a large planetary body that has a much bigger gravitational pull - such as Mars .
Not that getting down on to a small , low - gravity body is easy .
The wrong approach could crush landing legs or even result in the vehicle bouncing straight back off into space .
Such problems were amply demonstrated by the recent Japanese attempts to grab samples off the surface of Asteroid Itokawa .
It is still not clear whether Japan 's Hayabusa spacecraft managed to capture any material and the probe 's return to Earth is still haunted by uncertainty .
The Americans deliberately crash - landed their Near - Shoemaker probe on to Asteroid Eros at the end of the spacecraft 's mission in 2001 .
They have also sent the Dawn spacecraft to rendezvous with Asteroid Vesta in 2011 before going on to visit Asteroid Ceres in 2015 .
But these are remote - sensing ventures , not sample return attempts .
Europe , itself , is no novice in the field of asteroid study .
Its Rosetta probe , which is en route to a comet , took close - up pictures of Asteroid Steins during a flyby earlier this month .
Ultimately , it is possible that astronauts could visit an asteroid .
The US space agency is currently studying how this might be done ; but even if approved , such a mission would not happen for many decades .

What are these ?

In a new television ad for the state of Nevada , the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama criticized John McCain ’s support of opening up Yucca Mountain as storage facility for nuclear waste .
The ad hit McCain hard saying that he supports nuclear waste in Nevada , but not in his own backyard of Arizona .
Here is the ad :
Advertisements
Tucker Bounds of the McCain campaign said , “ Apparently Barack Obama is also taking a vacation from the facts , ignoring his own votes in support of the Yucca Mountain project .
Either Barack Obama is too inexperienced to understand that his votes on the floor of the United States Senate are recorded for Americans to review , or he ’s simply showing incredible hypocrisy . ”
So , who is telling the truth ?
The official Obama position is that he has always opposed opening up Yucca Mountain .
In a letter written to Majority Leader Harry Reid and the Chairman of the Committee on Environmental and Public Works Barbara Boxer , Obama said , “ Because of these safety issues and the unwavering opposition from the people of Nevada and their elected officials , there is strong reason to believe that many more billions of dollars could be expended on Yucca Mountain without any significant progress in moving towards a permanent solution to the problem of where to store spent nuclear fuel .
For these reasons , I believe that it is no longer a sustainable federal policy for Yucca Mountain to be considered as a permanent repository . ”
Notice how the McCain camp does n’t bother to mention their candidate ’s position favoring the opening of Yucca .
Instead , they chose to spread more distortions about Obama .
For the residents of Nevada , Yucca is a big issue , but it should be a bigger issue to voters everywhere .
There are several inherent dangers involved in shipping nuclear waste across the country .
Plus , the Department of Energy released a new estimate that the cost of the Yucca Mountain project has increased 67 % to $ 96.2 billion .
I think McCain support of such a risky proposal demonstrates McCain ’s poor judgment , and why he should not be our next president .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The dollar has sprung off its deathbed , but a swift return to ruddy good health looks like a long shot .
After years of steady depreciation , the U.S. currency has rallied strongly this month .
The surge in the dollar 's purchasing power - a euro now fetches $ 1.50 , down from $ 1.57 near the end of July and $ 1.60 in April - is good news for U.S. consumers , because a stronger currency makes imported goods cheaper and helps to hold down inflation .
And inflation , of course , can use some holding down : even after recent declines , the prices of commodities from crude oil to corn remain sharply above year - ago levels .
Unfortunately , the dollar may not be much help there in coming months , because its run may be coming to an end .
Yes , it 's true that European economies are struggling against a looming recession , which is bad for the euro .
But the fact is that weak U.S. fundamentals - particularly in the housing and finance sectors , as well as the nation 's need to borrow overseas to finance current spending - are likely to cap the dollar 's gains .
" Nothing here is sunny , " said CMC Markets currency strategist Ashraf Laidi .
He likens the dollar 's recent gains against the euro to a campaign between two unpopular politicians , one of whom " wins by default . "
A sharp fall ...
Of course , any victory seems appealing after the dollar 's plunge over the past five years .
When the euro was launched almost a decade ago , it traded at par with the dollar .
The dollar then quickly appreciated , as money poured out of slower - growing European economies and into the red hot U.S. stock markets .
But those dynamics started reversing with the U.S. stock market crash of 2000 and the brief U.S. recession of 2001 .
They accelerated when Washington swung back to deficit spending after a brief run of surpluses .
The housing boom kept the U.S. economy growing through the middle years of this decade , but investors started buying the euro and other currencies as Americans borrowed to finance their spending and the government borrowed to finance wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The flight from the dollar gathered more momentum as the U.S. economy slowed and the Fed slashed interest rates even as food - and - energy prices were spiking .
The European Central Bank took the opposite tack , boosting its key rate by a quarter - point in July to 4.25 % , a stance that stood to further boost the euro at the dollar 's expense by widening interest - rate spreads .
Since then , though , data from across Europe and in the states of the former British Commonwealth have shown that the U.S. slowdown is spreading overseas .
So the ECB and other foreign central banks now appear to be moving toward an easing policy .
... and a quick reversal
That shift goes a long way toward explaining the dollar 's recent resurgence - though the speed of the reversal has surprised even analysts who were predicting a dollar rally .
As a result of the recent surge , " our bullish - looking [ dollar ] forecasts from not long ago are now on the near - term bearish side , " analysts from Merrill Lynch wrote Wednesday .
Merrill expects the dollar 's gains to slow in the near term , as " the concerns about the funding of the U.S. deficit prevent some from embracing this [ dollar rise ] wholeheartedly . "
The firm does expect the dollar to appreciate to $ 1.40 to the euro in the first half of 2009 .
But Laidi , of CMC Markets , says he does n't expect to see the dollar continuing to gain ground against the euro or yen .
Instead , he sees the euro trading at around $ 1.53 or $ 1.54 next year , and the yen at 101 or 102 to the dollar - against 110 now .
Laidi says a sustained rise in the dollar would have to be accompanied by a peak in U.S. unemployment , a bottom in U.S. house prices and a general improvement in the U.S. financial sector .
Few expect to see those shifts any time soon .
JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , one of the best - performing U.S. banks during the past year 's credit crunch , warned Monday evening that market conditions have " substantially deteriorated " in the third quarter , leading to $ 1.5 billion of mortgage - related losses .
UBS ( UBS ) , which has been a much weaker player but nonetheless has global reach , likewise said it " does not expect any improvement in current adverse economic and financial market trends . "
The U.S. has lost more than 400,000 jobs in the first seven months of the year , and economists say more layoffs are coming as retailers and automakers endure their latest retrenchment .
Even
Fed officials who have been sounding the alarm about inflation are saying they expect to see the economy struggle , a development that wo n't be supportive of higher values for the dollar .
" I expect that in the second half of this year we will broach zero growth , " Richard Fisher , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas , told the Dallas Morning News in an interview published Tuesday .
Fisher was the lone member of the Federal Open Market Committee to vote for a rate hike earlier this month , when the Fed held its fed funds rate target steady at 2 % .
The one factor that could extend the dollar 's gains , Laidi says , would be " a deepening of the weakness in the euro zone . "
Then , writes Northern Trust economist Asha Bangalore , the ECB could be forced into a swift reversal of last month 's rate hike - an event that could boost the dollar as overseas central bankers are forced to follow , willingly or otherwise , in the Fed 's footsteps .
" Euro - zone interest rates are probably on hold for the rest of this year , " she wrote earlier this month , " unless the ' zone - wide slowdown starts to look like a collapse . "
When Abraham Lincoln first entered politics in 1832 he announced to Illinois voters that " My politics are short and sweet , like the old woman ’s dance .
I am in favor of a national bank . . . in favor of the internal improvements system and a high protective tariff . "
These three things — central banking , protectionism , and what we today call corporate welfare ( for the railroad and road - building industries ) are what Lincoln would devote the next twenty - eight years to achieving , working tirelessly in the political trenches of the Whig and Republican parties .
In doing so he became a master politician , a designation that the founding fathers warned all citizens to be fearful of .
The year 1832 is significant because that was the year of the big showdown over the rechartering of the Bank of the United States between President Andrew Jackson and the bank ’s president , Nicolas Biddle .
Jackson won the showdown , the bank became defunct , and the Whig Party was created largely in response to it and in response to Henry Clay ’s failure to prevail with the " Tariff of Abominations , " which would have raised average tariff rates to nearly 50 percent .
A central bank was the potential political lifeblood of the Whig Party , and no one was more devoted to resurrecting it than was Lincoln .
As University of Virginia historian Michael Holt writes in his treatise , The Rise and Fall of the Whig Party , during the 1840 , 1844 , and 1848 elections Lincoln " crisscrossed the state ardently and eloquently defending specific
Whig programs like a national bank . . . .
Few people in the party were so committed to its economic agenda as Lincoln . "
In 1848 Lincoln stumped for Zachary Taylor , promising that if he were elected he would revive the central bank .
He would continue to criticize Jackson and advocate central banking for the rest of his political career .
In Monetary Policy of the United States Richard Timberlake clearly explained the paramount importance of central banking to the political ambitions of Lincoln and his fellow Whigs : " To the Whigs . . . a national bank was their life — the vital principle — without which they could not live as a party — the power which was to give them power . . . .
To lose it , was to lose the fruits of the election , with the prospect of losing the party itself . "
In other words , the Whigs always intended to use a central bank , and the printing of paper money not backed by gold or silver , as the means of financing massive patronage schemes ( " internal improvements " ) that they hoped would keep them in power indefinitely .
This is precisely why the Jacksonians were so opposed to it .
Andrew Jackson and the Bank War
The best published account of the " bank war " between Andrew Jackson and Nicolas Biddle is Robert Remini ’s Andrew Jackson and the Bank War .
Jackson considered fiat money to be " the instrument of the swindler and the cheat .
For Andrew Jackson , hard money — specie — was the only legitimate money ; anything else was a fraud to steal from honest men . " ( Remini , p. 19 ) .
Jackson also believed that the doctrine of states ’ rights meant that a central bank was unconstitutional .
This view was quite pervasive , especially in the South .
As Timberlake writes ( p. 83 ) : " The states . . . . were properly jealous and fearful of encroachment by the federal government .
Since a central bank would necessarily be a federal bank and would maintain and operate state branches from a distant center , proponents of states ’ rights found opposition to a national bank almost mandatory . "
Jackson suspected that a central bank would be controlled by Northern bankers and would be used to manipulate politics .
Remini does point out that the strongest support for the bank came from New England , whereas the fiercest opposition came from Southern politicians like Jackson .
Jackson had good reason to fear political manipulation by a central bank .
The first president of the Bank of the United States ( BUS ) was Navy Captain William Jones , who had no banking experience and who had just gone personally bankrupt .
Murray Rothbard blames him for the Panic of 1819 in his book of the same title , which is cited by Remini .
The Second BUS was run by Nicolas Biddle , who continued to politicize the bank in many ways , including granting low - interest loans and " consulting contracts " to politicians who would support the bank ’s expansion .
Jackson ’s Treasury Secretary , Roger B. Taney ( the future chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court ) complained of the bank ’s " corrupting influence " and " its patronage greater than that of government " for good reason .
As Henry Clay biographer Maurice Baxter wrote in Henry Clay and the American System , Clay ( Lincoln ’s political role model ) left Congress for two years in 1822 after having incurred $ 40,000 in personal debt to become general counsel of the BUS .
His income from this caper " apparently amounted to what he needed " to pay off his personal debts , writes Baxter .
" When he resigned to become Secretary of State in 1825 , he was pleased with his compensation . "
Another prominent Whig , Daniel Webster , did not even bother resigning from Congress before collecting bribes .
He simply demanded a " retainer " from Biddle " If it be wished that my relation to the Bank should be continued . "
Biddle proved Jackson ’s charges of political corruption to be correct when , during the 1828 election he spent more than $ 100,000 of the bank ’s money in support of Jackson ’s political opponents ; promised BUS money to friendly politicians to spend on " internal improvements " schemes ; paid for the reprinting of Henry Clay ’s speeches in support of the BUS ; and paid for newspaper ads that promoted himself and the bank and attacked Jackson .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a central bank was constitutional , but it is important to keep in mind that , prior to the War for Southern Independence , it was not at all universally agreed that the federal government itself should be the arbiter of the limits of its own powers .
That is , Supreme Court decisions were viewed by many , including President Andrew Jackson , as mere opinions and not Holy Writ , as they are today .
As Jackson said in response to the Court ’s decision :
To this conclusion I cannot assent .
Congress and the president as well as the Court must each for itself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution . . . . the opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges , and on that point the president is independent of both .
The authority of the Supreme Court must not , therefore , be permitted to control the Congress or the executive when acting in their legislative capacities .
For the next several decades the political battle would continue over central banking , with such advocates of a more centralized and omnipotent state as John Quincy Adams , Webster , Clay , and Lincoln on one side , and John C. Calhoun and the Jacksonians on the other .
As Remini writes , " Calhoun argued in favor of a system that would convert the United States to the gold standard exclusively . "
The Independent Treasury System
The demise of the BUS led to an alternative banking system known as the Independent Treasury System , which was put into place in 1840 , ended by the Whigs in 1841 , resurrected in 1846 , and ended finally during the Lincoln administration .
As Jeffrey Hummel wrote in an essay on President Martin van Buren in Reassessing the Presidency , the Independent Treasury System , under which the only legally recognizable money was gold and silver coins and all currency was redeemable in specie on demand , " ushered in an era of financial deregulation at the national level . "
It was probably the most stable monetary system in American history , according to Hummel .
Timberlake writes that " The Independent Treasury may well appear in retrospect as the optimal monetary - fiscal institution within the basic framework of a gold standard . "
Lincoln the Bank Whig
Abraham Lincoln was fiercely opposed to the Independent Treasury System .
On December 26 , 1839 , he gave a speech in opposition to it and in support of central banking in Springfield , Illinois .
The speech was Clintonian in length and charged that the system would generate economic instability , be extremely expensive to operate , would be an insecure depository of money , and would " reduce the quantity of money in circulation . "
These turned out to be red herring arguments .
Lincoln ’s speech was quite extreme and even bizarre in some respects .
He quite hysterically claimed , for instance , that under a gold and silver standard " All [ will ] suffer more or less , and very many will lose everything that renders life desirable . "
Lincoln was not a religious man , and many of his contemporaries believed he was an atheist .
But being a consummate politician he frequently invoked Scripture in his speeches , including this one .
" The Savior of the world chose twelve disciples , and even one of that small number , selected by super - human wisdom , turned out a traitor and a devil .
And , it may not be improper here to add , that Judas carried the bag — was the Sub - Treasurer of the Savior and his disciples . "
An Independent Treasury System would supposedly be a " traitor " to the American public just as Judas betrayed Jesus , said Lincoln .
About a year later Lincoln had become a leader in the Illinois legislature and he repeatedly opposed proposals by Democrats to audit the Illinois state bank .
In December 1840 the Illinois Democrats wanted to require the bank to make payments in gold or silver instead of paper .
The bank was authorized to continue its suspension of specie payment through the end of the year .
Lincoln wanted desperately to avoid this outcome , so he bolted for the door and instructed his fellow Whigs to follow him .
Without a quorum the legislature could not vote to adjourn , and the suspension of specie payment would continue .
But the door was locked and guarded , so Lincoln literally jumped out of the first - floor window , followed by his lemming - like Whig followers .
The Democrats ridiculed him as " Lincoln and his flying brethren , " and his stunt failed anyway .
In What Has Government Done to Our Money ?
Murray Rothbard explained the significance of the phrase , " suspension of specie payment . "
This explanation clarifies just what it was that Lincoln and the Whigs ( and later the Republicans ) were fighting so vigorously for .
The bluntest way for government to foster inflation . . . is to grant the banks the special privilege of refusing to pay their obligations , while yet continuing in their operation .
While everyone else must pay their debts or go bankrupt , the banks are permitted to refuse redemption of their receipts , at the same time forcing their own debtors to pay when their loans fall due .
The usual name for this is a “ suspension of specie payments . ”
A more accurate name would be “ license for theft , ” for what else can we call a government permission to continue in business without fulfilling one ’s contract ?
Richard Timberlake was right : The Whig Party failed to revive the BUS and , without an ability to promise taxpayer - financed subsidies to its big business supporters , the party imploded in the early 1850s .
Many of the same special interests that had supported the Whig Party then supported the new Republican Party .
Lincoln assured his Illinois constituents that there was not policy difference at all between the Whig and Republican Parties .
Lincoln ’s Banking Legislation
As soon as Lincoln took office the old Whig coalition finally controlled the entire government .
It immediately tripled the average tariff rate , began subsidizing the building of a transcontinental railroad in California even though a desperate war was being waged , and on February 25 , 1862 , the Legal Tender Act empowered the Secretary of the Treasury to issue paper money ( " greenbacks " ) that were not immediately redeemable in gold or silver .
The National Currency Acts of 1863 and 1864 created a system of nationally chartered banks that could issue bank notes supplied to them by the new Comptroller of the Currency , and a 10 percent tax was placed on state bank notes to drive them out of business and establish a federal monetary monopoly .
The government ’s paper money flooded the banks so that by July 1864 greenback dollars were worth a mere 35 cents in gold .
Ever since the days of Andrew Jackson American presidents had opposed a fiat money system .
The Jacksonian opposition to central banking was ended , literally , at gunpoint .
Lincoln ’s main role was to avoid doing what presidents had done for the previous three decades : veto central banking legislation .
There was no chance of that since Lincoln , unlike Jackson and President John Tyler , was a career - long advocate of central banking and fiat money .
Financing the American Empire
The Republican Party establishment , led by Lincoln , was very clear on what it hoped to achieve with a central bank .
As Heather Cox Richardson recounts in The Greatest Nation on the Earth : Republican Economic Policies During the Civil War , Senator John Sherman , brother of General William Tecumseh Sherman and chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee , declared , " nationalize as much as possible , even the currency , so as to make men love their country before their states .
All private interests , all local interests , all banking interests , the interests of individuals , everything , should be subordinate now to the interest of the Government . "
This is a perfect rendition of the collectivist philosophy that would plague the twentieth century with its insistence that citizens are to be the mere servants of the state , rather than the other way around .
The sponsor of the banking legislation in the House of Representatives was Congressman Elbridge G. Spaulding , a New York banker .
Spaulding clearly argued that the new fiat money system would finally clear the way for the mercantilist system of massive " internal improvement " subsidies .
The New York Times published a celebratory editorial on March 9 , 1863 , in which it said , " The legal tender act and the national currency bill crystallized . . . . a centralization of power , such as Hamilton might have eulogized as magnificent . "
Kentucky Democrat Lasarus Powell was not as enthusiastic .
" The result of this legislation , " he said , " is utterly to destroy the rights of the states .
It is asserting a power which if carried out to its logical result would enable the national Congress to destroy every institution of the States and cause all power to be consolidated and concentrated here [ in Washington , D.C. ] . "
But of course it would ; that was always the intention of The Party of Lincoln .

Poor test writing , part 1 : Celtic Kane JavaScript speed test
This is the first in what will probably be a series of posts about poorly - written tests .
Writing good tests is hard , especially without having some idea of how browsers work on the inside ; these posts are meant to point out some of the pitfalls , not to criticize .
I often see the Celtic Kane JavaScript speed test cited as a performance test people care about .
This test has several sub-tests , some of which I would like to examine in more detail .
Layer movement .
This test is simply not testing what it thinks it 's testing .
Here 's the entire test :
var layer1 = document.getElementById(' layer1 ' ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i <= 8000 ; i++ ) { layer1.style.x = i + ' px ' ; layer1.style.y = i + ' px ' ; }
First , and most obviously , the test is simply testing the speed of setting " expando " properties on a CSSStyleDeclaration object , since there are in fact no CSS properties named " x " and " y " .
I 'm not sure why this is an interesting thing to test , or what it has to do with " layer movement " .
Even if the test were setting " left " and " top " , it would n't be testing " layer movement " , since all UAs I 'm aware of do most of their layout and such asynchronously and this test is not leaving time for that .
All the test would measure in that case is the amount of time it takes for the UA to record the information needed to do a layout some time later .
Again , I 'm not sure why this is an interesting thing to test .
Random number engine .
No attempt is made to check whether the numbers are actually random , or even non-constant .
A UA that simply returns 0 , or returns poor random numbers ( using a poor random - number generator ) would automatically do better on this test , though it's not clear that you 'd want to use the return value of random ( ) for anything serious in such a UA .
DOM speed .
This test tests setting a single DOM property : innerHTML .
It sets it to a string with no actual HTML in it .
I 'm not sure whether this is a common performance bottleneck in the real world , but results on this test change radically in various UAs once there is an actual tag name in the string ( a situation that I suspect is more common than the plaintext one ) .
Once again , the test does n't actually measure the time needed to lay out or render the newly - created DOM nodes , but this is probably fine for a test that claims to be about " DOM speed " .
It would be a much more useful test if it tested a wider variety of methods and properties , and in more realistic ways .
Array functions .
In pratice , this test basically tests the performance of reversing an array and sorting an array that is in exactly reversed order .
There is an Array. push ( ) call , but the time it takes is overwhelmed by the sort ( ) and reverse ( ) calls .
This seems like a very uncommon and quite synthetic workload .
In particular , there are plenty of array - sorting algorithms that would perform quite well on this workload and poorly on more random arrays , and vice versa .
String functions .
This test tests string concatenation and String.slice ( ) .
There are two lines in this test that are no -ops :
str.toLowerCase ; str.toUpperCase ;
I 'm not sure whether the test author thinks he 's testing toUpperCase ( ) and toLowerCase ( ) performance here ; I hope he does n't .
Ajax declaration .
This test tests the performance of creating an XMLHttpRequest object and doing absolutely nothing with it .
I 'm not sure why this is a useful test , since it can be easily gamed by deferring all initialization work until the open ( ) call .
That would make the time from creation start to open ( ) complete longer , but speed up creation time .
Before someone suggests it , I did try contacting the test author several weeks ago .
There has been no response of any sort .

New Study Says Commercial Carbon Capture Unlikely by 2020
August 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The recent news that the demand for coal is climbing rapidly around the world has left many of us deeply unsettled .
And a new study from Australian energy consultancy ACIL Talisman does n’t make things sound any more cheery .
The company believes that clean coal technologies such as carbon capture and storage are unlikely to be commercially available before 2020 unless major technological breakthroughs occur in the very near future .
However , the firm predicts that both geothermal and concentrated solar will be in widespread commercial use by the 2020 target date .
But none of these technologies can squelch the CO2 coming from the 40 % increase in coal consumption expected by 2030 .
While the ACIL Talisman study only focuses on Australia , their predictions most likely hold true for the rest of the world as well .
In 2006 , the World Business Council on Sustainable Development reported that commercial carbon capture and storage is not expected for 20 years .
While these reports are bleak , they are not hopeless .
So many major discoveries have occurred recently in other cleantech sectors that the idea of a major breakthrough in carbon capture and storage is not entirely a pipe dream .
And of course , there are many other greenhouse gases that also deserve our attention — some of them more harmful than CO2 .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
DENVER — Democratic women brushed off a new ad by Republican John McCain that Democrat Barack Obama did n’t pick Hillary Rodham Clinton as a running mate because of their hard - fought primary race
“ Good try — but not good enough , ” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , appearing with three other female Democratic elected officials on the eve of the party convention .
Though Clinton did n’t appear , Pelosi and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius , herself a vice presidential candidate , doused speculation that the lack of a female on the Democratic ticket could hurt Obama .
“ There is so much more in common with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama than with John McCain , ” Sebelius said .
The McCain ad airing Sunday shows Clinton during the primary battle saying critical things about Obama .
A voiceover announcer then says , “ She won millions of votes but is n’t on the ticket .
Why ?
For speaking the truth . ”
Pelosi praised Obama ’s pick , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , and said she doubted any Clinton supporters would be swayed by the McCain ad .
“ Women have the most to gain with the election of Barack Obama , and the most to lose with the election of John McCain , ” Pelosi said .
Clinton will repeat her endorsement of Obama in a prime - time speech Tuesday .
Party leaders will be watching to see whether she and former President Bill Clinton heal any remaining divisions in the party .
Hours before Hillary Clinton ’s speech , a group of supporters called 18 Million Voices were to march through downtown Denver .
But on fliers promoting the march , organizers say the event will be a celebration of Clinton ’s campaign and not a protest of Obama ’s vice presidential choice .
The basic problem is that many transmission lines , and the connections between them , are simply too small for the amount of power companies would like to squeeze through them .
The difficulty is most acute for long - distance transmission , but shows up at times even over distances of a few hundred miles .
Transmission lines carrying power away from the Maple Ridge farm , near Lowville , N.Y. , have sometimes become so congested that the company ’s only choice is to shut down — or pay fees for the privilege of continuing to pump power into the lines .
Politicians in Washington have long known about the grid ’s limitations but have made scant headway in solving them .
They are reluctant to trample the prerogatives of state governments , which have traditionally exercised authority over the grid and have little incentive to push improvements that would benefit neighboring states .
In Texas , T. Boone Pickens , the oilman building the world ’s largest wind farm , plans to tackle the grid problem by using a right of way he is developing for water pipelines for a 250 - mile transmission line from the Panhandle to the Dallas market .
He has testified in Congress that Texas policy is especially favorable for such a project and that other wind developers cannot be expected to match his efforts .
“ If you want to do it on a national scale , where the transmission line distances will be much longer , and utility regulations are different , Congress must act , ” he said on Capitol Hill .
Enthusiasm for wind energy is running at fever pitch these days , with bold plans on the drawing boards , like Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’s notion of dotting New York City with turbines .
Companies are even reviving ideas of storing wind - generated energy using compressed air or spinning flywheels .
Yet experts say that without a solution to the grid problem , effective use of wind power on a wide scale is likely to remain a dream .

Bank of China may hold huge US debt
( China Daily / Agencies )
Updated : 2008-07-17 09:20
Bank of China Ltd may own about $ 20 billion of debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , representing two - thirds of total holdings among the six largest Chinese banks , according to CLSA Ltd .
The Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae investments would amount to about 2.6 percent of total assets at Bank of China , the nation 's third - biggest , CLSA analysts said yesterday in a note to clients .
That compares with 0.09 percent at larger Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd ( ICBC ) , they said .
ICBC may have $ 1 billion of securities linked to the two beleaguered US home loan companies , while China Construction Bank Corp , the second largest , may have $ 7 billion of such holdings , according to the report .
China CITIC
Bank
Co may own $ 1.4 billion of agency debt , CLSA said .
The government - sponsored companies tumbled on Tuesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading as investors lost confidence in Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's plan to shore up their finances .
Moody 's Investors Service reduced the lenders ' financial strength ratings , saying credit losses may jeopardize dividend payments on preferred shares .
As most Chinese banks classify the holdings as available - for - sale or held - to - maturity , they are unlikely to book a loss on their income statements , and declines in bond prices in July wo n't affect first - half earnings , CLSA said .
When Red Fades , It Turns Saffron
The Sangh Parivar ’s attempts to wrest control of Kerala ’s Left bastion , Kodungallur , is threatening to undo the town ’s historic legacy of communal harmony .
KA SHAJI reports
KODUNGALLUR IS an ancient seat of tolerance and communal amity .
This coastal town in central Kerala , with a sizable population of upper caste Hindus , was supposedly where St. Thomas — one among the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ — landed in AD 52 to preach Christianity , and was welcomed by the locals .
Later , the port town reaffirmed its faith in the harmonious co-existence of religions when its popular king Cheraman Perumal embraced Islam and went to Mecca for Haj .
Even the unique taste of the presiding deity at the ancient Devi temple here caused no communal disturbances .
Interestingly , the goddess likes risqué talk , sexual humour and sexually explicit songs .
During the annual Bharani festival in April - May , devotees throng the temple and sing ribald songs to the deity .
Despite these unusual circumstances , there has been no record of minority communities living close to the temple finding fault with the centuries - old tradition .
However , the situation is different now .
Hindutva forces are now trying their best to get control of the temple and sow seeds of intolerance and animosity among different religious and social groups in Kodungallur municipality and its adjoining panchayat areas .
The temple administration has been threatened against leasing out land to Muslim and Christian traders to put up stalls during the annual festival .
For the last 10 years , lumpen elements of the Sangh Parivar have been forcibly removing the stalls of people from other religions during the annual festival .
During the last Christmas season , the Sangh Parivar had enforced an eccentric and illegal ban : no trader near the temple was permitted to sell Christmas stars made out of glittering paper .
These stars are traditionally displayed in front of homes to celebrate the arrival of the festival .
Whenever India wins cricket matches against Pakistan , the Sangh Parivar uses that opportunity to hold mammoth anti-Muslim rallies .
Muslim members of the CPM and its youth organisation Democratic Youth Federation of India ( DYFI ) are often dubbed agents of the Muslim extremist organisation National Development Front ( NDF ) .
KODUNGALLUR IS rapidly turning into a Hindutva lab .
The BJP - RSS are determined to tear apart its rich legacy of communal harmony and social solidarity .
“ We will not allow them to implement their communal agenda here , ’’ says MB Rajesh , state president of DYFI .
But Kodungallur is turning into a new flashpoint for CPM - BJP clashes , second only to the volatile Kannur district .
With the CPM and DYFI coming out in support of the minority communities and declaring an ideological war against the Sangh Parivar ’s hate campaign , Parivar forces started engaging in murder politics .
In the first week of July , DYFI area vice - president , Karekkattu Biju was allegedly stabbed to death by BJP - RSS men .
The murder was followed by a three - day hartal and widespread destruction of property belonging to followers of the Sangh groups .
Shops , houses and vehicles of innocent people were attacked ; even pedestrians were not spared .
Paramilitary forces have been deployed and an eerie silence prevails in Kodungallur .
“ Both the BJP - RSS and CPM are equally responsible for the destruction .
The police inaction in arresting the real culprits is equally condemnable , ’’ says Oommen Chandy , Kerala ’s Opposition leader and top Congress man .
“ The CPM never abetted violence .
We were just attempting to ideologically fight their hate campaign .
Four DYFI activists were killed here in the recent past for fighting the communal agenda of the BJP - RSS , ’’ said Rajesh .
He also said that his outfit was against murder politics but would not hesitate to give a fitting reply to unprovoked assaults .
Local BJP leader PK Sreekumar goes back to the 80s to trace the origin of murder politics in the region .
“ A young RSS leader named Satheesan was brutally killed in the beginning of the 80s by CPM - DYFI goondas .
They were worried over his ability to win over youth to the RSS fold .
The prevailing tension is a sequel to that , ’’ he said .
According to him , another RSS worker was killed last year by DYFI activists without any major provocation .
“ The violence will stop once the CPM recognises our right to hold shakhas and conduct everyday political activity , ’’ he says .
He remained silent when the long gap between the murder of Satheesan in the early 80s and those of 2008 was pointed out .
Sreekumar also had no reply when asked about those who killed the four DYFI activists .
The CPM camp says Biju was a clean and honest political activist who never engaged in any violence .
“ The targeting of people with no criminal background shows the cruel mind of the BJP - RSS men .
We are in the process of uniting all like - minded forces to fight their agenda , ’’ said CPM ’s local leader MA Vijayan .
“ In the past , bloodletting in Kodungallur was limited only to the sacrifice of cocks as part of temple rituals .
Though blood and belief blends in symbiosis during the Bharani festival , murders are quite new to the region , ’’ says TN Joy , a Kodungallur - based human rights activist .
According to him , the volatile situation emerged last year with the advent of a powerful local BJP leader — even his detractors are afraid to name him — who considered muscle power the best way to ensure growth for the party .
His first agenda was to take control of the temple .
First , he took the contract for conducting fireworks during festivals .
“ The revenue ranges between Rs 75 lakh and Rs 1 crore while the expense would only come to around Rs 17 lakh , ’’ informs Joy .
The leader then took control of the right to allocate space for advertisements during festivals .
He gets at least Rs 2 crore from this business .
“ That leader is behind all the existing problems here .
‘ Groupism ’ and other internal problems made the CPM ’s ranks ineffective in the last three years .
The BJP leader used that period to consolidate his position , ’’ says K Venu , former Naxalite leader and independent thinker .
Local journalists are also under threat .
A passing reference to the criminal past of a BJP leader in an article resulted in the brutal manhandling of Kerala Kaumudi reporter KM Mithran .
The house of Somasundaran , the owner of a local evening newspaper , was damaged in response to a series of articles against BJP - RSS activists .
“ Only the CPM and DYFI are fighting the Sangh Parivar agenda in Kodungallur now .
That is why their activists are getting killed .
It is the duty of all secular and democratic forces to fight the communalists ’ agenda of segregation in Kodungallur using all democratic means , ’’ exhorts Venu . •
The supernova SN 2006gy is the brightest and most energetic stellar explosion ever recorded , and may be a long - sought new type of explosion .
At top , an artist 's illustration shows how SN 2006gy may have appeared at a close distance .
The bottom left panel is an infrared image by the Lick Observatory of NGC 1260 , the galaxy containing SN 2006gy .
The panel to the right shows Chandra 's X - ray image of the same field of view .
ST . LOUIS ?
Quark stars , exotic objects thathave yet to be directly observed , are part of a new theory to explain some ofthe brightest stellar explosions recorded in the universe .
Super - luminoussupernovae , which produce more than 100 times more light energy than normal supernovaeand occur in about one out of every 1,000 supernovae explosions , have longbaffled astrophysicists .
The problem has been finding a source for all of thatextra energy .
University of Calgary astrophysicists Denis Leahy and Rachid Ouyed think they have a possible source ?
the explosive conversion of aneutron star into a quarkstar .
A neutron staris a compact stellar corpse with a mass equal to about 1.5 suns packed into aspace no more than 16 miles ( 26 km ) across .
Though still just theoretical as nodirect evidence yet exists , a quark star is thought to be even denser , packinga similar mass into an object just 12 miles ( 19 km ) across .
Leahy and Ouyed 's computer models suggest a quark - nova explosion would account for the extraenergy observed in super - luminous supernovae .
The properties they found intheir simulations matched up with those of three of the most luminoussupernovae to date : SN2006gy , SN2005gj and SN2005 ap .
" Intheory , when a neutron star converts into a quark star it releases a lot ofenergy and it produces something that looks like a supernova explosion in termsof energetics , " Leahy said during a presentation of the results today , here at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) .
The low - down
Here 's howthe scenario could work :
The explosive collapse of a massive star generates a neutronstar .
If that neutron star is massive enough , the neutron star will convertinto a quark star , which is packed with quarks .
" Ifyou make a neutron star massive enough , gravity compresses it so you get ahigher and higher density in the center , " Leahy said .
" If youcompress matter to a high enough density you 'll get quark matter . "
Sincequarks are a lower energy state than neutrons , the conversion should releaseloads of energy , enough to power a second explosion called a quark - nova .
In atypical supernova explosion , most of the released energy is used to push offthe cloud of gas as the star collapses .
This so - called envelope of gas expandsoutward .
Just a fraction of a percent of the energy goes into the spectacularlight shows of supernovae .
Leahy saidthat if a second explosion , the quark - nova , were to occur 10 to 20 days afterthe supernova , the energy would n't have to go into expanding the gas envelope .
Instead , most of the energy would be in the form of light radiation .
Thatradiation could explain the brightest supernova recorded , he said .
Oddmatter
The resultsare of special interest for two reasons : Astronomers previously did not have asatisfactory explanation for super - luminous supernovae ; and the model providesindirect evidence for the existence of quark stars , Leahy said .?
" Noone has given a satisfactory explanation for these super - luminoussupernovae , " Leahy told SPACE.com .
" Until somebody does with anormal mechanism , I think it [ this theory ] does provide some evidence , becauseyou need to get that energy . "
Quarks areconsidered to be the tiniestelementary particles that form the building blocks for protons andneutrons , which in turn form atoms .
While protons and neutrons are thought to bemade of three quarks each , a short - lived particle called a pion is made up ofjust two quarks and eventually decays into photons , electrons and neutrinos .
So thefinding , albeit theoretical , brings astronomers a step closer to understandingand possibly finding more evidence for the existence of quarks .
Otherexplanations for the bright supernovae are possible , the researchers say , sofurther research is needed to confirm the new quark - nova model .

After a few weeks of silence , the Musical Geek Friday is back !
This time it 's a song dedicated to all the hackers and the crackers !
The song is written and performed by a guy calling himself Zearle .
It 's very interesting to read his autobiography , where , among other crazy things , he says that during his childhood FBI was closing in on his family and his first years were spent underground , going from one small town to another .
It 's very interesting reading .
The Song for Hackers and Crackers was recorded in 1999 and it is included in his " Class War " music album ( downloadable for free ) .
He says that the song was written as a praise for warez groups .
Thanks to them , he was able to refine his computer skills and get software for making music .
The music tracks he uses in his songs are mostly created by unsigned hiphop beatmakers with R&B / soul , reggae , folk , and acid jazz backgrounds .
This song is NSFW -- Not Suitable for Work , as it contains explicit language .
Though , you can still listen to it on your headphones :)
Contextually , this song is similar to another song I posted on Musical Geek Friday # 2 : Leech Access is Coming At You .

TfL said crime on London buses was " low and getting lower " Bus drivers have been given " spit kits " to help prosecute passengers who spit at them .
London bus drivers will use swabs to take samples of the saliva , which will be DNA - tested by a new police unit set up to combat attacks on bus drivers .
The kits are already used by Tube staff and helped prosecute about 100 people last year who assaulted them .
Transport for London ( TfL ) said bus drivers faced " far too much low - level abuse " from members of the public .
' Disgusting activity '
Last year more than 1,000 incidents of spitting were recorded on London buses , though not all were directed at drivers .
The " spit kits " contain swabs , rubber gloves and an evidence bag , which drivers will use to take samples and hand in to police stations .
They will then be DNA - tested by the new Metropolitan Police unit investigating workplace violence against bus drivers .
" Spit kits " are already used by bus drivers in areas including Nottingham , Cardiff , South Yorkshire and Glasgow .
Mayor of London Boris Johnson said : " We have the finest bus drivers in the world in London and it saddens me that they may find themselves the victims of this disgusting activity .
" These kits will increase the likelihood of being able to track down perpetrators and sends them a clear message that this foul behaviour will not be tolerated . "
Bus crime ' low ' TfL said crime on London buses was " low and getting lower " .
Bus - related crime fell by 11 % last year , with youth crime on buses falling by 19 % in the same period .
The number of serious assaults on bus drivers fell last year from 135 to 118 , TfL added .
However the number of assaults not classified as serious , which included spitting at bus drivers , rose from 866 in 2006 to 998 last year .
Mr Johnson added : " We are determined to make public transport a safer place through measures such as the ban on passengers carrying open containers of alcohol , and I am aware that this will ask more of our drivers .
" However I hope they will agree that by providing support such as the new workplace violence unit we are fulfilling our pledge to protect them . "
Last week the mayor announced that an extra 440 uniformed police staff would patrol major London bus stations to stamp out " minor crime " .

What are these ?
To drop pounds , write down everything you eat
Francis Tacotaco always knew that he was n't a particularly healthy eater .
But until he started keeping a food diary and writing in painstaking , sometimes embarrassing detail about everything that went into his mouth , he did n't know just how bad it was .
The Richmond man would n't eat just one or two thigh pieces from Kentucky Fried Chicken for dinner - he'd eat five .
" I was eating six hot links in one sitting , " Tacotaco said .
Tacotaco , severely overweight and diabetic at age 38 , started logging his daily diet three months ago .
When he saw just how much junk food he was eating , he made significant changes to his diet - cutting out some of the junk entirely or , in the case of the hot links , limiting himself to just one at a time .
He 's lost 22 pounds since .
New research suggests that Tacotaco 's experience is n't unusual .
In a Kaiser Permanente study released today , overweight people who kept daily food diaries lost up to twice as many pounds as those who did n't log every meal .
The study is being published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine .
" Nowadays , there is this notion that people can't lose weight , and that 's not at all what we found , " said Victor Stevens , senior investigator at Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland , Ore. , and an author of the study .
" Keeping food diaries creates awareness of what you 're eating .
And quite honestly , most people do n't know where the extra calories are coming from . "
The two - year observational study followed 1,685 men and women who were trying to lose weight .
All participants were asked to keep daily food diaries , and in the first six months of the study , they had lost on average about 12.5 pounds .
But those who managed to log their eating seven days a week lost between 13 and 20 pounds over six months .
Participants who kept no food diaries lost only about 9 pounds .
The results do n't surprise many nutritionists , who compare keeping a food diary to going to confession - it holds people accountable , they say .
" My clients are a little skeptical at first when I tell them I want everything .
I mean , every last thing .
If they put sugar in their cup of coffee , I want to know it , " said Sharon Meyer , a nutrition therapist at the Institute for Health and Healing at California Pacific Medical Center .
" It 's almost like having homework to turn in to the teacher .
But sometimes we selectively forget that there was a cookie we munched after lunch . "
Tacotaco , who is a Kaiser patient but was not a participant in the study , said he refuses to lie in his food diary .
" I do n't cheat , " he said .
" I still eat sausages from time to time , I still eat pizza once every two weeks or so .
If I eat a lot , I still write it down , so I can correct myself at the next meal .
There 's no point to doing it if you 're going to cheat yourself . "
But aside from the guilt that might come from seeing every french fry and chocolate chip cookie in writing , the truth is that most people are n't very good at paying attention to what they put in their mouth , nutritionists say .
Food diaries force them to actually think about what they eat , said Meyer .
" People are quite surprised by what they find , " Meyer said .
" They have this idea that they 're eating two or three slices of bread in a day , and then they realize they 're eating six .
Writing everything down brings us back to reality . "
Meyer said nearly everyone is guilty of some form of mindless eating - the kind of behavior that leads to afternoon grazing in the break room at work or eating the entire large bag of movie theater popcorn before the opening credits have finished .
Among the worst offenders are moms , said Meyer .
Her clients are often shocked at how much they 're eating off their children 's plates - bites of yogurt or applesauce , handfuls of cookies and crackers .
The snacks might not seem like a lot , but the calories add up .
The good news , said Stanford University nutritionist JoAnn Hattner , is that those are also easy calories to get rid of - as long as people are aware of what they 're doing .
" Food diaries just bring you into a zone where you 're much more aware of portion sizes , " said Hattner , who knows from experience .
When her weight started creeping up recently , she logged her food and found , among other problem areas , that she was using too much olive oil when she cooked at home .
" I was n't measuring it at all , " she said .
" I was just pouring it in , and it was too much .
Now I just have a tablespoon handy . "

AOL disappoints yet again !
It has 28 million users all over the country and it ca n’t seem to get its act together .
In the last year or so it has launched or talked about launching and then killed off over 50 product and service options , and much of what was touted as being the new wave of innovation for the future of the company has already been discontinued .
The rest is following suit like rats fleeing from a sinking ship !
As if AOL has n’t done enough disappointing things in the past , like getting rid of a number of people who relied on their jobs because the company ’s plans for some silly thing it tried to launch did n’t work out right , or badgering people who try to cancel their membership over the phone until they ’re nearly in tears , now AOL users who are still loyal to the company ( for whatever reason ) have something else to contend with .
On July 14th , Kevin Conroy ( he ’s AOL ’s Executive Vice President , for those of you who do n’t know ) , sent out an internal memo saying that AOL Pictures and a few other things â€ “ XDrive , BlueString , and MyMobile â€ “ were going bye - bye .
Just leaving .
Why ?
Simple .
And the same reason that any business gets rid of anything â€ “ it ’s not pulling in the huge sacks full of dollars that the company thought it would back when it launched .
It does n’t seem to matter that a lot of people like this service and use it , or that there are a lot more AOL members who might be enticed to use it in the future if it was marketed to them properly .
AOL users would probably be pretty disappointed about the disappearance of their photo site â€ “ if they knew .
Conveniently , there is no mention on the actual Website ( http://pictures.aol.com/) that the service is shutting down .
Not even a hint hidden somewhere in a corner or a little tidbit of info stuck down in all that fine print along the bottom .
Instead , the site offers to log you in or sign you up for a free account if you do n’t already have one , and invites you to do more with your pictures and check out BlueString ( also leaving ) .
You ’d think that a site that has a number of users who rely on it and was going away in the very near future would make some mention of it , but hey , thatâ€™s just AOL
for ya .
Thankfully , there ’s a solution .
Here ’s what you do .
Download Migratr and move your photos away from AOL Pictures , and to something that will still be there for you the next time you want to look at or share those photos .
Migratr is a desktop application that ’s designed to take photos from one sharing site and put them on another one , along with all the titles , tags and captions you ’ve added to them , along with the albums you organized them by .
Then the next time AOL gets a bright idea and launches a photo sharing site and then yanks it away just a few short months later , users will be better prepared .
In the meantime , AOL users â€ “ let ’s get those photos moved !

With summer in full gear displays of sunscreen appear in every drug , discount and grocery store and many other retail outlets as well .
We grab handfuls , dig up bottles from last year and liberally apply it whenever we take a step out of doors .
The ozone layer is thinning … did n’t you hear ?
But what are we really putting on our skin ?
A recent study raises some concerns .
…. a new investigation of 952 name - brand sunscreens , the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) found that 4 out of 5 sunscreen products offer inadequate protection from the sun , or contain ingredients with significant safety concerns .
Leading brands were the worst offenders :
None of market leader Coppertone ’s 41 sunscreen products met EWG ’s criteria for safety and effectiveness , and only 1 of 103 products from Banana Boat and Neutrogena , the second - and third - largest manufacturers , are recommended by EWG .
Need to check to see if your sunscreen is one of those found to be most toxic ?
How about trying to find out which sunscreen is the best for your family ?
Skin Deep ’s database has the answers .
I ’ve been using the Skin Deep site to research a variety of cosmetics and skin care products for awhile now , but had n’t realized how extensive their sunscreen database is .
Over 1000 sunscreens are listed , ranked and given a grade .
This information turns out to be rather important since the Environmental Working Group found that :
· Only 15 % of 952 products analyzed met EWG ’s criteria for safety and effectiveness , blocking both UVA and UVB radiation , remaining stable in sunlight , and containing few if any ingredients with significant known or suspected health hazards .
Our assessment is based on a detailed review of hundreds of scientific studies , industry models of sunscreen efficacy , and toxicity and regulatory information housed in nearly 60 government , academic , and industry databases .
· Many products lack UVA protection .
Our analysis found that 7 percent of high SPF sunscreens ( SPF of at least 30 ) protect only from sunburn ( UVB radiation ) , and do not contain ingredient combinations known to protect from UVA , the sun rays linked to skin damage and aging , immune system problems , and potentially skin cancer .
FDA does not require that sunscreens guard against UVA radiation .
A top pick from the Skin Deep Database is sunscreen from California Baby .
Surprisingly , or perhaps not , some sunscreens marketed as natural scored the lowest in the ranking .
Most drugstore brands however seem to have scored around the middle .
For a truly safe summer though , it ’s best to take a minute and check out your sunscreen .
It ’s worth the extra minute it takes .

One of the biggest questions that occupy particle physicists and cosmologists alike is : what is dark matter ?
We know that a tiny fraction of the mass of the universe is the visible stuff we can see , but 23 % of the Universe is made from stuff that we can not see .
The remaining mass is held in something called dark energy .
But going back to the dark matter question , cosmologists believe their observations indicate the presence of darkmatter , and particle physicists believe the bulk of this matter could be held in quantum particles .
This trail leads to the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) where the very small meets the very big , hopefully explaining what particles could be generated after harnessing the huge energies possible with the LHC …
The excitement is growing for the grand switch - on of the LHC later this summer .
We ’ve been following all the news releases , research possibilities and some of the more “ out there ” theories as to what the LHC is likely to discover , but my favourite bits of LHC news include the possibility of peering into other dimensions , creating wormholes , generating “ unparticles ” and micro - black holes .
These articles are pretty extreme possibilities for the LHC , I suspect the daily running of the huge particle accelerator will be a little more mundane ( although “ mundane ” in accelerator physics will still be pretty damn exciting ! ) .
David Toback , professor at Texas A&M University in College Station , is very optimistic as to what discoveries the LHC will uncover .
Toback and his team have written a model that uses data from the LHC to predict the quantity of dark matter left over after the Big Bang .
After all , the collisions inside the LHC will momentarily recreate some of the conditions at the time of the birth of our Universe .
If the Universe created dark matter over 14 billion years ago , then perhaps the LHC can do the same .
Should Toback ’s team be correct in that the LHC can create dark matter , there will be valuable implications for both particle physics and cosmology .
What ’s more , quantum physicists will be a step closer to proving the validity of the supersymmetry model .
“ If our results are correct we now know much better where to look for this dark matter particle at the LHC .
We ’ve used precision data from astronomy to calculate what it would look like at the LHC , and how quickly we should be able to discover and measure it .
If we get the same answer , that would give us enormous confidence that the supersymmetry model is correct .
If nature shows this , it would be remarkable . ” – David Toback
So the hunt is on for dark matter production in the LHC … but what will we be looking for ?
After all dark matter is predicted to be non-interacting and , well , dark .
The supersymmetry model predicts a possible dark matter particle called the neutralino .
It is supposed to be a heavy , stable particle and should there be a way of detecting it , there could be the opportunity for Toback ’s group to probe the nature of the neutralino not only in the detection chamber of the LHC , but the nature of the neutralino in the Universe .
“ If this works out , we could do real , honest to goodness cosmology at the LHC .
And we ’d be able to use cosmology to make particle physics predictions . ”
– Toback

( CNN ) -- Suspected Al Qaeda militants disguised as security forces launched an explosive assault on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen 's capital , Sanaa , Wednesday killing 10 Yemeni police and civilians , officials said .
The attack involved two car bombs , a spokesman for Yemen 's embassy in Washington said .
Six attackers , including a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest , were also killed in the attack , Mohammed al - Basha said .
There were at least four explosions -- including at least one car bomb -- and sniper fire , a senior State Department official said .
Yemeni officials said the first car contained people in police uniforms who exchanged fire with Yemeni security forces , the officials said .
The second car exploded after it passed an outermost gate to the Embassy but before it reached a second protective barrier , the officials said .
But al - Basha said there were two cars packed with explosives involved in the attack .
The heavily fortified compound in the capital of Yemen -- the ancestral home of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- has previously been targeted in attacks .
Watch the aftermath of the attack »
A U.S. official told CNN the attackers initially opened fire outside the embassy 's security gate , then there was the main explosion followed by a secondary explosion .
At some point , snipers positioned across the street from the embassy opened fire on Yemeni first responders as they arrived on the scene , the official said .
Those killed include six Yemeni policemen and four civilians , he said , noting that the number of wounded is unclear .
No U.S. Embassy employees were killed , the official added .
However , CNN affilliate WGRZ reported that Ahmed Elbaneh of Lackawanna , New York , said his sister , Susan , 18 , and her new husband died in the attack .
Elbaneh said his sister left Lackawanna about a month ago for an arranged marriage and that she had been married for only 30 days .
Elbaneh said family members in Yemen told him she was at the embassy translating for her new sister - in - law when the blast occurred .
Yemen believes al Qaeda is responsible for the attack , al - Basha said .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the the explosions " bear the hallmarks of an al Qaeda attack . "
And Al - Basha said in a statement : " The government of Yemen considers terrorism as a crime against humanity .
It strongly condemns this heinous attack .
Whoever else who may have planned , plotted and supported the perpetrators of this terrorist attack will be apprehended and justice will prevail . "
Media reports said Islamic Jihad in Yemen -- which is affiliated with al Qaeda -- has claimed responsibility for the attack , but CNN could not independently confirm those reports .
The U.S. State Department said it is sending a team of law enforcement and security experts to help in the investigation , spokesman Sean McCormack said .
Trev Mason , a British national who lives near the embassy , said he saw " a massive fireball " near compound .
Eyewitness tells of fireball outside embassy »
" We heard the sounds of a heavy gun battle going on , " he told CNN .
" I looked out my window , and we saw the first explosion going off -- a massive fireball very close to the U.S. Embassy .
" The gun battle went on for a further 10 to 15 minutes , followed by two further loud explosions . "
The first explosion happened about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday ( 0615 GMT / 2.15 am ET ) and was followed by several secondary blasts , said U.S. Embassy spokesman Ryan Gliha .
Gliha describes the aftermath »
Gliha was at the embassy at the time of the attack and said he felt the compound shake .
" We were all ordered to assume what we call a duck - and - cover position which is a position where we guard ourselves and bodies from potential debris , " Gliha told CNN .
" From that vantage point , I can't tell you much after that except we did feel several explosions after the main explosion that shook the ground . "
Al - Basha called it a " despicable and heinous act " particularly because it took place during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .
President Bush condemned the attack , and warned that it is " a reminder that we are at war with extremists who will murder innocent people to achieve their ideological objectives . "
" One objective ... is they will try to cause the United States to lose our nerve , " he said .
" We want people to be able to live normal lives ; we want mothers to be able to raise their sons and daughters . "
A senior State Department official told reporters Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , in a phone call with Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh expressed regret for the loss of Yemeni life but also underscored the need to increase and improve cooperation against terrorism .
Witnesses told CNN they heard gunfire , and said they saw ambulances rushing from the scene .
The U.S. State Department has warned of violence that it attributes to Islamic extremists in Yemen .
It has cited concern " about possible attacks by extremist individuals or groups against U.S. citizens , facilities , businesses and perceived interests . "
The State Department ordered the departure of all non-emergency American staff from the Embassy , along with their family members , in April , after attacks against the Embassy and a residential compound .
That order was lifted last month .
In March , three mortar rounds landed near the Embassy , injuring Yemeni students at a nearby school and Yemeni government security personnel , the State Department said .
The next month , an expatriate residential compound in the Hadda neighborhood was attacked by mortar fire .
Suspected extremists fired two mortar rounds toward the Yemen Customs Authority and Italian Embassy in April , as well , but no one was hurt .
Authorities in Yemen have been struggling to curb the activities of al Qaeda - linked groups , with militants seen as having free rein outside major cities , says CNN 's International Security Correspondent Paula Newton .

The first release candidate for flash player 10 is out .
Unlike the previous beta and flash player 9 , this one actually performs pretty good .
Fullscreen playback is n’t choppy anymore for me .
Is Adobe finally listening to some of it ’s userbase ?
updated 15/09/08
Before you install it , make sure to remove the libflashplayer .
so file from / home / username/.mozilla / plugins
And if you installed flash player from synaptic , you are going to have to remove it also .
Run this code in a terminal to do so .
sudo apt - get remove libflash - mozplugin libflashsupport flashplugin - nonfree
The RC needed a quick hack to work on my machine ( I thank user mccord and wroobel on the ubuntuforums for this one ) .
I do n’t believe it is necessary for everyone , but this command did the trick .
( copy / paste one line at the time in the terminal )
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libssl3.so.1d /usr/lib/libssl3.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libnss3.so.1d /usr/lib/libnss3.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libnspr4.so.0d /usr/lib/libnspr4.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libsmime3.so.1d /usr/lib/libsmime3.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/ libplds4.so.0d /usr/lib/libplds4.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/ libplc4.so.0d /usr/lib/libplc4.so
Now for installation , one command should take care of the download and install of the player .
( close firefox before using the command )
cd /tmp
wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10/flashplayer10_install_linux_091508.tar.gz
tar - zxvf flashplayer10_install_linux_091508.tar.gz
cd install_flash_player_10_linux
./flashplayer - installer
Please note that this is n’t a final release .
However I have n’t had any crashes yet and the performance is much better .

There has been a bit of a dustup about KDE 4.0 .
A lot of opinions have been expressed , but I thought you might like to hear from KDE .
So I wrote to them and asked if they'd be willing to explain their choices and answer the main complaints .
They graciously agreed .
I was a bit puzzled at some of the complaints , because I use KDE , and when I did n't like something , I would just change it .
For example , if I did n't like the new menu , I could right click on the menu icon and it gave me an immediate choice to go back to the old one .
How hard is that ?
Could it be that at least some of what we are seeing is our old friend Stick in the Mud ?
I asked that because a friend of mine just switched to Linux , and she chose Mandriva 2008 , so I explained to her how to change back and forth and asked her to try both and tell me what she preferred .
She reports she greatly prefers the new menu .
I asked why , and she said she did n't know .
It seemed to her easier to find things , less confusing .
For what it 's worth .
I confess I find the old one easier so far , but then I 'm used to it .
I do like to see immediately everything I have installed , so who knows ?
It 's part of my personality to love to try new things .
So I 'm enjoying watching KDE move forward into new things , and I 'm trying everything .
Of course , I love trying things because I know I 'm not stuck anywhere .
I think it 's fair to say I 'm biased , therefore .
I confess I love KDE .
I like their attitude , and I 'm sticking with them .
As I looked into it , I found it was n't quite as simple as just old habits getting in the way .
For example , I learned that if you are using Kubuntu , you can't just right click the menu .
There is a way to get back to the old , though , which dburns figured out , which we 'll share with you .
But that part is n't KDE talking .
I 've added a footnote to the article about it .
But the KDE guys say that your best option in Kubuntu , and indeed in anything , is just to upgrade to 4.1 .
That solves a lot of problems , they tell me , and more solutions are on the way .
But there has also been quite a lot of mean things said about motives and why this design or that was chosen .
I suspect at least some of the fuss is deliberately done by those with a point of view .
Who knows ?
Whatever .
So let 's settle back , and down if we need to , and let Sebastian Kügler of KDE.org and representing the Board of Directors present the KDE point of view .
His article includes three screen shots , so that those who do n't use KDE can see what this is all about .
I include smaller versions of the screenshots in the article , so our friends on dialup do n't have such a struggle , but you will find links to separate pages where the originals can be found .
Enjoy .
Update : I got a request to make the images clickable to make them larger .
I did n't know how , but Groklaw 's grouch did , so I 've altered them as per the request .
******************************
11 Myths About KDE 4
~ by Sebastian Kügler , KDE e.V. Board of Directors Lately a lot has been said ( or bemoaned ) in the community about KDE 4 , the 4.0 release and the KDE developers .
In the following article we would like to address some common misconceptions about KDE 4 as we see it .
As we firmly believe in KDE 4 and the future of the Free Desktop , we expected the heated discussions about KDE4 and especially the 4.0 release to go away - and we were wrong about that .
As blogging about the issues raised did n't seem to reach the audience we intended , we took the opportunity presented by Groklaw for this article with both hands .
We sincerely hope it sheds some light on why the KDE community did what it thought it had to do and we hope it shows we do take the criticism seriously .
1 . " KDE4 is finished " Actually , KDE 4.0 is just the beginning .
KDE 4.0 has the beginnings of a publicly usable desktop and applications .
KDE 4.0 also marks the stability of the libraries and their programming interfaces so application developers can actively start using them in their application .
The new features and frameworks need some time to be implemented in a user - visible way .
In that light , KDE 4.0 marks the beginning of the availability of KDE4 - technology - based applications .
Assuming that KDE 4.0 delivers the full possibilities of its libraries and frameworks to the user is unrealistic .
The merit of the infrastructural work that has led up to 4.0 will be seen in the coming releases , with KDE 4.1 showing first signs of an increased pace of development thanks to the new foundations .
KDE 4.0 is the starting line , not the finishing line .
2 . " Releasing KDE 4.0 was a mistake " Many of the official release announcements posted on kde.org contained the following text :
" The aim of the KDE project for the 4.0 release is to put the foundations in place for future innovations on the Free Desktop .
The many newly introduced technologies incorporated in the KDE libraries will make it easier for developers to add rich functionality to their applications , combining and connecting different components in any way they want . "
This has been consistent in all communications .
We only failed with KDE 4.0 if we measure the work based on others ' criteria , not our clearly stated goals .
We 're glad that so many people eagerly anticipated the 4.0 release , but in some cases the expectations were heightened despite our efforts .
We do understand the excitement that built up over 2 years , but we 've actually had discussions on trying to meter / throttle people 's exuberance and expectations for 4.0 so that they would not feel let down when 4.0 was released .
On another note , remember that we were also working in parallel on the 3.5 series , which is still available .
KDE 3.5.10 , a new bugfix and translation update is coming in August .
We encouraged users that were not ready to be early adopters of new technology still in heavy development to continue enjoying the 3.5 series .
So why did we release KDE 4.0 in January ?
Let 's look at it from a broader perspective for a while .
Let 's see it in the Grand Scheme of Things to Come .
The big question that should come up is : could n't we have released what will now be KDE 4.1 as KDE 4.0 ?
If that would have been possible , it would surely have been the right choice .
But it was not possible , because of several reasons .
Release early , release often .
One of the pillars of Free Software development is to release your software as soon as it is useful to others , so people can jump in .
Nobody has ever promised that KDE 4.0 would be functionally equivalent to KDE 3.5 .
With KDE 4.0 we have delivered a stable set of libraries and a basic functional desktop .
4.0 in technical terms means :
From this point on , our libraries will remain binary compatible until 5.0 .
Not releasing 4.0 at that point means holding back hundreds of application developers from porting and releasing their applications .
Not releasing would hurt these applications - they would n't receive the attention to detail they deserved .
We 're talking about core applications like Dolphin , but also whole parts of KDE like the Educational applications , Graphics applications , and the games .
Not releasing them would also mean less new contributors and users than they deserved - another thing we did n't want .
Yet the publicly perceived quality of KDE seems to concentrate on Plasma , the newest , but most visible component of KDE 4 .
For this kind of new technology , it simply takes a bit of time and feedback from users until the user experience we could deliver in the past can be reached .
A second issue is packaging .
KDE 4.0 is relatively hard to package , not due to it being that difficult - packaging it is far easier and faster than KDE 3.x .
But it is new , and new things always require an adjusting period .
CMake , SVN , many new dependencies , many new architectural pieces , changes in the internal structure of the major KDE packages like KDElibs and KDEbase ... it'll take a while for packagers to get used to those .
We probably can't expect distros to put out KDE 3.5.x - quality packages for at least a few months .
By the time 4.1 is released , though , they will have some experience , and will hopefully get it done rather quickly .
( If you want the proof - just check out a few different KDE 4.0 distributions ... they differ wildly in terms of stability , features , default setup , and more . )
A third reason is for finding rare , obscure , or corner - case issues .
Many of the problems in KDE 4.0 can and will be fixed by the KDE hackers .
But many can't .
By pushing the boundaries of technology , you 'll be pushed back .
We 've exposed issues in drivers , architectural issues in X , window management , Qt , and more .
Without an earlier release to start getting user feedback , these simply would 've appeared in the delayed first release , and would 've bit users just as hard as they 're biting now .
And finally , KDE is a very complex beast , technically and socially .
It consists of hundreds of applications , an extensive development framework and a desktop on top of that and literally hundreds of contributors with diverse backgrounds .
It is plain impossible that all those things happen to be finished at the same time .
We were able to release a basic first version of the desktop along with the development framework and an already very good looking set of applications .
We did fail in communicating well enough this complex situation .
But then , we 're software developers , we create software ... 3 . KDE needs a fork Forking software is always a last - resort alternative .
Even though it's an option open to any software developer , it carries a hefty price and responsibility , which explains why it fortunately seldom happens .
It 's a last - ditch option to be used when the directions and management of a given software no longer match the vision that a developer or a group of developers have .
We do not think we 're anywhere near that point .
A fork is a necessity only when other alternatives have failed .
Yet people are calling for a fork of KDE without even trying those alternatives .
We call that irresponsible .
The KDE community is extremely open to new ideas , new contributors , and new directions .
Any current contributor will vouch for that .
Those people who feel that their needs are n't being tended to or who feel the direction KDE is going are more than welcome to join the mailing lists and voice their opinions .
Forking carries a hefty price in maintaining the forked code .
KDE is a complex set of interconnected applications and libraries , totaling well over 3 million lines of code ( according to Coverity 's Scan ) .
It 's a no - brainer conclusion that , the more people working on it , the lighter the load .
So it 's definitely better to work with the current developers than to gather a new group .
Forks for KDE have been proposed in the past and have failed .
Whenever those forks were proposed , the KDE community met with skepticism yet welcomed the would - be - forkers , inviting them to join the community instead .
Even when code was published , the community responded by offering to work together and incorporate the improvements .
In all cases so far , the invitation was not accepted , the forkers did not join the KDE community and simply abandoned their ideas .
Forking KDE 3 and porting it again to Qt 4 is a monstrous job .
It took the KDE team almost 3 years to do it .
We do n't believe that any group of developers is willing to undertake that task again .
However , the code is open .
Should anyone want to attempt , we 'll even provide commit rights to our servers .
4 . " KDE needs to drop Plasma " Most of the gripes about KDE 4 so far concentrate on Plasma .
The rest of the desktop , the rest of the applications , and the libraries and frameworks are generally are very well received by end users , and certainly by those willing to adopt those new technologies early .
Since forking all of KDE is out of the question on technical grounds ( see above ) , some call for just dropping Plasma and resurrecting kicker and kdesktop .
The people calling for a fork are invited to resume working on kicker .
As on previous occasions , the KDE community welcomes those developers and we will provide them with accounts on our Subversion server if they wish to undertake that work .
The code for those applications has been partially ported to the new KDE 4 libraries already much earlier in the development process towards KDE 4.0 .
The KDE team has no plans to resurrect kicker or kdesktop , however .
5 . " Plasma lacks functionality " Plasma is a new development from the ground up .
This was necessary because of severe scalability problems of the old KDE3 codebase containing kdesktop , kicker and the minicli ( the Run Command dialog you get when you press ALT + F2 ) .
Also , the requirements for a desktop system have changed in terms of user expectations .
Those components can now use new graphical capabilities such as compositing and animations , which was either very hard to do or plain impossible with the KDE3 technology .
Plasma in KDE 4.0 consisted of a basic traditional desktop with a panel and an application launcher menu .
It was not meant to fully replace all functionality that has matured in KDE3 for several years .
Plasma does however make it relatively easy to replace those components , so it can be extended with applets and code to be very powerful indeed .
The perceived lack of functionality is mostly due to the default settings and applets available in 4.0 .
As the technology matures and KDE 4.1/4.2 are released , we think that this complaint will become obsolete .
6 . " I can not put files on my desktop "
The folderview plasmoids ( which are enabled by default ) show files on your desktop and let you interact with them as if you were using a filemanager .
Although it provides the functionality of " icons on the desktop , " it is actually far more powerful .
It lets you show arbitrary folders on your desktop , even network resources , and interact with the files as if they were locally stored .
The user can also display folders other than ~/ Desktop , filter certain filetypes , and so on .
Folderview enters KDE in KDE 4.1 , replacing the somewhat clunky support for icons on the desktop in KDE 4.0 .
In KDE 4.2 , it is planned to set a folderview as " desktop background " .
The folderview Plasmoids lets you put files on your desktop 7 .
" The whole KDE4 desktop interface is radically new "
While the underlying technology provides lots of new means to interact with computers and will have even more ways of working with different sets of users on different devices , the desktop interface in KDE 4.0 and KDE 4.1 is mostly backwards compatible with desktops as we 've seen them in the last 20 years , containing a panel to switch between applications , a menu launcher , and several bits of functionality such as the clock .
Users are not forced to learn new paradigms unless they want to take advantage of new features such as the dashboard and applets .
The desktop interface has not been radically redesigned in the last twenty years .
The KDE team is working on laying the groundwork for new and innovative ways of dealing with the desktop while providing the traditional ways of interacting with the desktop so current users are not alienated .
The folderview Plasmoids lets you put files on your desktop 8 .
" I am forced to use the kickoff menu " KDE 4.0.4 and KDE 4.1 both provide the possibility to easily switch from the kickoff applications launcher to the classic menu style known from KDE3 .
To switch back to the classic menu , the user right - clicks on the K - menu button and chooses " Switch to Classic Menu Style " .
From kickoff's context menu , you can easily switch to the classic menu style 9 .
" The KDE team does not listen to its users " KDE , as a Free Software project , is more open to its users than any other comparable software team .
All mailing lists are open to suggestions , development can be closely followed through SVN , and developers are usually easily reachable for interested parties , either through their mailing lists , on IRC , or directly via email .
The developers do depend on precise information , however .
Vague statements such as " I do n't like the new foobar " are hard to address .
Precise reports detailing current and expected behavior along with use cases ( and sometimes a bit of patience ) increase the odds of issues being addressed .
Insulting , whining , or spreading FUD does no good to a developer 's motivation to address issues ; instead the usual effect is to cause the developer to become demotivated in regards to fixing a particular issue .
Users that would like certain functionality in KDE 4 should be collaborative and helpful and open to new solutions .
A common understanding of acceptable and effective behavior in communicating with developers is expected , especially considering that the developers do not have an obligation to help and usually do it voluntarily .
In some cases , we need to balance out when to listen to certain users or not .
After all , we are probably leaving some people comfort zone .
There is always resistance to change , yet change is necessary for survival .
A certain amount of room for innovation is needed , and in fact lies at the heart of Free Software .
KDE 3.5 would n't be the stable product it is now without ignoring some of the voices once in a while , and KDE 4 would never become reality .
10 . " KDE 4 vs 4.0 is confusing " With " KDE 4 " we refer to the complete lifecycle of technologies such as Phonon , Plasma , Solid , and so on .
" KDE 4 " spans the whole lifecycle .
KDE 4.0 is the first release in this lifecycle , exposing new technologies to the public .
Subsequent releases ( such as KDE 4.1 and 4.2 ) build on the " Pillars of KDE4 " .
The technologies that are there , but not yet visible surface as KDE 4 is around longer .
Users , especially Free Software users who are typically considered more familiar with software options and availability , have generally had little problem understanding OS X and its subsequent versions , Windows XP and its service packs , Linux 2.6 and its point releases , and so on .
KDE 4 is the new major software paradigm in the KDE project , and KDE 4.0 is simply the very first release .
It makes sense that for the release , we have focused on the technical underpinnings and architecture to future - proof KDE 4 for years to come .
11 . " KDE should just have ported KDE 3.5 to Qt 4 and not add all that other experimental stuff right away "
This is not a stupid idea and it was heavily considered .
The problem with it is two - fold : social and technical .
Socially speaking , it assumes redirecting development effort is effective .
To a certain extent it is , but for quite a few developers not developing features often means not developing at all .
Not everybody is good at low - level stuff ( or willing to do it ) .
This has bitten us and other projects in the past and present .
The development of KDE 4 has been slower than it would 've been if we would be able / willing to force developers to work on whatever some top - down managers think is good ... but it 's just not how FOSS works .
Technically speaking , two arguments .
First , an only - ported release would in time have to be reworked again , so we could n't promise binary compatibility , and the first release would be useless for development of third - party applications .
It would really be nice for users , but a total waste of time from the point of view of developers - the progress of KDE as a development environment would be minimal at best .
And that development environment happens to be the major focus of KDE 4.0 - we want to push the Free Desktop further ( long - term vision ) .
A second problem would be the fact the developers would have to port a huge amount of old code which would n't be needed on the new platform .
Prime example here are KDesktop and Kicker .
Many users asked the KDE developers to port Kicker and KDesktop to Qt 4 , but they did n't because it would be a huge job and in the long run unmaintainable anyway .
In other words , it would delay the release of Plasma by at least another year , with no long - term benefit at all .
The same goes for audio and video capabilities , all chat and PIM related capabilities , etc .
In other words , a LOT .
Innovation in technology will never go without changes .
Changes will never go without naysayers .
As much as we try to respect both sides , the desktop has hardly seen any real innovation in the last 15 to 20 years .
The KDE developers need some room for new ideas to be able to push the Free Desktop to the next generation of computers and computer users .

The dburns workaround :
In Kubuntu right clicking does not work the way it does in Mandriva .
After looking at my options for a while I opened up the " Add Widgets ... " option again and * then expanded the window * .
The Traditional Menu based application launcher was now a selection .
You could not tell the old menu was there unless the window was expanded .
This was not here before , but there were a few things I downloaded for KDE4 the other day and the option might have been installed then .
WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration plans to shift nearly $ 230 million in aid to Pakistan from counterterrorism programs to upgrading that country ’s aging F - 16 attack planes , which Pakistan prizes more for their contribution to its military rivalry with India than for fighting insurgents along its Afghan border .
Some members of Congress have greeted the proposal with dismay and anger , and may block the move .
Lawmakers and their aides say that F - 16s do not help the counterterrorism campaign and defy the administration ’s urgings that Pakistan increase pressure on fighters of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in its tribal areas .
The timing of the action caught lawmakers off guard , prompting some of them to suspect that the deal was meant to curry favor with the new Pakistani prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , who will meet with President Bush in Washington next week , and to ease tensions over the 11 members of the Pakistani paramilitary forces killed in an American airstrike along the Afghan border last month .
The financing for the F - 16s would represent more than two - thirds of the $ 300 million that Pakistan will receive this year in American military financing for equipment and training .
Burning Man and safer sex /
Free your mind , but watch out for crabs
While attendees of the yearly arts festival known as Burning Man come from all over the nation and the world , the impact of the costly desert bacchanalia is felt pretty strongly around San Francisco .
Many rejoice at the sudden lack of rich hippies and art cars dripping Barbie heads and Legos onto the roads when fog breaks down cheap art - store epoxy , and the ease with which one can get brunch in the Mission .
There are virtually no white dudes with dreadlocks for seven square miles .
San Francisco smug levels ratchet back to tolerable in the absence of arty hipster trust fund brats and Web 2.0 lets - resurrect - Pets.com - as-a- vlog leeches .
Super annoying guys do n't hit on me in bars assuming I know what the hell they 're talking about when they use terms like " the burn , " " the man " and " off the grid . "
And at house parties , there are no chicks that become uncontrollably drunk and then attempt to show you how they can " fire dance , " accidentally setting fire to the host 's potted plant / small dog / infant .
Making the e-mail rounds a few weeks ago -- and sent to me by more than one high - profile local sex educator -- was a snarky list of ways to " enjoy Burning Man at home . "
The list included many observations about the experience , like :
Before eating any food , drop it in a sandbox and lick a battery .
Stack all your fans in one corner of the living room .
Put on your most fabulous outfit .
Turn the fans on full blast .
Dump a vacuum cleaner bag in front of them .
Buy a new set of expensive camping gear .
Break it .
Get so drunk you can't recognize your own house .
Walk slowly around the block for five hours .
Have a 3 a.m. soul - baring conversation with a drag nun in platforms , a crocodile and Bugs Bunny .
Be unable to tell if you 're hallucinating .
Lust after Bugs Bunny .
Cut , burn , electrocute , bruise , and sunburn various parts of your body .
Forget how you did it .
Do n't go to a doctor .
Pay an escort of your affectional preference subset to not bathe for five days , cover themselves in glitter , dust , and sunscreen , wear a skanky neon wig , dance close naked , then say they have a lover back home at the end of the night .
For those of us who work in the sexual health professions , it 's the last bit that seems a bit mild .
For while we San Franciscans might make fun of the event and its customers ( and be intrigued by its lawsuits ) , we do love that it 's a sex- positive , inclusive gathering that celebrates art and community , and fosters -- even strongly emphasizes -- tolerance among all genders and orientations .
But what some of us do n't love is the noticeable impact on local STD clinics and call centers when the " burners " come home .
Here at home among clinic workers and sex hotline operators , our thoughts are about the souvenirs that keep on giving long after the man has burned , you 've thrown away a car full of garbage at a " leave no trace " event , and the ozone has thinned a bit more .
Maybe it's a coincidence that local health workers have complained to me that they think there 's a noticeable increase in STD testing around the Bay Area after Labor Day weekend , presumably from those who found bliss and new friends for life ( of the genital virus variety ) while spreading the , um , love and art at Black Rock City .
According to one local clinic worker who requested anonymity for this piece , " What we usually see is both a weekly trend and a seasonal trend in STD and pregnancy testing .
For example , Mondays are always the day we get lots of requests for Plan B .
We see a huge rise in pregnancy and STD testing ( and , more telling than the number of tests , the number of positive results ) in the summer and around the holidays . "
Holidays like Christmas -- or Labor Day ?
To wit : The Man might be burning , but so is your ass .
It 's no wonder the attendees are called " burners . "
Think about it .
Before you go , have mock - Burning Man sex , just for fun .
Lube up a condom with playa dust or the kitty litter of your choosing .
Have anonymous sex with people who have n't showered or used a functional bathroom in a week ;
This is easily accomplished around Stanyan and Haight .
Have a theme party featuring creative enlightenment peppered with drug busts , heatstroke and , um , community .
Dolores Park is a good location for the last three on that list .
I have a lot of friends who go to Burning Man .
But before you end up at Herpes Camp holding a cardboard sign that reads " will trade ice for antibiotics and Famvir , " pack your safer - sex gear , boundaries and some sexual common sense along with that fabulous outfit you 're about to ruin with dust and sweat .
Whether inebriated on community , ingestibles or gorgeous steam - powered art , not everyone is telling their potential sex partners that they 're infected before engaging in sex acts -- or maybe they do n't know they 're infected , or are too filthy with playa dust to see an outbreak .
When you 're reluctant to screen a new sex partner ( asking about STDs and using a condom ) , keep in mind that HIV will eventually kill you , herpes and HPV last a lifetime and the latter is linked to cervical cancer .
Does that white Rasta hippie in caked clown makeup still look worth it ?
Infections love dark , moist areas , heat and dirt , and unlike you , they get into Black Rock City for free .
Carry baby wipes to keep yourself clean ;
Look for ones that are alcohol - free , unscented and pH balanced .
Do n't buy ones with added oils and moisturizers if you plan on using latex condoms -- and please plan on using condoms ( not just for keeping your camera dust - free ) .
Use latex or polyurethane ( non-latex ) condoms , and do n't get any oil near your latex .
You can use oil with your non-latex condoms but use lots of lube , as they do n't stretch like latex and might break if they dry out .
Avoid animal skin condoms at all costs , as they are not proven effective against HIV transmission .
Buy and carry a pack of latex or non-latex gloves , as your ( and your partner 's ) hands will be filthy , and genital contact with germs will give you an infection , especially if you can't clean yourself off afterward .
Also , if you 're not sure that your sex partner is virus - free , a glove for a hand job might save you accidental transmission of the virus or infection to your eyes , nose , mouth or elsewhere later .
And no , you can't just lick all the dust off and have everything be OK .
Unprotected oral sex is still a risk .
Going down on a woman is a low risk activity for herpes and HPV , unless she 's having an outbreak .
Then you 're getting a gift that keeps on giving ( yes , HPV can blossom like a pretty bouquet in your throat ) .
One in three men and women carries HPV ( genital / oral warts ) , and many do n't know it because the virus might not show up for years .
Use a condom when giving a new male partner a blow job if you want to be absolutely safe .
If he objects , you know you have a loser on your hands ( but at least not in your mouth ) .
Additionally , you lower your risk for contracting an oral virus if you do not brush your teeth -- tooth brushing opens tiny cuts around your gums to make you bleed , giving viruses the ultimate ticket to the burn in your bloodstream .
So that naked guy with socks and Birkenstocks with the gnarly , clotted teeth ?
Mustache rides are free in the desert , ladies !
Herpes Camp is n't on the map , but you should know your way around it .
It 's true that you can contract herpes when the virus is shedding ( the period prior to an outbreak when there are no visible sores ) , but generally , people with herpes can tell when they 're shedding , and wo n't engage in sex during this time .
Medications like Famvir are extremely effective in preventing outbreaks , so if your partner discloses their herpes status but is on a medication such as Famvir and are in the clear for sex , your chances of contracting herpes are extremely low .

While its customers are still puzzling over why Vista Media Center
is suddenly refusing to record over - the - air NBC digital TV , Microsoft has come out
with an astounding admission , courtesy of Greg Sandoval at CNet News :
" Microsoft included technologies in Windows based on rules set forth by the ( Federal Communications Commission ) , " a Microsoft spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail to CNET News.com .
" As part of these regulations , Windows Media Center fully adheres to the flags used by broadcasters and content owners to determine how their content is distributed and consumed . "
Microsoft 's statement shines light on how Microsoft expects Media Center to
behave .
If this is the company 's explanation for what users are seeing when attempting
to record digital NBC broadcasts over - the - air , then Microsoft is saying Vista
obeys the broadcast flag : a requirement rejected by courts and Congress .
The FCC regulation that Microsoft 's spokesperson says
it follows is not in force - that is , there is no legal requirement
for them to follow these rules .
They were rejected by the D.C. Circuit of Appeals
in a case brought forward by librarians , public interest and consumer groups
( including EFF and Public Knowledge ) .
Microsoft is not complying with the FCC :
it is complying with the " broadcasters and content owners " who so dearly wanted
the flag in place , and failed to manage it .
Even if Microsoft somehow believes the FCC regulations still apply , they are going far beyond mere compliance .
Here 's the FCC's
href= " http://w2.eff.org/IP/broadcastflag/20031104_fcc_order.pdf ">rulemaking
on
the flag :
In light of our decision to adopt a redistribution control
scheme and to avoid any confusion , we wish to reemphasize that our action
herein in no way limits or prevents consumers from making copies of digital
broadcast television content .
... [ The aim of the broadcast flag ] will not ... interfere with or preclude
consumers from copying broadcast programming and using or redistributing it
within the home or similar personal environment as consistent with copyright
law .
Here is Microsoft 's interpretation of an over - the - air flag :
Note how Vista forbids recording this broadcast program at all : exactly what the FCC said the flag should not do .
( The
broadcast flag requirements allowed you to record TV , but required the recorded
material be " protected " to prevent you from redistributing it beyond approved
and locked - down devices ) .
In Microsoft 's attempt to " fully adhere ' , they have gone
beyond what the FCC ever asked them to do : they have agreed to what broadcast and content owners could only dream of passing by fiat .
Microsoft 's attempt to cover its behavior by claiming compliance with the
FCC neither explains nor justifies the errors that their customers are
currently seeing .
The company needs to spell out exactly whose rules Vista is
following , and exactly how they affect their customers computers ' current and
future behavior .
Simon had a great job .
Every day he was playing with cool hardware and software , he liked his colleagues , and the pay ... well ...
OK , he was underpaid .
Vastly underpaid .
While his company made good on their promise to give him a raise once he got a C certification , it was an insulting two figures .
Simon would 've felt less insulted if they 'd literally slapped him in the face ( instead of figuratively ) .
It did n't take him long to line up some interviews and get a job offer for a position that sounded just as interesting , with the added benefit of a reasonable level of compensation .
Once Simon made his intentions to leave clear , his boss started worrying — they needed someone to take over for Simon , and not having any spare staff , they had to hire someone quick .
Simon 's boss pulled him aside and asked him to draft a test with some basic questions to weed out the hacks .
Simon got started on a test that had questions ranging from braindead easy to moderately challenging .
He tried to come up with questions that would make someone think , but not frustrate them .
Ten questions seemed a reasonable amount , so that was his goal .
The first question was one of the harder ones —
" Explain how a modulus 11 checksum works and write an example of how it would work in pseudocode . "
The next several questions were about simple VB and C syntax ( remove an element from a linked list , write a sorting algorithm , etc. ) .
The last question , however , was tough .
You 're writing code in a programming language that you 've never used before .
You have no documentation about the language except the other code .
Complete the following function : ...
Simon included some actual production code from one such system .
The company had several machines that ran on long lost programming languages , and long lost manuals and reference sheets except for a few copies written in German , French , or Chinese ( with large sections of pages missing ) , or they were transcribed on stone tablets in glyphs that no one on the team could decipher .
So the developers at the company had to think on their feet and really pay attention to existing syntax .
Simon did n't intend for the question to be answered correctly , but rather to see the candidate 's approach to it .
He finished preparing the test the same day he gave his two weeks notice , and the candidates started coming in over the next few days .
The goal was to have Simon train his replacement .
Business continued like it usually did over the next few days , though Simon had yet to meet any candidates that had passed the initial screening process .
One day when Simon was in his boss 's office working on his computer , when he spotted something strange .
It was a completely filled out test , with answers that were not totally correct .
This is a BS question !
A child could do this one .
First year programming question .
( which was the point )
Who wrote this crap ?
You should fire him !
I would be embarrassed to answer such a stupid question .
This question makes no sense at all !
Stupid ! ...
For most questions , it was full of complaints about the exam .
For the tougher questions , it was complaints that the questions did n't make sense .
Simon wondered whether it was his boss that had written these responses to the test ( and that he'd soon be told to write another test ) , but the handwriting did n't look like his boss's ...
He put it out of his mind and focused on other tasks .
If his boss wanted a rewrite , Simon would wait to hear from him .
He was curious how the hunt was going , though , so he asked .
" Any luck finding a replacement ? "
" Actually , yes , " his boss replied with a smile .
He looked as though he'd just been relieved of a huge burden .
" Turns out my nephew is really good with computers , so we 're going to give him the job ! "
" So ... he did OK on the exam then ? "
" Oh , yeah , he did great !
In fact , he said it was too easy and that he could 've done much harder questions ! "
Weird .
Simon had n't provided an answer key , since he'd have to grade the more open - ended questions on his own after each applicant finished .
His boss did n't have the technical knowledge to review the tests .
" I 'd like to see his test if you do n't mind . "
" Uhh ... err ... we already offered him the job . "
Simon had no response ; all he could do was stare .
" So there 's really no point , He 'll be in tomorrow . "
Simon blinked twice and continued staring .
He was irritated that he'd spent all that time drafting the test , only to have it swept under a rug by someone complaining that it was too easy .
I guess I 'll withhold judgment until I see the kid's chops , Simon thought .
The following day , Ryan came in and began his training .
After a few minutes with Ryan , Simon could tell that Ryan could n't program , and in fact Simon even doubted that Ryan had ever used a computer before .
He 'd put together an intense training schedule that would barely fit in the remaining days he'd be on the job , but they did n't even get through a half day 's worth of material in the first day .
The first few days involved basic math training , and going over what a bit , byte , binary , hex , etc. were .
After explaining hex to Ryan , a revealing question was asked .
" So , like , hex can be a number or a letter between ' A ' and ' F ' , right ?
Are there any conditions where this is n't the case ? "
Simon closed his eyes for a second , then turned and focused on Ryan .
" What do you mean ? "
" Like , could it ever be a ' G ' , for example ? "
Simon 's inner voice was screaming loud enough that he was concerned Ryan might actually hear it .
He answered Ryan 's question and continued the training .
Hours passed , and Simon learned that Ryan was n't coy about anything .
At one point , he blurted out what his salary was — twice what Simon had been making .
As Simon 's last day loomed closer and closer , he tried to put Ryan on some of the equipment to let him learn for himself a bit .
A manager that worked in the area saw Ryan doing basically nothing all day aside from asking basic questions , taking bathroom trips , and frequent water cooler visits , and he was concerned that Simon had wasted the training time .
" Ryan , did you get any traini - I mean , who did you go through your training with ? "
" Simon , " he responded .
" But he did n't do a very good job of it , I hardly learned anything from him . "
Suspecting sabotage , the manager rounded up the other managers and called Simon into the conference room .
" Do you know why you 're here ? " they began .
Before Simon could open his mouth , they continued " We do n't think you trained Ryan very well .
We think you do n't care because your time is almost up here . "
His blood boiling , Simon could n't help but say exactly what was on his mind .
Fists clenched at his side , he yelled " This guy is a complete idiot !
He does n't know anything about computers , he does n't know anything about the business , and the only reason he was hired is because he 's related to Larry !
And that 's also why he 's making twice what I made ! "
After a brief flash of embarrassment that he'd gotten so worked up about it , he realized he had proof of Ryan 's incompetence .
" Look , I think we can clear this all up if we just look at his exam . "
The managers were stunned .
After a long pause , Simon 's boss ( Ryan 's uncle ) chimed in .
" Uh ... w- I lost it . "
" OK , " Simon replied , " how about re-interviewing him ? "
Ryan 's uncle started to respond , " uh , I do n't think that 's neces - "
" Fine , bring him in , " one of the other managers said .
Simon was asked to leave the room .
Hours later , Simon was summoned back to the conference room .
All of the managers other than Ryan 's uncle were there .
" Look , we 're sorry .
Turns out you were right —
Ryan does n't know anything .
Is there any chance you can stay on ? "
" Sorry , " Simon said .
" I 've already accepted another offer . "
" We 'll pay you what we were paying Ryan ! "
Simon buried his face in his hands , slowly looking up .
" Look , my new employer made me a better offer , and how could I possibly want to work here after what happened ? "
He 'd taken all he could , so he just got up and left the room , finishing the day working quietly at his desk .
To blow off steam , he got together with a friend later that night and complained about the whole messed up situation .
" So , like , they 're hiring now ? " his friend asked .
" Well , yeah , but did you listen to everything I said ? "
" Yeah , but that 's more than I 'm making now .
Who can I send my résumé to ? "
A few days later , Simon 's friend was offered a job right after his interview .
Meanwhile , Ryan is still working at the company .
He was moved to a manual labor position , however .
World 's first cyber heart hailed as revolution for surgeons
London doctors today unveiled the world ’s first ' cyber ' heart , which they believe will revolutionise cardiac care .
The 3D computer model was developed by consultant cardiac anaesthetist Sue Wright at The Heart Hospital and is set to bring training into the 21st century .
Experts say the technology is the biggest advance since Leonardo da Vinci transformed understanding of the heart 500 years ago .
Breakthrough : Doctors Andrew Smith , Sue Wright and Bruce Martin show off the virtual heart
It is expected to improve the accuracy of cardiac operations and speed up surgery times .
Doctors can ' slice ' through the model displayed on a computer screen to show the internal structures of the heart .
In detail : The World 's first cyber heart is hoped to revolutionise cardiac training
Trainee surgeons currently train using text books , video clips and heart scanning — which is labour intensive and carries risks for patients .
Students can now study the organ by looking at a computer screen .
The virtual heart was developed with a digital animation firm .
Glassworks , based in Soho , is best known for special effects such as its goblin in a TV commercial for soft drink Sprite .
Ms Wright said : ' We ’re hoping that the NHS will use this animated heart to revolutionise training . '
Ron Suskind has a new book coming out called : " The Way of the World : A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism "
It has some explosive information about the White House 's plan to forge documents to persuade the American public that we should attack Iraq .
This is incredible stuff .
Suskind appeared on the TODAY show and gave his first interview about it ... He says it 's " one of the great lies in modern political history . "

George " Slam dunk " Tenet denied the report , but there 's this Sunday Telegraph article that describes what happened .
Worse than Watergate .
I 've used notes from CBS 's Dan Raviv to highlight the action :
His new book THE WAY OF THE WORLD is about the war on terrorism and the Bush Administration since 9/11 and especially since invading Iraq in March ' 03 .
( You can easily Google details of the alleged letter from " Habbush " to Saddam Hussein dated July 1 , 2001 , which says ( future ) 9/11 hijacker was trained in Baghdad , AND that Iraq received shipments from Niger . ) [..]
The book reports ( or charges ) that the Bush White House faked a letter from Saddam Hussein 's intelligence chief to President Saddam in late 2003 , backdating it to July 2001 and reports that Saddam 's intelligence chief ( Habbush ) was in the protective custody of the C.I.A. at the time -- even while the U.S. military had him in the " deck of cards , " a list of Saddam officials wanted dead - or - alive .
The White House ordered the C.I.A. to arrange for Habbush to write the fake letter in his own handwriting .
The controversial letter did find itself to the world media in December ' 03 .
Habbush was in the deck of cards -- the ( approx . 50 ) Saddam officials wanted dead - or - alive by the U.S. after the March 2003 invasion -- while in reality he was in C.I.A. protection .
And in October 2003 , Habbush was paid $ 5 million by the C.I.A. AFTER the C.I.A. asked Habbush to write -- in his own handwriting and in a convincing way -- the note that the White House suggested .
Britain 's Sunday Telegraph in December '03 caused a sensation by reporting the discovery in Baghdad of that letter ... and a few days later NEWSWEEK reported strong doubts that the letter was genuine .
Among other things , experts wondered , why would Saddam 's intel chief write about both Atta & nuclear material in the same letter ?
Exact quotes from pp. 369-372 of Suskind 's book are in bold print below :
In the months before the U.S. - British invasion of Iraq , British intelligence had secret meetings in Amman , Jordan , with Habbush , chief of Saddam 's intelligence network .
Habbush demanded a safe way out , if - and - when the U.S. invaded .
Habbush repeatedly told the British that Saddam had no WMD ; all programs had ended in the 1990's ; and the book says the Bush White House did n't want to hear it - and did n't want to hear more reports on what Habbush was saying .
The U.S. invaded in March ' 03 .
Habbush was ready .
He slipped out of Baghdad with the help of U.S. intelligence and into Amman ...
In October ' 03 , CIA paid Habbush $ 5 million as part of his resettlement .
By then , the White House had finally thought of a way to use Habbush .
... The White House had concocted a fake letter from Habbush to Saddam , backdated to July 1 , 2001 .
It said that 9/11 ringleader Mohammed Atta had actually trained for his mission in Iraq -- thus showing , finally that there was an operational link between Saddam and al Qaeda ...
The letter also mentioned suspicious shipments to Iraq from Niger set up with al Qaeda 's assistance .
The idea was to take the letter to Habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of Iraqi government stationery , to make it look legitimate .
CIA would then take the finished product to Baghdad and have someone release it to the media .
Even five years later , ( Rob Richer , who worked in CIA for 30 years and was in charge of " clandestine ops " in the Middle East - - now working as an executive at Blackwater USA and in line to be CEO of Blackwater according to this book ) remembers looking down at the creamy White House stationery on which the assignment was written .
" The guys from the Vice President 's office were just barraging us in this period with one thing after another : Run down this lead , find out about that .
It was nonstop .
Of course , this was different .
This was creating a deception . "
Richer passed the directive down the chain , to the Iraq Operations Group .
( ( IOG was a CIA team co-led by John Maguire , clearly also a source for Suskind ) ) ...
" When it was discussed with me , I just thought it was incredible , " Maguire recalls .
" A box - checking of all outstanding issues in one letter , from one guy . " ... Suskind is NOT able to report exactly how it was done , whether Habbush himself definitely did it , but reports what you can find through Google searches :
The Sunday Telegraph reported the letter ; it caused a sensation .
Suskind does report that Richer remembers George Tenet passing to him the White House 's orders to concoct that letter .
Suskind asserts that it's an apparently illegal act , to forge or concoct that fake letter to Saddam . :
Under a 1991 amendment to the statutes that in 1947 created CIA and that govern its actions , there is a passage that reads , " No covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence United States political processes , public opinion , policies , or media . "
The operation created by the White House and passed to the CIA seems inconsistent with those statutory requirements .
... It is not the sort of offense that brings jail time .
It is much broader than that ... the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings . "
An excellent job by Dan Raviv .
All this makes you wonder how the outing of Valerie Plame must have really pissed off the CIA , does n't it ?
This is just an observation , but if they wanted to plant the evidence , it normally would have been done a little better than this .
Remember the Italian reporter that refused to print the Niger yellowcake connection to Iraq because she thought it was a forgery ?
The Guardian is reporting that Italian intelligence warned the United States about bogus information on Saddam Hussein 's nuclear ambitions at about the time President Bush cited them as a crucial reason for invading Iraq , an Italian parliamentarian said yesterday .
Oh , and I almost forgot this C&L post for more context : The Italian Letter :
I just cracked it open , but Jonathan Schwarz has been reading it and finds : " Goodman thanked Foley for addressing the students and asked him what weapons of mass destruction he believed would be found after the invasion .
" Not much , if anything , " Goodman recalled that Foley responded .
Foley declined to be interviewed for this book "
So why , then , would WINPAC report that Iraq had WMD ?
Here 's the answer ( p. 119 ) : One day in December 2002 , Foley called his senior production managers to his office .
He had a clear message for the men and women who controlled the output of the center 's analysts :
" If the president wants to go to war , our job is to find the intelligence to allow him to do so . "
The directive was not quite an order to cook the books , but it was a strong suggestion that cherry - picking and slanting not only would be tolerated , but might even be rewarded … read on
Impeachment anybody ?
The email :
" In this week 's interview , Senator McCain did not rule in or rule out a White House meeting with President Zapatero , a NATO ally , " he said in an e-mail .
" If elected , he will meet with a wide range of allies in a wide variety of venues but is not going to spell out scheduling and meeting location specifics in advance .
He also is not going to make reckless promises to meet America 's adversaries .
It 's called keeping your options open , unlike Senator Obama , who has publicly committed to meeting some of the world 's worst dictators unconditionally in his first year in office . "
I thought Zapatero was the prime minister , not president .
Spain has a monarchy .
But this is the McCain campaign .
They have no clue about foreign policy , except the permanent search for new and more enemies .

People who took magic mushrooms were still feeling the love more than a year later , and one might say they were on cloud nine about it , scientists report in the Journal of Psychopharmacology .
" Most of the volunteers looked back on their experience up to 14 months later and rated it as the most , or one of the five most , personally meaningful and spiritually significant of their lives , " comparing it with the birth of a child or the death of a parent , says neuroscientist Roland Griffiths of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , who led the research .
" It 's one thing to have a dramatic experience you say is impressive .
It 's another thing to say you consider it as meaningful 14 months later .
There 's something about the saliency of these experiences that 's stunning . "
Griffiths gave 36 specially screened volunteers psilocybin , the active ingredient in so - called magic mushrooms .
The compound is believed to affect perception and cognition by acting on the same receptors in the brain that respond to serotonin , a neurotransmitting chemical tied to mood .
Afterward , about two thirds of the group reported having a " full mystical experience , " characterized by a feeling of " oneness " with the universe .
When Griffiths asked them how they were doing 14 months later , the same proportion gave the experience high marks for transcendental satisfaction , and credited it with increasing their well - being since then .
But some scientists noted that this psilocybin study was just the first trip on a long journey of understanding .
" We do n't know how far we can generalize these results , " cautions neuroscientist Charles Schuster of Loyola University Chicago and a former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
" To attribute all of this to the drug , I think , is a mistake and to expect the same effects from simply taking the drug without this careful preparation in these kinds of people would be a mistake . "
Herbert Kleber , who directs the division of substance abuse at Columbia University also notes that it is difficult to assess the mushroom 's impact without detailed information on how individual lives were changed .
For example , it remains unclear from the study whether volunteers really were more altruistic or simply claimed to be .
But the findings do seem to support reports of recreational users and what LSD guru and 1960s counterculture icon Timothy Leary made famous in his psychedelic lab at Harvard University .
Griffiths and Schuster are proponents of future research on psilocybin to determine whether it has long - term influence on the brain — and whether the reported mystical effects affect memory alone or stem from other physiological changes .
This study is among the first of so - called " shrooms " in four decades , coming after the widespread , illegal use of hallucinogens as recreational drugs in the 1960s , which turned off corporate and academic researchers .
" I do n't think the evidence is sufficiently strong for any beneficial effect in general for us to consider changing the legality of these substances until a great deal more research is done , " Schuster says .
" But the illegality should not interfere with this research . "
For his part , Griffiths is now recruiting terminally ill cancer patients for a trial that will test whether psilocybin mitigates the existential anxiety that comes with facing death .
Strangely enough , he says , it may also be a salve for alcoholism and drug addiction .
" It does sound counterintuitive , " Griffiths says .
But , " six of the 12 AA [ Alcoholics Anonymous ] steps are related to a higher power and surrendering to it .
Many people do n't engage fully into the 12 - step program because they do n't have a connection to a higher power .
One can't help but wonder whether an experience like this might be useful . "
Sens. Diane Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) and Mel Martinez ( R - Fla . ) authored a bill ( with 11 co-sponsors , including Sen. Barack Obama ) that was incorporated into a housing bill passed by the Senate Banking Committee 19 - 2 before the Memorial Day recess — a bill that creates a national fingerprint registry .
According to a Martinez press release , the language merely “ create[s ] national licensing and oversight standards for residential mortgage originators . ”
One of the standards , John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute says , may “ require thousands of individuals working even tangentially in the mortgage and real estate industries — and not suspected of anything — to send their prints to the feds . ”
This is a step in the wrong direction — at least for a nation that preserves freedom .
• Three babies dead and more than 6,000 taken ill • 18 suspects arrested over scare and 87 questioned
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
Police in China arrested 12 more people today as investigations continue into a milk powder scandal that has killed three babies .
More than 6,000 infants in the country have been taken ill since being fed batches of contaminated milk formula last week .
Local officials knew about the problem for more than a month before they alerted central authorities , it emerged yesterday .
So far , 18 suspects have been arrested in connection with the health scare , while a further 87 people have been summoned for questioning .
News of the contamination first began with reports that dozens of babies in Gansu province had developed kidney stones after drinking a milk formula that contained melamine , a chemical normally used in plastics .
Officials said that subsequent tests found affected batches at 22 of China 's 109 milk powder manufacturers , including its two biggest dairies , Mengniu and Yili Industrial Group .
The number of affected infants has soared .
The health minister , Chen Zhu , said that 6,244 babies had fallen ill , 1,327 were in hospital and 158 were suffering from acute kidney failure .
He expected the number of cases to rise .
Chen said that so far all the sick infants had consumed milk powder made by the Sanlu group , the country 's biggest formula producer .
Li Changjiang , the head of China 's quality control agency , said that 5,000 inspectors would monitor companies and all dairy products would be tested for melamine .
The chemical is banned from use in food , but adding it to watered - down milk makes the liquid appear higher in protein when tested .
China has sought to tighten its safety regime after a number of product scares .
In 2004 , more than 200 infants suffered malnutrition and at least 12 died after being fed formula containing no nutrients , and an estimated 1,500 dogs and cats died in the US last year after they consumed a melamine - tainted pet food ingredient manufactured in China .
The Sanlu case is particularly alarming because the recall took so long , and apparently required the intervention of the New Zealand government , which was alerted by Sanlu 's New Zealand - based partner Fonterra .
New Zealand 's prime minister , Helen Clark , said on Monday that she ordered her officials to leapfrog regional authorities and inform Beijing directly .
Today , Shi Guizhong , a spokesman for the Hebei provincial police , said government officials were starting a 10 - day campaign to focus on the melamine contamination .
Officers had also confiscated 300 kg ( 660 lb ) of suspected chemicals , including 490 pounds of melamine , he said .
One suspect , surnamed Su , told police that from February 2007 to July 2008 he bought 200 20kg sacks of melamine , and sold them all to milk suppliers , Shi told a news conference .
Yang Chongyong , the deputy governor of Hebei province , where Sanlu is based , said the firm received customer complaints from March .
But it was not until August 2 that it informed the city government of Shijiazhuang , the provincial capital .
Officials there waited more than a month , until September 9 , to inform their bosses in the provincial government .
The Hebei authorities took the problem to central government the following day .
Sanlu finally ordered a recall .
Andrew Ferrier , the chief executive of Fonterra , which owns 43 % of Sanlu , said it had urged disclosure " from day one " .
The state news agency Xinhua reported that the mayor and four other city officials of Shijiazhuang had been fired .
Sanlu 's general manager , Tian Wenhua , was arrested .
Four milk suppliers have been arrested and 22 detained .
China is the world 's second largest market for infant formula .
Ding Bing , the China coordinator for the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action , said : " The milk powder companies do advertisements which exaggerate the effects of their products and make the mothers doubt [ the quality of ] their own milk . "

Now that everyone agrees that oil is headed straight to $ 200 , what could get in the way ?
A global economic collapse , for one ( which wo n't be too long in the making if oil really does go to $ 200 ) .
And perhaps a nice cold bucket of water in the face from Washington .
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the country 's emergency oil supply and is only meant to be used in truly dire circumstances .
Congress and the White House are now mulling whether today fits that bill .
It does n't , of course .
But this might not stop Washington from trying to secure its own future by dipping into it ( WSJ ) :
In Washington , deepening fears that oil prices will shoot still higher have stoked talk in Congress and within the Bush administration of using one of the last remaining cudgels to try to reverse the price rise : a sharp and sustained release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Those discussions remain preliminary , though , while most senior administration officials remain opposed to such a move , because the oil stored in salt mines is meant for release in genuine supply emergencies ...
Some advocates are clamoring for the Bush administration to take a more dramatic step and release millions of barrels from the U.S. strategic reserves , which contain around 706 million barrels .
The House of Representatives is weighing legislation to force a release from the reserves , while support for such a move also appears to be building in the Senate
Releasing tens of millions of barrels obviously would n't have a long - term impact on prices : we guzzle 21 million barrels a day .
But it might burn some oil longs and make them less willing gamble on further prices increases .
Some pundits , of course , have resigned themselves to having no hope :
[ S ] ky - high prices have made refiners all the more reluctant to build up oil stocks .
" And even if you release 20 or 30 million barrels , people are still going to be worried about Iran or something else , " said Michael Lynch , a Massachusetts - based oil analyst who is among the many who believe that oil prices are already far too high .
Long - term problems require long - term solutions .

They are ripping her to shreds !
Whenever someone brings up old Windows , I think back to a game that I had as a kid , Balance of Power .
It was originally developed on the Mac , and had a windowy , mousy interface , so the PC port shipped with its own copy of Windows 1.0 , on two 5 ¼ " floppies .
As I was googling around in nostalgia , I came across Chris Crawford 's online version of the book about the game .
I have n't finished reading it , but so far it 's great , with detailed analsyses and historical examples of the real - world political phenomena represented in the game .
It 's also really funny in parts .
Here 's a bit about the religious component of insurgencies :
Westerns may think of religious insurgency in terms of recent [ 1985 - xach ] expressions of Islamic extremism , but religious factors played a large role in insurgencies during the Reformation and were the primary expression of insurgency during Roman times .
It is not that religion exerted life - and - death influence over people 's hearts and minds in these societies ; it 's just that churches were the primary locus of social activity in these societies .
Were a major insurgency to form in the United States , it would probably be based in shopping malls .
There 's an informative passage about the role of simulations and the role of games .
For simulations :
The military has used simulations since their creation in the 1830s by a Prussian staff officer .
On a large table with markers representing military units , officers consulting a detailed manual of rules maneuvered their armies in imaginary campaigns .
The training value of such simulations was scoffed at by other armies until 1866 and 1870 , when the Prussian army smashed first the Austro - Hungarian army and then the French army in two stunning campaigns .
The rest of the world very quickly adopted the use of military simulations .
For games :
A game is to a simulation as a painting is to a blueprint .
A painting of a house gives you an emotional impression of the house ; a blueprint of the house tells the carpenter exactly where to put the windowsill .
A game is no mere approximation of a simulation or a lower - quality version of a simulation .
Instead , a game focuses on presenting broader , less quantifiable concepts .
One would not use a painting as the basis for building a house , nor would one use a blueprint to convey his feelings about the house in which he spent his childhood .
Sprinkled throughout are historical examples of the game concepts ( insurgency , coups , international crises , etc ) , with statistics about success and failure , and their impact on the design of the game formulas .
For example , after discussing the successful riotous revolts in Haiti , Iran , and Poland , he concludes :
These examples of successful popular revolts are the exceptions , not the rule .
Civil unrest is the norm in many nations of the world and it boils into the streets with depressing frequency .
In all three of the above - cited cases , ( Haiti , Iran , and Poland ) , the leadership refused to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation until it was too late .
The reason for such a callous attitude is the frequency of civil disorder and its usual lack of issue .
Most of the time , the police crack down and the crowds disperse after venting their rage .
There have been some 10,000 riots in the last forty years ; about 100 , or 1 % of these , yielded a change of executive .
Little wonder that political leaders seldom see civil disorder as a threat to their jobs .
The last chapter is all about the development of the game itself .
It 's interesting to see a world where a guy can write an abstract , brainy geopolitical strategy game , for the Mac , on his Lisa , and eventually , with much difficulty , find a big audience for it .
So go read it !
It 's part 1985 time capsule , part far - ranging but easy - reading geopolitical power history , part game design philosophy , and part game development journal .
The style is accessible and informative .
And it 's free !

Voters Do Lie to Pollsters About Race– That ’s Black as Well as White Voters …
( Akiit.com ) Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama outwardly seems little worried that the polls could get it wrong on white attitudes toward his candidacy .
But the possibility that many whites could flat out lie to pollsters when they say that they have no problem voting for an African - American presidential candidate has gnawed at Democrats and those on Team Obama from the moment that he tossed his hat in the presidential ring .
A major study by university researchers called Project Implicit measured hidden biases on everything from weight , age and religion too gender and race .
They found deep and pervasive hidden bias on nearly every one of the tests among wide segments of the public .
That included race and voting .
The survey found that Obamaâ€™s Republican rival John McCain could get more votes in the states with relatively small black populations no matter what the polls said .
This possibility makes many Democrats squirm at polls that show Obama with only a paper tissue thin lead over McCain .
When the standard polling margin of error along with the refusal of many to answer polling questions is considered it makes trying to get an accurate gauge of voter sentiment even more fragile and volatile .
And the murkiness of hidden racial bias makes it even more problematic still .
Pollsters are doing everything they can to try and ferret out hidden bias in voting among whites .
They are asking end around questions such as what are the racial attitudes of their friends and relatives .
They are making cold calls and then identifying themselves by race ( white ) .
They are even directly asking respondents their race and whether they socialize with blacks .
Still some pollsters deny that race will be a factor in election poll predictions .
Some political analysts say that times and public attitudes have changed ; that there are more young voters , and they are more racially tolerant .
Whites , they say , turn on their TVs and see legions of black newscasters and talk show hosts , topped by TV ’s richest and most popular , Oprah Winfrey .
They see mega -rich black entertainers and athletes pampered and fawned over by a doting media and adoring public .
They see TV commercials that picture blacks living in trendy integrated suburban homes , sending their kids to integrated schools , and driving expensive cars .
They see blacks such as former Secretary of State Colin Powell , and his successor , Condoleezza Rice in high profile , important policy - making positions in the Bush administration .
They see dozens of black congresspersons , state legislators , and mayors .
They see blacks heading corporations , and universities .
This supposedly has radically leveled the racial playing field , and not only make color - coded bigotry unacceptable , but mostly a thing of the by - gone past .
Obviously , thatâ€™s not the case .
But Project Implicit researchers also found that hidden bias cuts both ways and that many blacks lie or misrepresent their views to voters on voting .
They as many whites donâ€™t want to come off sounding like racial bigots by giving the impression that they oppose McCain because heâ€™s white .
Many are just as adamant that their passion for Obama is not based solely on the fact that heâ€™s black .
The truth , of course , is that many blacks back Obama based exclusively on race .
The likelihood that they will flock to the polls in possible record numbers in several states excites Democrats , and many even encourage it by making subtle and not so subtle racial appeals , such as â€œhelp make history , â€ â€œour time has come , â€ â€ œThis will be a first.â€ 
So why do many blacks fib to pollsters about race ?
Even though itâ€™s politically tactless to revel in it , it has much to do with their legitimate sense that Obama will make history by being the first African - American in the White House .
But it also has much to do with faulty assumptions .
Many blacks erroneously believe that whites live an Ozzie and Harriet life of bliss and are immune from personal and social angst .
They are puzzled when middle - class whites shoot up their suburban schools , and neighborhoods , bludgeon their children in their homes , use and deal drugs , have high suicide rates and commit bizarre anti-social acts .
They do n’t hear and see their pain .
Many blacks do n’t recognize that millions of whites are also trapped in a downward cycle of need and poverty , and have about as much chance of crashing into America ’s corporate boardrooms , joining university faculties and getting elected to Congress as poor blacks .
The sense among many whites that they are fast losing economic and social ground in America
Then there â€˜s the even less socially correct view that whites are conniving , brutal , dishonest , and inherently untrustworthy in dealing with minorities .
The reality is that black and white voters arenâ€™t racial bigots .
They like to believe that they are open minded when it comes to judging a candidate , and that they wouldnâ€™t lie about their preferences .
Unfortunately , many do , and that makes making presidential predictions based on polls even shakier .

Midori aims to uncouple its software from the hardware it runs on Microsoft has kicked off a research project to create software that will take over when it retires Windows .
Called Midori , the cut - down operating system is radically different to Microsoft 's older programs .
It is centred on the internet and does away with the dependencies that tie Windows to a single PC .
It is seen as Microsoft 's answer to rivals ' use of " virtualisation " as a way to solve many of the problems of modern - day computing .
Tie breaking Although Midori has been heard about before now , more details have now been published by Software Development Times after viewing internal Microsoft documents describing the technology .
Midori is believed to be under development because Windows is unlikely to be able to cope with the pace of change in future technology and the way people use it .
Windows worked well in an age when most people used one machine to do all their work .
The operating system acted as the holder for the common elements Windows programs needed to call on .
" If you think about how an operating system is loaded , " said Dave Austin , European director of products at Citrix , " it 's loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine .
" The operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware , " he said .
That , he said , created all kinds of dependencies that arose out of the collection of hardware in a particular machine .
If Windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more OS agnostic where will Microsoft make its money ?
Michael Silver , Gartner
This means , he said , that Windows can struggle with more modern ways of working in which people are very mobile and very promiscuous in the devices they use to get at their data - be that pictures , spreadsheets or e-mail .
Equally , he said , when people worked or played now , they did it using a combination of data and processes held locally or in any of a number of other places online .
When asked about Midori by BBC News , Microsoft issued a statement that said : " Midori is one of many incubation projects underway at Microsoft .
It 's simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it . "
Virtual machines Midori is widely seen as an ambitious attempt by Microsoft to catch up on the work on virtualisation being undertaken in the wider computer industry .
Darren Brown , data centre lead at consulting firm Avanade , said virtualisation had first established itself in data centres among companies with huge numbers of servers to manage .
Putting applications , such as an e-mail engine or a database , on one machine brought up all kinds of problems when those machines had to undergo maintenance , needed updating or required a security patch to be applied .
By putting virtual servers on one physical box , companies had been able to shrink the numbers of machines they managed and get more out of them , he said .
" The real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing , " he said .
" Physically , there is less tin to manage . "
Windows ' history makes it hard to adapt to a more distributed age Equally , said Mr Brown , if one physical server failed the virtualised application could easily be moved to a separate machine .
" The same benefits apply to the PC , " he said .
" Within the Microsoft environment , we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others .
" Virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems , " he said .
Many companies were still using very old applications that existing operating systems would not run , he said .
By putting a virtual machine on a PC , those older programs can be kept going .
A virtual machine , like its name implies , is a software copy of a computer complete with operating system and associated programs .
Closing Windows
" On the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware , " said Dan Chu , vice president of emerging products and markets at virtualisation specialist VMWare .
Computer users in the future are likely to be much more mobile Some virtual machines , he said , acted like Windows PCs to all intents and purposes .
But many virtual machines were now emerging that were tuned for a particular industry , sector or job .
" People take their application , the operating system they want to run it against , package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client , " he said .
In such virtual machines , the core of the operating system can be very small and easy to transfer to different devices .
This , many believe , is the idea behind Midori - to create a lightweight portable operating system that can easily be mated to many different applications .
Microsoft 's licensing terms for Windows currently prohibited it acting this way within a virtual appliance , said Mr Chu .
Michael Silver , research vice president at Gartner , said the development of Midori was a sensible step for Microsoft .
" The value of Microsoft Windows , of what that product is today , will diminish as more applications move to the web and Microsoft needs to edge out in front of that , " he said .
" I would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around , " he said .
The big problem that Microsoft faced in doing away with Windows , he said , was how to re-make its business to cope .
" Eighty percent of Windows sales are made when a new PC is sold , " he said .
" That 's a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get .
" If Windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more OS agnostic where will Microsoft make its money ? " he asked .

What are these ?
Tagline : “ Only one news organization has the guts to tell it like it is … ”
Translation : … or at least compile some semi-hilarious crap into a 90 - minute DVD collection of comedy skits , one of which stars Steven Seagal !
The Verdict :
The consistently funny Onion News Network has finally made completed its * long overdue * feature - length movie , and it ’s headed straight to DVD , presumably because bongs are n’t allowed in movie theaters .
From this trailer ( which has apparently been around for a little while ) , it ’s still unclear whether it ’ll be a collection of short , funny clips sustained by a barely - there plot ( like “ Weird Al “ ‘s 1989 classic UHF ) , or a collection of short , funny clips without any plot whatsoever ( like The Kentucky Fried Movie or Robert Altman ’s Short Cuts ) .
Either way , the fake trailer for Steven Seagal ’s Cockpuncher ( which actually stars Steven Seagal ! ) will probably make it worth the cost of our Netflix subscription .
In fact , we ’d probably pay money to see Cockpuncher in a theater .
Update : The Onion cheerfully writes to let us know that this movie is old enough to predate the Onion News Network , which only launched last year .
We still want to see Cockpuncher .
Both presidential candidates have stumped for a new “ green ” economy .
To me this smells of the supposed transformation to the “ information economy ” touted only a decade ago .
Fortune had this to say on June 30th :
What senators McCain and Obama believe about U.S. energy policy matters – hugely .
To fight global warming , the next President will oversee the transition to a new , green economy , which will result in one of the biggest business transformations of the 21st century and potentially one of the largest transfers of wealth since the creation of the income tax .
Leaders , lauded by environmentalists for jumping on the green bandwagon , have promoted alternative energy technologies , alternative transportation , green homes , etc .
It is my belief that these politicians care less about the state of the environment , and more about maintaining the status quo growth of the economy .
The manufacturing economy in the 1970′s and 1980′s faced the insurmountable obstacles of higher energy prices , inflation , and globalization of trade , and rapidly declined .
While many continue to pin their hopes on the “ information age ” to continue to propel the US economy – technology stocks remain at less than half their value achieved in the initial boom , US economic growth has been anemic , and job creation minimal .
Decoupling of the information economy from the real economy did not take place , and the promises of six figure IT jobs for workers laid off from manufacturing jobs did not pan out .
Likewise , I fear the “ green economy ” , for all of the good that it may do for the environment , will be unable to be the next engine of economic growth .
Why not ?
The reasons are three - fold .
First , the credit crunch .
Business start - ups require infusions of capital in the form of business loans and venture capital .
If the current trend in business lending continues to worsen , funds will become less available for new businesses , and the higher interest rates may make borrowing unaffordable .
The highly technical nature of many “ green ” jobs and businesses require high start - up costs and a long term commitment .
Consumers , too , will find it difficult to finance large investments in personal alternative technologies , home upgrades , or retrofitting without access to cheap home equity loans .
The second factor that will limit the growth of green industries and infrastructure is the consumer ’s shrinking pocket book .
Electric - hybrid cars like the Chevy Volt promise to dramatically improve fuel mileage and transportation .
But at a cost of over $ 40,000 , how many struggling American families will be able to afford these vehicles ?
Promising alternative energy technologies , like solar electric and geothermal heating / cooling , also require massive up front costs .
While never having to pay a utility bill again sounds wonderful , the nearly $ 100,000 cost to do so ( Solar PV + Geothermal ) is cost prohibitive .
“ But surely costs will come down as the technologies are adopted , ” you say .
Maybe , maybe not .
If the cost of energy continues to rise , manufacturing processes and installation costs for solar and geothermal will also continue to rise .
Barring a massive government subsidy , these technologies may stay out the reach of many Americans for decades .
These subsidies if enacted would require increased taxation at the federal , state and local level .
With the economy on life support , tax revenues declining , and health care costs for aging baby boomers rising rapidly , how else will we pay for such a plan ?
While I support carbon taxes as a means to reduce greenhouse gases , surely the increased tax burden on consumers will reduce out of pocket spending .
The third factor is our crumbling infrastructure .
Today , many cities rely upon water and sewer systems that are over a century old .
The electric grid is aging and is incapable of supporting the proposed transition to 25 % renewable energy production .
Bridges , roadways , and rail system maintenance has been delayed over the years , and will require massive spending to maintain systems .
Projects like these require tremendous amounts of energy , and the expense grows each year that they are delayed .
The required spending on infrastructure projects will further strain state and local budgets with a resulting decline in available funds for “ green ” projects .
Our national debt is already approaching $ 10 trillion , a number that is quite unfathomable .
I do n’t want to give the wrong impression , I do favor programs to encourage home retrofitting , public transportation investment , and alternative energy projects .
I just worry about the ability of “ green ” technology to power the entire U.S. economy , given the dire straits we are in .
The reduced availability of cheap energy is reverberating through our economy .
Any actual shortages of gasoline , heating oil , and diesel would sound the death knell for our consumer driven economy .
Trying to fuel the US economy with “ green ” initiatives can be likened to trying to run all of our 250 million vehicles on ethanol .
Just because the technology exists , does n’t mean that it is feasible to do so .
My advice ?
When politicians start campaigning on “ green economies ” , make sure you listen to what they are saying out of the other side of their mouths .
You ’ve got to love the banking industry .
As our friends in the financial sector were passing the hat among taxpayers last week for $ 700 billion in bailouts to cover their crappy mortgage investments , they were simultaneously condemning the House of Representatives ’ passage of a “ Credit Cardholders ’ Bill of Rights , ” which aims to crack down on some of the industry ’s more troublesome practices .
The legislation -- HR 5244 -- would , among other things , end card issuers ’ self - proclaimed right to change interest rates at any time .
Instead , a 45 - day notice would be required for any increase .
It also would give cardholders more time to pay by requiring issuers to mail bills at least 25 days before the due date , as opposed to the current 14 days .

Similar measures are being considered by the Federal Reserve , the National Assn. of Credit Unions and the Office of Thrift Supervision .
But they would n’t carry the force of law and could be weakened by more industry - friendly regulators down the road .
The House bill still needs to be tackled by the Senate , and it ’s unclear what its chances are there .
The Bush administration has signaled its opposition to the legislation .
“ The timing of all this could n’t be more glaring , ” said Bill Hardekopf , chief exec of LowCards.com , a website that tracks credit card rates and trends .
“ While banks say they would be tanking without taxpayer money , here comes a bill that would help taxpayers , and the banks say it is n’t right .
“ I ’m amazed that there ’s not more humility at a time like this . ”
Advertisement
Humility ?
The banking industry could n’t have been bolder in its opposition to the House bill .
Within minutes of the 312 -112 vote approving the legislation , American Bankers Assn. President Edward Yingling issued a statement denouncing the move .
He said the bill would “ increase the cost of credit for consumers and small businesses across the country , result in less access to credit for consumers and businesses alike , and may further roil the securities markets -- all at a time when our economy can least afford it . ”
JPMorgan Chase & Co. , which became the largest U.S. bank by deposits Thursday when it acquired much of Washington Mutual Inc. , similarly wasted no time in blasting the House bill as the wrong medicine at the wrong time .
“ In today ’s turbulent economic times , consumers deserve a careful and balanced approach when considering potential changes to consumer credit and the credit card industry , ” the bank said in a statement .
“ Consumers have benefited from a competitive marketplace that allows for pricing based upon risk . ”
Advertisement
The banks essentially are arguing that enactment of the Credit Cardholders ’
Bill of Rights would make plastic more expensive for consumers by preventing issuers from imposing higher rates on riskier customers , although the bill includes no such language .
“ We are very concerned that this bill would significantly hinder our ability to price the risks of lending and would result in less credit being made available to creditworthy borrowers at the worst possible time , with generally higher prices for those who do receive credit , ” said Bank of America Corp. spokeswoman Betty Riess .
Nonsense .
“ They ’re using the I ’ll - take - my - toys - and - go - home argument , ” said Linda Sherry , a spokeswoman for Consumer Action .
“ But that wo n’t be the case .
They ’ll keep fighting for our business . ”
Advertisement
She said banks would still be able to offer competitive terms for preferred customers .
And for riskier customers , she said , banks could still raise rates or even do the unthinkable : turn them down for cards .
Maybe that would n’t be such a bad thing .
According to the Consumer Federation of America , the 50 million U.S. households that carry a credit card balance from month to month face an average debt load of $ 17,000 .
With the economy going down the toilet and home foreclosures at record levels , I can think of more than a few families that would benefit from less plastic in their lives .
A Credit Cardholders ’
Bill of Rights would level the playing field by protecting consumers from questionable late fees and sudden rate hikes , and requiring clear disclosure of terms and conditions .

That does n’t seem too much to ask of an industry that has no problem asking taxpayers to cover its bad bets .
Enjoy the bailout , boys .
This is n’t over yet .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - The Sydney Olympics ran out .
Athens doubled the number .
So organisers of the Beijing Games are hoping 100,000 condoms will satisfy the needs of Olympic athletes .
While sex is not an Olympic sport it is expected to be an activity in the Beijing village housing 10,500 athletes , all of whom are in great shape and with plenty of free time on their hands once knocked out of the Games .
Athletes have received free condoms at every Olympics since Barcelona in 1992 to help raise awareness of AIDS , and Beijing is no exception .
“ There are many young , strong , single people in the athletes ’ village and , like everywhere , some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available , ” Ole Hansen , spokesman for UNAIDS China , told Reuters .
“ A lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters . ”
The UNAIDS , the Beijing organising committee BOCOG and International Olympics Committee are providing 100,000 condoms as part of a campaign on HIV prevention and anti-discrimination .
At the Sydney Games in 2000 athletes quickly exhausted a supply of 70,000 and another 20,000 had to be brought in .
The Foundation for AIDS Research , amfAR , said 100,000 were distributed at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 after a plan to distribute 250,000 condoms met protests by religious groups and was scaled back .
At Athens in 2004 about 130,000 condoms were distributed .
Hansen said the number available at Beijing was based on previous Games ’ experience and in keeping with previous Olympics would be available at medical centres at athletes ’ centres in Beijing , Qingdao and Hong Kong rather than put in rooms .
“ We have people here from all religions and cultural backgrounds , some of whom may feel uncomfortable or offended with condoms in their room , ” he said .
To be discreet , two condoms are tucked inside every a brochure about HIV that are available at medical centres .
“ No one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment , ” said Hansen .
“ People are encouraged to take the leaflets and to take as many as they like .
They can use them or take them home for friends and spread the knowledge and awareness . ”
Chinese condom makers have jumped on the Olympics bandwagon .
One manufacturer , Elasun , has come up with a set of cheeky advertisements featuring a stickman swimming over a rippled condom that looks like a wave , riding two condom rings like a bicycle , and using a condom as a basketball hoop .
Condoms depicting the five Olympics mascots are also for sale on various online sites although nowhere to be seen in official merchandise stories .

AS I stand at the gas station filling my tank , the meter tallies how much it ’s going to cost me .
At this station , a gallon is $ 4.26 , and as the meter passes the $ 20 mark , then the $ 30 , I realize that I am paying too much attention to the price of gasoline .
I bet you are too .
Looking back at my family ’s expenses over the past few years , I see big increases in our health care costs and in how much we pay for food .
The rise in what we spend on gas is not nearly as extreme as our increases in categories like electricity and telephone .
So why does the amount we spend on gasoline feel so enormous ?
I think it is because of the way we buy gas .
For the several minutes that I stand at the pump , all I do is stare at the growing total on the meter  there is nothing else to do .
And I have time to remember how much it cost a year ago , two years ago and even six years ago .

Yet I have no such memory about the prices of items in any other category .
I have no idea how much milk was six years ago , how much bread was three years ago or how much yogurt was a week ago .
But I suspect that if I stood next to the yogurt case in the supermarket for five minutes every week with nothing to do but stare at the price , I would also know how much it has gone up  and I might become outraged when yogurt passed the $ 2 mark .
RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) -
The body of a Brazilian priest who floated out over the ocean suspended by hundreds of helium - filled party balloons , has been found off the coast of southeastern Brazil , police have confirmed .
The corpse of Father Adelir Antonio de Carli was spotted by a tugboat at sea near the city of Macae , three months after he disappeared while flying a contraption buoyed by balloons over the Atlantic Ocean in a fund - raising stunt .
“ We were almost certain that it was the priest due to various elements , such as the clothes and material used in the balloon trip , ” Macae ’s chief of police , Daniel Bandeira , said on Monday .
“ The DNA only confirmed our suspicions . ”
The priest disappeared on April 20 after he called friends from his mobile phone to say he was about to crash into the ocean .
He staged the stunt to help raise money for a chapel for truckers in his highway parish .
It has been a testing time for traders around the world
The last two major investment banks in the US have changed their status to become bank holding companies , allowing them to take deposits from investors .
The changes should enable Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to raise more funds by opening commercial banks .
The move - part of a huge restructuring effort on Wall Street - will also give them access to Federal Reserve support .

Both presidential candidates have been having their say about the financial crisis .
Republican John McCain said President George W Bush should take the blame for the crisis along with both parties in Congress .
Mr McCain said he was enraged by the greed of Wall Street speculators and said the rescue plan should be funded by cutting government waste , rather than through taxation .
Meanwhile Democrat presidential candidate Barack Obama suggested Mr Paulson could be asked to play a role in his administration should he win the presidency .
But Mr Obama criticised the bail - out proposal , calling for independent supervision of its implementation .

If Ashin Zawta has his way , the next time the government of Burma ( Myanmar ) clamps down on dissent it will have to deal with a new force : monks with guns .
" Last September the Army proved too powerful for us and defeated our nonviolent tactics , " says the young monk , whose real name , like those of other activists in this story , has been changed for security reasons .
" We need weapons .
That is the only way we can bring down this regime . "
One year after monks led thousands in Burma 's largest antigovernment protests in 19 years , many activists say they are losing patience with the slow pace of change .
Up against a powerful regime , they are calling for fresh tactics , from teaching human rights theory to stockpiling arms .
" The younger activists ' frustrations are growing .
They want to take up arms because they were so brutally suppressed last September .
They have gone their whole lives without seeing change , " says Win Min , an expert on Burmese political affairs at Thailand 's Chiang Mai University .
While the activists turning toward violence still form a minority , young monks have never before openly advocated violence , and this may signal a new phase in the evolution of the political opposition , says Mr. Win .
Burma 's military government killed dozens of protesters and detained at least 800 in August and September 2007 when a surge in fuel prices sparked large demonstrations , led by Burma 's widely respected monks .
The stark defeat of the uprising – which became known as the Saffron Revolution , for the monks ' deep - red robes – left many younger activists questioning the prevailing political wisdom .
Though Buddhism is traditionally associated with nonviolence , Mr. Zawta says the junta does not respect life or Buddhism , forcing some monks to take this extreme position .
" The regime is like a rabid dog , " Mr. Zawta says .
" It bit us and infected us with militancy .
The old ways are n't working – the only solution is to arm the people .
" Some of the old monks preach caution and tell us to focus on patience and the Buddhist way , " he continues .
" But many of us are realizing that we have to go out there and do something . "
New tactics : teach rights , deliver aid
The younger monks are more active , Zawta says , adding that more are learning English so they can communicate with international media and expose conditions inside the country .
As with many young monks , last year 's protests politicized Zawta .
He forged links with the All Burmese Monks Alliance ( ABMA ) , an underground network of activist monks that formed in the wake of last September 's crackdown .
The Alliance , which has become a leading underground opposition group , gives political sermons and organizes aid delivery to Burma 's south , which was devastated by cyclone Nargis in May .
Most monasteries in Burma provide free education to the community 's poor , including lessons in English , math , and Buddhism .
But Zawta and other Alliance - affiliated monks have supplemented the curriculum with a dose of human rights theory and political history .
" Most young people do n't even know about 1988 , " he says , referring to the failed uprising of that year .
Years ago such overt anti-regime talk in monasteries would have been unthinkable .
But members of the post - September generation say monks can no longer play a secondary role in Burmese politics .
This new focus comes with a price , however .
Authorities have cracked down on the monk movement , arresting many of the leaders of last year 's protests .
Earlier this month , intelligence agents raided a monastery in Rangoon , Burma 's main city , and arrested a senior monk .
The government also recently derobed ABMA leader U Ashin Gambira and plans to try him on sedition charges .
Some leading monks have fled for Thailand , while others remain in country and work underground , surreptitiously distributing leaflets and facilitating other activists ' work .
The Monks Alliance has housed activists being hunted by the government in their monasteries .
Older activists : too cautious ?
The security dragnet is forcing some groups , such as the semi-legal National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi , to operate with caution .
During the September demonstrations , NLD 's central committee urged party members to avoid the protests , though it verbally supported the monks .
" But the youth [s ] started helping the monks anyway , and they defied party orders and marched , " says Nay Shi Shwe , a leader of the NLD 's youth wing .
" There is definitely frustration with the leadership , " he continues .
Young people " think that this is a good opportunity to fight the dictatorship , but the old men are taking too much time .
They want to wait until 2010 " – the year of scheduled elections – " but we want action now . "
Older activists of the NLD , whose election win in 1990 was ignored by the ruling junta , say that too open an association with proscribed groups and illegal demonstrations may jeopardize the party 's hard - fought semi-legal status and disqualify them from the 2010 elections .
But to some , the party seems to be caught in suspension , without a coherent policy to address the current political climate .
" The NLD is slowly losing relevancy , " says a member of the underground group , the 88 Generation Students .
Still a unifier : Aung San Suu Kyi
But while the NLD stagnates , youths , monks , and underground activists agree that Ms. Suu Kyi , who has been under house arrest for 12 of the past 18 years , is the only figure who can unite the opposition and revitalize the party .
When Suu Kyi reportedly refused to meet the United Nations envoy to Burma , Ibrahim Gambari , a few weeks ago , the hopes of many activists who are frustrated with the UN and NLD jumped .
" The UN is no good .
All they do is talk , and when they come here they are focused on dealing with the regime [ rather ] than with fighting for democracy , " says Thaw Htun , an opposition sympathizer .
Mr. Gambari is mandated to help facilitate the release of Suu Kyi and the reopening of NLD offices , but in six visits he has only met mid-level government officials and no one from the junta leadership .
Suu Kyi's lawyer , U Kyi Win , suggests that her refusal may be a strategy to convince authorities to alleviate the conditions of her detention rather than a principled opposition to the UN 's role in Burma .
She 'd also refused food deliveries for almost a month until the government agreed this week to some of her requests , including the right to receive mail regularly and certain foreign publications .
Activists with the underground groups say they are not banking on legal strategies or UN visits .
Instead , many are looking for new opportunities in the current political climate .
" My vision is that through the development of local NGOs after Nargis , we can start building community - based activist groups , " says Hein Thein , a longtime opposition member .
Mr . Thein says these groups can function like " urban guerrillas , " rising to protest when needed and blending back into society during times of repression .
If the whole community is involved in such work , he says , it becomes very hard for authorities to crack down effectively .
Other sections of the underground , like some young monks , think armed insurrection is the key .
" We can't make the mistakes our predecessors did , " says Tha Kay , one such advocate .
" We have to develop new leaders and a new vision .
For example , we are stockpiling arms .
It 's too early to use them , but the time will definitely come . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- U.S. home prices posted record declines in April , extending a painful losing streak for U.S. home prices .
The S&P / Case - Shiller 20 - city Home Price Index fell to a record low of 15.3 % on a year - over - year basis , and was down 1.4 % from March .
The 10 - city index was down 16.3 % year - over - year and 1.6 % for the month .
The 20 - city index is based on data going back 19 years , while the 10 - city index is 21 years old .
There is one sliver of hope .
Although every city surveyed posted year - over - year price drops , the month - to - month pace of declines did slow in many cities .
And eight metro areas actually posted gains from March to April .
Bright spots
Hard - hit Cleveland was the biggest winner , with prices up 2.9 % .
Charlotte , N.C. posted a slight gain of 0.2 % , up for the second straight month , while Dallas prices were up 1.1 % in April , also up for the second month in a row .
" There might be some regional pockets of improvement , but on an annual basis the overall numbers continue to decline , " said David Blitzer , Chairman of the Index Committee at Standard & Poor's .
Indeed , there are anecdotal reports that investors have begun to snap up distressed Cleveland properties at very low prices , according to Dean Baker , Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , a Washington - based think tank .
" The data suggests that Cleveland has found a bottom , " he said , " although it 's just one month 's data and I would n't make too much of it . "
Also on Tuesday , the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) reported that its monthly house price purchase index was down 4.6 % year - over - year in April .
While the closely - watched Case - Shiller index tracks the sale prices of the same homes over the years , OFHEO 's index only tracks sales of homes with mortgages insured by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
These loans were for $ 417,000 or less , until Fannie and Freddie 's loan limits were raised in early March .
The overall price declines reported by Case - Shiller have been remarkably consistent over the past two years .
Prices on the 20 - city index have dropped for 21 straight months , since July 2006 .
The 10 - city index has fallen every month since June 2006 .
Declines accelerating
What 's more , recent drops have been particularly steep .
The 20 - city index fell 2.2 % in March , 2.6 % in February and 2.3 % in January , and is now it down another 1.4 % .
" In the bubble markets , we continue to see very rapid rates of price declines , " said Baker .
" If anything , it may be accelerating . "
Las Vegas prices plunged 26.8 % compared with April of 2007 , the worst drop among the 20 cities Case - Shiller covers .
Prices there fell 2 % in April .
Other hard hit cities include Miami ( down 26.7 % year - over - year and 4.1 % in April ) , Phoenix ( 25 % and 3.4 % ) and Los Angeles ( 23.1 % and 2.2 % ) .
" Bubble markets are now trapped in a vicious negative cycle , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody 's Economy.com , " with foreclosures driving prices down , which leads to more foreclosures . "
Foreclosures account for a much larger proportion of sales than they did a year ago , he said , and that pulls down the numbers .
" But just because the average home in your market is down 25 % , " he said , " does n't mean that your house is down 25 % . "
Still , plummeting prices could derail some of the foreclosure prevention efforts underway across the nation .
As home prices fall , that wipes out home equity , often leaving homeowners underwater , with mortgages worth more than their homes .
Some 10 million homeowners are now underwater , according to Economy.com , and that number will continue to grow as home prices plummet .
Underwater borrowers have higher rates of foreclosure than those with some home equity , since they can't tap their homes for cash in case of an emergency .
And some owners are simply walking away from homes that have lost so much value rather than continuing to make expensive payments every month .
The flood of foreclosures may be darkening an already bleak picture , said Zandi , " but the market is very bad right now . "
Here 's the comic !
See you tomorrow .
So , how badly will Sarah Palin lose the Vice Presidential debate ?
Because , lose she will … but to what degree ?
Not one to relish in the misfortune of others , I ’ve been having a mental battle with myself when thinking about the upcoming VP debate .
Good Me :
There ’s no doubt she ’s going to lose .
And she ’ll probably embarrass herself .
People will see her for who she is , and they will note her lack of experience and wisdom , and Biden will demonstrate his superiority in every facet of the debate .
The rightful winner shall win , and that ’s the end of it .
I feel no joy that it had to come to this , but that ’s the way it is .
We will all learn and move on .
Evil Me : Please , let them ask really tough questions about foreign policy .
I want Mbeki , and Mugabe , and Odinga… May Gwen Ifill be a salivating bulldog .
Joe Biden is going to run mental circles around her and then drop her like a bag of dirt , and I am going to love it .
( rubbing hands together like a fly )
That scrappy terrier from Scranton will kick the pitbull ’s behind all the way back to Juneau .
She will be so humiliated and so exposed , she ’ll slink out of public life forever after being Alaska ’s most infamous one - term wonder .
She wants “ Stump the Candidate ” , then give her “ Stump the Candidate ! ”
Good Me : Ahem … Are you listening to yourself ?
Evil Me : …. and maybe they ’ll ask about the capitol of Uzbekistan ….. what ?
Oh. ( sheepish grin )
As this battle rages on between me and myself , the following news comes out today :
At the insistence of the McCain campaign , the Oct. 2 debate between the Republican nominee for vice president , Gov. Sarah Palin , and her Democratic rival , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , will have shorter question - and - answer segments than those for the presidential nominees , the advisers said .
There will also be much less opportunity for free - wheeling , direct exchanges between the running mates .
McCain advisers said they had been concerned that a loose format could leave Ms. Palin , a relatively inexperienced debater , at a disadvantage and largely on the defensive .
McCain advisers said they were only somewhat concerned about Ms. Palin ’s debating skills compared with those of Mr. Biden , who has served six terms in the Senate , or about his chances of tripping her up .
Instead , they say , they wanted Ms. Palin to have opportunities to present Mr. McCain ’s positions , rather than spending time talking about her own experience or playing defense .
I had to read that a couple times .
Go ahead and read that again if you need to .
( pause )
So , when the McCain team decided upon the terms of the debate , a debate in which any future candidate worth his / her salt should be able to participate , it obviously never occurred to them that their actual pick would be completely and utterly unprepared and unqualified .
At this point , they are basically saying , “ We know she ’s going to lose , but we want her to lose less catastrophically .
And we do n’t really care that the American people will never get to see the woman who we want to be a heartbeat away from the highest office in the land engage in actual conversation , or be called out for her lack of knowledge .
Allowing the debate to continue as is , would be far worse for us than being called out for giving head starts to ignorant people , and grading the debate on a curve . ”
They ’d rather she have more time to spit out the talking points , then have to defend her own qualifications .
They just came right out and said it !
Our little hothouse flower will be protected .
Quick , add another circle of barbed wire , and dig a deeper level in that subterranean , undisclosed location … Sarah ’s coming .
But is she Ready to Lead ?
One reason we 've been bearish about the US economy and stock market is that we 've never bought the " decoupling " theory .
And , slowly but surely , the global economic superpowers appear to be falling in line behind the United States :
UK headed for first recession in 15 years ( and earlier in its property bubble implosion )
Germany " growth " now negative
Whole Eurozone now contracting : - 0.2 % in Q2
Japan " growth " now negative
China slowing ( and stock market forecasting a far worse fate )
And so on ...
In fact , " Every region of the world except the Middle East and North Africa -- a beneficiary of high oil prices -- will experience a slowdown this year , " Global Insight , a Massachusetts research firm , is quoted as saying in today 's WSJ global - economic - slowdown essay .
Inflation is out of control in many emerging markets ( not to mention the US and UK ) , which will limit central banks ' ability to goose growth ( not that they wo n't try ) .
Global military tensions are still rising .
Oil has fallen 20 % from its peak , but is still higher on an inflation - adjusted basis than it has been at any time in modern economic history .
Weakening international economies will :
Hurt demand for US exports , which have helped the economy in recent quarters , especially with the demolished dollar
Spur protectionism
Prompt emerging economies to devalue currencies , which will further hurt US exports .
As the US is demonstrating , economies do n't turn on a dime ( Abby Joseph Cohen 's famous supertanker analogy from the 1990s is apt in more ways than one ) .
Falling commodity prices will help , but they wo n't help immediately .
So a global recession still seems more likely than a quick recovery .
And " the US is actually doing better than everywhere else " wo n't be of much solace to struggling American companies , and it likely wo n't stop the overvalued US stock market from dropping .

John McCain 's campaign will be reviewing contributions from one of his major fundraisers , it announced today .
That review comes after stories in the Washington Post and New York Times raised more than a few questions about the donations gathered by Harry Sargeant III , who 's listed on McCain 's Web site as having raised more than $ 500,000 for the campaign .
As we noted yesterday , it was unclear how some of those contributions , from Arab - Americans in California , were connected to Sargeant .
The Times reported this morning that they were gathered via Sargeantâs Jordanian business partner Mustafa Abu Nabaâa .
Abu Nabaâa is named as a manager of International Oil Trading Co. ( IOTC ) in its incorporation documents .
That company , we noted yesterday , is currently the subject of a suit by the king of Jordan 's brother - in - law over its almost $ 1 billion contract to supply fuel to the U.S. military in Iraq .
But many questions still remain .
â Several of the donors were emphatic in interviews that they had made the contributions on their own and had not been reimbursed , â reports the Times .
Such emphasis is understandable :
To reimburse contributions as a way around contribution limits is a crime .
But there are indications that a review would be a good idea :
Via ABC , this good news : the California Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that doctors cannot deny patients medical care on religious grounds .
The case involved two Christian doctors , working at a fertility clinic , who had refused to perform artificial insemination on a lesbian :
Guadalupe Benitez , now 36 , had maintained that the California medical clinic that was treating her polycystic ovary syndrome had “ dumped ” her when she asked for artificial insemination .
In 1999 , after a year of surgeries and hormone treatments — all covered by insurance — Benitez was finally ready to get pregnant .
But at the crucial moment , her doctor refused to do the procedure for “ religious ” reasons .
… Also named in the suit were two of the clinic ’s doctors — Dr. Doug Fenton and Dr. Christine Brody — who lawyers say had a constitutional right to refuse a procedure that violated their religious beliefs .
As the story explains , Benitez and her partner have since had three children – but they had to pay for fertility treatment at their own expense , because the clinic they ultimately found to perform the procedure was not a member of their health plan .
I do n’t know if this ruling will reimburse them for those medical costs , although it should ; but at the very least , it has established a powerful and obviously correct precedent that a person ’s religious beliefs do not grant them an exemption from anti-discrimination laws .
During the civil rights era , many whites justified their oppressive and prejudiced treatment of blacks on the grounds that racial minorities were foreordained by God to be inferior .
I doubt that anyone claiming a religious right to discriminate against blacks would be given even a moment ’s consideration today .
Yet the same ugly , appalling reasoning is still used by bigots who claim that God gives them the right to hate , and who are willfully blind to the truth that gays and lesbians are human beings deserving of all the same rights – including the right to start a family – as the rest of us .
I ’m astounded that such a claim would ever be seriously advanced , even by a religious fundamentalist , but it ’s still a good sign that the court unequivocally rejected it .
The law is clear : doctors can and should be free to exercise their professional judgment in deciding what treatment is medically appropriate ; but they cannot arbitrarily deny treatment based on medically irrelevant characteristics of the patient .
This case partakes of the same twisted reasoning used by pharmacists who think they should have the right to deny their customers access to drugs whose use they disagree with .
An even more virulent form of insane stupidity is displayed by female Muslim doctors who claim that it violates their religious beliefs to wash up before surgery .
This reasoning , and not just in the Muslims ’ case , is a clear and present danger : it prioritizes rigid adherence to irrational superstition over the lives and well - being of actual human beings .
This firm ruling against these practices is a welcome one , but it does n’t go far enough .
This needs to be a criminal matter and not just a civil one : any doctor who refuses on religious grounds to perform a necessary medical procedure needs to be immediately sanctioned and barred from further practice of medicine .
The solution to these fundamentalists ’ dilemma , as I ’ve written before , is a simple one .
If your religious beliefs would interfere with your ability to perform the duties of a job , then you are free to seek a different job .
You are not free to take the job and refuse to do it while whining about religious persecution .
Individual , adult believers are free to subject themselves to whatever religious rules they see fit – but we live in a secular society , and no one should be permitted to impose their personal dogmas on all the rest of us .
A few George Patton quotes :
“ A good plan , violently executed now , is better than a perfect plan next week . ”
“ Do n’t tell people how to do things , tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results . ”
“ If you tell people where to go , but not how to get there , you ’ll be amazed at the results . ”
“ Battle is an orgy of disorder . ”
“ Courage is fear holding on a minute longer . ”
“ I do n’t measure a man ’s success by how high he climbs but how high he bounces when he hits bottom . ”
“ If everyone is thinking alike , then somebody is n’t thinking . ”
“ Nobody ever defended anything successfully , there is only attack and attack and attack some more . ”
“ Prepare for the unknown by studying how others in the past have coped with the unforeseeable and the unpredictable . ”
“ Take calculated risks .
That is quite different from being rash . ”
“ The time to take counsel of your fears is before you make an important battle decision .
That ’s the time to listen to every fear you can imagine !
When you have collected all the facts and fears and made your decision , turn off all your fears and go ahead ! ”
“ Watch what people are cynical about , and one can often discover what they lack . ”
Here ’s George C. Scott playing him in the movie Patton :
Or at least that 's what we 'd like to think .
It turns out some of the biggest , costliest disasters have resulted from some random employee making a single tiny mistake .
Such as ...
A lot of you are probably reading this at work and despite that , a lot of you are probably also drunk .
That 's because most of us have jobs where , if you maybe screw up here and there , it 's not the end of the world .
5 One Leaked File Nearly Brings Down AOL
Over the course of three months in 2006 , AOL compiled search data on over 650,000 of its users .
That might sound ominous , but all they wanted was a tool for researchers .
Sure , the users did n't know their data was being saved , but what they did n't know could n't hurt them , right ?
After all , it 's not like they would ever release it to the general public .

Whoops ...
Somebody should have told company researcher Abdur Chowdhury .
On Friday August 4 , 2006 , with a click of a mouse , Chowdhury uploaded a single compressed text file of the search data on an AOL website that was , in fact , open to the public .
But do n't fret , the user names were n't listed and AOL officials quickly realized the mistake and took the file down on Monday , the next business day .
Really , What 's the Worst That Could Happen ?
This is the internet , there is no such thing as the next day .
By the time the file was taken down , word of the data leak had spread through blogs far and wide , the search results were posted on mirror sites including one that remains today as a searchable database .
The media had already taken to the frighteningly easy task of personally identifying some of the users .

See , despite the absence of user names , a number of people had unknowingly identified themselves by way of " ego searches . "
That means that , along with searches for pleasant topics like rape , murder , committing rape and murder , hiding rape and murder , and Clay Aiken CDs , they also searched for their own names , addresses and social security numbers .
Within days , The New York Times had released , with consent , the name of a user who they tracked down by cross-checking search keywords with phone books and other public information .
After a few weeks , AOL had not only fired the researcher responsible for the leak , but also his supervisor and Chief Technology Officer Maureen Govern .

All because of one click of the mouse .
As a bizarre postscript to all of this , one of the users identified in the file only by number ( " User 927 " ) became internet famous for having basically the creepiest search habits imaginable .
Searches included " human mold , " " dog sex , " " child porn , " " Disney Beauty and the Beast Porn " and , most frighteningly , " ' Sugar , We 're Going Down ' by Fallout Boy . "
No , really .
Well , recently , a stage production premiered , based on their life , called User 927 .
Wake up , America !
On July 15 , the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled by 5 votes to 4 in the case of Al - Marri v. Pucciarelli [ .pdf ] that the president can arrest U.S. citizens and legal residents inside the United States and imprison them indefinitely , without charge or trial , based solely on his assertion that they are " enemy combatants . "
Have a little think about it , and you ’ll see that the Fourth Circuit judges have just endorsed dictatorial powers .
In the words of Judge William B. Traxler , whose swing vote confirmed the court ’s otherwise divided ruling , " the Constitution generally affords all persons detained by the government the right to be charged and tried in a criminal proceeding for suspected wrongdoing , and it prohibits the government from subjecting individuals arrested inside the United States to military detention unless they fall within certain narrow exceptions .
The detention of enemy combatants during military hostilities , however , is such an exception .
If properly designated an enemy combatant pursuant to legal authority of the president , such persons may be detained without charge or criminal proceedings for the duration of the relevant hostilities . "
As was pointed out by Judge Diana Gribbon Motz , who was steadfastly opposed to the majority verdict ( and whose opinion was endorsed by Judges M. Blane Michael , Robert B. King , and Roger L. Gregory ) , " the duration of the relevant hostilities " is a disturbingly open - ended prospect .
After citing the 2007 State of the Union Address , in which the president claimed that " The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others , ’ " Judge Motz noted , " Unlike detention for the duration of a traditional armed conflict between nations , detention for the length of a ‘ war on terror ’ has no bounds . "
The Court of Appeals made its extraordinary ruling in relation to a habeas corpus claim in the case of Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , whose story I reported at length here .
To recap briefly , Marri , a Qatari national who had studied in Peoria , Ill. , in 1991 , returned to the United States in September 2001 , with his U.S. residency in order , to pursue post - graduate studies , bringing his family  his wife and five children  with him .
Three months later he was arrested and charged with fraud and making false statements to the FBI , but in June 2003 , a month before he was due to stand trial for these charges in a federal court , the prosecution dropped the charges and informed the court that he was to be held as an " enemy combatant " instead .
He was then moved to a naval brig in Charleston , S.C. , where he has now been held for five years and one month in complete isolation in a blacked - out cell in an otherwise unoccupied cell block .
For the first 14 months of this imprisonment , when he received no visitors from outside the U.S. military or the security agencies , he was subjected to sleep deprivation and extreme temperature manipulation , frequently deprived of food and water , and interrogated repeatedly .
In August 2003 , representatives of the International Red Cross were finally allowed to visit Marri , and two months later he was permitted to meet with a lawyer , when he finally had the opportunity to explain that his interrogators had " threatened to send [ him ] to Egypt or to Saudi Arabia where , they told him , he would be tortured and sodomized and where his wife would be raped in front of him . "
Based on advice given to Donald Rumsfeld by Defense Department lawyers regarding the use of isolation at Guantánamo , when the lawyers warned that it was " not known to have been generally used for interrogation purposes for longer than 30 days , " Marri has now been held in solitary confinement for 66 times longer than the amount of time recommended by the Pentagon ’s own lawyers ( this figure includes the six months that he spent in isolation in Peoria County Jail and the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York , before being transferred to Charleston ) .
It is , therefore , unsurprising that his lawyer , Jonathan Hafetz of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law , has explained that he is suffering from " severe damage to his mental and emotional well - being , including hypersensitivity to external stimuli , manic behavior , difficulty concentrating and thinking , obsessional thinking , difficulties with impulse control , difficulty sleeping , difficulty keeping track of time , and agitation . "
So what is Ali al - Marri supposed to have done to justify being held in solitary confinement for almost as long as the duration of the Second World War ?
The presidential order declaring him an " enemy combatant " stated simply that he was closely associated with al - Qaeda and presented " a continuing , present , and grave danger to the national security of the United States . "
Elaborating , in subsequent statements , the government has claimed that he was part of an al - Qaeda sleeper cell , who had been instructed to carry out further terrorist attacks in the United States , targeting reservoirs , the New York Stock Exchange , and military academies .
What ’s particularly worrying about these charges is that , by the government ’s own admission , the primary sources for its supposed evidence against Marri are confessions made by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( KSM ) , the alleged architect of the 9/11 attacks , during the three months following his capture in March 2003 , when , as even the CIA has admitted , he was subjected to waterboarding , a form of controlled drowning , which the torturers of the Spanish Inquisition at least had the honesty to call tortura del aqua .
As I discussed at length in an article last summer , KSM stated during his tribunal at Guantánamo in March 2007 that he had given false information about other people while being tortured , and , although he was not allowed to elaborate , I traced several possible victims of these false confessions , including Majid Khan , one of 13 supposedly " high - value " detainees transferred with KSM to Guantánamo from secret CIA prisons in September 2006 ; Saifullah Paracha , a Pakistani businessman and philanthropist held in Guantánamo ; and his son Uzair , who was convicted in the United States on dubious charges in November 2005 and sentenced to 30 years in prison .
As I also stated last November , " It ’s possible , therefore , that Marri is another victim of KSM ’s tangled web of tortured confessions , but whether or not this is true , the correct venue for such discussions is in a court of law , and not in leaks and proclamations from an administration that appears to be intent on holding him without charge or trial for the rest of his life . "
When I wrote these words , it seemed possible that the Fourth Circuit judges would act to prevent Marri from having the dubious distinction of being the last " enemy combatant " on the U.S. mainland , and would put pressure on the government to transfer him to a federal prison to face a trial in a U.S. court , as happened with Jose Padilla , a U.S. citizen and one of two other " enemy combatants " imprisoned without charge or trial  the other being Yaser Hamdi , a U.S. - born Saudi , who was held in Guantánamo until it was ascertained that he held U.S. citizenship .
In Hamdi ’s case , however , a brief stay at the Charleston brig was followed by a deal that allowed him to return to Saudi Arabia .
In June 2007 , a panel of three Fourth Circuit judges dealt a blow to the administration ’s claims by ruling that " the Constitution does not allow the president to order the military to seize civilians residing within the United States and then detain them indefinitely without criminal process , and this is so even if he calls them ‘ enemy combatants . ’ "
Last week ’s decision followed a successful appeal by the government , but when the Fourth Circuit court met en banc to reconsider Marri ’s case in October , it seemed possible that they would uphold the panel ’s June verdict .
When Judge Michael asked the government ’s representative , Gregory J. Barre , " How long can you keep this man in custody ? " and Garre replied that it could " go on for a long time , " depending on the duration of the " war " with al - Qaeda , Judge Michael stated , " It looks like a lifetime . "
I now realize , of course , that it was always highly improbable that the Fourth Circuit court  widely regarded as the most right - wing court in the country  would end Marri ’s legal limbo , although it was somewhat ironic that , in a separate ruling , the swing - voting Judge Traxler ruled in Marri ’s favor when it came to a decision to grant him some as yet unspecified ability to challenge the basis of his definition as an " enemy combatant . "
This , at least , earned him the gratitude of Judge Motz , who stated that " the evidentiary proceedings envisaged by Judge Traxler will at least place the burden on the government to make an initial showing that ‘ the normal due process protections available to all within this country ’ are impractical or unduly burdensome in Marri ’s case and that the hearsay declaration that constitutes the government ’s only evidence against Marri is ‘ the most reliable available evidence ’ supporting the government ’s allegations . "
In other respects , however , the court only added to its reputation as a defender of the indefensible .
Not content with endorsing the president ’s dictatorial right to imprison " enemy combatants " without charge or trial on the U.S. mainland , the judges responsible for the majority verdict ruled that the president did not even have to allege , as he did with Yaser Hamdi and Jose Padilla , that an " enemy combatant " had either been in Afghanistan or had ever raised arms against U.S. forces .
The injustice of this was pointed out in the opinion of Judge Motz , who stated that , " unlike Hamdi and Padilla , Marri is not alleged to have been part of a Taliban unit , not alleged to have stood alongside the Taliban or the armed forces of any other enemy nation , not alleged to have been on the battlefield during the war in Afghanistan , not alleged to have even been in Afghanistan during the armed conflict , and not alleged to have engaged in combat with United States forces anywhere in the world . "
Judge Motz added , however , " With regret , we recognize that this view does not command a majority of the court .
Our colleagues hold that the president can order the military to seize from his home and indefinitely detain anyone  including an American citizen  even though he has never affiliated with an enemy nation , fought alongside any nation ’s armed forces , or borne arms against the United States anywhere in the world .
We cannot agree that in a broad and general statute , Congress silently authorized a detention power that so vastly exceeds all traditional bounds .
No existing law permits this extraordinary exercise of executive power . "
Disturbingly , as Judge Motz mentioned above , the court also indicated its presumption that its ruling applies not just to legal residents like Marri , but to U.S. citizens as well .
Judge Traxler noted , " it is likely that the constitutional rights our court determines exist , or do not exist , for Marri will apply equally to our own citizens under like circumstances , " and Judge Motz explained that the lack of distinction between citizens and residents had become apparent at oral argument , when the government " finally acknowledged that an alien legally resident in the United States , like Marri , has the same Fifth Amendment due process rights as an American citizen .
For this reason , the government had to concede that if Marri can be detained as an enemy combatant , then the government can also detain any American citizen on the same showing and through the same process . "
We have , to be honest , been here before .
In September 2005 , a three - member panel upheld , in Padilla ’s case , the president ’s power to hold U.S. citizens indefinitely without charge or trial [ .pdf ] .
This verdict was never tested , as the government took Padilla out of the brig and into the court system ( where he was convicted in January ) before the Supreme Court could rule on his case , but as Glenn Greenwald noted in an article at Salon.com , the upshot is that the 2005 Padilla verdict still stands .
To that extent , all that has changed now is that the Fourth Circuit court has reinforced its former ruling en banc .
Marri ’s lawyers will doubtless appeal , and , if justice still counts for anything , his case will go all the way to the Supreme Court .
However , it remains incomprehensible to me that the whole sorry saga has lasted for so long already .
As Jonathan Hafetz and his colleagues explained last November when they presented their arguments to the Fourth Circuit judges ( and as Judge Motz noted last week ) , the president " lacks the legal authority to designate and detain al - Marri as an ‘ enemy combatant ’ for two principal reasons " : firstly , because the Constitution " prohibits the military imprisonment of civilians arrested in the United States and outside an active battlefield , " and secondly , because , although a district court previously held that the president was authorized to detain Marri under the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( the September 2001 law authorizing the president to use " all necessary and appropriate force " against those involved in any way with the 9/11 attacks ) , Congress explicitly prohibited " the indefinite detention without charge of suspected alien terrorists in the United States " in the PATRIOT Act , which followed five weeks later .
That seems pretty clear to me .
In the " War on Terror , " however , as I have learned during my research over the last two and a half years , all forms of logical thought  sometimes in the courts , most of the time in military custody , and as a permanent fixture in the war rooms where torture was endorsed  have been engulfed in a fog of fear and barbarism .
I leave the final words to Judge Motz , and her clear - eyed awareness of the injustice of the Marri verdict .
" To sanction such presidential authority to order the military to seize and indefinitely detain civilians , even if the president call them ‘ enemy combatants , ’ would have disastrous consequences for the Constitution  and the country , " Judge Motz wrote .
" For a court to uphold a claim to such extraordinary power would do more than render lifeless the Suspension Clause , the Due Process Clause , and the rights to criminal process in the Fourth , Fifth , Sixth , and Eighth Amendments ; it would effectively undermine all of the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution .
It is that power  were a court to recognize it  that could lead all our laws ‘ to go unexecuted , and the government itself to go to pieces . ’
We refuse to recognize a claim to power that would so alter the constitutional foundations of our Republic . "
Unless Ali al - Marri is allowed a meaningful review of his status as an " enemy combatant , " Judge Motz ’s fears have already come true .
Introduction
Some scientists say an increase in the rate of melting of the world 's glaciers is evidence of global warming .
Argentina 's Upsala Glacier was once the biggest in South America , but it is now disappearing at a rate of 200 metres per year .
Other scientists say its reduction is due to complicated shifts in glacial dynamics and local geology .
Open water now stretches all the way round the Arctic , making it possible for the first time in human history to circumnavigate the North Pole , The Independent on Sunday can reveal .
New satellite images , taken only two days ago , show that melting ice last week opened up both the fabled North - west and North - east passages , in the most important geographical landmark to date to signal the unexpectedly rapid progress of global warming .
Last night Professor Mark Serreze , a sea ice specialist at the official US National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) , hailed the publication of the images – on an obscure website by scientists at the University of Bremen , Germany – as " a historic event " , and said that it provided further evidence that the Arctic icecap may now have entered a " death spiral " .
Some scientists predict that it could vanish altogether in summer within five years , a process that would , in itself , greatly accelerate .
But Sarah Palin , John McCain 's new running mate , holds that the scientific consensus that global warming is melting Arctic ice is unreliable .

The opening of the passages – eagerly awaited by shipping companies who hope to cut thousands of miles off their routes by sailing round the north of Canada and Russia – is only the greatest of a host of ominous signs this month of a gathering crisis in the Arctic .
Early last week the NSDIC warned that , over the next few weeks , the total extent of sea ice in the Arctic may shrink to below the record low reached last year – itself a massive 200,000 square miles less than the previous worst year , 2005 .
Four weeks ago , tourists had to be evacuated from Baffin Island 's Auyuittuq National Park because of flooding from thawing glaciers .
Auyuittuq means " land that never melts " .
Two weeks later , in an unprecedented sighting , nine stranded polar bears were seen off Alaska trying to swim 400 miles north to the retreating icecap edge .
Ten days ago massive cracking was reported in the Petermann glacier in the far north of Greenland , an area apparently previously unaffected by global warming .
But it is the simultaneous opening – for the first time in at least 125,000 years – of the North - west passage around Canada and the North - east passage around Russia that promises to deliver much the greatest shock .
Until recently both had been blocked by ice since the beginning of the last Ice Age .
In 2005 , the North - east passage opened , while the western one remained closed , and last year their positions were reversed .
But the images , gathered by Nasa using microwave sensors that penetrate clouds , show that the North - west passage opened last weekend and that the last blockage on the north - eastern one – a tongue of ice stretching down to Russia across Siberia 's Laptev Sea – dissolved a few days later .
" The passages are open , " said Professor Serreze , though he cautioned that official bodies would be reluctant to confirm this for fear of lawsuits if ships encountered ice after being encouraged to enter them .
" It 's a historic event .
We are going to see this more and more as the years go by . "
Shipping companies are already getting ready to exploit the new routes .
The Bremen - based Beluga Group says it will send the first ship through the North - east passage – cutting 4,000 nautical miles off the voyage from Germany to Japan – next year .
And Canada 's Prime Minister , Stephen Harper , last week announced that all foreign ships entering the North - west passage should report to his government – a move bound to be resisted by the US , which regards it as an international waterway .
But scientists say that such disputes will soon become irrelevant if the ice continues to melt at present rates , making it possible to sail right across the North Pole .
They have long regarded the disappearance of the icecap as inevitable as global warming takes hold , though until recently it was not expected until around 2070 .
Many scientists now predict that the Arctic ocean will be ice - free in summer by 2030 – and a landmark study this year by Professor Wieslaw Maslowski at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California , concluded that there will be no ice between mid-July and mid-September as early as 2013 .
The tipping point , experts believe , was the record loss of ice last year , reaching a level not expected to occur until 2050 .
Sceptics then dismissed the unprecedented melting as a freak event , and it was indeed made worse by wind currents and other natural weather patterns .
Conditions were better this year – it has been cooler , particularly last winter – and for a while it looked as if the ice loss would not be so bad .
But this month the melting accelerated .
Last week it shrank to below the 2005 level and the European Space Agency said : " A new record low could be reached in a matter of weeks . "
Four weeks ago , a seven - year study at the University of Alberta reported that – besides shrinking in area – the thickness of the ice had dropped by half in just six years .
It suggested that the region had " transitioned into a different climatic state where completely ice - free summers would soon become normal " .
The process feeds on itself .
As white ice is replaced by sea , the dark surface absorbs more heat , warming the ocean and melting more ice .

I never thought it would happen to me , but I guess they all say that .
I knew I was pushing my luck , but I thought I always stayed on the right side of the line and that I 'd be able to stop in time .
What I did n't realize is that long - term stress wears you down gradually , and that if the effects do n't get you while you 're going at full speed they 'll strike when you slow down .
Then , after it struck , I thought for a long time that I would n't write about it .
There did n't seem to be any point , really .
Talking to people about it , however , I 've found that most seem to know very little about it , and at the same time want to know more .
Another reason to write this is that there are some blog postings I want to write that may seem a little strange without this background being explained first .
The first time I can remember being so tired that I felt sick and nauseous and had to just stop what I was doing was in Tokyo in 2002 , while sightseeing after two weeks of work in Japan and South Korea .
Since then it 's happened a few times , but I always responded by slowing down and taking it a little easier for a while , and this seemed to be enough for me to get by .
Over the last few years this started happening more and more often , and it became usual for me to feel tired and out of whack .
It got to the point where I stopped enjoying meeting new people and lost much of my interest in social activities .
This happened so gradually that I did n't really sit up and take note .
Then , in December 2007 , normal work started getting harder and harder and suddenly I found I could just barely get through a normal working day .
Over Christmas I started getting ill in different ways .
Normally I 'm never ill , so this was a real wake - up call .
My doctor found nothing wrong , however , which made us think this was a case of burnout .
None of the people who know me well or have worked closely with me were surprised by this .
My former manager said she thought I 'd really burned out a couple of years ago , and that it only showed up now because I 've been taking it easier after we were acquired by Bouvet .
And I think she is right .
Anyway , the reaction of the managers at Bouvet was quick .
I was told to start handing over everything I was working on , and to go see a specialist they use for burnouts .
I sort of resisted and moved slowly on the handing over , but eventually realized that they were right , and that there was nothing else to do .
As a result I 've only worked one full week in 2008 so far .
So what is it like ?
From talking to other people who have had this it's clear that this takes different forms , but common symptoms seem to be lethargy , nausea , headaches , pains in various parts of the body , and susceptibility to infections of various sorts .
Personally , I contracted an ear infection , which was no fun , as I got a fever and the infection eventually made my ear drum burst .
A month or so later I got an infection in my gums , which my dentist eventually had to cut up and clean with salt water .
A friend of mine had none of this , but came down with a three - week headache instead .
One thing that was odd about the course this took for me was that once I stopped working and just took it easy I did n't start feeling better .
Instead , I gradually got worse over the course of about a month , before I very slowly started climbing back .
I expected the quick transition from working 120 % to doing nothing to be a real shock , and to be difficult to adjust to , since I 'm just not used to taking it easy .
Much to my surprise I found that it was not even remotely difficult .
This was partly because I was too worn out to be able to do anything anyway , and partly because I really longed for some rest and found lazing around doing nothing to be exactly what I wanted and needed .
Or at least I found it to be that way for one or two months .
After that it started getting seriously boring , and in the last few months I 've now and then found myself pushing myself further than I should simply because I have n't been able to bear continuing to do nothing .
Exertion
Fence , Beitostølen , Norway
For some weeks I actually fell so low that I 'd literally sit on the couch all day and do nothing except some reading .
I 'd force myself out for a 15 - minute walk each day , and found this so tiring that I had to take the bus back home .
After that I 'd do literally nothing before the next day 's walk .
Slowly I got better , and was able to expand the walks a bit , read more , and so on .
I 've also found that even if I feel totally whacked I am able to exert myself .
We went away for a weekend of skiing , but because the last 100 km of roads were covered in ice , I wound up driving , which turned out to be tiring .
So the day after I felt awful , and could barely get out of my chair .
Still , we 'd come there to go skiing , and go skiing I did .
We went at a quite leisurely pace for a couple of hours , mostly gently uphill .
My girlfriend took it easy , while I 'd cross out of the tracks into fields etc to take photos .
I really enjoyed this and felt fine .
Then we stopped for lunch , and when we were ready to get going again I felt completely knocked out .
Even though it was all downhill back to the hotel I felt like I was only just able to make it .
Once back at the hotel I did not get out of bed for the next 20 hours .
In other words , while down with burnout you can certainly exert yourself and be active .
It 's just that you have to pay for it afterwards .
What I 've also noticed is now that I 've improved a bit in many cases I wo n't feel anything unless I stop what I 'm doing and spend a few quiet minutes concentrating on how I really feel .
Is it just psychological ?
Some people have asked me this , and it's clear from talking to the specialist that many people suffering from burnout wonder the same thing .
The answer is that it 's both physical and psychological .
It 's psychological in the sense that people who inflict this on themselves have certain bad habits and work values that cause them to push themselves too hard .
However , the effect of that is physical , in that some of the biochemical networks in the body which regulate energy use gradually wear down .
So the tiredness is entirely real , and if you go through a complicated and expensive procedure with repeated blood tests over the course of some weeks you can actually get this to show up in medical tests .
People usually do n't do this , however , both because it 's expensive and because usually the symptoms are clear enough that there 's really no need to test for anything .
But the root cause of the " disease " is generally psychological .
For example , I 've always found it difficult to sit still , and will generally be doing something all the time , whether at work or in my spare time .
So on holiday I 'll always be trying to squeeze as many experiences into each day as I possibly can , and push myself to see another castle , check another pub , or whatever .
At work it 's pretty similar , in that I demand a lot from myself , and push myself to deliver as much as I possibly can .
Of course , this can be taken too far , and it 's pretty clear that over the past ten years that 's exactly what I 've done .
Effects
Several people who know I 've been ill have on seeing me reacted with a " You look surprisingly good " comment , as though they expected to see a real wreck .
This is part of what 's strange about this " disease " .
I look entirely like normal , except more tanned , since I can spend more time outdoors , and behave very close to normal .
There are , however , some differences .
The main one , of course , is that I get tired quickly .
This experience has made me question quite a few things about how I live my life , because I 've found that most of what I like to do , apart from being social and indulging my beer hobby , is very like work .
That 's part of what has caused me to come down with burnout , and it also means that for much of 2008 the only thing I 've really been able to do is read .
To illustrate what that really means , here 's a photo of the books I 've read this year .
Boredom
Another effect is that when I 'm really worn out I find that any serious thinking gets to be too much for me .
For example , if I have a different point of view on something from my girlfriend explaining what I mean is just too much effort .
For the first couple of months of the year I did n't read popular science books , because they were just too much mental effort for me .
Similarly , non-trivial programming was also too much .
I 've also found that it 's very easy to misjudge how well I am .
We went on a two - week interrail in Germany in April / May , and this actually turned out to be too much for me , even though we did n't do anything much and took things very easy .
The last couple of days of the holiday I had to spend partly in bed , and it took several weeks after we came home for me to recover the energy I 'd had before the holiday .
Treatment
Well , that 's a little misleading , actually , because there is n't really any treatment in the usual sense for burnout , except for resting , of course .
I have been to my doctor ( general practitioner ) and he after asking some questions basically said I should take it easy and do things I enjoy .
I remember looking at him and wondering whether he might possibly be deaf .
Not fully five minutes earlier I 'd told him a 15 - minute walk each day was literally all I was capable of doing .
So clearly it did n't much matter what I enjoyed doing ; I was n't up to it , anyway .
The specialist I was sent to by Bouvet is a psychologist , and he was much more helpful .
For one thing he had time to talk to me and really get some grasp of how I was doing and what my problems were .
He 's given me a lot of useful advice and helped me change some of my attitudes , and also been able to help me see that I 'm actually making progress at times when I 've been depressed at my seeming lack of progress .
Outlook
I 'd say mine is pretty good .
I have n't been hit anything like as hard as some people get this , and it does n't seem that I have the chronic fatigue version of this .
By now , I 'm definitely on the road to recovery , but unfortunately this is a pretty slow road .
I go jogging three times a week , and work 2 - 3 hours every day these days .
That takes up a lot of time which I have to spend relaxing to recover from jogging and work , but it 's worth it , as I notice that I 'm getting better .
However , the pace of recovery is very slow , and it seems like it could easily take me the rest of the year to get well .
Be depressed .
Be very depressed .
You thought that cyberspace -- a term conjured up long ago by that neuromancer , sci - fi author William Gibson -- was the last frontier of freedom .
Well , think again .
If the U.S. Air Force has anything to say about it , cyber - freedom will , in the not so distant future , be just another word for domination .
Air Force officials , despite a year - long air surge in Iraq , undoubtedly worry that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 's " next wars " ( two , three , many Afghanistans ) wo n't have much room for air glory .
Recently , looking for new realms to bomb , it launched itself into cyberspace .
The Air Force has now set up its own Cyber Command , redefined the Internet as just more " air space " fit for " cyber - craft , " and launched its own Bush - style preemptive strike on the other military services for budgetary control of the same .
If that 's not enough for you , it 's now proposing a massive $ 30 billion cyberspace boondoggle , as retired Air Force Lt. Col .
William Astore writes below , that will , theoretically , provide the Air Force with the ability to fry any computer on Earth .
And do n't think the other services are likely to take this lying down .
Expect cyberwar in the Pentagon before this is all over .
In the meantime , think of cyberspace , in military terms , as a new realm for nuclear - style strategy , with its own developing version of " first - strike capability , " its own future versions of " mutually assured destruction , " its own " windows of vulnerability " to be closed ( while exploiting those of the enemy ) , and undoubtedly its own " cyber- gaps . "
In fact , it looks like the national - security version of cyberspace may soon be a very , very busy place .
Noah Shachtman , who covers the subject like a rug at his Wired Magazine Danger Room blog , recently noted that Comcast , the country 's second - largest Internet provider , " has just advertised for an engineer to handle ' reconnaissance ' and ' analysis ' of ' subscriber intelligence ' for the company 's ' National Security Operations ' " -- that is , for the U.S. government .
( " Day - to - day tasks , the company says in an online job listing , will include ' deploy[ing ] , installing ] and remov[ing ] strategic and tactical data intercept equipment on a nationwide basis to meet Comcast and Government lawful intercept needs . ' " )
Ain't that sweet .
And it should n't be too tough a job .
As Shachtman also points out , " Since May 2007 , all Internet providers have been required to install gear for easy wiretapping under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act . "
Sigh .
Those who do n't learn from history are bound to get ever more bloated budgets .
Tom
Recently , while I was on a visit to Salon.com , my computer screen momentarily went black .
A glitch ?
A power surge ?
No , it was a pop - up ad for the U.S. Air Force , warning me that an enemy cyber - attack could come at any moment -- with dire consequences for my ability to connect to the Internet .
It was an Outer Limits moment .
Remember that eerie sci- fi show from the early 1960s ?
The one that began in a blur with the message , " There is nothing wrong with your television set .
Do not attempt to adjust the picture .
We are controlling transmission . "
It felt a little like that .
And speaking of Air Force ads , there 's one currently running on TV and on the Internet that starts with a bird 's eye view of the Pentagon as a narrator intones , " This building will be attacked three million times today .
Who 's going to protect it ? "
Two Army colleagues of mine nearly died on September 11 , 2001 , when the third hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon , so I can't say I appreciated the none - too - subtle reminder of that day 's carnage .
Leaving that aside , it turns out that the ad is referring to cyber - attacks and that the cyber protector it has in mind is a new breed of " air " warrior , part of an entirely new Cyber Command run by the Air Force .
Using the latest technology , our cyber elite will " shoot down " enemy hackers and saboteurs , both foreign and domestic , thereby dominating the realm of cyberspace , just as the Air Force is currently seeking to dominate the planet 's air space -- and then space itself " to the shining stars and beyond . "
Part of the Air Force 's new " above all " vision of full - spectrum dominance , America 's emerging cyber force has control fantasies that would impress George Orwell .
Working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the Department of Homeland Security , and other governmental agencies , the Air Force 's stated goal is to gain access to , and control over , any and all networked computers , anywhere on Earth , at a proposed cost to you , the American taxpayer , of $ 30 billion over the first five years .
Here , the Air Force is advancing the now familiar Bush - era idea that the only effective defense is a dominating offense .
According to Lani Kass , previously the head of the Air Force 's Cyberspace Task Force and now a special assistant to the Air Force Chief of Staff , " If you 're defending in cyber [ space ] , you 're already too late .
Cyber delivers on the original promise of air power .
If you do n't dominate in cyber , you cannot dominate in other domains . "
Such logic is commonplace in today 's Air Force ( as it has been for Bush administration foreign policy ) .
A threat is identified , our vulnerability to it is trumpeted , and then our response is to spend tens of billions of dollars launching a quest for total domination .
Thus , on May 12th of this year , the Air Force Research Laboratory posted an official " request for proposal " seeking contractor bids to begin the push to achieve " dominant cyber offensive engagement . "
The desired capabilities constitute a disturbing militarization of cyberspace :
" Of interest are any and all techniques to enable user and / or root access to both fixed ( PC ) or mobile computing platforms .
Robust methodologies to enable access to any and all operating systems , patch levels , applications and hardware .
[ T] echnology to maintain an active presence within the adversaries ' information infrastructure completely undetected [ A ] ny and all techniques to enable stealth and persistence capabilities [ C ] apability to stealthily exfiltrate information from any remotely - located open or closed computer information systems "
Stealthily infiltrating , stealing , and exfiltrating : Sounds like cyber - cat burglars , or perhaps invisible cyber -SEALS , as in that U.S. Navy " empty beach at night " commercial .
This is consistent with an Air Force - sponsored concept paper on " network - centric warfare , " which posits the deployment of so - called " cyber - craft " in cyberspace to " disable terminals , nodes or the entire network as well as send commands to ' fry ' their hard drives . "
Somebody clever with acronyms came up with D5 , an all - encompassing term that embraces the ability to deceive , deny , disrupt , degrade , and destroy an enemy 's computer information systems .
No one , it seems , is the least bit worried that a single - minded pursuit of cyber - " destruction " -- analogous to that " crush kill destroy " android on the 1960s TV series " Lost in Space " -- could create a new arena for that old Cold War nuclear acronym MAD ( mutually assured destruction ) , as America 's enemies and rivals seek to D5 our terminals , nodes , and networks .
Here 's another less - than - comforting thought : America 's new Cyber Force will most likely be widely distributed in basing terms .
In fact , the Air Force prefers a " headquarters " spread across several bases here in the U.S. , thereby cleverly tapping the political support of more than a few members of Congress .
Finally , if , after all this talk of the need for " information dominance " and the five D's , you still remain skeptical , the Air Force has prepared an online " What Do You Think ? " survey and quiz ( paid for , again , by you , the taxpayer , of course ) to silence naysayers and cyberspace appeasers .
It will disabuse you of the notion that the Internet is a somewhat benign realm where cooperation of all sorts , including the international sort , is possible .
You 'll learn , instead , that we face nothing but ceaseless hostility from cyber - thugs seeking to terrorize all of us everywhere all the time .
Of Ugly Babies , Icebergs , and Air Force Computer Systems
Computers and their various networks are unquestionably vital to our national defense -- indeed , to our very way of life -- and we do need to be able to protect them from cyber attacks .
In addition , striking at an enemy 's ability to command and control its forces has always been part of warfare .
But spending $ 6 billion a year for five years on a mini-Manhattan Project to atomize our opponents ' computer networks is an escalatory boondoggle of the worst sort .
Leaving aside the striking potential for the abuse of privacy , or the potentially destabilizing responses of rivals to such aggressive online plans , the Air Force 's militarization of cyberspace is likely to yield uncertain technical benefits at inflated prices , if my experience working on two big Air Force computer projects counts for anything .
Admittedly , that experience is a bit dated , but keep in mind that the wheels of procurement reform at the Department of Defense ( DoD ) do turn slowly , when they turn at all .
Two decades ago , while I was at the Space Surveillance Center in Cheyenne Mountain , the Air Force awarded a contract to update our computer system .
The new system , known as SPADOC 4 , was , as one Air Force tester put it , the " ugly baby . "
Years later , and no prettier , the baby finally came on - line , part of a Cheyenne Mountain upgrade that was hundreds of millions of dollars over budget .
One Air Force captain described it in the following way :
" The SPADOC system was designed very poorly in terms of its human machine interface [ leading to ] a lot of work arounds that make learning the system difficult [ Fortunately , ] people are adaptable and they can learn to operate a poorly designed machine , like SPADOC , [ but the result is ] increased training time , increased stress for the operators , increased human errors under stress and unused machine capabilities . "
My second experience came a decade ago , when I worked on the Air Force Mission Support System or AFMSS .
The idea was to enable pilots to plan their missions using the latest tools of technology , rather than paper charts , rulers , and calculators .
A sound idea , but again botched in execution .
The Air Force tried to design a mission planner for every platform and mission , from tankers to bombers .
To meet such disparate needs took time , money , and massive computing power , so the Air Force went with Unix - based SPARC platforms , which occupied a small room .
The software itself was difficult to learn , even counter - intuitive .
While the Air Force struggled , year after year , to get AFMSS to work , competitors came along with PC - based flight planners , which provided 80 % of AFMSS 's functionality at a fraction of the cost .
Naturally , pilots began clamoring for the portable , easy - to - learn PC system .
Fundamentally , the whole DoD procurement cycle had gone wrong -- and there lies a lesson for the present cyber -moment .
The Pentagon is fairly good at producing decent ships , tanks , and planes ( never mind the typical cost overruns , the gold - plating , and so on ) .
After all , an advanced ship or tank , even deployed a few years late , is normally still an effective weapon .
But a computer system a few years late ?
That 's a paperweight or a doorstop .
That 's your basic disaster .
Hence the push for the DoD to rely , whenever possible , on COTS , or commercial - off - the - shelf , software and hardware .
Do n't get me wrong : I 'm not saying it 's only the Pentagon that has trouble designing , acquiring , and fielding new computer systems .
Think of it as a problem of large , by - the - book bureaucracies .
Just look at the FBI 's computer debacle attempting ( for years ) to install new systems that failed disastrously , or for that matter the ever more imperial Microsoft 's struggles with Vista .
Judging by my past experience with large - scale Air Force computer projects , that $ 30 billion will turn out to be just the tip of the cyber - war procurement iceberg and , while you 're at it , call those " five years " of development 10 .
Shackled to a multi - year procurement cycle of great regulatory rigidity and complexity , the Air Force is likely to struggle but fail to keep up with the far more flexible and creative cyber world , which almost daily sees the fielding of new machines and applications .
Loving Big " Cyber " Brother
Our military is the ultimate centralized , bureaucratic , hierarchical organization .
Its tolerance for errors and risky or " deviant " behavior is low .
Its culture is designed to foster obedience , loyalty , regularity , and predictability , all usually necessary in handling frantic life - or - death combat situations .
It is difficult to imagine a culture more antithetical to the world of computer developers , programmers , and hackers .
So expect a culture clash in militarized cyberspace -- and more taxpayers ' money wasted -- as the Internet and the civilian computing world continue to outpace anything the DoD can muster .
If , however , the Air Force should somehow manage to defy the odds and succeed , the future might be even scarier .
After all , do we really want the military to dominate cyberspace ?
Let 's say we answer " yes " because we love our big " Above All " cyber brother .
Now , imagine you 're Chinese or Indian or Russian .
Would you really cede total cyber dominance to the United States without a fight ?
Not likely .
You would simply launch -- or intensify -- your own cyber war efforts .
Interestingly , a few people have surmised that the Air Force 's cyber war plans are so outlandish they must be bluster -- a sort of warning shot to competitors not to dare risk a cyber attack on the U.S. , because they'd then face cyber obliteration .
Yet it 's more likely that the Air Force is quite sincere in promoting its $ 30 billion " mini-Manhattan " cyber - war project .
It has its own private reasons for attempting to expand into a new realm ( and so create new budget authority as well ) .
After all , as a service , it 's been somewhat marginalized in the War on Terror .
Today 's Air Force is in a flat spin , its new planes so expensive that relatively few can be purchased , its pilots increasingly diverted to " fly " Predators and Reapers -- unmanned aerial vehicles -- its top command eager to ward off the threat of future irrelevancy .
But even in cyberspace , irrelevancy may prove the name of the game .
Judging by the results of previous U.S. military - run computer projects , future Air Force " cyber - craft " may prove more than a day late and billions of dollars short .

So great is the demand for oil today  and so great the concern over rising prices  that it would be tempting to uncritically embrace plans by major Western oil companies to return to Iraq .
Unfortunately , the evolving deals could well rekindle understandable suspicions in the Arab world about oil being America ’s real reason for invading Iraq and fan even more distrust and resentment among Iraq ’s competing religious and ethnic factions .
As reported by Andrew Kramer in The Times , Exxon Mobil , Shell , Total and BP  original partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company  are in the final stages of discussions that will let them formally re-enter Iraq ’s oil market , which expelled them 36 years ago .
The contracts also include Chevron .
Iraq can certainly use the modern technology and skills these oil giants offer .
Although Iraq ’s oil reserves are among the world ’s largest , years of United Nations sanctions and war have badly eroded the industry .
Government officials say they aim to increase production from 2.5 million barrels of oil a day to 3 million barrels .
That is a minor increase in global terms , but with oil at $ 140 a barrel , it is good news for Iraqis , who need the money to rebuild their war - torn country .
It hits you like a TON of BRICKS !
It ’s an idea for that KILLER blog post that is just bound to bring you all the traffic that you ’ve ever dreamed of .
With the idea fresh in your mind you sit down at your keyboard and BANG it out – desperate to hit publish as quickly as you can for fear that someone else will beat you to the PUNCH !

As SMOKE rises from your keyboard you complete your post , quickly add a title to it and proudly hit PUBLISH !
Visions of an avalanche of visitors , incoming links and comments swirl before you .
But then …
Reality hits you like a SLAP in the face .
There are few visitors , no comments and no links .
It ’s not a KILLER post – it ’s DEAD .
Ever had that experience ?
I have – many many times over .
Today I want to start a series of posts that will walk you through an alternative workflow for constructing a blog post – one that takes …. time .

If there ’s one lesson that I ’ve learnt about writing for the web it ’s that a key element to writing successful blog posts is that in most cases they take time to CREATE .
I emphasize ‘ create ’ because I think too often as bloggers we ‘ PUNCH ’ out content as though we ’re in a race or under some kind of deadline .
It ’s almost like we ’re on a production line at times – unfortunately the posts we write often reflect this .
In this series I want to suggest an alternative approach – the crafting ( or creation ) of content .
This process is a more thoughtful process that is about crafting words and ideas – shaping posts into content that take readers on a journey .
To kick off this series I want to suggest 10 points to pause at when writing a post on your blog .
I ’ll include a link to each post that follows in this series as I update them .
Instead of rushing through a post – I find that if I pause at these key moments my post rises to a new level of quality and posts tend to get more traction with readers .
They do n’t guarantee the perfect post – but they certainly take you a step closer to a good one .
Taking extra time at each of these 10 points looks different for me in every post that I do – but I believe that every extra moment spent of these tasks pays off .
Some times the pause I take in one step will be momentary while in others it could take hours or even days to get it just right .
Sometimes the above process happens quite automatically and other times I need to force myself to stop and ponder something like a title or the timing of a post .
Each of the 10 points above have much more that could be said about them so over the weeks I ’ll be tackling each in turn in the hope that we can have some good discussion and sharing of ideas around them .
I ’ll link to each of them from within the list above as I release the posts .
For each point I hope to give some insight into how I tackle them and will share a few practical tips and examples of what I ’ve done that has worked ( and not worked ) .
Do n’t expect posts each day on this series – like all good things – this will take us some time !
Tokyo fell sharply , with the news from Washington still fresh Stock markets across Asia fell sharply , with some losing over 4 % of their value , after a US financial rescue plan failed to get through Congress .
Australia 's S&P / ASX - 200 index fell 4.3 % , while Japan 's main Nikkei index ended 4.1 % down - a three - year low .
But after an initial precipitous fall , Hong Kong 's Hang Seng managed to buck the trend , ending up 0.8 % .
The volatility came after the US Dow Jones index saw its biggest one - day points fall , dropping nearly 7 % .
In a shock move , the US House of Representatives rejected a $ 700 bn ( £ 380 bn ) plan to bail out Wall Street .
Day of turmoil
The House 's rejection of the bail - out plan came after a day of turmoil in the US and Europe , with Wachovia , the fourth - largest US bank , being bought by larger rival Citigroup .
Why did the bail - out bill fail ?
Q&A : US $ 700 bn bail - out plan Asia was quick to react to the shock rejection .
In Japan , the benchmark Nikkei stock 225 index fell 483.75 points , or 4.12 % , to close at 11,259.86 - the lowest level since 9 June 2005 .
Taipei shed 3.6 % .
But some indices erased losses , with Sydney closing 4.3 % down after falling as much as 5.3 % and South Korea 's Kospi ending down 0.6 % after falling as much as 5 % .
In Hong Kong , it was a day of drama with shares ending up 0.8 % after falling more than 6 % at one point .
New Zealand , the Philippines , Singapore and Indonesia all lost ground .
Markets in mainland China are closed this week for National Day celebrations .
' Big impact '
In the face of such volatility , regional leaders tried to reassure investors .
" Taiwan 's economic fundamentals are still good , " President Ma Ying - jeou said in a speech at a local event , reported Reuters news agency .
" We have the means to weather this global financial crisis . "
Meanwhile Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat said the situation remained manageable and urged investors " not to be alarmed " .
But others rued the failure of the US Congress to pass the emergency bail - out .
" It will have a big impact on the US economy , and it will also greatly affect the global economy , " said Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano .
Australia 's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said it was a " bad development " .
He said he had spoken to his British counterpart Gordon Brown and they agreed to urge the US Congress to push through the plan .
Other countries , such as Indonesia and South Korea , say they will follow US and EU regulators in banning or restricting short - selling of stocks to curb instability in the stock markets .
Meanwhile , the Bank of Japan pumped another 3 trillion yen ( $ 28.7bn ; £ 15.8 bn ) into money markets as part of the co-ordinated effort by the world 's central banks to boost liquidity and lending .
It is the 10th consecutive working day that it has put money into the domestic system .
Washington blockade
The US rescue plan , a result of tense talks over several days between the government and lawmakers , was rejected by 228 to 205 votes in the House of Representatives .
About two - thirds of Republican lawmakers refused to back the rescue package , as well as 95 Democrats .

After talks with the president , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the government 's plan to address the crisis facing the US financial sector was much too important to be allowed to fail .
He added that he would be working with congressional leaders to get something done " as quickly as possible " .
Analysts say that without a bail - out plan , the banks will be left to handle all their own bad mortgage debt as best they can , and more of them will be in danger of going bust .
But after several hours of impassioned debate , the bill 's opponents - the majority of whom were from the Republican Party - got their way .
They had raised concerns about both the content of the plan and the speed with which they were being asked to pass it .

What are these ?
DNA from dried human excrement recovered from Oregon 's Paisley Caves is the oldest found yet in the New World -- dating to 14,300 years ago , some 1,200 years before Clovis culture -- and provides apparent genetic ties to Siberia or Asia , according to an international team of 13 scientists .
Among the researchers is Dennis L. Jenkins , a senior archaeologist with the University of Oregon 's Museum of Natural and Cultural History , whose summer field expeditions over two summers uncovered a variety of artifacts in caves that had caught the scientific attention of the UO 's Luther Cressman in the 1930s .
The Paisley Caves are located in the Summer Lake basin near Paisley , about 220 miles southeast of Eugene on the eastern side of the Cascade Range .
The series of eight caves are westward - facing , wave - cut shelters on the highest shoreline of pluvial Lake Chewaucan , which rose and fell in periods of greater precipitation during the Pleistocene .
The team 's extensively documented analyses on mitochondrial DNA -- genetic material passed on maternally -- removed from long - dried feces , known as coprolites , were published online April 3 in Science Express ahead of regular publication in the journal Science .
" The Paisley Cave material represents , to the best of my knowledge , the oldest human DNA obtained from the Americas , " said Eske Willerslev , director of the Centre for Ancient Genetics at Denmark 's University of Copenhagen .
" Other pre-Clovis sites have been claimed , but no human DNA has been obtained , mostly because no human organic material had been recovered . "
Willerslev visited the UO in 2004 to obtain samples for DNA analyses after word spread among archaeologists and anthropologists about Jenkins ' discoveries .
A Danish team , led by Willerslev , examined 14 coprolites -- initially using multiplex polymerase chain reaction to rapidly amplify DNA and a minisequencing assay -- that were found by Jenkins and colleagues during summer field work in 2002 and 2003 .

A lengthy analysis , including the collection of DNA samples from 55 UO students , supervisors , and site visitors and 12 Danish DNA researchers , was done to screen for modern DNA contamination .
From that analysis , six coprolites containing the ancient DNA were radiocarbon dated using accelerator mass spectrometry and calendar calibrated to between 1,300 and 14,300 years ago .
" Of these , half date from the early arrival time , " Jenkins said .
" All six coprolites containing ancient DNA underwent additional testing at two independent labs .
Three of the six also contained DNA similar to red fox , coyote or wolf . "
The researchers suggest that these early Americans ate the animals or that the animals urinated on the human feces during times of non-human habitation .
The DNA testing indicated that the feces belonged to Native Americans in haplogroups A2 and B2 , haplogroups common in Siberia and east Asia .
Clovis culture began sometime between 13,200 and 12,900 years ago , according to a re-evaluation of Clovis evidence published in Science ( Feb. 23 , 2008 ) by Michael R. Waters of Texas A&M University and Thomas W. Stafford Jr. of Stafford Research Laboratories in Colorado .
Skeletal remains dating to Clovis culture have proven elusive , leaving researchers with little hard evidence beyond tell - tale cultural components such as the distinctive fluted Clovis points and other tools .

Exactly who these people living in the Oregon caves were is not known , Jenkins said .
In their conclusion , the authors wrote : " The Paisley Caves lack lithic tool assemblages , thus the cultural and technological association of the early site occupants , and their relationship to the later Clovis technology are uncertain . "
" All we 're doing in this paper is identifying the haplogroups , " Jenkins said in an interview .
" We are not saying that these people were of a particular ethnic group .
At this point , we know they most likely came from Siberia or Eastern Asia , and we know something about what they were eating , which is something we can learn from coprolites .
We 're talking about human signature .
" If our DNA evidence and radiocarbon dating hold up on additional coprolites that are now undergoing testing at multiple labs , then we have broken the Clovis sound barrier , if you will , " he said .
" If you are looking for the first people in North America , you are going to have to step back more than 1,000 years beyond Clovis to find them . "
The UO 's Cressman was lured to the area after being told about a woman who was digging in the caves for artifacts and began uncovering large bones , Jenkins said .
Cressman , an anthropologist , died in April 1994 after 35 years on the UO faculty .
During the two summers of fieldwork , Jenkins , colleagues and students , working in four of the caves , retrieved manufactured threads of sinew and plant fibers , hide , basketry , cordage , rope , wooden pegs , animal bones , two forms of projectile point fragments and diverse kinds of feces .
These items were found " in an unbroken stratigraphic sequence spanning the late Pleistocene and Holocene , " the researchers wrote in the study .
Some of the thread is narrower than that holding buttons on many shirts today and date back 12,750 years , Jenkins said .
" To find these threads was just incredible , " said Jenkins , who directs the Northern Great Basin Archaeological Field School .
" We found a little pit in the bottom of a cave .
It was full of camel , horse and mountain sheep bones , and in there we found a human coprolite .
We radiocarbon - dated the camel and mountain sheep bones , as well as the coprolite , to 14,300 years ago . "
With radiocarbon dating adjusted to calendar years , the materials date back to about 14,400 years ago , he added .
Such a dating puts the Oregon site into about the same time period as Chile 's Monte Verde site .
The UO 's Cressman reported his discoveries in 1940 , but his conclusions on material he found were not widely accepted because of a lack of solid documentation .
" Cressman was correct about the association of human cultural remains with Pleistocene animals such as the now extinct camels , horses , and bison that once ranged the plain in front of the Paisley Caves , but it has taken nearly 70 years and the development and application of new scientific methods to prove it , " Jenkins said .
" Had the human coprolites at the Paisley Caves not been analyzed for DNA and subjected to rigorous dating methodology , " he added , " the pre-Clovis age of the artifacts recovered with the megafaunal remains could not have been conclusively proven .
In other words , the pre-Clovis - aged component of this site could very well have been missed or dismissed by archaeologists . "

Michael Phelps showed no sign of letting up in his pursuit of breaking Mark Spitz 's record for the most amount of medals won in one Olympic Games .
First he romped home in the 200 m butterfly in a new world - record time .
He gave all swimmers around the world hope when he moaned he could n't see down the last 100 m due to his goggles filling up with water !
This is usually only a problem that faces young swimmers at club level .
I 'm just thankful he did n't stop and look for the lifeguard to tighten the strap .
And then there was the 4x200 m relay - if ever there was one of his gold medal opportunities that was nailed on , it was in this race .
With such strong middle distance team - mates the world record always looked under threat .
However , to break the magic barrier of 7.00 minutes was simply phenomenal .
Lets take a look at what makes Phelps so special :
Long torso
All swimmers look pretty much the same when in their swimming suits but if you take time to truly weigh up Phelps ' physique he looks almost like a cartoon character .
If you were guessing his height from looking at his legs , you would more than likely say less than six foot .
Switch your gaze to his freakishly long torso and you you probably say he would be more like a 6ft 8in !
The issue most people have with swimming is the legs drag through the water and in many instances can slow them down .
His long torso and short legs reduce this drag and allow for maximum propulsion .
Wing span
Just like most people have a shoe size that is the same length as the distance from their wrist to the elbow , we all generally have a wingspan that is similar to our height .
Michael Phelps ' wingspan based on his height should be around 196 cm .
His actual wingspan is 208 cm and this provides perfect levers for him to pull himself through the water .
Low body fat
When Phelps steps out the water after one of his final swims you can generally see what he had for breakfast !
It would seem there is no fat on him at all and at a guess I would say it was around 4 % and obviously based on power to weight ratio this allows him to maximise his effort into speed .
I 'm sure if you checked any doctor 's chart a 6ft 4ins , 83kg man would definitely be seriously underweight .
When trying to win Olympic gold medals it works fairly well !
Power of recovery
All athletes produce lactic acid when their aerobic system can no longer keep up with producing the amount of energy required to perform .
As a matter of course all swimmers need to swim down to get rid off this ' acid ' so they are ready to perform at their potential the next time they race .
Phelps has extraordinary powers of recovery ; as well as not producing usual levels of lactic acid he also needs only minimal recovery before he is ready to go again .
On Tuesday he swam a sensational race in the 200 m freestyle - and was back in the pool moments after the medal ceremony for the 200 m butterfly heats .
" In between the 200 m free and the fly heats I have probably had in total about 10 minutes to myself , " he told to US TV .
That takes phenomenal mental focus too .
Tools of the trade
With large hands and size 14 feet he has all the right equipment to swim super fast .
Without these paddles and fins to get him through the water he would not be equipped to make an assault on all the world records .
Mindset
Similar to Tiger Woods this man just does not know how to quit .
With 11 Olympic gold medals to his name already and a possible three more up for grabs in Beijing plus a similar medal assault in London could Michael Phelps not only end up being the greatest Olympian in history but also the greatest sportsman ever ?
NEW YORK , Sept 17 ( Reuters ) - The yield on 3 - month U.S. Treasury bills US3MT=RR fell to 0.02 percent early afternoon New York trade on Wednesday amid investors ' panicked scramble into the safe haven of ultra short - dated government securities , traders said .
The 3 - month U.S. Treasury bill yield “ last traded at 0.02 percent as an actual trade and may have traded negative earlier today , ” said Sean Murphy , Treasuries trader at RBC Capital Markets in New York , shortly after 12:30 p.m. EDT ( 1630 GMT ) .
The last time the 3 - month U.S. T - bill yield was at or below zero was in January 1940 , said Bryan Taylor , chief economist with Global Financial Data in Los Angeles .
Murphy cited “ a flight to quality into the Treasury bill market . ”
“ People are just panicking and they just want their principal , ” he said .
Andrew Brenner , analyst at MF Global Inc , said the 3 - month bill traded at 0.02 percent .
“ Probably there ’s disappointment in the Fed ’s decision ( to hold interest rates unchanged ) yesterday and what ’s transpiring is that banks are just pulling back and not lending and not being able to get the funding they need , ” Murphy said .
Introduction
Given the prevalence of DirectX nowadays , we tend to forget that 10 years ago an all - out war was being waged between Microsoft and Silicon Graphics in the field of 3D APIs .
The two companies were both trying to win over developers , with Microsoft using its financial muscle and SGI relying on its experience and its reputation in the field of real - time 3D .
In this modern David - versus - Goliath battle , the “ little guy ” won a precious ally in one of the most famous game developers– - Mr. John Carmack .
In part due to the success of the Quake engine , solid support for OpenGL became important enough to motivate makers of 3D cards to provide complete drivers .
In fact , it gave 3dfx one of its early advantages and knocked ATI to the back of the pack as it struggled with its OpenGL support .
Meanwhile , Microsoft was starting from scratch , and the learning curve was steep .
So , for several years , Direct3D ’s capabilities were beyond the curve , with an interface that many programmers found a lot more confusing than OpenGL’s .
But nobody can accuse Microsoft of being easily discouraged .
With each new version of Direct3D , it gradually began to catch up with OpenGL .
The engineers in Redmond worked very hard to bring performance up to its rival API ’s level .
A turning point was reached with DirectX 8 , released in 2001 .
For the first time , Microsoft ’s API did more than just copy from SGI .
It actually introduced innovations of its own like support for vertex and pixel shaders .
SGI , whose main source of revenue was the sale of expensive 3D workstations , was in a bad position , having failed to foresee that the explosion of 3D cards for gamers would prompt ATI and Nvidia to move into the professional market with prices so low ( due to economies of scale ) that SGI could n’t keep up .
OpenGL ’s development was also handicapped by bitter disputes among its proponents .
Since the ARB — the group in charge of ratifying the API ’s development — included many different , competing companies , it was hard to reach agreement on the features to be added to the API .
Instead , each company promoted its own agenda .
Conversely , Microsoft was working solely with ATI and Nvidia , using its weight to cast a deciding vote if there was disagreement .
With DirectX 9 , Microsoft managed to strike a decisive victory , imposing its API on developers .
Only John Carmack and those who insisted on portability remained faithful to OpenGL .
But their ranks dwindled .
And yet a reversal of fortunes was still possible .
It had happened with Web browsers , after all .
Even when a company has maneuvered itself into a near monopoly , if it rests on its laurels , it ’s not all that rare for a competitor to rise from his ashes .
So when the Khronos group took over OpenGL two years ago , many hopes were rekindled with all eyes on the upcoming SIGGRAPH conference that year .
Last month , Khronos was to have announced OpenGL 3 , a major revision of the API that ’s supposed to catch up with Microsoft , which was also scheduled to launch its next - gen DirectX 11 API .
But things did n’t really go as planned .
Cosmology is currently focused on learning more about three different things : inflation , dark matter , and dark energy .
Inflation was the process that drove the early expansion of the universe — it is used to explain why the universe is basically the same in every direction .
Dark energy is the label given to the apparently accelerating rate of expansion the universe is experiencing .
Dark matter explains the huge amount of apparently invisible matter observed throughout the universe .
These guys are seemingly very different , yet a key feature of physics has been the unification of seemingly different concepts .
Could it be possible that inflation , dark matter , and dark energy are all aspects of a single underlying phenomenon ?
Apparently so , according to new research published in Physical Review D.
The idea that dark energy and inflation are somehow linked is not exactly new .
They are both used to describe periods where the rate of the expansion of the universe is increased , and there have been a few attempts to find models that can link dark energy and inflation .
Dark matter , however , was considered to be something else entirely .
Now , a new look at inflation has proposed a set of dynamics that would lead to the universe we observe today and unite the three phenomena under a single conceptual framework .
We start off early in the universe , where there is lots of energy sitting in a field that drives inflation and bit of radiation in the form of photons , electrons , and quarks .
The universe expanded quickly and , at a certain point , the inflation field density dropped below that of the radiation density , at which point the field decayed , releasing energy and heating up the universe in a process called re-heating .
After a while , the energy density would become high enough to drive a new epoch of inflation , called thermal inflation — this is analogous to the expansion of a high pressure gas that breaks its container and expands .
After this occured , the universe was once again cold , and now symmetry breaking in the inflation field would drop even more energy into the radiation field , reheating the universe and resulting in a light - dominated universe .
This would leave only nucleosynthesis and star formation to do before we humans could turn up to poke around .
The key points are that the inflation field is not completely exhausted at the present and , if certain parameters happen to be in the right range , it could play the role of dark matter .
Furthermore , dark energy is exactly like inflation except on a much smaller scale , meaning that a residual inflation field could play the role of dark energy .
So , how does that work ?
Well , the average density of the inflation field is non-zero and , as a result , keeps the rate of expansion of the universe increasing .
However , the density of the inflation field will fluctuate about this average value and , in places where there is a deficit , there will be less expansion , which will look just like a dark matter concentration .
Its a nice idea , but it has some way to go before it can gain acceptance .
For instance , dark matter explains a large range of different phenomena on length scales ranging from a single galaxy through to the entire universe .
This work has demonstrated that density fluctuations in the inflation field can mimic dark matter at the very largest scales .
However , they would have to show that it can do so at every scale if it is to replace dark matter .
By then , the Large Hadron Collider will have started turning up new particles , several of which are dark matter candidates .
If that happens , physicists will be left to wonder why this new theory now predicts too much dark matter in the universe .

THE empty house , in a middle - class corner of southern California , is two storeys high and boasts a three - car garage .
Roses bloom around a kidney - shaped swimming pool , which is green with algae .
Bill Bobbitt , a county inspector , dips a ladle into the water and brings up half a dozen wriggling larvae .
Mosquitoes , and the West Nile virus that some of them carry , are thriving in California 's plunging property market .
West Nile virus arrived in America in 1999 and made it to California three years later .
Since then it is known to have infected 2,300 people in the state , of whom 76 have died .
In Orange County this is the worst summer yet .
By this point last year officials there had discovered nine birds that had been killed by West Nile virus and not one infected mosquito .
So far this year they have found 219 infected birds and 75 infected mosquitoes .
Some of this rise is due to better testing and co-operation with the animal services department , which receives most reports of dying birds .
But a much bigger cause is the housing crunch .
Fully 63,000 homes were foreclosed in California between April and June , according to DataQuick , a property data services outfit .
In the past year the number of Orange County homeowners who have defaulted on their mortgages has more than doubled .
Empty houses mean untended pools .
Untended pools quickly breed mosquitoes .
Dead birds are also piling up in neighbouring counties like Los Angeles , San Diego and San Bernardino , which also have high foreclosure rates .
Last week 170 infected mosquitoes were discovered in the state as a whole — the highest tally ever .
So far this year 13 human infections have been reported in California , but the numbers are expected to grow rapidly as the summer moves on .
John Rusmisel , president - elect of the board responsible for killing the critters , says a peak in infected mosquitoes is generally followed , two or three weeks later , by a peak in human cases .
In theory , owners are supposed to keep their properties in decent shape whether they live there or not .
California has even passed a bill fining banks and mortgage companies that seize properties and then allow pools to fester .
But Mr Bobbitt is n't waiting for the lawyers .
He has treated the pool in Santa Ana with oil and synthetic growth hormones , which will keep the mosquitoes adolescent , preventing breeding .
Then he tips in a few dozen mosquito fish ( Gambusia affinis ) , which begin happily munching larvae .
You can buy a lot of the fish for what a lawyer charges per hour , and some authorities , with commendable creativity , even provide them free to help control the pests .
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuba , devastated in recent weeks by two powerful hurricanes , has too much dignity to accept aid from the United States , former leader Fidel Castro said in a column published on Wednesday .

He said the United States had done billions of dollars in damage to Cuba with its 46 - year - old trade embargo against the island and does not understand “ that the dignity of a people has no price . ”
Cuba suffered $ 5 billion in damages from hurricanes Ike and Gustav , but the government has rejected offers of up to $ 5 million in U.S. aid .
“ If instead of five million they were one billion , the answer would be the same , ” wrote Castro , who has been on the sidelines since undergoing intestinal surgery in July 2006 and was formally replaced as president by brother Raul Castro in February .
“ The damage in thousands of lives , suffering and more than $ 200 billion the blockade ( embargo ) has cost , and the Yankee aggressions , ca n’t be paid with anything , ” he said .
Instead of accepting aid , Cuba has asked the United States to at least temporarily lift the embargo so it can buy what it needs , but the Bush administration has refused .
The United States first offered $ 100,000 to Cuba with the possibility of more if Cuba allowed a U.S. team to do its own damage assessment .
The offer was eventually raised to $ 5 million , without the request to do an assessment .
Other countries such as Russia , Spain , Brazil , Venezuela , Ecuador , Honduras and Colombia have been sending in goods , and Cuba has accepted an offer of $ 3.5 million in aid from the United Nations .
“ The wave of solidarity with Cuba , that encompasses countries big and small , with resources and without , would disappear the day that Cuba quit being dignified , ” Castro said .
The 82 - year - old Castro , not seen in public since falling ill , now writes occasional columns published in Cuba ’s state - run press .
The Federal Reserve is facing a major challenge because high commodity prices , especially oil , have produced high headline inflation .
But the Fed should not overreact .
The Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) last month rose more than 5 % over a year earlier , way above a rate that is consistent with price stability .
At the same time , the federal - funds rate is at 2 % , so the real interest rate on federal funds -- the interest rate adjusted for inflation -- has turned very negative .
Will ...
Vincent R. Reinhart , a former Federal Reserve economist now at the conservative - leaning American Enterprise Institute here , said that , in retrospect , “ it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the F.D.I.C. ”  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  “ to look at these issues more closely . ”
He said it would also have helped “ for Congress to have held hearings . ”
Instead , voices inside the administration for tougher policing of Wall Street found themselves with few supporters .
William H. Donaldson , a former Wall Street executive with respected Republican credentials who became chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Mr. Bush , quit after facing resistance from the White House and Republican members of the agency , who criticized his support for stiffer regulations on mutual funds and hedge funds .
Today , even some sympathetic to Mr. Bush say he cannot disentangle himself from a home - lending industry that ran amok or a banking industry that mortgaged its future on toxic loans .
“ The crisis definitely happened on their watch , ” said Kenneth S. Rogoff , a professor of economics at Harvard who advises Mr. McCain .
“ This is eight years into the Bush administration .
There was a lot of time to deal with it . ”
To some extent , Mr. Bush was simply following a deregulatory pattern set by his predecessor , President Clinton .
Perhaps the most significant recent deregulation of the banking industry  the landmark act that allowed commercial banks to expand into other financial activities , like investment banking and insurance  was signed into law by Mr. Clinton in 1999 .
Mr. Bush also inherited a culture of borrowing and a frothy housing market that has become “ deeply embedded in the American psyche , ” Mr. Rogoff said .
And Mr. Reinhart said the markets seemed to be doing so well that few analysts , either in government or the private sector , had a critical eye .
“ When everybody is doing better , ” he said , “ it is difficult to see the underlying weaknesses . ”
A Renewable Future versus A Bureaucratic Past
August 28th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
We hear a lot these days about the drive to implement renewable energy solutions .
Companies and governments alike are looking to solar and wind generation as a way to not only cut costs , but to help the environment .
Wind farms are popping up left right and center across the United States , and people are getting excited about a possible future independent of fossil fuels .
Sadly , that enthusiasm is also running up against a very solid and very old wall ; bureaucratic red tape and shoddy designs .
The current power distribution system set up in the United States is currently run by about 500 owners , is a hundred years old , and is designed around helping prop each other up in the case of emergencies .
What it is not designed to do , is to take a large amount of power and safely store or transport it .
You would think this would have been a justifiable goal for a power distribution system , but I guess things were different .
What is worse is that the sheer amount of red tape that stands in the way of change is mind - boggling .
Any change to the system would require the involvement of multiple power companies , multiple state and local governments , and a mass of permits .
As T. Boone Pickens told Congress , “ If you want to do it on a national scale , where the transmission line distances will be much longer , and utility regulations are different , Congress must act . ”
The New York Times ran an article recently looking , specifically , at problems such as the one facing the residents of Maple Ridge in upstate New York .
The developers of the Maple Ridge wind - farm were hoping to make money by producing electricity , but the fluctuations in the power levels sometimes force the entire grid to be shut off , to save it from becoming too congested .
In other words , light to steady winds might be ok , but start turning the wind turbines a bit too fast , and the electrical generation will become too much for the system to handle .
The only option , and one that is not out of the realm of possibility given the environmental fervor these days , is for Congress to allow sweeping changes across the country .
Expensive , sure , but in the long run , beneficial .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s campaign said on Monday a McCain opinion article about Iraq offered to The New York Times as a rebuttal to Democrat Barack Obama had been rejected .

The McCain camp had submitted the article to The Times as a response to a piece by Obama published by the newspaper last week .
“ My Plan for Iraq ” had detailed Obama ’s goal of withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in 16 months if he is elected on November 4 .
The McCain article was largely a critique of Obama ’s position , arguing against establishing a set timetable for pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq .
McCain is attempting to make sure his voice is heard while Obama picks up headlines with a visit this week to Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East and Europe .
“ During the course of eight visits to Iraq , I have heard many times from our troops what Major General Jeffrey Hammond , commander of coalition forces in Baghdad , recently said : that leaving based on a timetable would be ‘ very dangerous , ’” McCain wrote .
An e-mail sent to the McCain staff by a Times editor said it would be terrific to have an article from McCain but that the one sent in was not acceptable as currently written and that a new draft should articulate how McCain defines victory in Iraq .
The McCain campaign , which does not feel McCain gets equal treatment in the U.S. news media , expressed dismay at the Times ’ decision and suspected it was because the Times did not agree with McCain ’s policy .
“ John McCain believes that victory in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground , not arbitrary timetables .
Unlike Barack Obama , that position will not change based on politics or the demands of The New York Times , ” said McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds .
The New York Times said it was standard procedure to have a “ back and forth with an author about his or her submission ” and looked forward to publishing McCain ’s views .
“ We have published at least seven Op - ed pieces by Senator McCain since 1996 .
The New York Times endorsed Senator McCain as the Republican candidate in the presidential primaries .
We take his views very seriously , ” said the statement from Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis .
Commodity Futures Modernization Act
THE PAST :" The saga of American wealth creation , both for the nation and for its enterprising capitalists , reached its apotheosis during the Gilded Age , a period roughly delimited by the end of Civil War and the beginning of World War I .
The Gilded Age ended sometimes in the first third of the 20th century , Some cite the 15th of April 1912 , the night when the ocean liner Titanic sank .
Others mention World War I or the stock market crash of October 24 , 1929 .
All these events certainly had an impact on the factors which put an end to the Age of Moguls in America .
The Titanic disaster taught mankind that there were still limits to where it could go .
World War I started a process in which the power of the federal government was increased against the power of the tycoons , a process which would be furthered by the depression which followed the stock market crash of 1929 .
But what really put an end to the Gilded Age or the age of the moguls , was the introduction of income and estate taxes during the Wilson administration .
Corporate and income taxes rendered wealth accumulation slower and more difficult , whereas the estate taxes prevented the perpetuation of wealth in the hands of the founding families .
" THE PRESENT : How Did We Get Here This Time ?
That 's pretty easy to answer , too .
His name is Phil Gramm .
A few days after the Supreme Court made George W. Bush president in 2000 , Gramm stuck something called theinto the budget bill .
Nobody knew that the Texas senator was slipping America a 262 page poison pill .
The Gramm Guts America
Act was designed to keep regulators from controlling new financial tools described as credit " swaps . "
These are instruments like sub - prime mortgages bundled up and sold as securities .
Under the Gramm law , neither the SEC nor the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) were able to examine financial institutions like hedge funds or investment banks to guarantee they had the assets necessary to cover losses they were guaranteeing .
This is n't small beer we are talking about here .
The market for these fancy financial instruments they do n't expect us little people to understand is estimated at $ 60 trillion annually , which amounts to almost four times the entire US stock market .
And Senator Phil Gramm wanted it completely unregulated .
So did Alan Greenspan , who supported the legislation and is now running around to the talk shows jabbering about the horror of it all .
Before the highly paid lobbyists were done slinging their gold card guts about the halls of congress , every one from hedge funds to banks were playing with fire for fun and profit . "
THE FUTURE :
" In fact , it really does look as if the foundations of US Capitalism have shattered .
" Nothing will be like it was before , " said James Allroy , a broker who was brooding over his chai latte at a Starbucks on Wall Street .
" The world as we know it is going down . "
Many are drawing comparisons with the Great Depression , the national trauma that has been the benchmark for everything since .
" I think it has the chance to be the worst period of time since 1929 , " financing legend Donald Trump told CNN .
And the Wall Street Journal seconds that opinion , giving one story the title : " Worst Crisis Since '30s , With No End Yet in Sight . "
The only thing that is certain is that the era of the unbridled free - market economy in the US has passed -- at least for now .
The near nationalization of AIG , America 's largest insurance company , with an $ 85 billion cash infusion -- a bill footed by taxpayers -- was a staggering move .
The sum is three times as high as the guarantee provided by the Federal Reserve when Bear Stearns was sold to JPMorgan Chase in March .
The most breathtaking aspect about this week 's crisis , though , is that the life raft -- which Washington had only previously used to bail out the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- is being handed out by a government whose party usually fights against any form of government intervention .
The policy is anchored in its party platform .
" I fear the government has passed the point of no return , " financial historian Ron Chernow told the New York Times .
" We have the irony of a free - market administration doing things that the most liberal Democratic administration would never have been doing in its wildest dreams . "
The Past : - Drew Caradine Shouter , ( " A Classification of American Wealth : History and Genealogy of the Wealthy Families of America , " 2008 ) .
The Present : - James Moore , ( " A Nation of Village Idiots , " Huffington Post , 9.18.08 ) .
The Future : - Marc Pitzke ( ' The World As We Know It Is Going Down , ' Der Spiegel Online International , 9.18.08 .

That would seem to be a far cry from the legal and accounting exemption .
But the F.E.C. issued an advisory opinion last year that said Senator John Kerry ’s presidential campaign could use its compliance fund to cover up to 5 percent of its advertising costs , because of the several seconds candidates must devote in their advertisements to a disclaimer .
The Campaign Legal Center , founded by Mr. Potter , joined with Democracy 21 , a watchdog group , to file a strongly worded brief opposing the practice , warning that it would be exploited .
The McCain campaign declined to make Mr. Potter available for an interview .
Brian Rogers , a spokesman for the campaign , said in a statement that the campaign had not yet paid for advertising with its compliance fund but “ reserves the option to do so under this recent , clear F.E.C. precedent . ”
The centerpiece of McCain - Feingold was its efforts to rein in “ soft money , ” or unregulated contributions , in national elections .
But McCain fund - raisers continue to build much of their efforts around the solicitation of large contributions of up to about $ 70,000 for a special joint fund - raising account for the Republican National Committee and several state parties , which can spend money on behalf of the campaign , called McCain - Palin Victory 2008 .
Campaigns have used the joint fund - raising committees in the past , but the McCain campaign took the practice to a new level by linking them with state party accounts , which can accept contributions of $ 10,000 , on top of the $ 28,500 collected for the national party , $ 2,300 for the compliance fund and , until recently , $ 2,300 for the campaign ’s primary coffers .
Critics have contended that the large donations to the joint fund - raising accounts amount to a form of soft money .
The Obama campaign has been using its own joint fund - raising committee with the Democratic Party , but it only recently created a separate account for the state parties , so the checks are not nearly as big .
“ The real irony here , ” said Craig Holman , a lobbyist for Public Citizen , a watchdog group , “ is we fought so hard to get B.C.R.A. through , McCain - Feingold through , with the whole intent of getting rid of those large donations , which everyone , including McCain , realized were potentially corrupting .
And we ’ve gone full circle with these large donations for the joint fund - raising committees . ”
Okay , I ’ve seen a lot of absurdities during the election , but this latest effort by MSNBC ’s Contessa Brewer to somehow equate Biden and Palin on foreign policy takes the cake .
The MSNBC anchor actually said that both Biden and Palin will “ try to bolster their foreign policy credentials . ”
Biden does n’t have to bolster his foreign policy cred .
He ’s chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , for christ sakes .
Palin got her passport last year …. photo ops with foreign leaders does n’t bolster her cred , it makes her look more unprepared and unqualified .
All of this coming right when we learn McCain does n’t know where Spain is .
Watch this , it ’s classic .
Absurdly classic :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ACrJR8mn7o]
Yeah , you might say Biden has “ the edge ” on experience — by a 2 to 1 margin .
Even if the traditional media is doing contortions to equate the experience of Biden and Palin , the American people get it :
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
In the impoverished neighborhood of South Los Angeles , fast food is the easiest cuisine to find — and that 's a problem for elected officials who see it as an unhealthy source of calories and cholesterol .
The City Council was poised to vote Tuesday on a moratorium on new fast - food restaurants in a swath of the city where a proliferation of such eateries goes hand - in - hand with obesity .
HEALTH BLOG :
The skinny on fitness and nutrition
" Our communities have an extreme shortage of quality foods , " City Councilman Bernard Parks said .
The aim of the year - long moratorium , which was approved last week in committee , is to give the city time to try to attract restaurants that serve healthier food .
The California Restaurant Association says the moratorium , which could be extended up to two years , is misguided .
Fast food " is the only industry that wants to be in South L.A. , " said association spokesman Andrew Casana .
" Sit - down restaurants do n't want to go in .
If they did , they 'd be there .
This moratorium is n't going to help them relocate . "
The proposed ban comes at a time when governments of all levels are increasingly viewing menus as a matter of public health .
Last Friday , California became the first state in the nation to bar trans fats , which lowers levels of good cholesterol and increases bad cholesterol .
It also comes as the Los Angeles City Council tackles issues beyond safety , schools and streets .
The council last week decided to outlaw plastic bags .
Fast - food restaurants have found themselves in the frying pan in a number of cities .
Some places , including Carmel - by - the Sea and Calistoga , have barred " formula " restaurants altogether ; others have placed a cap on them — Arcata allows a maximum of nine fast - food eateries ; others have prohibited the restaurants in certain areas , such as Port Jefferson , N.Y. , in its waterfront area .
Most initiatives were designed to preserve a city 's historic character .
The Los Angeles bid is one of few that cite residents ' health .
The mounting pressure has caused chains to insert healthier food choices in their menus .
McDonalds offers salads and low - fat dressings ; Burger King stocks Kids Meals with milk and apple pieces .
That 's why the restaurant industry says it 's unfair to blame them for fat people .
" What 's next — security guards at the door saying ' You 're overweight , you can't have a cheeseburger ' ?
" Casana said .
But public health officials say obesity has reached epidemic proportions in low - income areas such as South Los Angeles and diet is the key reason .
According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health , 30 % of adults in South Los Angeles area are obese , compared to 19.1 % for the metropolitan area and 14.1 % for the affluent westside .
Minorities are particularly affected : 28.7 % of Latinos and 27.7 % of blacks are obese , compared to 16.6 % of whites .
Perry says that 's no accident .
South L.A. residents lack healthy food options , including grocery stores , fresh produce markets — and full - service restaurants with wait staff and food prepared to order .
A report by the Community Health Councils found 73 % of South L.A. restaurants were fast food , compared to 42 % in West Los Angeles .
If the moratorium is passed , Perry wants to lure restaurateurs and grocery retailers to area .
Rebeca Torres , a South Los Angeles mother of four , said she would welcome more dining choices , even if she had to pay a little more .
" They should have better things for children , " she said .
" This fast - food really fattens them up . "

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Scotland ’s 2006 ban on smoking in public places cut the heart attack rate by 17 percent within one year , with non-smokers benefiting most , researchers reported on Wednesday .

The study is the first real - time , large - scale look at how a ban on second - hand smoke might benefit smokers and nonsmokers .
Earlier research looked at the effect of smoking bans in individual cities , or had other limitations .
“ A total of 67 percent of the decrease involved non-smokers , ” Dr. Jill Pell of the University of Glasgow and colleagues wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The number of people admitted to nine Scottish hospitals for a heart attack dropped 14 percent among smokers , 19 percent among former smokers and 21 percent for those who had never smoked .
In contrast , the rate declined only by 4 percent in England during that period , before a ban went into effect there .
Historically , heart attack rates in Scotland had been dropping 3 percent per year .
“ There are a number of countries considering whether to impose similar bans , and obviously the more evidence of the effectiveness of such intervention , the more likely they are to do that , ” Pell said in a telephone interview .
Among the 5,919 cases she and her colleagues studied , women seemed to benefit the most .
The heart attack rate among smokers dropped 19 percent compared to an 11 percent decline among men .
It dropped 23 percent among female nonsmokers versus 18 percent among nonsmoking males .
There had been concern at the start of the ban that it would increase the amount of smoking in private homes .
Using measurements of a chemical that gauges exposure to cigarette smoke , the researchers found that the fear was unfounded , and exposure to secondhand smoke declined by 42 percent .
“ So it seems that the ban is not only protecting non-smokers , it is changing society ’s idea of what is normal , ” said Pell .
When New York imposed tough restrictions on public smoking , exposure levels declined by 47 percent .
The United States does not have national smoking restrictions .
Limits are placed by individual states or municipalities .
As many of you know , I also run a blog about the environment and sustainability .
And while I rarely cross-promote articles , I decided that this post ( originally on the other site back in June ) could probably come in handy over here , with the economy the way it is and the growing concern about the environment .
People are looking for more ways to save money and reduce the amount of trash they throw away , and if you look hard enough , there are a ton of things that come into our houses that we can reuse for multiple purposes !
Here are 25 that I came up with ; what would you add to the list ?
Milk jugs ( gallon or 1/2 gallon plastic ) – Clothespin holder after you cut the top off and hang from your clothesline .
Plastic soda or water bottles – Can be used as kids banks after a nice paint job ; a cold pack to be stored in the freezer ; with some small holes in it , fill with bird seed and you have a nice bird feeder .
Spaghetti jars – small planters for around the home .
Film canister –
Cut a slit in the side and you have a holder for a roll of stamps .
Beer bottle caps –
You could pick up some small magnets and some glue at a craft store and make custom refrigerator magnets .
Glass bottles – pick up a light bulb fixture and you have a new lamp ; can be used for vases , decorative grass holders .
Old t- shirts – rags for cleaning up around the house ; sew a couple of your favorites into a pillow .
Shoe and delivery boxes – storage containers , file boxes , etc – no need to waste money on plastic containers from the container store .
Every box in my closet is a reused cardboard one !
Toilet paper roll – extension cord organizer ; stuff with paper and some alcohol to make a fire starter .
Sunday comics – wrapping paper .
You would never have to buy wrapping paper again if you saved this all year !
An old garden hose – make a soaker hose – poke holes throughout , seal off other end , lay in garden ; bucket handle ,
Baby jars – votive candle holders ; storing spices or seeds .
Toothbrushes – bathroom scrubbers ; clothing stain scrubbers .
Mailing tubes – cut several of them to the same length , assemble into a wine rack .
Wine corks – soaked in alcohol , they make a good fire - starter .
CD ’s – one - of - a - kind drink coasters ( paint , cover with paper , etc ) .
Altoids tins –
These tins are the perfect size to make small emergency kits for camping or to keep in your car ; basic sewing kits for college kids .
Shredded paper – Makes great packing material for shipping gifts ; also makes good packing material for when you are moving .
Old jeans – cut up and sew into squares full of padding to make pot holders .
Tires – build an earthship !
Or , maybe just a tire swing .
Old shoes – send to Nike so the rubber can be turned into new playgrounds .
Bath mat – folded just right , can be used as a new floor mop !
Shower curtain – drop cloth for painting ; cover the air conditioner during winter ?
Mason canning jars – canning , obviously , but they also make great drinking glasses .
Paper –
Be sure to use both sides of paper in the house .
Just cut up “ once used ” paper and make notepads with the blank sides !
So what would you add ?
Soon the presidential debates between Barack Obama and John McCain will ensue .

Oregon Launching First Solar Highway in the US
August 13th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Oregon is once again taking the lead with renewable energy by installing the country ’s first highway solar energy project .
The project will consist of a 104 kW solar photovoltaic system that covers 8,000 square feet and produces 112,000 kWh each year .
That ’s 28 % of the energy needed to power the project ’s location , the Interstate 5 and Interstate 205 interchange in Tualatin .
Electricity for the interchange will be provided by PGE .
The solar panels will come into play by producing electricity during the day , giving the power to the PGE grid , and getting the equivalent amount of power back at night from PGE to power lighting on the highway .
The whole project will literally be Oregon - powered , as companies based in - state will provide materials , design , and installation .
Next year , the Oregon Department of Transportation plans to look at more highway project proposals .
Eventually , the department would like to generate 2 million kWh every year with the new projects .
They also are looking for proposals that showcase new ways to utilize solar energy , such as solar panels that double as sound walls near highways .
So if you happen to have any good ideas on Oregon solar , get in touch with ODOT — they ’re clearly open to progress .

9,000 Couples to Marry on Lucky 8/8/08
Come the 8th of August , 2008 , there will be more than one historical event in China , as some estimated 9,000 couples have will be married on the same day to celebrate the opening of the Olympic Games .
The Chinese government had planned the Olympics to kick off on 8/8/08 , due to the number “ 8 ” being very lucky and sounding like part of the phrase “ to get rich ” in Mandarin .
The thousands of couples hope to also share in the blessing of the rare and lucky date , similar to the 7/7/07 marriage craze in the US .
“ We want to show our support for the Olympics , a century - old dream for China , and take part in a major event , ” says Liu Huiling , 24 , an office assistant .
“ Who knows if we will ever see another Olympics ? ”
Before the couples are actually married they will be asked to sign a billboard stating the governments slogan : “ A century of the Olympics ; a century - long dream ; a century - long prayer for happiness ; a century of perfect marriage . ”
Today was the first day that couples could register to be officially married on the 8th of August and around 1,000 couples have already registered .
The estimated 9,000 couple wedding record would more than double China ’s previous single - day wedding record .

The Good Fight : How to Effectively Fight for Social Justice Right Now
We live in very tumultuous times .
So much of what we previously believed about ourselves and the world is being questioned , and perhaps rightly so .
In 2018 , the average CEO made 287 times more money than the average worker .
A mere generation ago , back in the 1960s , CEOs made only twenty times more than the average worker .
This is one of many things that will eventually have to change so that our society can move forward .
The question is how we go about moving forward .
What can the average person do to advocate for social justice ?
We ’ll offer a few suggestions in this article .
1. Take Precautions
One of the major issues we ’re facing at the moment is the COVID 19 pandemic .
We ’ve repeatedly been told to stay six feet away from others , wear a mask in public , and stay at home whenever possible .
Something that is n’t talked about as often is how COVID 19 is disproportionately affecting certain groups of people .
African Americans , Hispanics , and American Indians / Alaska Natives are contracting COVID more than twice as much as white people .
They are also four to five times more likely to visit the hospital with COVID 19 .
African Americans are also twice as likely to die from COVID .
It might be a good idea to bring these statistics up the next time somebody refuses to wear a mask or claims COVID is n’t real .
These are n’t just health issues .
They ’re social justice issues .
2. Fight Censorship and False Information
We walk a strange line with censorship , especially now .
Many modern activists have called for hateful ideas and people to be shut down .
However , others argue that censorship is , in itself , a form of evil , and should not be tolerated regardless of what messages people are spreading .
You can fight censorship with simple steps , like turning off safe mode on your internet .
Contrary to popular belief , you can still turn off safe mode on Tumblr .
Be careful , though , because this Tumblr may contain sensitive media .
Regardless , we can all agree that certain types of speech should n’t be censored .
We should be able to criticize the ideas , processes , and institutions that impact so much of our lives , and demand social justice when human rights are not being respected .
One of the best ways to do this is to fight misinformation .
There ’s a lot of false information out there , and the intent behind it is not always malicious .
Many people are legitimately convinced that they ’re speaking the truth .
If somebody is distributing false info , correct them .
They may apologize , and even change their opinion .
They may dig in their heels until you show them proof .
A few wo n’t change even after you show them proof .
Some people are like this , and you ca n’t change them .
How to Fight for Social Justice
The fight for social justice is going to be one of the biggest issues of our generation .
We ’ve talked about a few ways to combat injustice in this article , but there are plenty of others out there .
We encourage you to do more research to see what else you can do .

McCain campaign manager was for McCain ’s record before he was against it
Of all the various interviews on the Sunday morning shows , McCain campaign manager Rick Davis ’ appearance on “ Fox News Sunday ” was likely to be the least interesting .
The head of the Republican campaign on the Republican network ?
Not exactly must - see TV .
But FNC ’s Chris Wallace was actually at the top of his game yesterday , and raised hard - hitting questions that left Davis looking unusually bad .
Take this exchange , for example :
There was no doubt the McCain gang was inviting this ; I ’m just surprised someone in the media was willing to bring it up .
McCain ’s new ad says the nation is worse off now than it was four years ago , but as Wallace noted , McCain , as recently as a year ago , was voting with the Bush line 95 % of the time .
Given this , should n’t McCain bear some of the responsibility ?
“ Well , look , if you want to talk about history , then you can make all of the cases you want to make , ” Davis responded .
He added that McCain has been a maverick and “ the biggest irritant ” to the Bush administration .
I have n’t the foggiest idea what that means — if McCain votes with Bush 95 % of the time , then he obviously is n’t an irritant or a maverick ; he ’s the opposite of an irritant or a maverick .
“ But I ’ve got to come back at you , ” Wallace said .
“ If you say the country is worse off than it was four years ago , clearly the president has got to bear some of the responsibility , and by his own record , his own admission , John McCain voted with the president , last year , 95 % of the time . ”
Point , set , match .
Davis said something about those votes not mattering too much , but it was too late — Wallace had already destroyed the McCain campaign ’s claim .
There was more , too .
Here ’s Davis struggling to explain his lobbying role in the DHL deal in Ohio :
And here ’s Davis struggling to explain why Dick Cheney is speaking at the Republican convention .
“ You ’ll never find John McCain changing his stripes just because of an election , ” Davis said .
Um , Rick ?

In short , there is no conclusive evidence Einstein was a theist .
At best , he was a Pantheist and used the term " God " as an abstract symbol of the unknown / creation .
I think part of the problem of theists wanting to believe that famous scientists such as Einstein and Hawking believe in their god comes from the common quote : " God does not play dice with the Universe . "
To those who already wish that Einstein believed in god , Einstein 's mere mention of " god " here is all the " assurance " they need .
But to truly understand what he meant when he said that , one has to dig further into Einstein 's views toward god and religion .
Scientists often informally use " god " to mean the laws of nature .
Here are some quotes relating to Einstein 's views on god & religion :
" I believe in Spinoza 's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists , not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings . "
Upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue , New York , April 24 , 1921 , [ 1 ] .
" an attempt to find an out where there is no door . " [ 2 ]
" Our situation on this earth seems strange .
Every one of us appears here involuntary and uninvited for a short stay , without knowing the whys and the wherefore .
In our daily lives we only feel that man is here for the sake of others , for those whom we love and for many other beings whose fate is connected with our own . " ...
" The most beautiful and deepest experience a man can have is the sense of the mysterious .
It is the underlying principle of religion as well as all serious endeavour in art and science .
He who never had this experience seems to me , if not dead , then at least blind .
To sense that behind anything that can be experienced there is a something that our mind cannot grasp and whose beauty and sublimity reaches us only indirectly and as a feeble reflection , this is religiousness .
In this sense I am religious .
To me it suffices to wonder at these secrets and to attempt humbly to grasp with my mind a mere image of the lofty structure of all that there is . "
Einstein 's speech ' My Credo ' to the German League of Human Rights , Berlin , autumn 1932 , Einstein : A Life in Science , Michael White and John Gribbin , Page 262 .
Letter to Eric Gutkind ( partial ) Albert Einstein ( 1954 ) Translated from the German by Joan Stambaugh ... ...
The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses , the Bible a collection of honourable , but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish .
No interpretation no matter how subtle can ( for me ) change this .
These subtilised interpretations are highly manifold according to their nature and have almost nothing to do with the original text .
For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions .
And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people .
As far as my experience goes , they are also no better than other human groups , although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power .
Otherwise I cannot see anything ' chosen ' about them .
In general I find it painful that you claim a privileged position and try to defend it by two walls of pride , an external one as a man and an internal one as a Jew .
As a man you claim , so to speak , a dispensation from causality otherwise accepted , as a Jew the priviliege of monotheism .
But a limited causality is no longer a causality at all , as our wonderful Spinoza recognized with all incision , probably as the first one .
And the animistic interpretations of the religions of nature are in principle not annulled by monopolisation .
With such walls we can only attain a certain self - deception , but our moral efforts are not furthered by them .
On the contrary .
Now that I have quite openly stated our differences in intellectual convictions it is still clear to me that we are quite close to each other in essential things , ie in our evalutations of human behaviour .
What separates us are only intellectual ' props ' and `rationalisation ' in Freud 's language .
Therefore I think that we would understand each other quite well if we talked about concrete things .
With friendly thanks and best wishes Yours , A. Einstein .
And here 's one that seems to speak from the grave :
" It was , of course , a lie what you read about my religious convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated .
I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly .
If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . "
- Albert Einstein in Albert Einstein : The Human Side , edited by Helen Dukas ( Einstein 's secretary ) and Banesh Hoffman , and published by Princeton University Press .
Sorry for the rant ; Einstein 's sort of one of my historical heroes . :)
P.S. - ok , one more - sort of humorous ( from the religious standpoint , at least ) :
" Coughlin [ of the Los Angeles tabloid Illustrated Daily News , in hot pursuit of asking Einstein a provocative , headline - inducing question ] found the right moment while tailing the car that was speeding the couple [ the Einsteins ] north on the coast road to Pasadena .
It had stopped to let Einstein stroll over to a small headland known as Sunset Cliffs , where he stood gazing at the sea and sky .
Seizing the moment , Coughlin leaped from his car , the question on his lips , followed by Spang , his camera at the ready .
" Doctor " , Coughlin said , " is there a God ? "
Einstein stared at the water 's edge some twenty feet below , then turned to his questioner .
Coughlin later wrote : " There were tears in his eyes , and he was sniffing .
Spang shot the picture as Einstein was hustled away before he could answer me .
" Well , " I said , " the way he reacted , he believes in God .
Did you ever see such an emotional face ? "
Spang was standing on the edge of the headland , where the great scientist had stood .
He looked down , then called me : " Come over here . "
I looked down and there , caught against the base of the little cliff , was a shark that must have been dead in the hot sun for several days .
" Make anybody cry " , Spang said . "

In January of 1936 , a young girl named Phyllis wrote to Albert Einstein on behalf of her Sunday school class , and asked , " Do scientists pray ? "
Her letter , and Einstein 's reply , can be read below .
( Source : Dear Professor Einstein ; Image : Albert Einstein in 1947 , via Life . )
The Riverside Church January 19 , 1936 My dear Dr. Einstein ,
We have brought up the question :
Do scientists pray ? in our Sunday school class .
It began by asking whether we could believe in both science and religion .
We are writing to scientists and other important men , to try and have our own question answered .
We will feel greatly honored if you will answer our question :
Do scientists pray , and what do they pray for ?
We are in the sixth grade , Miss Ellis 's class .
Respectfully yours , Phyllis January 24 , 1936 Dear Phyllis , I will attempt to reply to your question as simply as I can .
Here is my answer : Scientists believe that every occurrence , including the affairs of human beings , is due to the laws of nature .
Therefore a scientist cannot be inclined to believe that the course of events can be influenced by prayer , that is , by a supernaturally manifested wish .
However , we must concede that our actual knowledge of these forces is imperfect , so that in the end the belief in the existence of a final , ultimate spirit rests on a kind of faith .
Such belief remains widespread even with the current achievements in science .
But also , everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe , one that is vastly superior to that of man .
In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort , which is surely quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive .
With cordial greetings , your A. Einstein [ 3 ]

Is an angry society an unhealthy one ?
So we 're often told .
Feeling angry ?
Well , then , say those earnest experts who seek to soothe our roiled spirits , calm down .
Take a pill .
Try yoga .
In The New York Times the op - ed columnist Nicholas D. Kristof begs us to " hold the vitriol , " which , he worries , " discourages public service . "
And yet where would America be without its anger ?
Perhaps still under Colonial rule , if those rowdy upstarts had never tossed British tea into Boston Harbor .
Perhaps still mired in a slave - based economy , if not for the prodding of yes , vitriolic abolitionists .
Okay — I 'm exaggerating to underscore a point .
But the point is worth considering : the presence of anger can indicate a society 's moral and political well - being , and its absence can be a worrisome sign of complacency .
Indeed , the democratic idea rests on the proposition that the well - placed anger of the citizenry can be an appropriate and useful instrument of change .
Aristotle certainly thought so .
" The man who is angry at the right things and with the right people ... , " he wrote in Book IV of the Nicomachean Ethics , " is praised . "
Praise be , America 's social - anger thermometer is on the rise .
No , the mercury has not reached the level of the 1960s , America 's previous Decade of Anger .
But there is an appreciable warming of the economic , political , and cultural climate zones .
Let 's start with a brief definition of terms .
By " social anger " — or , let 's say , " public anger " — I do n't mean incidents of road rage or obscene chants directed by Boston Red Sox bleacher bums at New York Yankees outfielders .
My concern is with the anger that is directed at the institutions of political , legal , economic , and cultural power ; at the practices and policies that such institutions pursue ; and at the people in charge of them .
This is , broadly speaking , anti-establishmentarian anger .
Ripe targets include the Pentagon , the Republican Party , George Bush , multinational corporations , the California car - tax collector , and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court judges who in November revoked a state ban on same - sex marriages .
The prospect of gay marriage infuriates religiously motivated conservative traditionalists .
Manufacturing workers are angry about jobs lost to a resurgent China .
( " A SEETHING POLITICAL ANGER RISES IN AMERICA'S INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND , " the trade publication Manufacturing & Technology News recently declared . )
Perhaps the most sensitive issue of all is the mounting casualty list in U.S. - occupied Iraq , which is generating antiwar wrath at the powers that be in Washington .
Some of this anger is deeply personal , born of grief ; it is acquiring a public , political cast as relatives of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq speak out in the newspapers and on radio and television .
" The President do n't care , " Vecie Williams , the cousin of Sergeant Aubrey Bell , of Tuskegee , Alabama , who was shot and killed in front of an Iraqi police station , told The New York Times .
" You see him on TV .
He says this , he says that .
But show me one tear , one tear . "
Ahead of us promises to be an invigorating election season in which the prizes go to those candidates able to tap the anger while managing to avoid becoming its target .
Howard Dean , the front - runner for the Democratic nomination , who at any moment looks ready to sink his teeth into the nearest available thigh , is banking his campaign on the " I 'm mad as hell " ( about Iraq , the economy , Bush , you name it ) vote .
Other Democrats are certainly doing their best to imitate his snarl .
" The angry voter is back , " the veteran pollster John Zogby reports .
" He and she have been on sabbatical . "
Zogby says the sabbatical began with the economic boom that started in the mid-1990s , but the boom petered out nearly three years ago , and the discord has been growing ever since .
And the terrorism threat seems to have only exacerbated partisan rivalry .
The Washington - based Pew Research Center found in a recent survey that " national unity was the initial response to the calamitous events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , but that spirit has dissolved amid rising political polarization and anger . "
Although public anger tends toward cyclical peaks and troughs , its varieties fall into well - established taxonomical grooves .
There really are n't any altogether new kinds of anti-establishmentarian anger in America — a country that since its birth has been a congenial breeding ground for this sort of animosity .
But even if such anger is a fixed part of America 's genetic code , mutations occur as the various strains adapt to a changing political , social , and cultural environment .
A catalogue of the forms of social anger in America circa 2003 reflects the nation 's evolution as the ultimate middle - class society .
It turns out that public anger does n't dissipate as the average house size ( and waistband ) expands ; it simply fastens onto new targets .
Perhaps , as some analysts argue , the anger of an affluent post - industrial society is inevitably rooted more in cultural identity than in economic discontent — but then again , never underestimate the rage of an American who senses a threat to material livelihood .
At least three forms of anger in the catalogue , updated for the times , are classic breeds .
Economic - Populist Anger Traditional American populism was born on the prairie , as struggling nineteenth - century farmers focused their ire on the large , alien , impersonal forces of a rapidly industrializing economy — namely , the extortionist freight - hauling railroads and Wall Street banks to which the farmers were hostage .
Today 's prototypical angry worker is the laid - off factory worker ; since March of 1998 the U.S. manufacturing sector has shed 3.1 million jobs .
The blue - collar manufacturing sector endured a similar downsizing in the early 1980s , but now there is a growing white - collar component to the trend , with Boeing , Microsoft , and IBM all " outsourcing " software - programming and engineering jobs to lower - wage havens like India and Russia .
In an Internet society it is possible to contract abroad for almost any work that deals principally in digitized data , such as insurance claims .
The future of populist anger may thus lie in Redmond , Washington , and Hartford , Connecticut .
Born of economic fear and insecurity , this anger has an eternal future in a dynamic capitalist society in which " structural change " is inescapable .
In the here and now , though , the anger is concentrated in places like Rockford , Illinois , a once thriving center of machine - tool industry about an hour 's drive from Chicago .
The Rockford area has lost 10,000 jobs in the past three years — at Motorola , Textron , and other companies — and many of those laid - off workers who have found new employment are generally working for lower wages , without health and other benefits .
" We 're on our way to becoming a Third World nation , " says Donald Manzullo , a Republican member of Congress who was born in Rockford in 1944 and has represented the district since 1993 .
Manzullo is a lawyer ; his father was a machinist .
Although he counts himself a free - trader , he blames China , as do many others in his district , for keeping its currency artificially undervalued , thus boosting exports .
What 's the state of mind of his constituents ?
" They are angry because they lost their jobs , " he says , " angry because the jobs are going overseas , and angry because the Chinese work for such a low wage . "
The anger is starting to turn inward , into depression : " A lot of people have given up hope . "
Although the pain from which populist anger springs is certainly real , the anger itself tends to be misplaced .
Rapacious railroads damaged but did not destroy the yeoman farmer ; he fell prey to mechanization , which raised the productivity of American agriculture so much that many fewer workers were needed to produce the same quantity of , say , corn .
Similarly , the main reason today 's manufacturing workers occupy a shrinking share of the work force is that automation has vastly improved productivity in factories — a trend also inexorably in motion in Japan and Europe .
Still , populist anger tends to serve a useful social purpose .
Agrarian populism generated political momentum for the trust - busting and other good - government reforms of the Progressive era .
Angry U.S. manufacturing workers are helping to stimulate an overdue debate on the sweatshop conditions in which many products are made in China and elsewhere — a debate that has already prompted Nike and other multinationals to upgrade their overseas labor standards , and that may yield a more balanced trade policy ( if not one that restores the industrial vitality of Rockford ) .
And if health - care benefits ever become " portable " ( that is , migrate with workers wherever they go ) , the populist anger of permanently anxious workers forced to change jobs half a dozen times during their careers probably will have been responsible .
Liberal Anger
In the beginning , the Angry American Liberal was a Christian human - rights zealot embarked on a crusade ordained by a wrathful God against the original sin of the new republic : slavery .
Harriet Beecher Stowe , the daughter of an evangelical Protestant preacher , helped to support her family by writing for religious periodicals .
She shook the country with her first novel , the anti-slavery tract Uncle Tom 's Cabin ( 1852 ) , but her writing , suffused with a Christian sentimentality , has scant appeal for the modern liberal .
Outside the African - American community , whose religious leaders continue to embrace a liberal politics of righteous indignation rooted in the Bible , the voices of modern liberalism are almost entirely secular .
The creeping secularization of liberal anger , which brings the values of the white American liberal into rough alignment with those of Northern Europe 's mainstream political culture , stands as political anger 's most impressive adaptation in the past century .
Indeed , religious fervor is a central animus for this liberal , who associates it with intolerance and inexplicable ( to the modern liberal mind ) conservative obsessions such as abortion and school prayer .
Perhaps not since the 1960s has liberal anger been so intense .
Its grievances have blended into a potent brew : first the 2000 election , which liberals believe George Bush stole ; then the inattention to environmental concerns , as symbolized by the Bush Administration 's abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol ; and now the Iraq War , which liberals widely view as manufactured by the Bush team to benefit nefarious crony interests , including the oil - services company Halliburton , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former employer .
The Republican Party itself is seen as a font of evil .
To take a sounding of this anger I spoke with one of modern American liberalism 's most articulate — and imposing — representatives : the novelist Jane Smiley , who stands over six feet tall and regularly dispatches angry letters on politics to The New York Times and other news organizations .
Smiley 's novels have not so far tackled explicitly political themes , but the writer offered a modern commentary on patriarchal rage in A Thousand Acres , which loosely uses the plot of King Lear for a story about a midwestern father 's tempestuous dealings with his three daughters .
" I woke up early this morning , and I lay awake anxious and angry about political matters , " Smiley told me in a telephone chat from her home in Carmel Valley , California , on a Thursday in early November , the day after she learned that the Republicans had won gubernatorial elections in Kentucky and Mississippi .
" I see people who are Republicans as people who have aligned themselves with the worst features of the American character .
I call them the gruesome threesome : toxic patriotism , toxic religion , and toxic racism . "
Smiley conceded that her anger is in some sense problematic ; it 's disturbing her sleep , for one thing , and it disagrees , she said , with the liberal 's temperamental preference for placid tolerance .
But on the whole , she said , " I do n't actually mind being angry .
I do n't think liberals mind .
I think it 's a good thing . "
This current wave of anger has been a long time coming , with liberals finally responding in kind to the generation of smash - mouth conservatives who have been assaulting them since the Reagan era .
Before there was Howard Dean there was Al Franken , the former Saturday Night Live writer and performer who in 1996 published his mold - making Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations .
That book , Franken told me recently , grew out of his anger at the Gingrich revolution of 1994 , for which he saw Limbaugh as " the mouthpiece . "
Franken 's current anti-Bush , anti-Republican best seller , Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell
Them , prepared with research assistance from students at Harvard ( where Franken was a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government 's Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy ) , is relatively low on humor and in the vein of a political - activist tract .
It is a favorite among Dean 's well - read supporters , who are disproportionately drawn from the wealthiest , best - educated wing of the Democratic Party .
The bane of modern liberal anger is its tendency to closet itself in elite , marginal causes , such as those espoused by the various societies opposed to anyone 's wearing fur .
But liberal anger at its best is drawn from the deepest and purest source of all : love .
No one has ever expressed this anger better than Charles Dickens .
With his scathing indictments of the numerous institutional injustices of Victorian Britain — from debtors ' prisons to dreadful factories dependent on child labor — he moved a society toward its better self , and toward reform .
In America a kind of Dickensian anger appeared in the civil - rights movement of the 1960s , which laid bare the injustices of institutionalized racism .
The last sermon that Martin Luther King Jr. wrote ( he was murdered before he could deliver it ) was titled " Why America May Go to Hell . "
But King 's central vision was of a new Promised Land , which could be reached only through a redemptive journey paid for in the coin of love .
Today 's wrathful liberals are unlikely to broaden their appeal unless they can transcend their penchant for satire and sarcasm — which are indirect ways , after all , of taking a poke at a target .
Michael Moore 's best seller Dude , Where 's My Country ?
does n't quite cut it .
Traditional - Values Anger Just how long can social conservatives stay angry ?
Conservative anger at such venerable targets as Harvard , Hollywood , and the TV networks began well before the ascent of Rush Limbaugh , in the mid-1980s — its roots are in the Goldwater and Nixon campaigns of the 1960s and even before that , in young - Republican activism on college campuses .
In an earlier era , when Darwinism was a fresher concept , conservative Bible Belt anger welled up at the teaching of evolution in the public schools .
Conservative anger persists because core elements of the conservative world view — which is grounded in an abiding religious belief — are in fact under steady assault ( and have been ridiculed since at least H. L. Mencken , with his barbs at Bible Belters ) .
The conservative bid ( led by southern Democrats ) to thwart racial integration was lost decades ago , so thoroughly lost that Mississippi Senator Trent Lott and other old - style conservatives are nowadays embarrassed to be reminded that so many in their ranks supported the struggle to maintain segregation .
The effort to limit abortion achieves an occasional success ( such as the recently enacted restriction on so - called partial - birth abortion ) , but the overall trend is altogether in favor of the liberal feminist vision enunciated by Betty Friedan & Co. in the 1960s .
Conservative attempts to keep smut from invading the household faltered with the coming of the Internet , a pure - gold pipeline for the pornography industry .
And in a society as culturally fluid as America 's there will always be new causes for anger on the right .
These days gay rights seem to be taking the place once occupied by racial integration as a focus for conservative rage , with the anger meter rising especially rapidly on the volatile issue of gay marriage .
One stalwart opponent of gay marriage , Sandy Rios , the president of Concerned Women for America , a Washington - based group whose motto calls for " prayer and action , " says she possesses " a righteous anger " that " comes from serious followers of Jesus . "
A divorced fifty - four - year - old mother of two who grew up in southern Illinois , Rios says that she herself has seen how the permissive values of the 1960s have broken up families and damaged children .
Why such strong sentiments on gay marriage in particular ?
Because traditional marriage , between a man and a woman , is like " the support beam in a big house , " she says .
" If you take the support beam out , the structure will fail . "
At its worst conservative anger detracts from well - being not only by embracing stereotyped and in some cases hateful images of certain groups of people but also by drawing from the tainted well of nostalgia .
The well is tainted because the nostalgia is usually for a society remembered or imagined as much better than it ever actually was .
Nostalgia can make for poignant art , but it tends to produce a perverse and impractical politics .
In 1930 a group of southern writers at Vanderbilt University , including John Crowe Ransom and other " fugitive poets , " railed against a faster - paced modern life in their deservedly discarded political manifesto I 'll Take My Stand , which offered the South " in its very backwardness " as a pathway to " the reconstruction of America . "
But at its best conservative anger has forced a rigorous , Old Testament - like moral accounting on issues incautiously advanced by modern liberal secularists .
America , which does sometimes seem close to motoring full throttle over a secular cliff , is richer for the debate that angry and uncompromising social conservatives have forced on abortion and euthanasia .
As inflamed as the question of gay marriage is likely to become , committed conservatives will force lawmakers , courts , and the large number of citizens who are unsure of their stance to do some hard thinking about the legal and moral meanings of marriage and its larger significance for the social health of America .
We 're probably going to get where the liberal secularists want to take us , but at a more measured , more deliberate pace .

Too much trust can actually be a bad thing — a polity of suckers is no better than a nation of cynics .
But Americans ' steadily declining faith in one another is a warning .
By Jedediah Purdy " Suspicious Minds " ( January / February 2003 ) Too much trust can actually be a bad thing — a polity of suckers is no better than a nation of cynics .
But Americans ' steadily declining faith in one another is a warning .
By Jedediah Purdy
Is social anger really , on balance , a public good ?
Certain variants seem entirely devoid of merit .
Cynicism — at least one part the anger of the disillusioned spirit — is generally corrosive , although a populace that errs on the side of suspiciousness toward its leaders is not altogether a bad thing .
( Better a cynical than a credulous nation . )
Then there 's a loathing of our nation 's leaders , which is often linked to a sense of betrayal .
A violent , visceral hatred has at times exacted the steepest of prices : the assassination of Abraham Lincoln came during a campaign of unremitting vilification , in which haters portrayed the President as a traitor to his race and drew caricatures of him as a Negro and an ape .
In the 1990s a wave of presidential loathing resulted in the character assassination of Bill Clinton , who was hated with a particular intensity by fellow southerners who viewed his liberalism and his embrace of selected aspects of 1960s counterculture ( even if he never inhaled ) as a threat to their region 's native conservatism .
Clinton of course provoked them with his behavioral lapses and subsequent lies — but the loathing was out of proportion to the offenses .
And now George Bush , who strikes a fair number of people as a genial guy , is the target of loathing on the left , with the haters gleefully confessing to an obsessive animosity .
( " I hate George W. Bush , " Jonathan Chait wrote at the outset of his September 29 New Republic cover story , " Mad About You . " )
Loathing tends to focus on the minutely personal as emblematic of the political ; in Bush 's case , his strut seems to be a particularly infuriating trait , a signifier of the cockiness and arrogance the loathers see in his stance on Iraq and other matters .
" He 's a smug bastard — you can tell by the way he walks , " said Peter Nelson , a thirty - five - year - old massage therapist who showed up at Faneuil Hall , in Boston , to cheer on Howard Dean at a debate there on November 4 .
( To demonstrate , Nelson puffed out his chest and swung his arms wide , mimicking a cowboy saunter . )
It may be that loathing of the President is an unavoidable by - product of the pursuit of bold change .
Few Presidents have faced more vitriol than Franklin Delano Roosevelt , whom fellow patricians considered a betrayer of his class for his embrace of the New Deal .
It 's hard to remember much loathing of the mild Calvin Coolidge .
True , social anger in America today too often betrays the impatience and ingratitude of a spoiled - brat society .
In almost every corner of the planet live people who would sacrifice a good deal to trade their list of daily public angers for that of the average American .
Has the good life ever been lived better than in California , which despite its laid - back image has for many years been a pacesetter for the anger agenda ?
California 's per capita income — $ 32,702 — puts it well ahead of the United Kingdom , Germany , and France .
Yet Californians were so angered by a proposed tripling of the state 's car tax that they recalled Governor Gray Davis and replaced him with Arnold Schwarzenegger , the former bodybuilder best known for his movie role as the Terminator .
As for the despised levy , it meant that the owner of a 2003 4x4 Chevrolet Suburban , retailing at $ 40,665 , would have to pay a tax of $ 813.30 rather than $ 264.32 .
Small change , one might think , for the sort of consumer quite willing to add on such features as heated leather seats , an XM satellite radio system , and a DVD player for the kids .
But flashpan anger in response to even slight threats to material well - being ultimately reflects the country 's distinctive determination — sanctioned in its founding charter — to pursue happiness .
( The Terminator 's first official act as governor , needless to say , was to roll back the car tax . )

Do our differences effectively split us into two nations ?
By David Brooks
Of course , more might be accomplished if Americans could somehow manage to become as united in their anger as Californians seem to have been on the car tax .
The clash between angry secular liberals and angry religiously motivated conservatives sometimes seems to generate little more than media din .
But the rising partisanship of the American voter is probably a positive development .
A country as big and diverse as the United States cannot avoid contentious fights over public - policy issues .
A broad sorting of voters into a Red team and a Blue team — a trend harking back to the intense partisanship of the nineteenth century — is better than a European - style fragmentation of the electorate into numerous small parties , able to govern only after patching together fragile coalitions .
The same Pew Research Center survey that found — tut - tut — a surge in the intensity of partisan feelings also turned up a decline in cynicism about government .
That makes sense .
The Pragmatic American would n't be investing energies — and angers — in partisan causes if he or she did n't believe in the decent possibility of a payoff .
America works as well as it does because of the practical use it makes of its anger .
Now the country is getting angry again .
Perhaps it is not angry enough .
How big is too big ?
That 's the question that you inevitably ask yourself once you spend any amount of time with Panasonic 's new 150 - inch plasma TV prototype .
We visited it in Panasonic 's towering warehouse in Secaucus , New Jersey last Friday , running it through its paces with 4 K footage , Blu-ray movies and Playstation 3 games .
After spending a day with it , was it the type of thing I honestly wanted to set up in my living room ?

Maybe .
Maybe not .
The standards that we use to measure other TVs do n't apply here .
Have you ever seen a TV taller than yourself ?
A TV that uses more energy than your washer and dryer ?
A TV that needs to be carried around on a forklift ?
I 'm guessing you have n't .
This thing is in a category all its own .
Man , is it impressive .
If you stand within a few feet of it , it fills your entire field of vision , quickly making you motion sick if you 're playing video games or watching a movie with lots of action .
Even standing 20 feet away , you still feel like the TV is the only thing in the room .
It 's a 4 K set , so if you 've got the proper ultra - HD footage pumping into it , it makes 1080 p look like a second - rate resolution , but even with 1080 p , it 's absolutely stunning .

My body felt a dissonance because I was n't moving my legs or having my body jolted with recoil from my automatic weapon .

I 've played video games on big TVs before .
I visited Panasonic last year to do similar , uh , " tests " on their 103 - inch plasma .
And while that was awesome , it still felt like playing games and watching movies on a really big TV .
The 150 transcends regular TV to become something more .
It 's like something out of a sci - fi movie , a living wall , a form of primitive virtual reality .
It 's so overwhelming that you can't really fathom putting it in your house because you can't see it fitting into any kind of reality you inhabit .

Inside the warehouse , we placed a 42 - inch plasma next to it that looked pathetic , like something you 'd put over your toilet to watch SportsCenter while you take a leak .
I wanted to put it in my pocket .
Even the 103 - incher looked sad and small next to it .
And trust me , a 103 - inch TV does n't look sad or small in too many situations .

If this were a true review , I 'd have to complain that , since a 4K TV does to 1080 p what your new HDTV does to standard - def , you 're bound to watch a lot of crappy looking TV on this .
If 1080 p looks bad , think about all of the channels that come through in standard def .
And if you 're planning on streaming Netflix movies via your Xbox onto this TV , be prepared for digital artifacts the size of your head .
But you know what ?
This TV is n't designed for you to put in your living room .
Sorry .
It 's a TV from the future , generously time - teleported back to the present by our friends at Panasonic .
You are n't going to hook a VCR up to this thing , and neither are they ; it is designed to run with precision - mastered footage , and our current lack of worthy video does n't diminish the ridiculous potency of the thing .

Believe it or not , Panasonic will begin selling the 150 - inch plasma sometime next year , probably for about twice as much as the $ 70,000 103 - incher .
Will it be snapped up by anyone ?
Probably .
There are always sultanates and NBA stars looking to have the biggest and most expensive TV in the world , and this definitely fits that bill .
But again I 'll ask :
Is it something normal people would benefit from having in their living room ?
I 'd say no , but not out of broke resentment and the fact that this would quadruple my energy bill and require me to knock down most of the walls of my home to even get it inside .
I do n't think people should put this in their living rooms because , when you get down to it , this is n't a TV .
I do n't want to imagine people watching Two and a Half Men on it .
To check the weather on The Weather Channel on this thing would be an act approaching sacrilege .
It 's more than a TV : it 's a glimpse into the future , it 's a brazen display of hubris and overkill , and it's a visceral , skin - searing experience .
It belongs on spaceships and in museums , not in living rooms .
It 's only right .
" I told them it was a private party and to clear off but this big youth put his face right into mine and said : ' make me ' , " said Mr Driman , 46 .
The South African electrical contractor said he had " sensed trouble " when he saw the youths outside and had armed himself with a decorative sjambok from inside the house .
The gang split into two groups and entered the house at the front and side , kicking a screen door off its hinges in the process .
Mr Driman , the only adult at his son's party , confronted the ringleader as he came around the side of the house .
" As I tackled him , six of them came over the top of me .
I received a big hit to the side of my head , " said Mr Driman .
" It happened really quickly . "
His son Brennan said : " There were six or seven really big , buff guys on top of my dad , hitting him .
I had to try and pull him out . "
As he got clear Mr Driman started using the sjambok - a 1.5 metre plastic whip like the traditional rhino hide whips used by South African herdsmen .
" I am certainly not a hero .
I just defended my property and my son's friends .
There were a group of 15 - year - old girls there too , " said Mr Driman .
" These guys were much bigger .
" People have had enough .
This gang has been terrorising people whose kids are having parties for months now .
Somebody needed to stand up to them . "
Brennan added : " I know that if Dad had not stood up to them they would have completely trashed the house and stolen anything they could get their hands on . "
None of the youths could be identified and so no charges were laid .
Hornsby police were called to the incident and are understood to be considering whether the force Mr Driman used to protect his home was excessive .
NSW Police could not comment on the incident yesterday but a spokesman told the local paper Mr Driman had the right to defend himself - the question was whether he had used too much force .
" All I would suggest , if a situation arises again , leave it to the police to handle , " he said .
Mr Driman remained unrepentant : " I would gladly do it again .
They picked on the wrong guy , " he said .

Portable Charger Powered by Kinetic Motion Will Be Released Next Year
August 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Should n’t a strenuous run provide something more than a rush of endorphins ?
Something , perhaps , like power to charge your cell phone ?
M2E Power agrees .
The company , which works with kinetic motion technology , announced plans today to release a portable charger for mobile devices sometime next summer .
The charger , which is the size of a pack of cards , derives power from cumulative motion from walking , jogging , cycling , or driving .
Six hours of motion provides 30 to 60 minutes of extra power .
And at $ 25 to $ 40 , M2E ’s catch - all charger wo n’t break the bank .
The kinetic energy system uses the Faraday Principle , which states that the movement of a conductor through a magnetic field produces voltage in the conductor proportional to the speed of movement .
In this case , the conductor is a wire coil .
The system uses a magnet that moves against the coil every time the charger moves , generating a charge that is captured in a capacitor .
A logic circuit takes the charge to the built - in Li-Ion cell , where it is stored until use .
While the portable charger will be M2E ’s only commercially available product in the near future , the company plans has more plans for their kinetic technology in the pipeline , including a centralized battery pack for military units and power for peripheral systems of hybrid cars .
On a larger scale , M2E hopes to use kinetic energy to enhance wind , hydropower , and tidal power efficiency .
Not bad for a company that came out of stealth mode less than a year ago .

Interbrand has concluded its study of this year 's top brands and released its annual Best Global Brands survey , a valuation based on several factors of international reach and financial growth .
A number of tech companies , including Google , IBM , and Nintendo saw the most positive gains , while financial giants and even Microsoft saw their places slip from previous years .
While Coca - Cola retained its place as the number one global brand for its eighth year in a row , Google saw explosive 43 percent growth from 2007 , leaping from its spot at number 20 and breaking into the list of top 10 brands at number 10 .
IBM also grew by three percent this year , rising from number three in 2007 to knock Microsoft out of its number two spot .
The rest of Interbrand 's top ten brands for 2008 continue with GE at number four , then Nokia , Toyota , Intel , McDonalds , and Disney .
That Google shot so far up the charts so quickly and broke into the top 10 brands in just 10 years of existence is no small feat .
Between successfully growing and defending its dominance in search over the last year , as well as expanding aggressively into mobile and business services , Google has become a household name and a part of everyday vocabulary .
Interbrand says it uses a proprietary formula for constructing this list , a methodology that takes into account several components of a company 's brand , such as financial strength , influence over point - of - purchase customer demand , and its ability to retain customers and demand for products , which in turn sustains future earning forecasts .
Other brands that saw significant gains include Nintendo , with 13 percent growth and a rise from spot 44 in 2007 to 40 , Apple , with the second largest positive gain of 24 percent growth and a move from spot 33 to 24 , and Amazon with a 19 percent growth and shift from spot 62 to 58 .
In light of the turbulent financial week , it should come as no surprise that brands , like Merrill Lynch , fell 12 spots to number 34 .
Strangely , though , some credit card companies did quite well due to their brand strengths , with Visa making its first entrance on the list at 100 , and American Express holding its own at 15 , with five percent growth from 2007 .
Interbrand notes that one of the most important new factors driving brand value across all sectors — financial services , consumer goods , and especially automotive — is sustainability .
Car manufacturers , and even luxury specialists , like Mercedes , are placing a much greater emphasis on fuel efficiency , with Honda being the only auto maker reporting better sales in 2008 over the previous year .
" In troubled economies business does n’t cease .
Companies may struggle , but the practice of buying and selling continues no matter what , " Jez Frampton , Global CEO of Interbrand , said in a press release .
" Many of the Best Global Brands know this and come through these difficult times stronger and better poised to compete .
The key to success , in good times and bad , is understanding how your brand creates value . "
Angry Bear writes
: We have a long record to compare the teenage unemployment rate and the minimum wage ( see graph above ) .
If you look at the two series you see a very inconsistent record .
Sometimes a rise in the minimum wage is followed by a drop in the teenage unemployment rate and sometimes it is followed by a rise in the teenage unemployment rate .
Essentially , the correlation between the teenage unemployment rate and changes in the minimum wage is zero , strongly implying that there is no causal relationship .
MP : Let 's assume there is no correlation between : a ) teenage unemployment rate and b ) changes in the minimum wage .
That is not the same thing as saying that " the minimum wage has no negative effect on teenage employment . "
Here 's why :
Even if the same number of teenage workers are employed after a hike in the minimum wage , reflected in NO change in the teen jobless rate ( and this is not necessarily true ) , there are many other adjustments that employers would make to offset the monetary increase in labor costs :
1. Fewer hours - unskilled workers might still be employed , but at a reduced number of hours ( the BLS counts workers as " employed " even if they work 1 hour per week ) .
Full - time workers now become part - time workers .
Overtime hours are eliminated .
Full - time workers now are forced to work a split - shift ( e.g. 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. - 8 p.m. ) .
Therefore , we would expect a negative relationship between increases in the minimum wage and HOURS WORKED .
2. Reduced benefits - employers can adjust " total compensation " and offset higher monetary wages by : a ) no longer providing free uniforms , forcing employees to now pay for uniforms , b ) no longer providing free or reduced food at fast food restaurants , c ) reducing or eliminating " employee discounts " on the employer 's merchandise , d ) eliminating paid holidays , e ) eliminating scholarship programs , f ) eliminating group discounts available through large companies like McDonald's , g ) eliminating employer sponsored or subsidized health care benefits , etc .
3 . Fewer opportunities for advancement , fewer or reduced ( or no ) wage increases , fewer or reduced ( or no ) bonuses .
For example , see the list of benefits here for McDonald 's workers in Canada ( I could n't find a comparable list for the U.S. , but I assume it would be pretty similar ) , and you 'll see that are at least ten non-monetary benefits offered to even unskilled minimum wage workers that could be adjusted in the face of higher monetary wage costs resulting from legislated minimum wage increases .
Bottom Line : Demand curves slope downward , and the market for unskilled workers is no exception .
Employers WILL respond to increases in the minimum wage , in many ways that will NOT show up in the teenage unemployment rate , but still to the DISADVANTAGE of unskilled workers .

John McCain ’s selection of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate has brought out a number of interesting positions opposing the pick .
People from all walks of life , but mostly one side of the aisle , are examining McCain ’s selection and critiquing it for its seeming “ strategy , ” which , if you read between the lines , is a pseudonym for “ cheap ploy . ”
Since when is “ strategy ” a bad thing , especially in a contest ?
Football coaches , corporate executives , ad agencies , military generals and chess players the world over would be nothing without strategy , and we ’d chastise them for ignoring it .
Yet , John McCain makes a strategic choice in running mate , and it ’s seen by some as dirty or patronizing .
Consider the following detractors , and their arguments against McCain ’s veep strategy :
The frighteningly mature and silver - tongued 13 - year - old daughter of a friend of mine , upon hearing the news said , “ What do they think , women are stupid ?
They choose an inexperienced person from Alaska and expect women to automatically vote for McCain just because he picks any old bimbo ? ”
Her point is a common one , especially among Hillary left - overs who suggest McCain ’s strategy was to pick a woman and hope that Clinton ’s female voters can’t tell the difference between the two .
It ’s an interesting idea , but hardly convincing .
After all , why would liberal , women voters who were going to vote for liberal Hillary Clinton now throw their considerable and influential weight to Sarah Palin , whose stances on abortion and gay marriage alone would hardly make her alluring to this market ?
In another argument , The Huffington Post ’s Jane Smiley and others have Palin ’s foray into beauty pageants as a college student somehow means she has traded on her looks to get ahead .
Smiley wrote , “ I want to know …if she 's just a follower with a pretty smile , who goes along with the big boys in order to get a little something for herself . ”
So McCain ’s strategy here , then , was to pick a good - looking woman in hopes that she can wink her way into the White House with male voters ?
One problem with this .
He ’d be turning off the very voting contingent he was hoping to gain – those 18 million women who voted for Hillary .
Another argument comes by way of the sophisticated wordsmith Sean “ Diddy ” Colmes , who recently blogged about the Palin pick .
Arguing , ineloquently , that John McCain is “ buggin ” for picking a woman from Alaska , he probes , “ What is the reality in Alaska ?
There are n’t even any crackheads in Alaska .
There are n’t no black people in Alaska . ”
This position , if we can call it that , seems to say that Palin was chosen to speak primarily to white , non -drug - addled America .
It ’s interesting to note that Alaska has more black people per capita , according to the 2004 US census , than West Virginia , Iowa , Hawaii , Oregon , New Mexico , New Hampshire , South Dakota , Wyoming , North Dakota , Maine , Vermont , Idaho , and Montana .
And , though it would seem the governor of a state without “ crackheads ” might benefit from that distinction , it ’s worth pointing out that according to the US Department of Health and Human Services , 4.9 percent of Alaska residents are considered lifetime crack addicts .
California claims only 3.8 percent .
And lastly , I recently sparred with Ann Friedman , a writer for the activist website Feministing .com , on CNN about the Palin pick .
Her position was that a pro-life candidate simply is n’t good for women , and McCain should have considered pro-choice voters .
Here , Friedman seems to make the only legitimate case for McCain ’s strategy , which according to her , was to appeal primarily to his conservative base .
She ’s absolutely right .
McCain ’s been criticized all summer for his inability to bring his base together in support of the GOP ticket , and the appointment of Palin is a direct response to that criticism .
To answer Friedman ’s charge , one could certainly argue that a pro-life candidate is good for women … who are pro-life .
And in 2003 , a Center for the Advancement of Women poll found that 51 % of women said they oppose abortion .
The media , the voters , feminists , rappers and even teenagers , are going to continue to discuss John McCain ’s strategy in selecting Sarah Palin for vice president , and the temperature will likely rise even higher now that word of her 17 - year - old daughter ’s pregnancy is out .
What will the McCain strategy be going forward ?
The only thing that is certain is that he will definitely have one .
Let ’s all remember , though , that strategizing is not the same as scheming .
S.E. Cupp is author of “ Why You ’re Wrong About the Right , ” with Brett Joshpe .
How well did that work out the first time ?
Paul Krugman :
Here 's what McCain has to say about the wonders of market - based health reform :
Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition , as we have done over the last decade in banking , would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state - based regulation .
So McCain , who now poses as the scourge of Wall Street , was praising financial deregulation like 10 seconds ago - and promising that if we marketize health care , it will perform as well as the financial industry !
Mr Deregulator would destroy what 's left of our health care system .
For those who have it at this point and can barely afford it , that is .

keynav - retire your mouse .
Keynav is a piece of an on - going experiment to make pointer - driven interfaces easier and faster for users to operate .
It lets you move the pointer quickly to most points on the screen with only a few key strokes .
Note that I said pointer , not mouse .
The mouse simply drives the pointer .
We can drive the pointer with other devices too .
keynav turns your keyboard into an fast pointer mover .
What does it do ?
You select a piece of the screen .
The screen is initially wholely selected .
One move will cut that region by half .
A move is a direction : up , down , left , and right .
Once you ’re done moving , you simply indicate ( with a key stroke ) that you want to move .
Boom , cursor moves .
Why it is fast ?
keynav is geared towards selecting a piece of the screen very quickly .
Recall from above that you are selecting a region by cutting the previous region by half .
This gives us logarithmic scaling .
High resolution screens incur about the same number of moves to select an area as smaller screens do .
For example , to select any pixel on a screen with resolution 1920x1200 it would take 21 moves .
21 moves is horrible .
There is a bright side !
How often do you really want to click on a single specific pixel on your screen using your mouse ?
Never , right ?
Well , maybe almost never .
Most of the time you want to :
Raise a window and give it focus : 80x80 pixel target ( worst : 9 moves )
Click on an “ OK ” button : 60x25 pixels ( worst : 11 moves )
Click on a text widget to activate it : 80x25 or larger
Mailing list
The keynav users mailing list is : keynav-users@googlegroups.com
I ’ll be announcing new versions on this mailing list .

The following is the default configuration :
h : select the left half of the region
j : select the bottom half of the region
k : select the top half of the region
l : select the right half of the region
shift+h : move the region left
shift+j : move the region down
shift+k : move the region top
shift+l : move the region right
semicolon :
Move the mouse to the center of the selected region
spacebar :
Move the mouse and left - click
escape : Cancel the move
Configuration file
Your config file must live in ~/.keynavrc .
Such as /home / jls/.keynavrc
The config file format consists of a keysequence followed by a comma-separated list of commands .
For example :
space warp , click 1,end
This would move the mouse , click left mouse button , and finish ( close the keynav selector ) when you hit spacebar while keynav was active .
A sample config file comes with the distribution as ‘ keynavrc ’ .
The following is a list of key modifiers : shift , ctrl , alt , or any valid X Keysym , such as Shift_L , etc .

DIGG THIS
Who among us doesnt like to brag after a job well done ?
It s human nature , right ?
I mean , even the DEA enjoys boasting about their so - called " accomplishments . "
They even have their own ( taxpayer funded ) museum .
Given this fact , its both curious and notable that the DEA has suddenly ceased publicizing data regarding how many millions of feral hemp plants ( aka " ditchweed " ) law enforcement eradicate each year .
In previous years , upwards of 98 percent of all the pot seized by law enforcement was categorized as " ditchweed " — a term the DEA uses to define wild , scattered marijuana plants [ with ] no evidence of planting , fertilizing , or tending . 
For instance , in 2005 the DEA reported that cops destroyed some 219 million feral hemp plants versus only four million cultivated marijuana plants .
DEA data for the year 2004 tells a similar story .
Of the estimated 265 million marijuana plants destroyed by law enforcement that year , more than 262 million ( roughly 99 percent ) were classified as " ditchweed . "
So , how much ditchweed did police confiscate in 2007 ?
That would be anyones guess .
Upon referencing Table 4.38
( Number of marijuana plants eradicated and seized , arrests made , weapons seized , and value of assets seized under the Drug Enforcement Administrations Domestic Cannabis Eradication / Suppression Program , by State , 2007 ) in the latest version of the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics , visitors will discover that the column that previously reported on " ditchweed " seizures ( in prior years  tables , it was seventh column from the left ) is now conspicuously missing .
So why would the DEA abruptly want to cease taking credit for destroying hundreds of millions of pounds of marijuana each year ?
Perhaps its because unlike cultivated marijuana , feral hemp contains virtually no detectable levels of THC — the primary psychoactive component in cannabis — and does not contribute to the black market marijuana trade .
Or perhaps its because the public was finally beginning to smarten up to the fact that theyve been paying their police millions of dollars each year to do nothing more than pull a few weeds .
The Best of Paul Armentano
Among the tiny number of occasions on which Sarah Palin has expressed even an opinion on foreign policy , one of the most recent bears putting out there one more time .
It 's from a critical moment in the war in Iraq , December 2006 , which John McCain has made the centerpiece of his campaign .
In fact , his support for a double - down strategy in Iraq in the winter of 2006 and early 2007 is one central argument he has made for his candidacy .
He has now chosen as the person who would replace him instantly if , at any time bgetween the ages of 72 and 76 , he might be incapacitated or die , a person whose view of the situation was as follows :
Alaska Business
Monthly :
We 've lost a lot of Alaska 's military members to the war in Iraq .
How do you feel about sending more troops into battle , as President Bush is suggesting ?
Palin : I 've been so focused on state government , I have n't really focused much on the war in Iraq .
I heard on the news about the new deployments , and while I support our president , Condoleezza Rice and the administration , I want to know that we have an exit plan in place ; I want assurances that we are doing all we can to keep our troops safe .
Every life lost is such a tragedy .
I am very , very proud of the troops we have in Alaska , those fighting overseas for our freedoms , and the families here who are making so many sacrifices .
As far as I can tell , her response to this central issue of national security was three - fold : I do n't know enough to have an opinion apart from what I hear on the news , I agree with the Democratic party 's focus on the welfare and safety of the troops , I 'm a loyal Republican and patriot , and
I want to know that we have an exit plan in place .
Was n't the whole point of the surge to kill off any notions in Iraq that we were going to withdraw and to ramp up counter - insurgency and troop levels indefinitely until the place was secure , and democratic ?
The whole point was that there was no exit plan for 2007 or beyond , and McCain opposed such an exit plan .
The point , according to McCain , was " victory . "
So McCain has picked a woman who , in so far as she had any views at all , actually echoed Democratic party talking points , not McCain's .
Do you think he even asked her about foreign policy ?
Me neither .
This pick has told us very little about Sarah Palin , except that she seems like a promising young governor focused almost entirely - and understandably - on the demands of her idiosyncratic state .
But it has told us a huge amount about McCain .
As in : way too risky for the White House right now .

A team of scientists led by researchers from the Instituto Astrofísica de Canarias ( IAC ) has succeeded in identifying naphthalene , one of the most complex molecules yet discovered in the interstellar medium .
The detection of this molecule suggests that a large number of the key components in prebiotic terrestrial chemistry could have been present in the interstellar matter from which the Solar System was formed .
IAC researchers Susana Iglesias Groth , Arturo Manchado and Aníbal García , in collaboration with Jonay González ( Paris Observatory ) and David Lambert ( University of Texas ) have just published these results in Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The naphthalene was discovered in a star formation region in the constellation Perseus , in the direction of the star Cernis 52 .
“ We have detected the presence of the naphthalene cation in a cloud of interstellar matter located 700 lightyears from the Earth ” , says IAC researcher Susana Iglesias Groth .
The spectral bands found in this consstellation coincide with laboratory measurements of the naphthalene cation .
Iglesias Groth further adds , “ we aim to investigate whether other , more complex , hydrocarbons exist in the same region , including aminoacids ” .
When subjected to ultraviolet radiation and combined with water and ammonium , both very abundant in the interstellar medium , naphthalene reacts and is capable of producing a wide variety of aminoacids and naphthaloquinones , precursor molecules to vitamins .
All these molecules play a fundamental role in the development of life as we know it on Earth .
In fact , naphthalene has been found in meteorites that continue to fall to the surface of the Earth , and which fell with much greater intensity in epochs preceding the appearance of life .
The work of these researchers also enables us to understand one of the most intriguing problems in interstellar medium spectroscopy .
For the past 80 years , the existence has been known of hundreds of spectroscopic bands ( the so - called “ diffuse bands ” ) associated with interstellar matter , but the identification of the agent causing them has remained a mystery .
“ Our results show that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene are responsible for the diffuse bands and should be present throughout the interstellar medium ” , says Iglesias Groth .
I mentioned previously that I 'm working on a Pinax project .
Email notifications are one of the things you need to get working in your development environment .
Unfortunately for the novice Django developer , getting this working may not be obvious .
Pinax uses an application called django - mailer to handle outgoing email .
This is a drop - in replacement for the mail functions built into Django .
The first thing I needed to get a handle on was how to get django - mailer to send mail .
The theory is that mail is queued inside the database , and then is sent when instructed via the appropriate manage .
py sub-command .
According to the django - mailer Quick Start Guide , there are two sub-commands :
send_mail - attempt to send any mail in the queue .
- attempt to send any mail in the queue .
retry_deferred - put deferred mail back into the queue .
It 's important to note here that retry_deferred does not try to deliver the deferred mail .
It just makes it available to send_mail again .
So , in order to get queued mail sent , simply run ./ manage .py send_mail .
Simple enough .
The Quick Start Guide recommends running this from cron every minute .
That 's reasonable in a production environment , but probably unnecessary in development .
By default , Django and django - mailer use the local system as their SMTP server .
This might not be appropriate for your situation .
Here are the settings you can drop in your localsettings .py file to get your development environment working properly :
EMAIL_HOST
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
EMAIL_HOST_USER
EMAIL_PORT
EMAIL_USE_TLS
If you 're lucky , you have a static mail server somewhere that runs on a port other than 25 ( 465 , for example ) and uses encrypted authentication .
This will let you develop your Pinax application from anywhere !

Sure , teleportation sounds like a good idea , but just remember : it always goes wrong .
It 's hard to believe a process that involves ripping your molecules apart and then jamming them together thousands of miles away could possibly have any safety risks , but there you are .
Sometimes the copy is n't quite as good as the original , and sometimes the new version is a little the worse for wear .
Here 's our list of the weirdest , the sickest , and the most demented teleportation mishaps from science fiction .
Even when teleportation works properly , there are tremendous risks .
You can get a smirking Hayden Christensen popping up on top of every world landmark , chased by a bleach - blond Samuel L. Jackson .
And that 's an example of successful teleportation .
Here 's what happens when it goes wrong : Star Trek : Gosh , are there transporter accidents in Star Trek ?
I can't actually think of any .
Oh wait .
Yeah , there are a few .
Just a handful , maybe .
If you 've got big hands .
Most notably , the transporter splits Kirk into two Kirks : one passive , one aggressive .
In Star Trek : The Motion Picture , Stonn Q. Vulcan beams up along with someone else , and they get scrambled into a mess that does n't live long OR prosper .
( And according to the book , Kirk also has a wife who dies in a transporter accident . )
In TNG , Reg Barclay has a transporter mishap that makes him even more annoying than usual .
And Ro Laren and Geordi get turned ghosty .
In DS9 , the transporter zaps Sisko and Bashir back in time , forcing Sisko to pretend to be a civil rights leader .
On Voyager , the transporter makes Seven Of Nine 's Borg implants have sex with the Doctor 's holo - emitter .
Also , Tuvok and Neelix have the oposite of Kirk 's original malfunction , and get merged into one super - passive - aggressive entity .
There are like 10,000 more of them , but you get the picture .

Tron .
As we pointed out a while back , Tron is about a teleportation experiment , and it 's designed to teleport from point A to point B . But instead , it disassembles Jeff Bridges and zap him into the passive - aggressive video - game world .
Oops .

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles .
One of the Turtles ' main frenemies is the one - eyed giant alligator , Leatherhead , who got adopted by the alien Utroms .
Stranded on Earth , Leatherhead is constantly building Transmat devices to take him back to the Utrom homeworld .
And they 're constantly going horribly wrong , in the comics and in the TV show .
One transmat device blows up in Leatherhead 's face .
Another one simply materializes three Utroms , who shoot him .
A third transmat device generates energy that lures a whole gang of Triceratons to Leatherhead 's secret hideout .
Poor Leatherhead !
Savage Planet .
This is possibly the absolute sickest teleportation disaster ever , from the indie movie Savage Planet .
A whole bunch of intrepid explorers are zapping themselves to an alien world , and they put just a wee bit too much stress on the system .
So one of them comes through missing a big chunk of his inner torso .
( Warning : video is totally gross . )

Adam Strange loved the Zeta Beam teleportation mechanism , which zapped him to and from the planet Rann - until it scooped out his eyes like cantaloupe balls .
The original Green Lantern , Alan Scott , had the same thing happen to him , but he only lost one eye .
I 'm noticing a theme of teleportation mishaps and missing eyes , what with Leatherhead and all .
Ultimate Fantastic Four .
In the original Stan Lee version , the Fantastic Four get transformed into lovable freaks when they go up in a rocket to beat the Soviets into space or something .
But in the Ultimate reboot , they build a teleportation machine to send matter into a parallel universe .
By accident , the four of them plus ( Dr. Doom ) get teleported into the N - zone and they get transformed into alternate universe versions of themselves , with the rocky heads and the invisible blondeness and stuff .
And they become really passive - aggressive .
Like the Thing is always saying , " Is it clobberin ' time ?
Do you think it is ?
I do n't know . "

The Fly .
In both the 1950s movies and the 1986 version , it 's a teleportation accident that turns an inquiring scientist ( Jeff Goldblum in the 1986 version ) into a half - human , half - fly mutant .
In the 1958 original , the scientist starts off his somewhat safeguard - free experiments by teleporting his cat , Dandolo , into a monstrous dimension where we can hear the cat screaming for help .
And the cat never gets rescued !
That 's fucken hardcore .
In the new version , Jeff Goldblum wants to stick Geena Davis into the teleportation machine so he can merge with both her and his fly parts , thus creating an even more awesome mutant .
Not surprisingly , David Cronenberg is turning his version into an opera .
Blake 's 7 .
I lost count of how many times people get teleported into space on this show , but it happens a lot .
It 's the show 's get - out - of - jeopardy - free card .
It definitely happens to Brian Blessed in the third episode .
But given Brian 's planet - sized ego , he should n't actually have been harmed by being zapped into space .
He could just generate his own atmosphere and gravity field , with the force of his shouting .
Thunderbolts : Baron Zemo's mind gets zapped into Techno 's mechanical " Tech - Pack " in a teleportation accident , according to the source of all lies wisdom .
Dinobots .
In one of the origins of these awesome Dinosaurs - in - Disguise robots , they suffered an accident with the teleportation systems of the supercomputer Teletran - 3 , which zaps them back into Earth 's prehistory where they turn into the robot dinos we love .
There 's also a BBC show for kids called A Purrfect Villain , which sounds totally meowniacal :
Victor 's DNA gets mixed up with that of a cat in a teleportation accident .
Victor gets the cat 's nine lives while the cat gets the computer code to destroy the world and turn all human life to jelly !
The chase is on to save the planet , as Victor loses life after life while the cat types in the code numbers one by one over the internet .

Editor ’s note :
Since the border is wide open to illegals and drug smugglers and a growing number of Americans are concerned about this , now is the time for the Department of Homeland Security and Hollywood to create a fluffy propaganda piece to brainwash us into thinking otherwise , sort of like the “ war on terror ” that does not stop terrorism but rather engenders it for political reasons .
A new ABC unscripted series will take an unprecedented look behind the scenes at the government ’s fight against terrorism .
The network has ordered 11 hours of “ Border Security USA ” from executive producer Arnold Shapiro ( “ Big Brother ” ) .
Shot on location throughout the United States , the series will focus on the efforts of border protection agencies to halt illegal smuggling and immigration .
A typical episode might jump from a border patrol in Texas to security screeners at a New York airport to a Coast Guard boat off Puerto Rico .
“ Border ” is billed as the first multiepisode television series to be shot in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security , as well as several other government agencies .
“ We ’re showing everyday heroes who are risking their lives to protect us , ” said Shapiro , who also produced the law enforcement series “ Rescue 911 ” and the classic jailhouse documentary “ Scared Straight . ”
“ Every mode of transportation to get into the country , we have covered . ”
“ Border ” is based on the Australian series “ Border Security : Australia ’s Front Line , ” which debuted in 2004 .
ABC purchased the rights to the format and tapped Shapiro to shepherd the U.S. version .
Shapiro wrangled the cooperation of the DHS ( as well as the Transportation Security Administration , U.S. Coast Guard , United States Citizenship & Immigration Services , the Secret Service , Customs & Border Protection and Immigration & Customs Enforcement ) .
The network plans to launch “ Border ” sometime next season .
The security agents depicted in the show stop a wide range of criminal behavior .
In one episode , customs finds a human skull shipped through the mail .
In another , a Coast Guard boat chases cocaine smugglers .
Yet it ’s the show ’s depiction of the government ’s post - 9/11 antiterrorism efforts that ’s bound to draw the most attention .
In one story , two young men of Iranian descent are denied entry into the country when one is found to have relatives with ties to a terrorist organization and the other carries a fake ID .
“ That ’s ( the agents ’ ) No. 1 mission : to protect the country from terrorists and from terrorist materials , such as bombs , ” Shapiro said .
“ We have n’t been there with a camera when an actual terrorist has been caught , but we ’ve seen a few people not admitted because they ’re on watch lists .
Nobody wants to be the officer who lets in the next terrorist . ”
Fox ’s long - running “ Cops ” is the most obvious comparison to “ Border , ” but Shapiro emphasizes there will be several differences between the series .
Each “ Border ” episode will intercut between 10 stories that will showcase an eclectic array of locations , law enforcement agents and crimes .
Since security agents spend large stretches of time searching for criminal activity rather than responding to emergency calls , Shapiro estimates he had to shoot 100 minutes of footage for every one minute of action used on the show .
“ It has more diversity than ‘ Cops , ’ and people really learn a lot from watching this , ” Shapiro said .
“ You see a lot of people who are not admitted into the country , and you learn why .
You will become a more knowledgeable traveler in terms of crossing the border . ”
But not too knowledgeable .
Shapiro said he ’s been asked to keep confidential a few tactics used by border agents .
Otherwise , the agencies welcomed a depiction of their day - to - day efforts .
“ They want people to know how diligent they are , ” Shapiro said .
“ You hear about every problem that the Department of Homeland Security is having ; you never hear about what they ’re doing that ’s good . ”
Such security problems in recent years have ranged from media reports of border agents taking bribes , to ongoing concerns that cargo inspections at airports and shipping ports remain dangerously lax .
Shapiro said “ Border ” will tell “ the other side of the story . ”
“ I love investigative journalism , but that ’s not what we ’re doing , ” he said .
“ This show is heartening .
It makes you feel good about these people who are doing their best to protect us . ”

Lawyers prepping litigation against telecom immunity Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Would argue immunity an ' unconstitutional ' violation of separation of powers Fear not , foes of oversight - free domestic surveillance .
Even if Senate Democrats follow their House counterparts and endorse immunity for telecom companies , the battle to hold those companies accountable will not end there .
While the prospects of reining in President Bush 's expanded spy powers seem to be dwindling in Congress , lawyers and activists are already gearing up for court challenges if lawmakers pass an unacceptable bill .
Critics say pending civil lawsuits that the administration and Congress are trying to get rid of are the only way to shed any light on the likely illegal spying authorized by President Bush and facilitated by the nation 's telecommunications firms .
The Senate next week is expected to vote on an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that would effectively grant retroactive immunity to phone and Internet providers facing dozens of class - action civil lawsuits .
Activists have not given up on a fight to strip the immunity provision from the bill , but their chances of success seem dim .
Lawyers for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union , two groups that have been leading the charge against dismissing the lawsuits , are working on possible legal challenges for the FISA bill that is expected to pass soon .
That being said , no one is ready to throw in the towel on the continuing FISA fight happening in the Senate .
" Assuming that the immunity does pass , which right now we are not assuming , we are certainly preparing for litigation against the application of immunity in our case , " Kevin Bankston , a senior attorney for EFF told RAW STORY .
EFF is representing customers in class - action lawsuits alleging that Verizon and AT&T violated customers ' privacy when they participated in the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The FISA bill passed by the House last month , which the Senate is expected to vote on next week , would dismiss those lawsuits if Attorney General Michael Mukasey assures the court that the companies were asked in writing to cooperate .
No one disputes that such requests were made , rather plaintiffs in the suit argue that such requests were illegal because the administration did not secure warrants before spying on Americans , as was required by FISA , which first passed in 1978 in response to Nixon - era abuses of the Intelligence Community .
EFF would argue that the immunity provision in the FISA update is itself an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine , Bankston said .
While the precise sequence of events in unclear , Bankston said the challenges would take place in the Northern District of California Court , where the telecom lawsuits themselves are being litigated .
He said he 's pleased that at least the immunity question is not being decided by the secret FISA court , as was proposed in an earlier bill .
The ACLU is keeping its options open but has not decided how or if it will proceed with court challenges to an eventual FISA agreement , a spokesman says .
All of these discussions , of course , are contingency plans .
The Senate still has not passed a FISA update , and the Bush administration and its allies in Congress have been thwarted before when they have tried to grant retroactive immunity to the telecoms .
" We have n't admitted defeat yet , " Bankston said in a phone interview last week .
He acknowledged the effort would be an " uphill battle " before recalling some words of wisdom from Han Solo : " Never tell me the odds . "
Immunity opponents like Sens. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) have succeeded in delaying a FISA vote until after this week 's Independence Day recess , and they have introduced an amendment to strip immunity from FISA .
Feingold initially sounded pessimistic about its chances , but he praised the " outpouring of support " from immunity opponents in a video message posted Monday .
" I teased some of my colleagues , I said we can celebrate the Constitution on July 4th then maybe when you come back you 'll decide not to tear it up , " he said .
Along with Feingold 's and Dodd 's amendment is a proposal from Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) that would delay a final decision on the question of immunity until a report on the warrantless wiretapping program from the Inspectors General of the Justice Department and other agencies .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) also has offered an amendment that would let the court decide not to grant immunity if it decides the NSA 's warrantless spying was unconstitutional .
The Bingaman amendment , which EFF and the ACLU support , would stay the pending lawsuits until 90 days after the IG reports , thereby preventing Congress from not knowing what it would be immunizing .
Bankston called it an " eminently sensible and fair minded " compromise .
Senate procedural rules worked out before the vote would allow the Feingold / Dodd amendment that would strip immunity entirely to be adopted with a simple majority vote* , while the Bingaman and Specter proposals would need 60 votes .
None of the amendments seem likely to pass .
When Dodd tried to strip immunity from an earlier FISA bill , only 31 senators supported him .
The earlier FISA bill did not require the IG reports , so there 's no parallel for the Bingaman / Specter proposal , although the 60 - vote requirement means it will have a tough time passing .
While senators are home for recess this week , activists are applying pressure within their states to try to sway some to support the anti-immunity amendments .
The Senate returns next week and is scheduled to resume consideration of FISA July 8 .
The ACLU is working hard to build support for the proposed amendments , recognizing that even if they fail , demonstrated opposition to immunity could help pressure the next administration .
" A strong ' no ' vote helps us keep the pressure on Obama and McCain to investigate at the very least , " Caroline Fredrickson , an ACLU lobbyist , said in an e-mail .
" And perhaps take more serious action . "
* Clarification :
An earlier version of this article said the Feingold / Dodd amendment would need 51 votes to pass .
It would only need a majority of senators casting a vote ; e.g. , if 97 senators are present , it would pass with 49 votes
Every once in a while you come across an idea that just lights you up .
Styrofoam has long been one of the unmoveables when it came to recycling ( too bulky , not much money in it ) and there was n’t a viable replacement for it .
Easy to make , lots of it , hard to sustainably dispo se of , what are you going to do ?
Reducing the amount of it in packaging is one path , but is only less bad .
What about an option that is all good ?
I found a contender : Ecovative Design has come up with a number of products for packaging , building insulation , foam core ( think : surfboards ) and ye olde beer cooler that do away with styrofoam , using agricultural waste .
And , making this even better , the ingredients for the product will come from local sources , whichever is the most prevalent in the area that it ’s made .
So rather than trucking the same ag waste 1000s of miles to other regional factories , they have come up with a product that can flex what it contains without compromising the quality or integrity .
For example , cellulose pulp from areas with lots of paper mills , and rice hulls in Texas , where a lot of rice is processed .
And it ’s compostable , biodegradable , and if sent back to Ecovative , recyclable .
Take that , styrofoam !
Where did this idea come from ?
Why The Inventor ’s Studio , a class at the Renssalear Polytechnic Institute of course .
Eben Bayer and Gavin Mcintyre were inspired by …a beer cooler .
Yes , those styrofoam cheapies people buy on their way to the coast and frequently toss them on the road side got them thinking , there has to be another way .
And now there is .
They ’ve created Greensulate Insulation , Negative Volume ( for packaging ) and the aforementioned cooler .
They area also in discussions with several surf board companies to use their product rather than the usual foam core .
My first thought when seeing mention of building materials and biodegradable was one of concern .
Bayer made the point that wood , a common building material , is biodegradable as well .
True enough .
In the case of their products , they ’d require specific conditions to biodegrade , which a housing application does not provide .
An internal pipe break would not be an issue .
An ongoing slow leak would , the same as with anything else typically found in construction .
They are currently thoroughly testing there products to comply with ASTM and International Building Code standards .
Their aim was to create a product that is of similar performance at a lower price , produced much more sustainably , and ultimately able to return to the earth when done .
They seem to be succeeding .
What does the future hold for them ?
They are continuing to validate their products for wide use in construction , packaging , and surfboard cores .
And the results ?
Combustability testing has demonstrated that Greensulate can function as a firewall , as well as an insulator .
Greensulate combined with bamboo has the possibility of having 75 times the compressive strength of styrofoam .
Learn more here about what they ’ve got in the works .
How can you help ?
They ’re looking for construction companies to incorporate GreenSulate in their products .
Perhaps you are or know one ?
Be a part of reducing the ubiquitous use of styrofoam , and increasing the use of what would otherwise be waste .
Not unlike Verterra , plates made entirely out of leaves that would otherwise be burnt as agricultural “ waste . ”

What other naturally derived substitutes for the status quo have you been using , think we should know about ?
Add your two cents below please .

The first results from a powerful gamma-ray telescope launched into orbit earlier this summer show it is on track to unlock new secrets of the most energetic explosions in the universe .
That was the message from NASA researchers speaking at a teleconference this afternoon to present the findings and to announce the mission 's new name .
Jon Morse , director of the space agency 's astrophysics division at NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , announced that GLAST , or the Gamma -ray Large Area Space Telescope , would now be known as the Fermi Gamma - ray Space Telescope , after the late Nobel laureate physicist , Enrico Fermi .
Launched on June 11 , GLAST was built to scan the cosmos for gamma rays , particularly those generated by the powerful explosions produced by black holes in the centers of so - called active galactic nuclei , as well as those from gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) , the brightest explosions in the universe .
Researchers presented the first data from GLAST 's two instruments .
The Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) scans the whole sky once every two orbits ( about three hours ) .
During its first 95 hours of operation , the telescope generated a gamma-ray map of the sky comparable to that obtained by the Energetic Gamma - Ray Experiment Telescope , or EGRET , which gathered data for nine years in the 1990s .
Familiar landmarks such as the Vala pulsar — the brightest persistent source of gamma rays in the sky — punctuated a backdrop of more diffuse radiation from high - energy cosmic rays striking interstellar gas .
The difference was that GLAST made its map in days , whereas EGRET needed years , Steve Ritz , GLAST project scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , says .
Ritz compared GLAST 's first view of the cosmos with opening one 's eyes for the first time following Lasik surgery .
That first view was a dazzling one :
It included the active galaxy 3C454.3 some seven billion light - years from Earth .
" When the LAT turned on , it was just blazing .
It was impossible to miss .
It was n't like that before " with EGRET , says Peter Michelson of Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif. , the lead investigator for LAT .
Fermi's namesake proved equally adept at spotting GRBs — the purpose of its second instrument , the GLAST Burst Monitor , which detected 31 bursts in its first month of activity , or about one per day , according to Charles " Chip " Meegan , the experiment 's lead investigator at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala .
Unlike the LAT , the burst monitor was ready for operation almost immediately after being turned on .
The rechristening of GLAST in honor of Fermi reflects the ongoing mystery of the gamma - ray sky .
Fermi , who won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics * , is best known for building the first man-made nuclear reactor in 1942 .
A brilliant theoretical physicist as well , he was also the first to propose a mechanism by which powerful cosmic objects could accelerate electrons strongly enough to generate gamma rays .
Researchers still do n't know exactly what those mechanisms are in active galactic nuclei and GRBs but they hope GLAST will allow them to test models by making precise measurements of flares as they happen .
Ritz says that the pace of data gathering so far " holds a tremendous amount of promise for things to come . "
* Correction ( 8/27/08 ) : This article originally stated that Enrico Fermi won the Nobel Prize in 1938 for buildilng the first nuclear reactor , which in fact he did not do until 1942 ; he won the Nobel in part for work on nuclear reactions .

Fox Television has informed the Federal Communications Commission that it will not pay the agency 's proposed $ 91,000 fine for a pixelated strip show on Married in America , broadcast in 2003 .
" FOX believes that the FCC 's decision in this case was arbitrary and capricious , inconsistent with precedent , and patently unconstitutional , " the network declared in a press release .
But the media company 's detailed , 49 - page Petition for Reconsideration , submitted to the agency at the same time , goes far beyond the terse press release .
It all but wonders if the FCC 's indecency analysts are projecting their own sexual fantasies into the programming that they evaluate .
And the Petition sets the stage for yet another legal confrontation as the Supreme Court prepares to hear the FCC 's appeal on its " fleeting expletive " rulings , struck down by a lower court in New York City .
The FCC first proposed a fine against the now - defunct Married in 2004 after it received complaints about a 2003 scene in which several engaged couples party at a strip club .
According to the FCC 's analysis , couples kiss , and lick whip cream off on - stage performers , whose naughty bits are pixelated .
But pixelation was not enough for the FCC .
" The fact that isolated body parts were ' pixelated ' did not obscure the overall graphic character of the depiction , " the agency concluded in denying Fox 's appeal last month .
" The mere pixelation of sexual organs is not necessarily determinative under our analysis because the material must be assessed in its full context .
Here , despite the obscured nature of the nudity , it is unmistakable that the party goers are participating in sexual activities and that sexual organs are being exposed . "
FCC spends too much time imagining what 's under the pixelation
In its petition , Fox challenges the FCC 's description of the program , insisting that many of the agency 's key complaints are inaccurate .
At one point the FCC 's analysis of the show claims that one performer places himself close to a woman in a miniskirt , " apparently to lick off the whipped cream " from her body .
But nobody actually licked whip cream off anyone 's body in the program , Fox protests .
The agency 's summary charges that at another moment two performers wear tops " but their buttocks are pixelated , presumably to obscure portions of their buttocks as well as the g - strings that cover their genitals . ”
But , as Fox attorneys note , the episode " never showed the women without clothes or without pixelation , so there is no way for the Commission to know what undergarments they were wearing . "
Actually , this is not the first time the g- string question has come up .
About a month earlier , the FCC fined a slew of ABC affiliates for an episode of NYPD Blue that displays a woman 's derrière , which the agency defined as " sexual " body part .
" Here , the scene in question shows a female actor naked from behind , with her buttocks fully visible at close range , " the FCC complained .
" She is not wearing a g - string or other clothing , nor are the shots of her buttocks pixelated or obscured . "
As Fox notes in its response to the Married decision , the word " apparently " constantly appears in the agency 's analysis , one participant " apparently about to kiss " a stripper ; two strippers " apparently kissing one another ... "
But none of these actions actually take place .
" The Commission repeatedly relies upon these assumptions about what it presumes is occurring off - camera to justify its description of the program as ' sexually oriented ' , " Fox argues .
" In no event does [ indecency ] regulation extend to an imaginative viewer 's or regulator 's assumptions about what may be occurring between characters off - screen . "
And finally , Fox asks , how can it be " unmistakable that the party goers are participating in sexual activities and that sexual organs are being exposed " if all the performers ' " sexual " body parts are obscured by pixelation ?
Between this case and the NYPD Blue decision , in which ABC cited medical textbooks to challenge the agency 's sexual classifications , the country is coming dangerously close to a trial in which Federal judges will be asked not just for a general definition of indecency , but to decide what constitutes a sexual activity , a sexual organ , or sex .
Fox has filed its appeal to defend 13 stations that broadcast the show , including stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group and Mountain Licenses , L.P .
All three companies have refused to pay the FCC 's fine .
Lindsay Lohan's Grandfather Dies
's grandfather , died in New York on Thursday after a long battle with colon cancer .
Richard Lohan , 73 , was the father of Lindsay 's dad Michael Lohan .
Michael released an official statment to OK !
magazine saying , " My father just , literally , died in my arms . "
Michael also did n't miss the opportunity to take a dig at ex-wife Dina Lohan .
" I notified all my kids and my lawyer notified Dina 's attorney .
Let 's see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral . "
He continues , " THIS will show her true colors !
Thus , not even a call .
But that 's par for the course with Dina !
She did n't even send a card or visit when he was sick . "
Michael later told E !
News that Lindsay had reached out to him .
" She sent me a message this morning .
She said , ' Now papa has found peace and maybe we can find peace in our lives , too . ' "
Yesterday Lindsay and gal - pal Samantha Ronson blogged about the discord between Lindsay and her dad .
Lindsay wrote that her father knows nothing about what ’s going on in her life because she has “ chosen not to involve him in it . ”
Officers said Coltrane was not a suspect in the crimes , which have been committed by a juvenile who happens to look like the Cracker star .

NEW YORK , Sept 19 : A delegation of Pakistani women parliamentarians now visiting the United States has pleaded with US lawmakers and the Bush administration to stop US attacks inside Pakistan and provide free trade opportunities to women .
At an Iftar hosted by Pakistan ’s UN Ambassador Abdullah Husain Haroon on Thursday , MNA Azra Pechuho of the Pakistan People ’s Party said the US - sponsored “ Reconstruction Opportunity Zones ” in the tribal areas were specifically discussed during their meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill .
These zones , she said , would play a major role in promoting long - term economic development in the region .
“ We believe ROZs will provide the crucial economic component that complements our military and political strategies . ”
Tehmina Daulatana of the PML - N said she had bluntly conveyed the outrage of the people of Pakistan over repeated violations of Pakistan ’s sovereignty by American forces in Afghanistan .
“ I told our counterparts that Pakistan is our country and only we can resolve the problems , ” she said .
The terrorists , now reported to be operating in those areas , were not there before 9/11 , she pointed out .
“ We ’ll deal with them in our way ... it ’s our war . ”
Ms Daulatana said the Americans had told them that they worried about a repetition of 9/11 from that region .
“ But what about Pakistan : we have 9/11 every day . ”
She called for upholding Pakistan ’s dignity and said that self - respect demanded sacrifice .
“ Pakistan is our country ; Let ’s make it strong . ”
Khushbakht Shujaat of the MQM said they had done their best to project a correct image of Pakistan .
She said she completely agreed with what her colleagues had stated .
The delegation members also exchanged views with their counterparts on the situation in Afghanistan , the peace process with India , the Kashmir dispute as well as women ’s empowerment .
The nine - member delegation is visiting the United States at the invitation of the government .
There are strong reports coming in from Islamabad that General Musharraf may truly [ finally ] be unseated and sent home packing .
Chief of the Army Staff ( COAS ) General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani held an extremely important meeting with President Pervez Musharraf at the Army House Rawalpindi late on Wednesday .
The meeting continued till after midnight lasting more than three - and - a - half hours .
This was their longest one - on - one encounter .
The meeting , which was significant in view of the current political and security situation in the country , gained further importance as it took place after day - long consultations of the Army chief with his important commanders .
The chain reaction started from the change of command in the Triple - One Brigade [ Military unit designated to protect the President of Pakistan ] where Brigadier Faheem Rao was asked to take over immediate command replacing the president ’s loyal commander Brigadier Aasim Bajwa and reports saying that Musharraf has also been asked to vacate the Army House in Rawalpindi which he continues to occupy despite his retirement many months ago .
General Kiyani has waited long enough , but I suspect its not all Kiyani ’s push , he was definitely spurred on by the reawakening of Asif Ali Zardari who as been at Musharraf ’s throat since the day his last criminal case was dismissed under the NRO deal , pardoning him of all his wrong doings .
It is from that very day we see a change in the stance of Zardari aggressiveness towards Musharraf .
News reports suggest that a deal is being negotiated for providing ‘ safe passage ’ to the dictator is that justice served when this Enlightened Moderator and make spaghetti out of our country and then get up negotiate a safe passage to safer lands .
The people of Pakistan deserve an answer and must hold people accountable for their actions and deeds .
Some semblance of justice needs to prevail to pacify an edge nation but more importantly future politicians need to be forewarned to keep on a tight shift or else they may face similar consequences , no more safe exits .
With a crumbling economy we cannot take any more chances we need to mend our affairs and if Zardari wants to be a proper politician who saves the day for Pakistan he needs to ensure that corruption be kept at minimum , But wait – are n’t we already languishing in a cesspool of proven criminals with millions of dollars of corruption in their tenure , so naturally its their basic instinct to first protect their ‘ own kind ’ , you scratch my back I scratch yours [ in the hope that God Forbid he may need the favor in return sometime in the future ] – while rest of the nation can starve to death crushed under with starvation from escalating living costs with no potential relief in sight .
I honestly question the logic of negotiating a safe passage for Musharraf to sneak out of the country without accountability , if he is innocent then provide him an independent judiciary [ ruling out PCO and Non- PCO judges due to a political bias ] and take him through a free and fair trial .
Let the courts decide whats a fair punishment and let it not be a mockery like the trials of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto .
But if Musharraf [ god forbid ] is found guilty then he must be made to face the consequences .
Sadly the moment I share this idea it immediately reverts to being a diminishing dream , to have any politicians accountable for their actions and deeds is something which Pakistan still has to witness

Data driven decisions - experiment , experiment , experiment .
We try to verify that we 've done the right thing by running experiments .
Designs that may seem promising may end up testing poorly .
There are inherent tensions here .
For instance , showing you more text ( or images ) for every result may enable you to better pick out the best result .
But a result page that has too much information takes longer to download and longer to visually process .
So every piece of information that we add to the result page has to be carefully considered to ensure that the benefit to the user outweighs the cost of dealing with that additional information .
This is true of every part of the search experience , from typing in a query , to scanning results , to further exploration .
to her , has become the poster child example for
) .
We do a huge amount of analysis of the billions of pages on the web and our query logs to determine what are " real words " on the web , and what are likely to be misspellings .
The system that gives you the spell correction has to , in a fraction of a second , consider a huge number of possible words you
have meant ( vastly greater than any dictionary ever manually constructed ) and determine if there is a more likely query you meant to type .
When we are confident that you actually meant to type something else , we take a rare liberty with our search results : we try to distract you from looking at the top result on the page .
The spelling correction is in your line of sight and colored a bright must - see red .
Furthermore , we now make sure that
, unless it is as important to you as spelling !
( so far , nothing is ) .
The algorithms involved in spell correction are constantly getting better .
They now work in a large number of languages and are even better at detecting when you have made a spelling mistake .
Getting the spelling of your query right is so important that we are considering showing you the results of the spell - corrected query in the middle of the page ( just in case you missed our bright red text at the top and bottom !
Having formulated your query correctly , the next task is to pick a page from the result list .
For each result , we present the title and
, and a brief two line snippet
.
Pages that do n't have a proper title are often ignored by users .
One of the bigger recent changes has been to extract titles for pages that do n't specify an HTML title -- yet a title on the page is clearly right there , staring at you .
To " see " that title that the author of the page intended , we analyze the HTML of the page to determine the title that the author probably meant .
This makes it far more likely that you will not ignore a page for want of a good title .
Below the title comes the snippet , and a key early innovation was in what Google showed for the snippet .
At the time , search engines showed you the first two lines of the web page ; Google , instead , showed you parts of the page where your actual search keywords showed up ( information retrieval experts call this " keywords - in- context " ) .
Showing keywords - in - context is visually simple and virtually indistinguishable from the simpler style of snippets , but vastly more useful in helping you decide which page to visit .
This simplicity belies underlying complexity : when we create a snippet we have to go through the actual text from each result to find the most relevant part ( which contain your keywords ) rather than just giving you the first few lines .
We have been making improvements to our snippets over time with algorithms for determining the relevance of portions of the page .
The changes range from the subtle -- we highlight synonyms of your query terms in the results -- to more obvious .
Here ' s an example screenshot where the user searched for " arod " and you can see that Alex and Rodriguez are

Sen . John McCain chose first - term Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , little known on the national stage , as his vice - presidential running mate -- a surprise stroke aimed at attracting Hillary Clinton supporters , but which could undercut the campaign 's key theme of experience .
Sen .
McCain passed over many high - profile , more conventional choices for the job , turning to a woman whose solid conservative positions thrilled the Republican base .
Her reputation as a reformer in Alaska dovetails with Sen. McCain 's image , too .
As a small - town ...
Two years ago , President Bush declared that America was “ addicted to oil , ” and , by gosh , he was going to do something about it .
Well , now he has .
Now we have the new Bush energy plan : “ Get more addicted to oil . ”
Actually , it ’s more sophisticated than that : Get Saudi Arabia , our chief oil pusher , to up our dosage for a little while and bring down the oil price just enough so the renewable energy alternatives can’t totally take off .
Then try to strong arm Congress into lifting the ban on drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
It ’s as if our addict - in - chief is saying to us : “ C’mon guys , you know you want a little more of the good stuff .
One more hit , baby .
Just one more toke on the ole oil pipe .
I promise , next year , we ’ll all go straight .
I ’ll even put a wind turbine on my presidential library .
But for now , give me one more pop from that drill , please , baby .
Just one more transfusion of that sweet offshore crude . ”
It is hard for me to find the words to express what a massive , fraudulent , pathetic excuse for an energy policy this is .
But it gets better .
The president actually had the gall to set a deadline for this drug deal :
“ I know the Democratic leaders have opposed some of these policies in the past , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ Now that their opposition has helped drive gas prices to record levels , I ask them to reconsider their positions .
If Congressional leaders leave for the Fourth of July recess without taking action , they will need to explain why $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline is not enough incentive for them to act . ”
The Obama campaign is condemning as “ tasteless and offensive ” a New Yorker magazine cover that depicts Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) in a turban , fist - bumping his gun-slinging wife .
An American flag burns in their fireplace .
The New Yorker says it 's satire .
It certainly will be candy for cable news .
The Obama campaign quickly condemned the rendering .
Spokesman Bill Burton said in a statement : “ The New Yorker may think , as one of their staff explained to us , that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature Senator Obama 's right - wing critics have tried to create .
But most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive .
And we agree . "
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds quickly e-mailed : “ We completely agree with the Obama campaign , it ’s tasteless and offensive . ”
The issue , which goes on sale Monday , includes a long piece by Ryan Lizza about Obama ’s start in Chicago politics .
At a press availability Sunday afternoon in San Diego , Senator Obama was asked , according to a transcript by Maria Gavrilovic of CBS News : “ The upcoming issue of the New Yorker , the July 21st issue , has a picture of you , depicting you and your wife on the cover .
“ Have you seen it ?
If not , I can show it to you on my computer .
It shows your wife Michelle with an Afro and an AK 47 and the two of you doing the fist bump with you in a sort of turban - type thing on top .
I wondered if you ’ve seen it or if you want to see it or if you have a response to it ? ”
Obama , shrugging incredulously : “ I have no response to that . ”
The magazine explains at the start of its news release previewing the issue : “ On the cover of the July 21 , 2008 , issue of The New Yorker , in ‘ The Politics of Fear , ’ artist Barry Blitt satirizes the use of scare tactics and misinformation in the Presidential election to derail Barack Obama ’s campaign . ”
Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post said Sunday on his CNN media show “ Reliable Sources ” that the cover is arguably “ incendiary . ”
“ I talked to the editor of The New Yorker , David Remnick , who tells me this is a satire , that they are making fun of all the rumors , ” Kurtz added .
Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune defended it as “ quite within the normal realms of journalism , ” adding that “ it 's just lampooning all the crazy ignorance out there . ”
The panelists agreed it would succeed in its goal of getting attention .
I find that people who go out of their way to claim they ’re more patriotic than you , that they love our country more than you , that they love the troops more than you , that they love God more than you – usually do n’t .
In fact , people who wear their “ love of ” on their sleeve usually have some sort of problem .
Normal people do n’t need to publicly extol their own love of country , family , or faith .
They show it – they do n’t crow it , as it were .
Hagel and Reed returned to the United States from Jordan , while Obama continued on to Israel , Germany , France and Britain .
“ At that point , it was a political trip for Sen. Obama , ” Hagel said Sunday on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . ” “ I think it would have been inappropriate for him — and certainly he would have been criticized by the McCain people and the press and , probably should have been — if , on a political trip in Europe , paid for by political funds , not the taxpayers , to go essentially then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign . ”
Hagel also lit in to McCain for , as host Bob Schieffer put it , stating that Obama ’s views on Iraq were based on political expediency , “ that he chose — and these are Sen.
McCain ’s words — ‘ a political path that would get him the nomination . ' ”
“ I think John is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives , and when we start to get into ‘ You ’re less patriotic than me , I ’m more patriotic , ’ ” Hagel replied , adding : “ John ’s better than that . ”
On the Palin- McCain Ticket , Palin Is Still Under Wraps
No , that was not a typo .
These big crowds really seem to be going to Sarah Palin ’s head .
As Jonathan noted , she actually referred to “ a Palin and McCain administration " in a speech last week .
But Palin ’s high opinion of herself is clearly not shared by the people running John McCain ’s campaign .
Funny that the McCain folks agreed to a wide - open format for the presidential debates but insisted on strict rules for the vice presidential encounter .
That way , Palin wo n't have to offer long answers .
Little sound - bites will do .
As Bob Kaiser put it in The Post this morning , “ In the negotiations , Republicans wanted to limit the amount of time available for their neophyte candidate , Palin , to be questioned on a single topic . ”
No kidding .
Once again , the McCain campaign is admitting that Palin ’s knowledge is as thin as a single - sheet press release .
Then there is the fact that Palin has been kept away from any serious or challenging questioning since her interview with Charlie Gibson .
In Grand Rapids , Mich. , where I visited this week , Palin did participate in a “ town hall ” meeting with McCain , but she did so before a carefully controlled crowd of Republican loyalists that was not about to ask her a question that might stump or stretch her .
The Post editorial board put matters gently but firmly today : “ Mr. McCain 's selection of an inexperienced and relatively unknown figure was unsettling , and the campaign 's decision to keep her sequestered from serious interchanges with reporters and voters serves only to deepen the unease . ”
Finally , there is the stonewalling of the Alaska investigation into what has become known as “ trooperagte . ”
Here is how an Associated Press story filed on Saturday described where matters stand :
ANCHORAGE , Alaska --
Until three weeks ago , only Alaskans and a few hard - core political junkies in the rest of the country cared about the obscure scandal known here as Troopergate .
A legislative committee had ordered an investigation into whether Gov. Sarah Palin abused her power to settle a vendetta against her sister 's ex-husband .
She did n't seem too worried .
Broadly popular , she adopted a bring - it - on attitude , saying : " Hold me accountable .
... I do n't have anything to hide . "
But the bravado regarding allegations that she dismissed the state 's top law enforcement official when he would n't fire Palin 's former brother - in - law from his state trooper 's job disappeared on Aug. 29 .
Suddenly , Palin was the Republican vice - presidential nominee .
Suddenly , aided by McCain campaign operatives , she began stonewalling .
Over the next several weeks , Palin and her team withheld the investigation 's most important witnesses _ herself , her husband Todd , and a host of key administration aides .
Palin also continued to withhold potentially key evidence _ the contents of a plethora of e-mails among the governor , her husband and key state government officials .
If Palin thinks she ’s on firm ground , why all this stonewalling ?
If this is not a cover - up , what is it ?
McCain figured he could prop Palin up – and keep her locked away -- until Election Day .
But that is looking more and more like an iffy proposition .
Of course , given Palin ’s unguarded take on the actual order of this ticket , maybe Palin will dump McCain before this is done .
It has been something of a David and Goliath battle , but the first skirmishes in the war on file sharing are over .
While the RIAA jubilantly claimed success last year , it is another case that has has now silenced the RIAA , as it avoids drawing attention to the case it never had .
If you read a mainstream media news report about file sharing or talk to a reporter about ( illicit ) filesharing , you would think that the only case involving the RIAA was Capitol V Thomas , a case that made news nationwide for the size of the fines .
However , there are a number of cases going on around the country , cases where the RIAA did not win .
One of the most under - reported is Atlantic V Anderson , which has taken over 3 years from start to finish .
The RIAA eventually dropped it with prejudice , meaning they accept the fault was theirs in this case .
A similar thing happened in the case against another alleged filesharer , Foster , but both cases were relatively under - reported in mainstream media .
Copyright law , like most other aspects of civil law , allows for the prevailing party to recoup legal fees and costs incurred in the case .
This is exactly what Foster and Anderson did , with success .
The Foster case was awarded over $ 68,000 in attorney fees and costs .
Likewise , the Anderson case was awarded fees and costs but of a substantially greater amount ; $ 107,834 to be precise , in an order dated July 28th 2008 .
It is encouraging to finally hear that last night , the RIAA and the member companies that were involved in the case finally paid the fees ( they refused first ) , putting an end to this protracted legal wrangling .
The amount paid was not , however , $ 107,834 but a figure of $ 107,951 , a figure which takes into account interest accrued due to delay .
It should be noted that while this is the end of Atlantic V Anderson , it is not the end of Anderson V Atlantic , the case where Ms Anderson is taking her former accusers to task over their practices in this field .
It is a heartening victory , and one that is spurring the tide .
So , with Thomas looking to head to a mistrial , making the $ 222,000 judgment null and void , the two largest decisions in the RIAA ’s ‘ war on downloading ’ have been against them .
In both cases the RIAA admitted it was wrong , and ordered to pay the fees .

This image , about 2 millimeters across , from NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander 's Optical Microscope shows particles collected on a magnetic surface inside the lander 's microscope .
The particles are larger grains seen within the fine orange dust that covers most of the ground at Phoenix 's landing site .
The particles vary in color , but are of similar size , about one - tenth of a millimeter .
Even as itsmission winds down , NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander has spotted snow falling fromthe Martian sky .
Phoenix ?s camera and meteorologicalequipment have shownclouds and fog forming during the night as the air gets colder .
" Thisis now occurring every night , " said Jim Whiteway of York University in Toronto and lead scientist for Phoenix 's Meteorological Station .
A laserinstrument that is pointed directly up into Mars ' atmosphere has also detectedsnow from clouds about 2.5 miles ( 4 kilometers ) above the spacecraft 's landingsite .
Data show the snow vaporizing before reaching the ground .
There are noconventional photographs of the snowfall .
Scientists knew from previous studiesthat it snowson Mars .
But they 've never seen it happening from the ground .
" Nothinglike this view has ever been seen on Mars , " Whiteway said .
" We 'll belooking for signs that the snow may even reach the ground . "
The crafthas also seen new hints of the planet 's watery past .
Meanwhile , missionscientists are trying to squeeze in all the science they can before the Martiansun sets for the winter , including a surprise attempt to switch on Phoenix 's as - yet unused microphone .
Missionscientists announced the plans for Phoenix ' sremaining weeks of activity at a press conference Monday .
They alsorevealed information that will help them to " begin rewriting the book ofMartian chemistry , " said Michael Hecht , of NASA 's Jet PropulsionLaboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , Calif. , and lead scientist for Phoenix 'sMicroscopy , Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer ( MECA ) .
Phoenix landed in the northern plains of Mars on May 25 and has been using its onboard instruments to analyze the Martian dirt and subsurface ice layer at its landing site above Mars ' arcticcircle .
The mission , extended once by NASA through the end of September , wasextended again earlier this month through the end of December .
But it 's unlikely Phoenix will last that long .
What 'snext
As winterapproaches in the Northern hemisphere of Mars , the sun dips lower in thehorizon , providing Phoenix ' solar arrays with less and less sunlight to convertinto electricity to run its instruments .
Eventually the sun will set above thearctic circle alltogether .
As thishappens , the Phoenix team is " trying to get the most out of these scienceinstruments in the last few days , " said Barry Goldstein , Phoenix projectmanager , also of JPL .
Scientistsworking on Phoenix 's Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer are planning to attemptto fill the instrument 's four ( of eight total ) remainingovens will Martian dirt and ice samples .
The team particularly wants to geta pure - ice or ice - rich sample , said TEGA lead scientist William Boynton of the University of Arizona , Tucson .
The teamhas run into problems gathering ice samples , with the " ice almost weldingitself to the inside of the scoop " on the end of Phoenix 's robotic arm , Boynton said , though he added : " We 're still optimistic that we can fillall four before we run out of power . "
Phoenix will also look for signs oforganics in the samples delivered to TEGA , by comparing them to a blank broughtto rule out any contamination brought from Earth .
While they would be athrilling find , organics would not necessarily indicate life ?
they could bedeposited by comets and preserved in the ice , said Phoenix principalinvestigator Peter Smith , also of the University of Arizona .
The landerwill also look at the different isotopes ( or types of an element with differentnumbers of neutrons ) in the subsurface ice and the water vapor in the Martianair to see whether the two water sources interact , Smith said .
As a bonus , mission scientists are going to try to switch on the microphone that wasoriginally installed on Phoenix to be used during the lander 's descent .
Whilethat use was scrapped , the Phoenix scientists have to decided now to " tryand listen to Mars for the first time , " Smith said .
" We 'renot sure if it 's going to work , but we 're going to make a try , " he added .
Phoenixwill also try to sample the dirt underneatha rock , dubbed " Headless , " that it successfully moved with its7.7 foot - long ( 2.4 meter - long ) robotic arm last week .
Images have already shownsome color differences in the dirt under the rock .
" We 'rehoping to find a different chemistry under the rock than next to therock , " Smith said .
NewMartian chemistry
So far , thechemistry of the surface layers near Phoenix 's landing site has been a bitdifferent that anticipated .
TEGA hasidentified several minerals that suggest that the surface there has interactedwith water sometime in the Martian past .
These include silicates similar instructure to mica , only softer , and calcium carbonate .
Examples of carbonateson Earth are chalk and antacid tablets .
The suiteof MECA instruments have shown that the pH of the soil near Phoenix isapproximate 8.3 ?
or slightly basic ?
" almost exactly the pH of oceanwater on Earth , " Hecht said .
MECA hasalso found evidence of perchlorates , which could act as an energy source forany potential past Martian microbes and could have a significant impact on Mars ' water chemistry .
For onething , they could help explain why Phoenix 's fork - likeprobe has found that " the soil in our little corner of Mars is very , very dry , " Hecht said .
Perchlorate could be soaking up any water in thesoil above the ice layer , he explained .
Based onmodels of Phoenix 's energy decline , mission engineers do n't expect Phoenix to last much past late November .
Eventually , the sun will set on Phoenixcompletely , and carbon dioxide ice will likely deposit on it .
That combinedwith the ever - decreasing temperatures of winter will likely destroy thespacecrafts components .
" Nobodyanticipates that the vehicle will survive that harsh winter , " Goldsteinsaid .
