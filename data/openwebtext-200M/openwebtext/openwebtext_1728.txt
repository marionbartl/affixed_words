Last August , the presidential press corps followed Barack Obama and his family to Martha ’s Vineyard for their brief vacation .
The coverage focused on summery fare  a visit to an ice cream parlor , the books the president had brought along .
Nearly everyone mentioned his few rounds of golf , including his swing , and the enthusiasm of onlookers .
What caught my eye , though , was the makeup of his foursome .
The president was joined by an old friend from Chicago ; a young aide ; and Robert Wolf , Chairman and CEO , UBS Group Americas .
In a decidedly incurious piece , a New York Times reporter made light of Wolf ’s presence :
" The president has told friends that to truly relax he prefers golfing with young aides …
But he departed from that pattern Monday when he invited a top campaign contributor , Robert Wolf , president of UBS Investment Bank , to join him for 18 holes .
Call it donor maintenance . "
Wolf , however , is hardly  as the Times suggested  just another donor .
For one thing , he is a leading figure in an industry that almost brought down the entire financial system  and then was the recipient of astonishing government largesse .
UBS , along with other banks , benefited directly from the backdoor bailout of the insurance giant AIG .
But UBS stands alone in one rather formidable respect  it was the defendant in the largest offshore tax evasion case in U.S. history , accused of helping wealthy Americans hide their income in secret offshore accounts .
To settle a massive investigation , UBS forked over $ 780 million to the US treasury .
This settlement came shortly before Wolf rounded out Obamas golfing party .
Given this rather problematical situation , why then would the President choose UBSs
Wolf of all people for this honor ?
Wolf declined a request for an interview about his relationship with the President , so it was not possible to pose that question to him .
This hardly matters , though , for the story goes far beyond Wolf and UBS .
It involves Republicans as well as Democrats , the Bush Administration as well as Obamas .
More importantly , behind the trivialized golf outing on Marthas Vineyard , lie the interests that increasingly set the course for every administration .
And that now game the system so well that the rest of us  wherever we live in the world  are kept fighting for the scraps .
BOTH SIDES NOW
When most people criticize those aspects of government that seem most impervious to the democratic process , they cite the permanency and perceived self - interest of the mandarins of the Washington bureaucracy .
But when it comes to real power , an ability to come out ahead no matter which party is in power , its hard to top certain financial institutions .
UBS is very much a part of that permanent government .
Though not a household name in the United States , UBS is a major player in the Beltway game .
During the 2008 campaign , while Robert Wolf was courting Democratic hopeful Obama , his UBS cohort , former Senator Phil Gramm , was working the other side of the street .
As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee in the 1990s , Gramm , a corporate - friendly Texas Republican , played a key role in the deregulation of the banking industry , an act so central to the nations financial collapse .
Since 2002 , Gramm has been UBS Americas vice chairman .
In 2008 , he was the leading economics adviser for Obamas opponent , John McCain  and even touted as a possible treasury secretary in a McCain administration .
The bottom line : UBS hedged its bets , and so had an inside track no matter which party took the White House .
Thus , when Obama won , it was Wolf who ascended .
The new president named the banker - donor to his White House Economic Advisory Board .
The important machinations behind this accrual of influence rarely get attention in the frenzied hustle of the news cycle .
One reason is that they do not seem like news at all , since they are essentially woven deeply into the fabric of politics and government , thus hidden in plain sight .
Another is that they are dauntingly complex .
Some things are simple , though .
Like the fact that a UBS executive is a dubious candidate to serve as an economic advisor to the president .
For one thing , the companys track record at the time of the election was distinctly underwhelming .
UBS suffered major losses on subprime lending , and had to raise money from the Singapore government and other entities .
As Slates money columnist Daniel Gross quipped back in 2008 , UBS used to stand for Union Bank of Switzerland .
But perhaps it should stand for Untold Billions Squandered .
Or Underwater Bi-Lingual Schleppers .
Furthermore , UBS  stock lost nearly 70 percent of its value even before the recession really kicked in  making it the worst performing foreign bank operating here .
Given this damning set of facts ,
Wolf made both an odd choice as a presidential adviser and a peculiar pick for that intimate round of golf .

MRI scans are an established way of diagnosing brain conditions Measures are needed to stop brain scans being misused by courts , insurers and employers , experts have warned .
Some research suggests the technique can show whether a person is lying if certain areas of the brain " light - up " .
At least one US company is offering scans to employers recruiting staff but American courts have already rejected attempts to use them in legal cases .
The University of Edinburgh 's Burkhard Schafer said there were issues over privacy and reliability of technology .
The subject is being discussed by experts from around the world at a conference at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Glasgow .
' The next frontier '
Attempts have been made to use magnetic resonance imaging scans as lie detectors or to demonstrate mental health problems in more than 90 capital punishment cases in the US , as well as in other proceedings in Europe and Asia .
As soon as public awareness increases there will be interest from everyone from daytime entertainment programmes to employers and the legal system
Burkhard Schafer , University of Edinburgh
While they have been rejected in many cases , scan results have sometimes been accepted as evidence .
Mr Schafer , co-director of the SCRIPT Centre for Research in Intellectual Property and Technology at the University of Edinburgh 's school of law , said the UK had to consider how to prevent MRI scans being misused - and how to protect people 's privacy .
" After data mining and online profiling , brain imaging could well become the next frontier in the privacy wars .
" The promise to read a person 's mind is beguiling , and some applications will be greatly beneficial .
" But a combination of exaggerated claims by commercial providers , inadequate legal regulation and the persuasive power of images bring very real dangers for us as citizens . "
He added : " As soon as public awareness increases there will be interest from everyone from daytime entertainment programmes to employers and the legal system .
" It would be sensible to be prepared . "
' Powerful and compelling '
Mr Schafer added there was also a chance employers could seek to use scans to test the honesty of an individual 's CV - or by insurance companies .
We do need to have an informed debate
Professor Geraint Rees , UCL " There should probably be a moratorium for insurance companies , as has happened over the use of genetic test information . "
But he warned MRI scans should not be used in this way : " The science is n't there . "
Joanna Wardlaw , professor of applied neuroimaging at the University of Edinburgh , said brain scans could show differences between groups who thought differently in a research setting .
But she added : " It 's very , very difficult to apply the results of an individual 's scan in situations such as where there is a threat of legal action .
" Images are powerful and compelling , and people are likely to accept them .
But there needs to be much more understanding of what the limitations are . "
Professor Geraint Rees , director of the University College London 's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , said : " I 'm concerned about the potential use of scans that are starting to emerge now , but whether we need to go down the road of legal regulation , I 'm not so sure about .
" But we do need to have an informed debate . "

dear new scientist , are you missing a backbone ?
The magazine is allowing an angry crank with a vendetta against an editor to dictate what stories it will publish and pull .
Illustration by Elgin Akpınar
I think I know what to get for New Scientist ’s lawyers this holiday season : a spine .
After one of the magazine ’s editors wrote a brief guide on how to spot creationist weasel words and New Age pseudoscience , a guide much like you ’d see on this blog , they pulled the piece because a certain Dr. James LeFanu whined about it and demanded that he be allowed to write a counter - comment before it goes back up .
Who is Dr. LeFanu ?
Oh just one of those desperate , attention seeking , New Age , post - modernist blowhards who write books on the limitations of science , and decry the concept of holding homeopathy to the same standards as conventional medicine as a witch hunt .
Not only that , but since the editor who wrote the article in question also gave him a lackluster review , there ’s an obvious hint of a personal vendetta , which the magazine ’s lawyers should ’ve just ignored and told LeFanu to find something better to do with his time than whine about his hurt feelings .
Here ’s the thing .
I know that cranks today are often rich , famous and spoiled rotten , and have a penchant for suing their critics if they do n’t get their way , but that does n’t mean that every time they huff and puff you should be afraid of them and give them column space .
LeFanu is just another post - modernist ditz spewing clichés in a book that decries science in the same way as the quantum woo-meisters on HuffPo , and since his attempt in this already over - crowded field failed , he ’s desperate for attention .
And what do you do when there ’s a loon desperate for attention pounding on your door , demanding to be let in so he can have the spotlight and write a public comment to show everyone how relevant and important he is ?
That ’s right , you tell him to go away , not give him exactly what he wants and encourage his bad behavior .
Just like you do n’t give kids candy after their temper tantrum , but put them into time out , so should you ignore self - important cranks who want to turn a very well known popular science publication into their bully pulpit while settling a score at the same time .
So he got some lawyers to send a boilerplate complaint , big deal .
After the Simon Singh affair , trying to sue a science writer for challenging pseudo - scientific tropes is n’t going to go well for the plaintiff .
The skeptics who supported Singh will also throw their support to the science writer in question , the courts will once again have an earful about how UK ’s plaintiff - friendly law is being abused , and the plaintiff will become a laughingstock , his work ridiculed and dissected by every skeptical blog whose authors hear of the case .
I know it can be very tempting to just give in and avoid the hassle altogether , but that ’s just handing a desperate , attention - seeking hack the publicity he does n’t deserve and allow him to take his personal grudges into the press .
But again , as any parent will tell you , children who get what they want after acting out will act out again when you wo n’t buy a toy or give them a cookie .
Likewise , childish cranks with skin thinner than a cell wall will do the same thing as long as you encourage them by caving in to their legal thuggery .
Fellow skeptics , you know what to do .
Fire up your search engines and let your readers know what you think of James LeFanu …

Have you heard the news ?
One of your top five favorite Disneyland park attractions is the focus of a new film from The Walt Disney Studios .
The original Disneyland park attraction , the Haunted Mansion , that debuted in August of 1969 has now inspired a new film for The Walt Disney Studios by well - known filmmaker Guillermo del Toro .
A new piece of artwork was also unveiled by the Studios and is featured below .
Announced at Comic - Con today , del Toro surprised thousands of fans with the news .
In speaking about the new project , del Toro said , “ I could n’t be more excited to be a part of my own adaptation of the original theme park attraction Walt envisioned and that remains - for me - the most desirable piece of real estate in the whole world ! ”
Rich Ross , Chairman of The Walt Disney Studios , remarked “ Millions of people from around the world visit The Haunted Mansion each year , but no one has ever had a tour guide like Guillermo del Toro .
Guillermo is one of the most gifted and innovative filmmakers working today and he is going to take audiences on a visually - thrilling journey like they ’ve never experienced before . ”
What do you think of this exciting news ?
The title of this Recording Industry vs The People post says it all , really : " Ha ha ha ha ha .
RIAA paid its lawyers more than $ 16,000,000 in 2008 to recover only $ 391,000 !!! " :
If the average settlement were $ 3,900 , that would mean 100 settlements for the entire year .
As bad as it was , I guess it was better than the numbers for 2007 , in which more than $ 21 million was spent on legal fees , and $ 3.5 million on " investigative operations " … presumably MediaSentry .
And the amount recovered was $ 515,929 .
And 2006 was similar : they spent more than $ 19,000,000 in legal fees and more than $ 3,600,000 in " investigative operations " expenses to recover $ 455,000 .
So all in all , for a 3 year period , they spent around $ 64,000,000 in legal and investigative expenses to recover around $ 1,361,000 .

FAQ
I like the idea , but I want to use Terminal .app features .
Do you plan to support tabs / unicode / whatever ?
Visor is just a light - weight plugin for Terminal.app ( SIMBL ) .
You should be able to use most of Terminal .app features with Visor .
The only broken feature is " Windows Groups " .
Does Visor work on OSX 10.6 ( Snow Leopard ) ?
64 - bit Terminal.app in Snow Leopard is supported by Visor 2.1 and later .
Does Visor work on OSX 10.5 ( Leopard ) ?
Leopard is supported by Visor 1.5 and later , the best version is Visor 2.1 .
Does Visor work on OSX 10.4 ( Tiger ) ?
Tiger was supported by early Visors ( pre 1.5 ) .
It was in the days when I was a young Windows hacker .
I will never look back , so your only chance is to upgrade to ( Snow ) Leopard .
How do I uninstall Visor ?
Visor is a standard SIMBL plugin .
Remove Visor.bundle from ~/ Library / Application Support / SIMBL / Plugins :
rm - rf ~/ Library / Application \ Support / SIMBL / Plugins / Visor.bundle
Or alternatively you can run rake uninstall task if you have a cloned git repo .
Where are Visor settings stored ?
Visor settings are stored with Terminal .app settings .
You can open ~/ Library / Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist and tweak the values ( better to do this when Terminal . app is not running ) .
If you have troubles with Visor settings or the generated Visor profile , delete this file and restart Terminal .app .
The file will be recreated with default values .
My Visor menu - bar icon is dimmed out .
My hot - key does n't work and just beeps .
What 's wrong ?
There can be only one visor - ed terminal window in the system .
If you close this terminal window ( for example Control + D or typing exit in shell ) , Visor gets into the disabled state you are describing .
Just open a new terminal window and it gets visor - ed again .
You can do this for example by clicking on Terminal .app icon in the Dock .
How can I open a new terminal window the old way , as a classic OSX window ?
If there is a visor - ed terminal window ( Visor menu - bar icon is active ) every new terminal window will be opened as a classic OSX window .
In other words , open at least two terminal windows .
The second one will be classic terminal window for sure .
How can I change the height of Visor ?
Go to Terminal.app's Preferences -> Window ->
Rows
How can I stick Visor to left screen edge ?
Look for the " Position " option in Visor Preferences and pick " Left - Stretch " window placement .
How can I change the width of Visor ?
By default Visor window stretches to the full screen width .
Set some non-stretching positioning for Visor window in Visor Preferences , then Go to Terminal.app's Preferences -> Window -> Columns .
Is it possible to show Visor only on a secondary monitor ?
Go to Visor Preferences ->
Screen
Is it possible to see Visor on every Space ?
Visor 1.6 does not respect Spaces settings ( Issue 52 ) .
Visor 1.7 + forces its window to be visible on every space .
You may disable this in Visor Preferences .
Note : Spaces configuration for Terminal.app does n't apply to the visor - ed terminal window , it is effective only for other ( classic ) terminal windows .
I want to keep different preferences for Visor and other ( classic ) terminal windows .
What is the best way manage this ?
Well this was quite a pain point in older Visor releases .
From Visor 2.0 there must be a profile in Terminal .app called " Visor " .
Visor - ed window always use the " Visor " profile for opening new tabs ( regardless of " default profile " or " startup profile " settings in Terminal.app ) .
To make your life easier Visor creates this profile for you if it does not exist and fills in Darwin 's preferred Visor settings ( black background with fine colors , 90 % opacity ) .
How can I revert to Darwin 's Visor profile ?
You can always delete ( or better rename ) the " Visor " profile and relaunch Terminal.app .
Visor will then create a new " Visor " profile from scratch with Darwin 's preferred settings .
Do I need to install TerminalColours SIMBL with Visor ?
No , TerminalColours is integrated into Visor 2.0 and later .
My motivation was to allow people to get cool Visor colors out of the box ( with generated Visor profile ) .
Do I need to install CopyOnSelect SIMBL with Visor ?
No , CopyOnSelect is integrated into Visor 2.0 and later .
It is a configurable option in Visor Preferences ( disabled by default ) .

On " AC360° , " hear from the wives of five survivors of the BP oil rig explosion .
Watch " AC360° " at 10 ET Wednesday night .
New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
Federal authorities have given BP until Friday to devise contingency plans for the continued collection of gushing oil into a containment cap in the event of an operational failure or severe weather .
In a letter written Tuesday , the government 's on - scene administrator , Coast Guard Rear Adm.
James Watson , instructed BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles to lay out a process for the recovery of oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico .
" BP shall provide the plans for these parallel , continuous and contingency collection processes , including an implementation timeline , within 72 hours of receiving this letter , " Watson wrote .
" Current collection efforts may not be interrupted to implement these plans . "
The deadline came as Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen said Wednesday that slightly more than 15,000 barrels of oil -- more than 630,000 gallons -- had been recovered from the ruptured BP well in the 24 hours ending Tuesday at midnight .
BP said it has collected about 57,500 barrels ( 2.4 million gallons ) of oil since last week , when it placed a loose - fitting containment cap atop its ruptured well .
High - resolution video of oil leak released
In addition to the letter to Suttles , Allen has written to BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward asking for the development of better redundancies in the company 's short - and long - term containment plans .
Allen highlighted concerns over BP 's ability to effectively process damage claims associated with the Gulf disaster and asked Hayward to provide more detailed information , including claim numbers and personal identifiers such as the last four digits of Social Security numbers .
" Access to this level of detail is critical to informing the public as to how BP is meeting its obligations as a responsible corporation , " Allen wrote .
Also Wednesday , Suttles denied that BP has ordered cleanup workers not to talk to reporters .
" Recent media reports have suggested that individuals involved in the cleanup operation have been prohibited from speaking to the media , and this is simply untrue , " he said in a letter e-mailed to CNN by a company spokesman .
i Report : Share views on oil spill
Asked about reports from BP employees that they had been forbidden to talk to reporters , Suttles said that it might take some time before all 25,000 people working for BP are made aware of the policy .
On Capitol Hill , oil drilling issues took center stage on Day 51 of the disaster as lawmakers debated everything from safety to cleanup to liability .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar defended the Obama administration 's six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling , which has come under fire from critics who argue that the drilling is vital for reducing the dependence on foreign oil and key to the region 's economic health .
" It was our view that we press the pause button ... not the stop button , " Salazar told the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources .
" It 's a pause button so that we can make sure that we move forward with OCS [ outer continental shelf ] drilling -- that it can be done in a way that is protective of people and protective of the environment as well . "
Salazar and Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes said government scientists estimate the spill 's flow rate after last week 's cut of the well 's riser pipe increased by 4 percent to 5 percent .
That 's well below an increase of as much as 20 percent that administration officials had indicated could happen .
As the environmental crisis worsens , states are tracking the disaster 's health impact , including respiratory and skin irritation problems in Louisiana and Alabama , health officials said .
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals is aware of 71 cases of oil spill - related illness as of Wednesday , said state health officer Dr. Jimmy Guidry .
Of those cases , 50 involved workers on oil rigs or who participated in cleanup efforts , and 21 came from the general public .
Symptoms included throat irritation , cough , chest pain , headaches and shortness of breath , he said .
Eight workers were hospitalized , for an average of one day each , the department said .
Monitoring of Louisiana 's air has not found chemicals from oil that would cause a large negative health impact , Guidry said .
In Alabama , 15 cases of illness have been reported , said Dr. Don Williamson , state health officer .
Florida , Mississippi and Texas have received no reports of illness connected to the oil spill , officials in those states said .
Top congressional Democrats renewed their push Wednesday for legislation that would remove oil spill liability caps -- a move some Republicans warned would lead to stronger monopolies in the energy sector while increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil sources .
Among other things , Democrats are targeting the 1990 Oil Pollution Act , which could limit BP 's liability for economic damages caused by the Gulf disaster to $ 75 million .
" If you or I ... got into an accident that we caused , [ we'd be ] responsible for all the damages , " said Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - California , chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee .
There would be " no caps in that case , and there should be no caps in this case . "
President Obama plans to visit the Gulf Coast again next week .
His Monday and Tuesday itineraries will include stops in Mississippi , Alabama and Florida , the White House announced .
It will be his fourth trip to the region since the gusher began in late April .
Government and BP officials are under increasing pressure from fishermen and officials , members of Congress and environmental advocacy groups to stop the relentless flow of oil into the Gulf .
The disaster has spurred grass - roots action .
Hands Across the Sand and Sierra Club leaders announced Wednesday a " National Day of Action " for June 26 , when they will call on Americans to gather on beaches across the country and hold hands for 15 minutes in opposition to offshore drilling .
Federal agencies responsible for monitoring the toll to wildlife said Wednesday that 442 oiled birds have been collected alive ; 633 were dead .
The report said 50 sea turtles have been collected alive ; 272 were dead .
CNN 's Ed Hornick contributed to this report .
MI5 was directly involved in the rendition of a Moroccan national , illegally taken from a Belgian prison to work for Britain 's Security Services in London , according to The Independent .
The man , now aged 29 and who cannot be named for his own safety , was secretly transferred from a Brussels jail in April 2004 and then further held and interrogated by senior MI5 officers at a secret base near London .
Documents seen by The Independent show that in September 2003 a Belgian court sentenced the man to four years in prison for the use of false documents and association with terror suspects .
Yet less than a year later Home Office papers reveal that the Moroccan , who was born in Rabat , was in Britain and had been granted leave to remain in the UK by the British Government .
The Home Office document , dated 4 November 2004 , says : " It has been decided that the Secretary of State 's discretion should be exercised in your favour and you have been granted limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom for a reason not covered by the Immigration Rules . "
The case is the first evidence of a UK - based rendition recruitment programme operated by the Security Service after the 11 September attacks on America .
Until now , Britain 's involvement in the practice appeared to be limited to providing assistance to American renditions .
In an interview with The Independent , the man 's Belgian lawyer , Christophe Marchand , said that the rendition took place while the suspect was waiting to appear before the central criminal court in Brussels in relation to his appeal .
Mr Marchand , Belgium 's foremost defence attorney and author of the book European Trends on the War on Human Rights , said his client , then 23 years old , had been questioned by MI5 agents in Forest Prison in Brussels where he had been detained without trial and held in solitary confinement for more than two years .
During his later interrogation and detention at an MI5 safe house 40 minutes from central London , the man did not have access to a lawyer .
Last night MPs and human rights groups said the case illustrated the extent of Britain 's illegal role in the war on terror .
Andrew Tyrie MP , chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition , said : " If it were to turn out that this man had been transferred to the UK against his will and against due legal process , we should well be concerned .
Stories such as this underline the need for an inquiry to get to the bottom of what happened after 11 September . "
Clive Stafford Smith , director of the legal charity Reprieve , said : " We simply can not be in the business of snatching people from foreign countries without any legal process .
Why have we fought for the rule of law for all these decades if it is simply to be ignored when the Security Services decide it is not convenient to let judges into the debate ? "
Mr Marchand suspects that the deal must have been approved by Belgium 's security services and the state prosecutor .
A year after his mysterious disappearance from prison , the Moroccan national contacted Mr Marchand .
" We met in central London .
He told me the whole story about how MI5 had arranged for his release and secret flight to London on a specially chartered British Airways aircraft .
He told me he felt vulnerable in prison and did n't think he would ever be released .
He feared being returned to Morocco even more because he felt sure that he would be tortured .
" They told him that if he agreed to work for MI5 he would have a new life in the UK .
But he was very vulnerable at this time , he was young and held in solitary confinement where he was psychologically weak .
He believed he had no choice .
Once he arrived in the UK he was told that if he ever told anyone who he was working for his life would be in danger from al - Qa'ida .
He told me that he thought this was an explicit threat that MI5 would make sure al - Qa'ida knew his identity if he ever broke his agreement with the Security Service . "
Mr Marchand , an international expert in human rights law , accused Britain of being directly involved in rendition .
" Of course it is rendition – it is the illegal transfer of someone from one country to another .
He was transferred from Belgium without any legal safeguards .
It is a very clear violation of the rule of law .
Pressure was huge on him because he knew he was condemned to years in prison . "
A spokeswoman for the Belgian embassy in London said she was aware of the case and the " disappearance " but could give no further details .
Lieve Pellens , of the Belgian Federal Prosecutors Office in Brussels , said she was sure the Prosecutors Office was " not implicated " in such an arrangement .
" If a foreign authority wants to question someone held in the Forest Prison then they have to make a special request and we have to ensure that a Belgian officer is present , " said Ms Pellens .
A spokeswoman for the Security Service said : " We do not comment on individuals .
We do not comment on operational security matters . "
Rendition : Explained
* Countries wishing to transfer a suspect from one state to another for arrest , detention or interrogation must operate through the judicial process , usually by making an extradition request .
* Where such transfers occur outside a legal framework , such as in the Brussels case which we have reported today , they are referred to as renditions .
* America 's extraordinary rendition programme involves the further element of torture , usually by a third - party proxy state .
In the Brussels case the Moroccan suspect faced the prospect of torture in his homeland and could not freely give consent for his transfer to Britain .
* Upon his transfer to the UK he was held in an MI5 safe - house , where he was interrogated without legal representation .
All the time he knew he was at risk of deportation .

Jeff Bezos has survived the iPad .
Predictions that Apple 's bright tablet computer would be a Kindle - killer have n't quite come to pass : Amazon CEO
Bezos says that the growth rate in sales of his e-reading device has tripled since June , when he dropped the Kindle price to $ 189 .
( Clearly increased competition from other e-readers , like Sony Reader and the Barnes and Noble Nook , has n't dampened the Kindle fire , either . )
And he 's still kvelling over last week 's announcement that e-book sales on Amazon exceed the number of hardback books sold by the e-commerce site .
" And that 's with a device at the end of its product life cycle , " he says .
The cycle of life resets on Aug. 27 , when Amazon will ship the third - generation Kindle .
Judging from a brief hands - on demo , the new Kindle – which still costs $ 189 – is n't a drastic makeover but a canny evolution that enhances the device 's raison d'etre : reading .
But by also releasing a lower - cost ( $ 139 ) version of the Kindle without 3G wireless connectivity , Bezos anticipates millions of new customers who can live with waiting for a Wi -Fi hot spot to replenish their content .
He says that the introduction of the Wi-Fi version is purely a price play , a way to sell Kindles to families and couples who already have one in the house .
" At $ 139 , you 're going to have multiple Kindles , not just one , " Bezos says .
Consistent with Amazon 's past practice , Bezos revealed no specifics about Kindle sales to date , other than to say that " millions " have already been sold .
This year 's Kindle comes in either the classic ivory or an earthier graphite hue .
The most significant improvement – perhaps as a " sez you " to the crisp iPad screen – is a sharper e-ink display than previous Kindles .
Bezos claims that the contrast is 50 percent better , due in part to a proprietary technology involving " font hinting " which more skillfully manipulates the electronic ink that forms the letters .
Also , as Apple 's CEO has been known to say , " It 's really thin ! "
The new Kindle is a svelte 1/3 of an inch thick and weighs 8.7 ounces , making it 21 percent smaller than the 2G Kindle .
This makes Kindle lighter than a paperback , while the iPad is heavier than Infinite Jest .
( Eventually , Bezos says , he'd like to make the Kindle so light " you 'd need a paperweight to hold it down . " )
" Our best estimate is that Kindle books will outsell paperbacks sometime in the next nine to 12 months . " – Jeff Bezos
The pages turn 20 percent faster than on the previous Kindle , and Amazon has even tamped down the clicking sound of the buttons , so readers are less likely to disturb a slumbering companion .
Those page - turning buttons , by the way , are longer and slimmer – almost like bumpers on the edge of the device .
This may be the first Kindle that finally prevents you from turning a page by mistake .
The long - anticipated Kindle touchscreen is … still not there .
" From an engineering point of view , it would have been very easy to put a touchscreen on it , " says Bezos .
" But it would hurt the reading experience . "
He says that e-ink touchscreens degrade display quality and add glare .
Instead , the Kindle revamps its interface by replacing its stubby joystick with a " five way " arrangement where a thumbnail - sized selection button is surrounded by a thin band of compass - point directional buttons .
The home and the menu button are now placed on the keyboard array .
Maybe third time 's the charm for the Kindle , which has changed navigational controls on each version .
Other improvements include expanded battery life : a full month if the radio's off , and 10 days if you leave the 3G turned on .
There 's twice as much storage , enough for 3,500 books .
And though Bezos did n't show it to me , Amazon is offering a cover with a built - in LED reading light that works off the device 's battery .
It 's $ 60 , which seems pricey for a book light , but Amazon explains that it uses gold - plated conducive hinges .
Maybe when you 're done reading you can use it as jewelry .
" We 're starting to see evidence that at the $ 189 price point that this may be a mass product , " Bezos says .
" Even though we 're designing it for readers , it seems to be breaking out . "
With a Kindle now selling at $ 139 , he expects the tipping point to tip even more .
What 's more , the revelation that Amazon sells more Kindle books than hardcovers is only the beginning of what now looks like an inevitable mass migration to e-books .
" Our best estimate is that Kindle books will outsell paperbacks at Amazon sometime in the next nine to twelve months , " Bezos says .
" And then at some point after that they 'll overtake the combination . "
As for the iPad ?
Bezos is a fan .
" My first thought when I saw the iPad is that it will be great for our mobile commerce business – the more internet - connected devices the better , from Amazon 's point of view . "
But if people thought the iPad would be a challenger to Kindle 's e-reading throne , " it has n't happened that way , " says Bezos with his trademark laugh .
He tried reading a bit on an iPad but did n't get far because " if I have to read a long document on an LCD display , the first thing I do is print it out . "
He thinks that people will be fine with carrying multiple devices – tablet , laptop and , of course , " purpose - built reading devices that are extremely light , let you read outside in bright daylight , a whole bunch of things . "
Like the one he 's now selling for $ 139 .
Santa - Claus is God in the eyes of young children !
Do you lie to your children ?
Remember the excitement of Christmas eve as children when we could n't get to sleep .
We were awaiting the arrival of Santa - Claus .
We were told that " He knows when you are sleeping , he knows when you 're awake , he knows if you 've been bad or good , so be good for goodness sake " .
Now children know Santa - Claus lives far away on the North pole and they have never met him .
Children can understand how parents know if they 've been bad or good , but for a perfect stranger that lives far away to know when they are sleeping or awake is nothing short of supernatural .
In fact Santa - Claus to a child is an exact representation of God to an adult .
Children are taught to believe in this " all knowing " , " always present " , " all powerful " giver of best gifts .
In fact , a child 's faith in Santa - Claus is in my opinion more powerful than their faith in God himself .
I am reminded of a boy in my grade 2 class .
It was just before Christmas break and the whole class was excited .
One boy discovered that Jamie , a fellow classmate , still believed in Santa - Claus .
The whole class ridiculed Jamie so bad that he ran out of the class and cried all the way home .
My heart still goes out to Jamie .
Yet in reality most children learn that Santa - Claus does n't really exist by mocking of older children or peers as in Jamie 's case .
Older siblings love to laugh at younger siblings when parents give approval to " pop " the Santa - Claus bubble of the young and faithful .
Now this is where the danger lies .
Every year , millions of children suddenly have their faith " shattered " in this " all knowing " , " omni- present " , " all - powerful " Santa - Claus .
This must damage their ability to have faith in the one true God who really does exist .
No wonder adults usually visualize God as a kind old man and Jesus as baby in a Christmas nativity scene .
This is how they were taught about God and Jesus as children .
Since Christmas is not found in the Bible , I believe parents would be well advised to participate in Santa - Claus as a game .
Teach children that Santa - Claus is a myth and a fairy - tale on their first Christmas .
Play the " Santa - Claus game " but protect your children 's faith in God by seeking out and destroying any " faith " they have in Santa - Claus .
Otherwise , imagine this :
Your 13 year old hears the preacher talk about God the Father , as an all knowing , all powerful giver of the gift of eternal salvation in his Sunday sermon .
The preacher then encourages all to have faith in God .
But " once bitten , twice shy " .
Your young teen thinks to himself , " Dejavu !
I know when I am an adult , that I will learn that Jesus was just a myth and that church is just a game , just like Santa - Claus " .
Playing the " Santa - Claus game " does n't take any of the fun or joy out of Christmas for children .
In fact they may enjoy it more !

Even Santa Knows that : " A lie is a lie is a lie " !
My mother 's parents taught her to believe in Santa Claus .
My mom said it hurt her deeply when she discovered that they had lied to her , so she did n't want to lie to us .
My dad was just very , very spiritual and refused to lie to us .
So I never believed in Santa Claus .
My husband was taught to believe in Santa Claus but did not want to lie to our children .
We took a lot of heat from his family because we refused to lie to our children .
My children are grateful to us that we did not lie to them .
A couple of them got in trouble at school and got taken out of class and reprimanded because they told their fellow kindergartners that Santa did n't exist .
Do we love our children or do n't we ?
If we can look into their innocent little faces and lie through our teeth to them , then we absolutely do not love them .
They trust us .
They depend on us to tell them the truth .
What kind of horrible parents are we if we would say , " Oh , do n't listen to Johnny .
You know I will tell you the truth .
Of course Santa exists " ?
Well , you know what ?
When they find out it is n't so , we should n't expect them to listen when we tell them God exists .
At least I would n't .
If my parents had lied to me about one thing I would have figured they 'd lie about something else .
Or they were so stupid they did n't know reality from fiction .
Do we want our children to be ignorant ?
If they asked us why grass is green would we fill their pure little minds with some kind of story about fairies dropping green food coloring on the grass or would we tell them the truth ?
Do we want our children to be IGNORANT ?
Mercy , the truth is all there is in this world !
A lie is a lie is a lie , and no matter how we want to sugarcoat it it 's still going to be a lie .
Do all good gifts come from God or do they come from Santa Claus ?
Sorry , this is one of my soapboxes .
As far as I 'm concerned this topic ought not to need discussion .
Anybody with half a brain in his head knows that lying is a sin .
And since Santa does n't exist , to say he does is to lie .

North Korea has sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council rejecting accusations from South Korea that it was behind the sinking of one of its neighbor ’s navy ships , saying it was the victim of a U.S. - led conspiracy .
The letter , addressed to the U.N. Security Council president from the North ’s permanent representative to the body , followed the filing of a complaint by the South last week demanding action by the international community to deter further aggression .
A team of international investigators led by South Korea ’s military said in May that a North Korean submarine torpedoed the corvette Cheonan on March 26 , snapping the vessel in half in a blast and killing 46 sailors .
North Korea , through its official media , has already rejected the charge , saying it was a ploy by the South ’s President Lee Myung - bak aimed at political gains for his conservative government .

Apple on Wednesday apologized for technology issues that crippled the iPhone 4 pre-order process , but said that the company processed orders for 600,000 of the devices in one day .
Apple on Wednesday apologized for technology issues that crippled the iPhone 4 pre-order process , but said that the company processed orders for 600,000 of the devices in one day .
As a result , new orders will not ship until at least July 14 , according to the Apple Web site .
" It was the largest number of pre-orders Apple has ever taken in a single day and was far higher than we anticipated , resulting in many order and approval system malfunctions , " Apple said .
" Many customers were turned away or abandoned the process in frustration .
We apologize to everyone who encountered difficulties , and hope that they will try again or visit an Apple or carrier store once the iPhone 4 is in stock . "
The new iPhone 4 is not scheduled to hit stores until June 24 , but Apple , AT&T and several other retail outlets started taking pre-orders for the device on June 15 .
Unfortunately , the companies ' systems , and many online buyers were met with timed - out browsers and 404 errors .
Apple subsequently updated its
Web site to say that pre-orders going forward will not ship until July 2 .
The company 's pre-order site now says they will ship by July 14 .
Earlier today , AT&T said its pre-order sales were 10 times higher than pre-orders for the iPhone 3GS last year .
Faced with this " unprecedented demand , " AT&T on Wednesday " in order to fulfill the orders we 've already received . "
Apple 's inventory will determine when AT&T resumes pre-orders , the company said .
There were also reports that people trying to purchase the iPhone 4 accidentally saw the personal information of other iPhone customers .
AT&T said it has " been unable to replicate the issue , but the information displayed did not include call - detail records , social security numbers , or credit card information . "
" In the meantime , we are looking into this matter , " the company concluded .
Radio Shack , which was accepting in - person pre-orders at its stores , also ended the program amidst demand .
Wednesday afternoon , Best Buy said it too had suspended iPhone 4 pre-orders .
Wal - Mart is expected to start selling the iPhone 4 in select stores starting June 24 .

A tiny cylindrical space camera detached itself from Japan 's new solar sail and snapped some photos of the mission bound for Venus and beyond in June 2010 .
Full Story .
A tiny space camera has snapped amazing photos of theworld 's first solar sail spacecraft to voyage into deep space on aninterplanetary mission for Japan .
The solarsail vehicle , named Ikaros , took the opportunity for a self - portrait bydeploying a free - floating cylindrical camera just 2.4 inches ( 6 cm ) in bothwidth and height .
In the photos , the Ikaros sail shines like a gleaming silvership in a sea of black space .
The spring - launched camera snapped the new photos of thesolar sail as the missiondeparts for Venus and beyond .
Ikaros , short for Interplanetary Kite- craft Accelerated byRadiation
Of the Sun , launched in late May and deployed its solar sail in earlyJune to become the first space mission ever propelledonly by sunlight .
The mission was designed and built by the Japan AerospaceExploration Agency ( JAXA ) .
JAXA engineers will monitor the power generated by thin filmsolar cells embedded within the kite - like sail , in hopes that future missionscould combine solar sailing with electricity to power ion propulsion engines .
Like the tale of Icarus , which tells the story of a boy whoflew too close to the sun , the Ikaros solar sail is also expected to exploreour nearest star .
It is headed to the other side of the sun after a detour toVenus , JAXA officials said .
" Through these activities , we will ultimately aim atacquiring navigation technology through the solar sail , " JAXA officialssaid in a statement last Friday .
The solar sail mission piggybacked aboard the main launch ofJapan 's Venusclimate orbiter , called Akatsuki ( " Dawn " in Japanese ) .
Both spacecraft launched alongside four small satellites on May 20 ( early morning local Japan time on May 21 ) from the Tanegashima SpaceCenter on Tanegashima island in Japan .

During confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan , it almost seemed as if the late and legendary Justice Thurgood Marshall was the one being vetted — rather than Kagan , who once clerked for him .
Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee have tried to turn the civil rights icon into ammo for their assault on Kagan , attacking Marshall as a “ judicial activist ” and suggesting that the same could be expected of Kagan .
This was n’t a surprise .
Michael Steele , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , kick - started this bash - Marshall campaign last month by pouncing on Kagan for praising a 1987 Marshall speech in which the ex-justice said the Constitution , “ as originally drafted and conceived , ” was “ defective . ”
Marshall had been referring to the Constitution ’s definition of slaves as three - fifths of “ free persons . ”
But Steele ’s oppo gang at the RNC seized on this and zapped out a memo hammering Kagan : “ Does Kagan Still View Constitution ‘ As Originally Drafted And Conceived ’ As ‘ Defective ’ ? ”
Choosing to go after the country ’s first black Supreme Court justice is an iffy strategy for the GOPers .
But it ’s an especially strange line of attack for Steele — formerly Maryland ’s first black lieutenant governor — who used to laud Marshall as a hero .
For instance , in July 2004 , Steele honored Marshall as a barrier - shattering champion on the 40th anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
Standing in front of a memorial statue of Marshall near the Governor ’s Mansion in Annapolis , Steele declared : “ Without the ’ 64 act , I do not stand in the shadow of this giant . ”
Also in attendance was Arthur Fletcher , one of the original plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education .
As the NAACP ’s chief counsel , Marshall had represented Fletcher in that landmark case , which ended legalized segregation in schools .
During the ceremony , Fletcher told then - Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich , “ Thank you for making that young man [ Steele ] lieutenant governor . ”
In public speeches , Steele has admonished others to follow Marshall ’s example .
After losing the 2006 Senate race in Maryland to Democrat Benjamin Cardin , Steele quoted Marshall in his concession speech : “ And I told [ Cardin ] … do n’t forget the poor .
Do n’t forget those who are trying their best .
But like Thurgood Marshall said , ‘ be the hand or two to help them . ’
So , I hope he is that kind of senator . ”
In 2005 , Steele helped christen the state ’s largest airport “ Baltimore - Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport . ”
A year later , Steele unveiled an exhibit at the airport honoring the judicial work of its namesake .
“ It is particularly significant for our younger Marylanders , who may not be familiar with [ Marshall ’s ] legacy , ” Steele said at the 2006 ceremony .
“ He honored us by his example , and we are proud to honor him in this small way . ”
Steele himself was honored in 2003 for carrying on the Marshall tradition , when he received the Community Leadership Award from the Thurgood Marshall College Fund — where Elena Kagan was once a board member .
( It was formerly known as the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund . )
The mission of the Fund is clear : to honor Marshall ’s “ legacy and commitment to education ” by awarding scholarships to students at historically black colleges .
With this award , the group recognized Steele as one of the “ foremost visionaries who have …impart[ed ] a positive impact on the lives of our next generation of leaders . ”
Does Steele support the GOP ’s ongoing offensive against Marshall ?
The RNC did not respond to a request for comment .
This Republican charge against Marshall is a throwback — with Southern white GOPers , notably Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the senior Republican on the judiciary committee , coming across as if they want to relitigate the civil rights era .
None of these senators have pointed to any decision that Marshall rendered as a justice to bolster their attack .
Instead , they have derided Marshall for being a supposed judicial activist — noting that he once quipped , “ do what you think is right and let the law catch up ” — and then slammed Kagan for admiring him .
This may play well in the deep South , but this strategy could have a cost .
Blasting Kagan as a Marshall fan is highly unlikely to derail her nomination .
Congressional switchboards have not lit up with calls from Americans demanding that the Supreme Court be off - limits to a clerk of one of its most well - known justices .
But this positioning has cast Republicans as hostile toward a civil rights hero .
( Marshall may be the most famous civil rights crusader to hold a top government job . )
For decades , Marshall has not been a controversial figure ; he has been revered .
When Steele became chair of the GOP in early 2009 , he vowed that his party would reach out to minorities .
Trashing Marshall during a nationally televised hearing — as his son sits in the committee room watching — is not going to help Republicans win over many African - Americans .
And by joining in — actually , triggering — the Marshall attack , Steele has demonstrated that he ’s willing to throw even his own hero under the bus for the sake of politics .
Perhaps Steele ought to return that award to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund .
Or maybe the fund ought to ask for it back .
* Correction : the original post had stated the Marshall statue was in Baltimore ; it is in Annapolis .
Not So Nucity
The Big Changeover
Alibi settles in to new ownership
Mordechai Vanunu 's case is as much about suppressing dissent by a supposedly democratic state as it is a demonstration of western double standards .
Had Mordechai Vanunu been , say , an Iranian or a Russian whistle - blower and facing persecution at home , he would have been assured of a prominent place in the western pantheon of heroes .
But he is an Israeli dissident and Israel 's friends in the West have no time for him .
The Morocco - born Mr. Vanunu first hit the headlines more than two decades ago when he revealed details of Israel 's secret nuclear programme to a British newspaper — an offence for which he served a long jail term .
Since then , he has been fighting an almost lone battle against harassment by successive Israeli administrations even though since his release in 2004 he has not said or done anything to harm the country 's security .
Beyond lip - sympathy , the 56 - year - old former technician at Israel 's secret nuclear facility at Dimona has received no support from the western governments , normally so quick to condemn “ persecution ” of dissidents .
The reaction of rights groups has also been uncharacteristically low - key , though individual politicians and rights activists have spoken out in his support from time to time .
His frequent arrests on one pretext or the other are now barely noticed by the media .
Mr. Vanunu has been jailed again — this time for allegedly violating the terms of his parole which forbade him from meeting any foreigner .
The “ foreign ” woman he met is his long - time Norwegian girlfriend .
His relationship with this foreigner is apparently common knowledge in Israel — and if ordinary Israelis know it , surely Israeli 's intelligence establishment too would be aware of it .
“ It is a relationship between a man and a woman .
By chance , she is a Norewegian , ” he said .
While being driven to jail last month , Mr. Vanunu gave vent to his frustration and anger over the world 's indifference to his plight .
Besides shouting abuse against his own government , he said : “ Shame on you democracy , the Knesset , the world media .
Shame on you all the Arabs who are allowing me to be put back in prison .
Shame on you [ U.S. ]
Senate , Congress and the chairman of the International Atomic Energy Agency for not protecting my freedom . ”
Mr. Vanunu 's case is as much about suppressing dissent by a supposedly democratic state as it is a demonstration of western double standards — one standard for allies such as Israel and another for countries that the West does n't like .
The question , his supporters are asking , is : would the western leaders have remained silent if a country other than Israel had treated its dissident in such a way ?
They point to the outcry over Iran 's attempts to put down its dissidents after last year 's controversial presidential election as an evidence of dual standards .
Leading global powers such as China and Russia routinely find themselves at the receiving end of western warnings and threats over their human rights record .
Why , even India gets a rap on the knuckles every now and then over its treatment of the minorities and political dissidents .
The incarceration of Binayak Sen in a Chhattisgarh jail ( 2007 - 2009 ) for his suspected Maoist links became a cause celebre for international rights groups and the campaign for his release was supported by leading British politicians , including MPs .
There has been no comparable pressure on Israel to stop browbeating Mr. Vanunu and calls for him to be given asylum in Britain and Norway have been ignored .
Mr. Vanunu 's story is to be seen in the wider context of the secrecy that has surrounded Israel 's nuclear weapons programme and its western allies ' complicity .
Under a disingenuous policy of “ nuclear ambiguity , ” Israel , which has refused to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , neither confirms nor denies its nuclear capability .
And the West happily accepts this fudge while demanding transparency from other countries ; sometimes at gunpoint , as it were .
Iraq , after all , was bombed out of shape on the basis of nothing more than cooked up “ evidence ” of its nuclear capability , and Iran faces threats of military action every day from the very same countries that prefer to look the other way when the “ n ” word is mentioned in relation to Israel .
Commentators argue that given the international concern over nuclear proliferation , Mr. Vanunu should have been hailed for blowing the lid off Israel 's nuclear arsenal but , let alone acknowledging his effort , there has been no inclination even to offer him moral support as he fights the Israeli state .
Mr. Vanunu 's travails began in 1986 , shortly after he quit his job at the Dimona nuclear plant in the Negev Desert arguing that Israel 's nuclear programme was a threat to peace in the region .
He then left the country .
While visiting Australia , he met a local journalist who arranged for him to give his story to The Sunday Times .
After independently confirming the veracity of his claims , the newspaper flew him to London to help it put the story together — revealing for the first time , complete with photographs and maps , the scale of Israel 's secret nuclear programme and , as one commentator put it , its “ previously unimagined capacity for producing nuclear weapons . ”
In a front - page splash on October 5 , 1986 , titled , “ Revealed — the secrets of Israel 's nuclear arsenal / Atomic technician Mordechai Vanunu reveals secret weapons production , ” the newspaper said Mr. Vanunu 's “ testimony and pictures ” had been “ scrutinised ” by nuclear experts on both sides of the Atlantic and they “ confirm ” that Israel had “ developed the sophisticated and highly classified techniques needed to build up a formidable nuclear arsenal . ”
“ The nuclear scientists consulted by The Sunday Times are convinced by Vanunu 's evidence .
They calculate that at least 100 and as many as 200 nuclear weapons of varying destructive power have been assembled — 10 times the previously estimated strength of Israel 's nuclear arsenal , ” it said adding : “ Israel now ranks as the world 's sixth most powerful nuclear power , after America , the Soviet Union , Britain , France and China — with an arsenal far greater than those of other countries such as India , Pakistan and South Africa , which have also been suspected of developing nuclear weapons . ”
The revelations caused worldwide stir but even before they were published , the Mossad got wind of it and laid a “ honey trap ” luring Mr. Vanunu to Italy .
Once there , he was drugged and taken to Israel where after a secret trial for treason he was jailed for 18 years — 11 in solitary confinement .
He was released under sweeping restrictions that included a ban on leaving Israel , meeting foreigners and speaking to journalists .
Since then , he has been in and out of jail mostly for alleged breaches of his terms of release .
After his latest arrest he told the court : “ I survived 18 years — I could survive another six …
You can not take my freedom of expression away …
You wo n't get from me in three months what you did n't get in 18 years . ”
Mr. Vanunu has always maintained that his motivation in leaking Israel 's nuclear secret was not financial but purely idealistic .
The Sunday Times journalist Peter Hounam , who worked with him on the story and was closely involved in arranging the deal , has confirmed that the newspaper did not pay Mr. Vanunu anything except his expenses .
In his book , The Woman from Mossad : The Torment of Mordechai Vananu , Mr Hounam highlights this fact pointing out that Mr. Vanunu 's lack of interest in financial gain enhanced his credibility as a whistle - blower .
There is a hilarious account of how Mr. Vanunu was seduced by an American woman — who called herself Cindy — he met at Leicester Square in London on September 24 , 1986 .
She claimed she was travelling alone and invited him to accompany her on a holiday to Italy .
Six days later , they were on a flight to Rome with Mr. Vanunu having visions of an exciting Roman holiday .
In the event , on arrival in Rome , “ Cindy ” handed him over to her Mossad minders who took him to Israel .
Notwithstanding Mr. Vanunu 's motives , it is widely acknowledged that he was in breach of Israel 's Official Secrets Act and the Israeli government was justified in taking the action it did .
But having paid for his sins by serving his full jail term and not doing anything unlawful after his release , should he continue to be harassed and intimidated ?
Apparently , Mr. Vanunu is a maverick who never felt at home with Jewish nationalism .
British academic and writer Charles Foster , in his review of Mr. Hounam 's book , says that Mr. Vanunu had a “ big chip on his shoulder : he was a Sephardi Jew and felt he was ‘ patronised by the Ashkenazi hierarchy ' at Dimona .
His colleagues were said to have found him ‘ lonely and inadequate ' . ”
They were also suspicious of what Mr. Foster describes as his “ left - wing politics ” and the fact that he made “ pro-Palestinian speeches at a local university . ”
Nearly quarter - of - a- century after the event , Mr. Vanunu continues to be reviled at home — and pursued by security agencies .
Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko , his budget under pressure in a weak economy , has laid off staff , reduced patrols and even released jail inmates .
But there 's one mission on which he 's spending more than in recent years : pot busts , The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday .
The reason is simple :
If the California lawman steps up his pursuit of marijuana growers , his department is eligible for roughly half a million dollars a year in federal anti-drug funding , helping save some jobs .
The majority of the funding would have to be used to fight pot .
Marijuana may not be the county 's most pressing crime problem , the sheriff says , but " it 's where the money is . "
Washington has long allocated funds to help localities fight crime , influencing their priorities in the process .
Today 's local budget squeezes are enhancing this effect , and the result is particularly striking in California , where many residents take a benign view of pot but federal dollars help keep law - enforcement focused on it .
To make sure his office gets the federal funds , Bosenko since last year has spent about $ 340,000 of his department 's shrinking resources , more than in past years , on a team that tramps through the woods looking for pot farms .
Though the squad is mostly U.S. - funded , the federal grants do n't cover some of its needs , such as a team chief and certain equipment .
So , Bosenko has to pay for those out of his regular budget .
He does n't doubt the value of pursuing pot farming , which he says is often the work of sophisticated Mexican gangs and leads to other crimes like assault .
But other infractions , like drunken driving and robbery , may have a bigger direct impact on local residents than pot growing , he says .
The pot money is " $ 340,000 I could use somewhere else in my organization , " he says .
" That could fund three officers ' salaries and benefits , and we could have them out on our streets doing patrol . "
His overall budget this year is about $ 35 million .
The U.S. Justice Department is spending nearly $ 3.6 billion this year to augment budgets of state and local law enforcement agencies .
In addition , the federal government last year set aside close to $ 4 billion of the economic stimulus package for law enforcement grants for state and local agencies .
The White House also is spending about $ 239 million this year to fund local drug trafficking task forces .
Much of the federal money helps local agencies go after sophisticated criminal gangs and hard drugs like methamphetamine .
Even staunch supporters of legal pot do n't dispute the value of that .

Do sweeteners bring on early birth ?
How fizzy drinks can harm an unborn child
Concern :
The study suggests pregnant women should think about how many fizzy drinks they consume ( picture posed by model )
Mothers - to - be who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners could be at greater risk of having a premature baby .
Research funded by the EU found a correlation between the amount of diet drink consumed and an early birth among the 60,000 women studied .
Many had switched from sugary drinks to those with artificial sweeteners believing they were a healthier option .
But this study suggests that drinks using sweeteners , such as aspartame , carried dangers for the unborn child .
Some British public health experts are now advising expectant mothers to avoid food and drink containing the chemicals .
It is rare for a mother - to - be to give birth before 37 weeks of a normal pregnancy .
But the EU research suggests this low risk was increased by 38 per cent if the woman was drinking , on average , one can of diet drink a day .
Routinely drinking four or more cans a day could increase the risk by as much as 78 per cent .
However , the researchers said in a report in the journal of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition that there was no link associated with sugar - sweetened drinks .
They suggested that exposure to methanol , which is in some artificial sweeteners , may play a part in bringing forward the birth .
Critics of the sweeteners say methanol is a known nerve toxin , which can form formic acid in the body .
It can also lead to formaldehyde , the chemical used to preserve dead bodies .
Historically , saccharine has also been identified as accumulating in the placenta .
Co-author of the study , Dr Thorhallur Ingi Halldorsson , said the research might be ' helpful in identifying sub - groups where intake of these sweeteners should perhaps be avoided or limited ' .
Public health expert Professor Erik Millstone , of the University of Sussex , said : ' I would think it is prudent for pregnant women to diminish consumption of these drinks and possibly those foods containing artificial sweeteners . '
The British Soft Drinks Association said : ' This study merits a cautious reaction .
' Its findings should not be over - stated . '

Senate hopeful Johnson has at least $ 116,000 in BP stock , thousands in 2 other oil stocks
Ron Johnson , a leading Republican challenger for Wisconsin ’s U.S. Senate seat , owns at least $ 116,000 in BP stock plus substantial shares in two other oil companies .
Recently released campaign finance documents show the Oshkosh businessman has between $ 116,000 and $ 315,000 in BP PLC stock .
It was a BP - operated rig that blew up in April , killing 11 people and setting off the massive oil spill that the company is working to control .
ADVERTISEMENT
Johnson also owns $ 50,000 to $ 101,000 in Exxon Mobil Corp. and $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 in Occidental Petroleum Corp. , the documents show .
The exact figures are n’t available because the federal report only requires a candidate to check boxes that list asset values in broad ranges .
Johnson will take on Watertown businessman Dave Westlake in a state primary Sept. 14 .
The winner will face Sen. Russ Feingold , the Democratic incumbent seeking his fourth term , on Nov. 2 .
Johnson , 55 , the owner of a company that makes plastic packaging , has previously criticized the manner in which the government treated BP .
He said the oil company was negligent and should be held accountable , but said the government “ circumvent ( ed ) the rule of law ” in forcing BP to set aside $ 20 billion for Gulf residents and businesses hurt by the spill .
Johnson ’s oil stocks represent only a fraction of his multimillion - dollar portfolio .
His report lists a total of 153 stock and bond holdings that cover a range of industries from pharmaceuticals to consumer electronics to automakers .

The portfolio “ does n’t strike me as excessively tilted ” toward one sector or another , said Mordecai Lee , a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee .
“ He ’s obviously an active investor .
This looks pretty blue chip to me . ”
Feingold ’s disclosure report , filed last month , lists a single asset Ã¢â‚¬â€ a mutual fund valued between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 .
Westlake filed his most recent report in August 2009 .
It lists four assets , each worth between $ 1,000 and $ 15,000 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Since he disposed of 223,288 shares on March 17 , the company ’s share price has fallen by 30 per cent .
About £ 40 billion has been wiped off its total value .
The fall has caused pain not just for BP shareholders , but also for millions of company pension funds and small investors who have money held in tracker funds .

Ladies , get off your butts .
A shocking new study found that even women who hit the gym every day can die young — if they spend too much time on their backsides .
The study , published by the American Cancer Society , says women who sit on their bottoms for more than six hours a day increase their chance of dying by 37 percent over the course of the survey , even if they chain themselves to their treadmills .
For those couch potatoes who did not exercise , their risk of dying was 94 percent higher than those surveyed who spend the least time wearing holes in the sofa .
Sitting , the study says , suppresses hormones that affect triglycerides and cholesterol , which could trigger heart disease .
“ Even if you are active , sitting for long periods of time will impact your health , and you ’ll have a shorter life span , ” said Alpa Patel , the study ’s lead author .
“ Whether a person is sitting at a desk , or sitting on a couch , sitting for long periods of time is harmful . ”
That was discouraging news for ladies whose jobs could be detrimental to their health .
“ It ’s disheartening .
I sit for 10 hours a day at work , ” said Clare Abdalla , 24 , who works at a financial firm in DC and was visiting a friend in the city .
“ And after I get home , after a stressful day , I just want to sit down and relax on the couch . ”
Marva Laidford , 53 , a jeweler who lives in Brooklyn , said she tries to stay active by taking public transportation to work .
“ But it ’s sad because I do n’t have a walk - around job — I basically sit from 8:30 to 5:30 p.m. , ” she said .
Not all women think they ’re doomed because they are parked at their desks all day .
Vita Generalova , 27 , a receptionist at a Midtown consulting firm , said she sits nine hours a day but makes a point to get up and stretch every hour .
“ Even though I have a desk job , I try to stay active .
I take the stairs a lot and try to walk around as much as possible , ” said Generalova , adding that she walks at least two to three hours a day , seven days a week .
But she did say the findings were troubling .
“ If it ’s true , then I have to quit my job , ” she said .
The study tracked the health of nearly 70,000 women without any major health problems for 14 years .
It also examined the fates of 53,000 men , though the risk for them was lower .
For men who sat more than six hours a day , the mortality rate increased by 17 percent .
That number rose to 48 percent for those who do not exercise and spend the most time lounging .
Some thought the survey carried no weight .
“ I think it ’s bogus , ” said Luisa Ceballos , 26 , an insurance agent from Connecticut .
“ If you take care of yourself and you exercise , then you are leading a healthy lifestyle . ”
Take a stand , ladies !
The study followed 123,216 people for 14 years
62 : The average age of participants
37 % of women who sit more than six hours a day had a higher rate of dying
17 % of men were more likely to die
94 % of women who sit the longest were more likely to die
48 % of men who sat longest were more prone to death

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former Vice President Dick Cheney , who has a long history of heart problems , said on Wednesday he has had a new heart pump implanted .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney speaks about national security at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington in this file photo from May 21 , 2009 .
Cheney , 69 , was hospitalized in George Washington Hospital on February 22 , 2010 after experiencing chest pains , according to media reports .
REUTERS / Joshua Roberts / Files
“ A few weeks ago , it became clear that I was entering a new phase of the disease when I began to experience increasing congestive heart failure , ” Cheney , 69 , said in a statement .
“ After a series of recent tests and discussions with my doctors , I decided to take advantage of one of the new technologies available and have a Left Ventricular Assist Device ( LVAD ) implanted , ” he said .
“ The LVAD is a small implantable pump that improves heart function and will enable me to resume an active life . ”
Cheney , who has had five heart attacks , the latest in February , said the surgery went well and he was recuperating .
LVADs helps maintain the pumping ability of a heart that cannot work effectively on its own .
They are usually implanted only in patients with severe heart failure and are nicknamed a “ bridge to transplant ” , according to the American Heart Association .
Congestive heart failure is a chronic condition that develops as the heart loses its ability to pump properly and gradually enlarges .
Cheney previously had a defibrillator implanted to monitor his heart and shock it back into a normal rhythm if abnormal beating occurred .
It was replaced in 2007 because of a low battery .
Studies have shown LVADs reduce the risk of death in end - stage heart failure patients by 50 percent , extending the average life span from 3.1 months to more than 10 months .
Cheney , a Republican , has been a vocal critic of Democratic President Barack Obama ’s policies .

Rich Dad ’s Conspiracy of the Rich : The 8 New Rules of Money
By Robert T. Kiyosaki
Robert Anton Wilson , in his book Everything Is Under Control , reported that “ a random telephone survey of 800 American adults in September 1996 found that 74 percent – virtually three out of four citizens – believe that the U.S. government regularly engages in conspiratorial and clandestine operations . ”
Robert Kiyosaki – the author of Rich Dad ’s Conspiracy of the Rich – agrees with the 74 percent surveyed in 1996 .
As Kiyosaki writes in his book : “ So has there been a conspiracy ?
I believe so , in a way . ”
He goes on to explain why he believes so , citing the lack of financial education in the school systems , the Federal Reserve Act , and Nixon ’s 1971 dismissal of the gold standard .
And most interestingly , Kiyosaki believes that 401 ( k ) retirement vehicles placed the retirement money of average people in the hands of Wall Street .
The first chapter of the book is entitled ‘ Can Obama Save the World ? ’
Kiyosaki ’s answer is no .
And apparently , Obama does n’t want to even if he could .
For he appointed Summers and Geithner , both of who played a part in repealing the Glass Steagall Act .
In other words , it ’s the same old same old .
Nothing has changed .
Which means that the average person needs to understand how taxes , debt , inflation , and retirement affect them .
Kiyosaki sums up the chapter by stating that once one understands the new rules of money , then one can “ opt out of the conspiracy of the rich . ”
From there , Kiyosaki moves on to explain how we got where we are .
He points the finger at the Federal Reserve Bank , which inflates the money supply , which destroys the value of savings and retirement plans .
And he makes it very clear that the rules of money changed dramatically when the U.S. went off the gold standard in 1971 .
For up until that time , “ technically , prior to 1971 , the U.S. dollar was a derivative of gold .
After 1971 , the U.S. dollar became a derivative of debt . ”
Kiyosaki proceeds to discuss what he calls ‘ The Invisible Bank Robbery . ’
He says “ since money is invisible , a derivative of debt , bank robberies by bankers have become invisible . ”
Two ways these invisible robberies occur are : fractional reserve banking , which is nothing more than banks lending money they do n’t have ; and deposit insurance , which “ protects the bankers – not savers . ”
Then he asks a very pertinent question : “ why should an insurance company like AIG receive bailout money in the first place ?
Is n’t bailout money reserved for banks ? ”
His answer is gloriously simple : “ because it owed the biggest banks in the world a lot of money and did n’t have the cash to pay up . ”
After allocating the first half of his book to talking about the conspiracy , Kiyosaki utilizes the second half of the book describing how to fight back .
And although he acknowledges that the Fed is the culprit , he does not advocate abolishing it .
For as he asks , “ What would replace it ?
How much chaos would that cause ?
And how long would that take ? ”
Instead , Kiyosaki advocates using the new rules of money to one ’s advantage .
He lists five new rules at the beginning of the second part of the book .
They are as follows : money is knowledge ; learn how to use debt ; learn to control cash flow ; prepare for bad times and you will only know good times ; and the need for speed .
The latter rule – the need for speed – is an eye - opener .
In other words , it should be read , memorized and implemented by everyone .
In chapter seven , Kiyosaki explains why 90 percent of people are average .
“ They follow average advice . ”
Essentially , they follow “ fairy tales of money . ”
The name of the game , according to Kiyosaki , is “ cash flow . ”
People need to re-position themselves so they are playing the game and not just “ pawns in the game . ”
He provides a great illustration – cell phones .
“ Every time you use your cell phone , cash flows from your wallet to the wallets of the cell phone businesses . ”
To drive his point home , Kiyosaki sets out the attitudes and words of three different types of people , the poor , the middle class , and the rich .
The focus has to be on cash flow , not on capital gains .
And he explains that the cash flow techniques used by most average people do not work well because they are based on capital gains .
In effect , what he is saying is if you ca n’t beat them ( the conspirators ) , then join them .
And he tells you how to do it .
Sophisticated investors – those focusing on cash flow – invest in four basic areas :
Businesses that provide passive cash flow .
Income - producing real estate .
Paper assets – stocks , bonds , savings , annuities , insurance and mutual funds .
Commodities – gold , silver , oil , platinum , etc .
According to Kiyosaki , the secret of success is sell .
“ In simple terms , if you ca n’t sell ‘ tickets ’ ( derivatives of you ) , you have to sell your labor . ”
And in Kiyosaki ’s opinion , the ultimate definition of “ sell ” is building a business and then taking it public .
By selling more than you buy , you can eventually become rich .
Kiyosaki then states that he thinks the present financial crisis will only get worse , not better .
Which mean that investing in businesses , real estate ( using other people ’s money ) , paper assets ( using option strategies ) , and commodities is the only way to take advantage of the situation .
To take advantage , average people must become conversant in the language of finance , according to Kiyosaki .
“ Words have the power to make us rich – or poor . ”
And in his summary to the book , he reminds his readers that “ knowledge is the new money . ”

Use Cases That Will Protect Your Bottom Line
Senior officials acknowledge that powerful constituencies are expected to line up in opposition to cuts of favorite programs  with criticism anticipated from the defense industry , Congress , military headquarters , Pentagon personnel and retirees .
“ We will need to address the reasons things are in the budget in order to be able to reduce overhead , ” Mr. Lynn said .
“ We are going to have to be engaged in dialogue with industry , with Congress , with other agencies , with the White House and inside the Pentagon  all the stakeholders . ”
The new directives are aimed at three distinct areas of spending .
The first is management and personnel , overhead , logistics and base operations , and support missions .
The second is the war - fighting accounts themselves .
Major targets for the next fiscal year already identified by the Pentagon leadership , and supported by the White House , include canceling a program to buy an alternative engine for the F - 35 warplane and ending production of the C - 17 cargo aircraft .
Officials said a range of lower - priority programs would also be under review .
The third area is Mr. Gates ’s own Defense Department staff and agencies .
Pentagon agencies that handle specialized tasks like missile defense and commissaries , as well as Mr. Gates ’s directorates for such matters as personnel and readiness , policy , intelligence and public affairs , will be ordered to reduce costs by trimming personnel and streamlining business practices .
Mr. Gates set a deadline of July 31 for receiving details on programs and personnel to be cut and a description of savings in management practices to be included in the budget proposal for the next fiscal year , 2012 .
Two - thirds of the ordered savings must be an actual money transfer from noncombat accounts to the war - fighting budget , while one - third can be found in efficiencies and eliminating redundancies and overhead .
The specific instructions are included in three unclassified guidance documents signed by Mr. Gates  one to the armed services , one to the Pentagon ’s primary agencies and directorates , and one to the global combatant commands .
It almost sounds too good to be true , but until relatively recently in beer - making history , it was the norm : Before the mid-1700s , barley used for brewing was dried over wood fires , and all beers tasted a little smoky as a result .
Today , we may have the technology for pale , clean - tasting malt , but smoked beers are making a comeback , from Bamberg , Germany 's traditional Rauchbiers to more - creative interpretations by America 's best craft brewers .
These probably are n't beers you 'll want to order by the pint at your local watering hole — they 're a bit intense and bizarre - tasting unless you drink them with food .
The good news is , they 're the best possible accompaniment to smoky , slow - cooked meats like barbecued ribs , cheeses like cheddar or gouda , Chinese food ( especially if it involves sesame oil , black bean sauce , or hoisin ) , Mexican food ( especially carne asada or anything in a mole sauce ) , game meats , burgers , mushrooms ... you get the picture .
Discover how much better these foods are with smoked beer , and you 'll never want to be Rauchbier - less again .
If you 're the kind of person who strays from darker malts , do n't worry :
Not all these beers are as heavy as they may seem .
Brauerei Spezial in Bamberg makes a lightly smoky lager that 's crisp and amber -colored .
It 's very dry and slightly nutty , with an unmistakable bacon note in the finish .
Because it 's not so intense , this beer is the ideal partner for meats like ham , kielbasa , barbecued chicken , or pork chops .
While you 're checking out smoked beers , you should n't miss the Aecht Schlenkerla classics from Brauerei Heller - Trum , also in Bamberg .
Both the ruby - colored Märzen and the bigger - bodied Urbock are rich and smoky , slightly spicy and toasty .
You 'll get more caramel flavor in the Märzen and more tobacco in the Urbock .
But my favorite might be the darkest ( and most local ) of the smoked beers I 've had recently .
Captain Lawrence Brewing Company in upstate New York makes a delicious smoked porter that smells a bit like a coffee milkshake with candied bacon in it ( hey , that 's not a bad idea ! ) .
It 's creamy and understated with roasty chocolate notes that make grilled steak or lamb chops taste even richer .
You could braise a bunch of short ribs in it ( and serve the extra on the side ) , or amplify the awesomeness of your best pot of chili .
Not that your cooking needs any help .

To many , 21 December 2012 may be no more than another day in the lead up to Christmas .
A day to make sure the last of the Christmas shopping is done , the turkey bought and the tree decorated .
To others , 21 December 2012 will mark the possible end to civilization as we know it .
Popularised by the disaster epic 2012 , there is a phenomenon sweeping the globe that suggests the end of a 5125 year long cycle in the Mayan calendar on 21 December will also bring about the end of the world .
Now , it seems , our own Prime Minister Julia Gillard may be among the believers .
In a video recorded for Triple J , the PM tells concerned viewers that yes , the world is indeed about to end .
“ My dear remaining fellow Australians the end of the world is coming , ” Ms Gillard said .
“ It turns out the Mayan calendar was true . ”
Just what exactly will cause the end of the world is still under debate on the internet .
Proposed theories include a collision with a planet called ‘ Nibiru ’ , giant solar storms or the reversal of the Earth ’s rotational pull .
In her video message Ms Gillard suggests some further options .
“ Whether the final blow comes from flesh eating zombies , demonic hell beasts … good luck to you all , ” she says .
Although obviously a tongue - in - cheek message to her countrymen , there are many who are genuinely concerned about the imminent apocalypse .
So seriously are these doomsday predictions being taken that NASA ( National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) scientists have hosted a Q&A on their website in an attempt to debunk the myths .
Titled “ Beyond 2012 : Why the World Wo n’t End ” the statement seeks to reassure readers that 21 December wo n’t be the end of the world as we know it .
“ Our planet has been getting along just fine for more than 4 billion years , and credible scientists worldwide know of no threat associated with 2012 , ” NASA says .
“ There are no planetary alignments in the next few decades and even if these alignments were to occur , their effects on the Earth would be negligible . ”
NASA also says there is no planet called Nibiru or Planet X that is approaching earth , and if there were such a planet “ it would be visible by now to the naked eye ” .
NASA have also produced a YouTube video with David Morrison , NASA Space Scientist , confirming “ there is no threat to Earth in 2012 ” .
Come 21 December we ’ll know once and for all who predicted correctly : the Prime Minister or NASA .
What Sony Pictures Home Entertainment thinks the end of the world would look like for Sydney :
For the reaction to Ms Gillard ’s video read Gillard ’s spoof apocalypse video meets with mixed response .
How dare you accuse me of being a stumblebum of a spy ?
That 's essentially the indignant reaction of Sturbridge , Mass .
selectman Tom Creamer to fellow board member Scott Garieri 's allegation that Creamer intentionally sent him a spyware - laden e-mail .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Here 's the setup from a story in the Worcester ( Mass . )
Telegram & Gazette :
On June 21 , Mr. Garieri said at a selectmen 's meeting his " IT guy " ( which , he said , this week is the same person who hooked up his printer ) picked up spyware attached to e-mails sent by Mr. Creamer .
Given Mr. Creamer 's " prior employment history " of making others ' " personal information available , " Mr. Garieri said , he felt it necessary to block all of Mr. Creamer 's incoming e-mails .
The story describes Creamer as having been " a consultant " to the U.S. Department of Justice , but for purposes of this post we will leap to the entirely unsupported assumption that he was ( if not still is ) a full - blown government spook .
Because not only does Creamer categorically deny sending any spyware , he contends that the mere fact Garieri's " IT guy " suspects him of doing so is proof he did not because -- are you following me here ? -- if he had he would have left no fingerprints ; he 's that good .
More from the Telegram & Gazette :
" Based on ( my ) prior background in intelligence , believe me , if I had something attached to ( the e-mail ) , your people would never find it , so let 's not be ridiculous , " Mr. Creamer responded that night .
" That 's such an insult to me . "
Now how 's that for an air - tight defense ?
Both men are taking a beating in the comments section at the end of the story , mostly for not having enough sense to keep this kind of spat out of the public eye .

Latest " Green " Packing Material ?
Mushrooms !
Packing foam now entering the marketplace is engineered from mushrooms and agricultural waste
EcoCradle™ packaging material is composed of agricultural byproducts bound by fungal roots .
July 26 , 2010
View a time - lapse video of mushroom roots growing in a pre-designed mold .
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
A new packing material that grows itself is now appearing in shipped products across the country .
The composite of inedible agricultural waste and mushroom roots is called Mycobond™ , and its manufacture requires just one eighth the energy and one tenth the carbon dioxide of traditional foam packing material .
And unlike most foam substitutes , when no longer useful , it makes great compost in the garden .
The technology was the brainchild of two former Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute undergraduates , Gavin McIntyre and Eben Bayer , who founded Ecovative Design of Green Island , N.Y. , to bring their idea into production .
" We do n't manufacture materials , we grow them , " says McIntyre .
" We 're converting agricultural byproducts into a higher - value product . "
Because the feedstock is based on renewable resources , he adds , the material has an economic benefit as well : it is not prone to the price fluctuations common to synthetic materials derived from such sources as petroleum .
" All of our raw materials are inherently renewable and they are literally waste streams , " says McIntyre .
" It 's an open system based on biological materials . "
With support from NSF , McIntyre and Bayer are developing a new , less energy - intensive method to sterilize their agricultural - waste starter material - - a necessary step for enabling the mushroom fibers , called mycelia , to grow .
McIntyre and Bayer are replacing a steam - heat process with a treatment made from cinnamon - bark oil , thyme oil , oregano oil and lemongrass oil .
The sterilization process , which kills any spores that could compete with Ecovative 's mushrooms , is almost as effective as the autoclaving process used to disinfect medical instruments and will allow the Mycobond™ products to grow in the open air , instead of their current clean - room environment .
" The biological disinfection process simply emulates nature , " says McIntyre , " in that it uses compounds that plants have evolved over centuries to inhibit microbial growth .
The unintended result is that our production floor smells like a pizza shop . "
Much of the manufacturing process is nearly energy - free , with the mycelia growing around and digesting agricultural starter material -- such as cotton seed or wood fiber -- in an environment that is both room - temperature and dark .
Because the growth occurs within a molded plastic structure ( which the producers customize for each application ) , no energy is required for shaping the products .
Once fully formed , each piece is heat - treated to stop the growth process and delivered to the customer -- though with the new , easier , disinfection treatment , Bayer and McIntyre are hoping the entire process can be packaged as a kit , allowing shipping facilities , and even homeowners , to grow their own Mycobond™ materials .
Based on a preliminary assessment McIntyre and Bayer conducted under their Phase I NSF SBIR award , the improvements to the sterilization phase will reduce the energy of the entire manufacturing process to one fortieth of that required to create polymer foam .
" This project is compelling because it uses innovative technology to further improve Ecovative 's value , while also providing the environmental benefits that NSF is looking for , " said Ben Schrag , the NSF program officer who oversees Ecovative 's Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) award .
" The traction that they have gotten with their early customers demonstrates how companies can build strong businesses around products whose primary competitive advantage lies in their sustainability . "
In addition to the packaging product , called EcoCradle™ , Ecovative has developed a home insulation product dubbed greensulate™ .
Comparable in effectiveness to foam insulation , it is also highly flame retardant .
Ecovative is already producing custom protective packaging products for several Fortune 500 companies , though they are leveraging the new disinfection process to produce turnkey systems that they plan to deploy to off - site customers and do - it - yourself homeowners by 2013 .
In addition to NSF , Evocative has received support from the USDA Agricultural Research Service , the Environmental Protection Agency , and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority .

It 's all about the combined - arms .
When fighting in modern warfare , I like to build carrier / transport battlegroups .
My battlegroups look something like this :
1 - carrier fully loaded with 3 fighters
1 - transport , fully loaded with 4 marines
2 - destroyers for added anti-air defense and spotting enemy subs
2 or more battleships , one with Combat promotions , the other with barrage
I like to give the carrier and transport marching promotion for an additional movement point ( to match the battleships ) .
And I give one destroyer a medic promotion for obvious reasons .
I end up with 6 or more such battlegroups when playing on Prince difficulty .
I own the seas .
The AI navies huddle in their ports .
One or two of these self - contained battlegroups make short work of capturing almost any coastal city when playing against the AI .

A short production of news clips detailing George W. Bush 's 9/11 inaction , including his post - attack foot dragging on establishing an independent investigation into the worst attack ever on United States soil .
Bush was clearly negligent in his duty on 9/11 , not only as President , but also as our Commander in Chief .
His inaction alone is reason enough to re-open the 9/11 investigation .
Throw in the fact that Donald Rumsfeld was not at his post directing a defense for this country , and that Dick Cheney tracked the Pentagon attack " vehicle " from over 50 miles out and still did not shoot the object down , and you have negligence and dereliction of duty at the highest levels of the U.S. government .
Do n't just ask for a new investigation .
Ask for a real 9/11 investigation .
– GOP Project :
Make the economy worse for as many as possible – hence the filibustering of unemployment benefits – stoke popular anger that will sweep GOP back into power , so long as nobody notices GOP is creating the misery they look to capitalize on . –
By : William Rivers Pitt , t r u t h o u t | Op - Ed
It is tempting to begin a sentence about today ’s Republican Party with the words , “ Just when you thought they could n’t get any dumber , ” but then you realize you ’re talking about a group that actively thwarts benefits for the unemployed while pimping tax cuts for rich people , a group that champions a political base which by and large does n’t believe dinosaurs existed because they ’re not in the Bible but ca n’t stand the thought of stem cell research making people whole again , who attack the ideas and policies of the majority with vehemence but absolutely refuse to offer any of their own , and you come to the realization that you ca n’t begin a sentence with those words , because there really is no bottom to this particular barrel .
This particular breed of dumb is a lot like the oil in the Gulf of Mexico ; it broadens and spreads and grows by the day , and will continue to do so until someone finally goes in and cleans it up once and for all .
This week ’s barrage of dumb started early – on Saturday morning , in fact – and hit the ground running .
The Washington Post reported that congressional Republicans and their advisors are attempting to devise a game plan for the remaining four months before the midterm elections .
Their efforts thus far have been spent making the economy worse for as many people as possible – hence the filibustering of unemployment benefits – so as to stoke popular anger that they hope will sweep them back into power , so long as nobody notices they are the ones creating the misery they look to capitalize on , of course .
The election plan ?
Simplicity itself :
Some of the party ’s most influential political consultants are quietly counseling their clients to stay on the offensive for the November midterm elections and steer clear of taking stands on substance that might give Democratic opponents material for a counterattack .
“ The smart political approach would be to make the election about the Democrats , ” said Neil Newhouse of the powerhouse Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies , which is advising more than 50 House and Senate candidates .
“ In terms of our individual campaigns , I do n’t think it does a great deal of good ” to engage in a debate over the Republicans ’ own agenda .
It ’s not that Boehner ( Ohio ) is arguing for a cease - fire .
The debate among Republicans comes down to this :
The speaker - in - waiting , for all his love of political combat , thinks that voters will not trust GOP candidates if their attacks do n’t also provide at least some substance .
The consultants argue that public anger , if properly stoked , alone can carry the party over the finish line .
In their view , getting bogged down in the issues is a distraction and even a potential liability .
So instead of any sort of high - minded debate on the signal issues of the day – Afghanistan , Iraq , energy policy , the Gulf , the economy , the banks , the mortgage crisis , the environment – we will be subjected to four stupid months of name - calling , obstructionism and general nonsense , again .
The American people have historically been suckers for this kind of game , but with everything going on these days , one has to wonder if four months of goop from the GOP might wind up backfiring tremendously with the populace .
As for the dumb , it only got stronger as the weekend came to an end .
The Tea Party , which was recently exposed by Gallup as having a different name ( “ the GOP base ” ) , began eating itself with large , healthy chomps .
Sarah Palin , the once and future queen of the ‘ Baggers , invented a new word – “ refudiate ” – and then proceeded to compare herself to Shakespeare , proving once and for all that intelligence has no bearing on becoming famous .
At about the same time , the Tea Party Federation threw out founder Mark Williams and his Tea Party Express for blogging about how spiffy slavery was for Black people in America .
I suppose you have to give credit to the Tea Party for finally drawing a line in the sand about how much racism is too much , but with “ Yup , I ’m A Racist ” t- shirts still being sold at Tea Party rallies , claims that the Tea Party is n’t fundamentally racist because they dumped Williams are still going to be a hard sell .
The self - immolation did n’t stop there .
It seems a number of prominent Republicans are now vocally criticizing and ridiculing the Tea Party for being disorganized neophytes who do more harm than good to the GOP .
Names like Trent Lott , Bob Bennett , Lindsey Graham and Bob Inglis are on the list of people who think this particular political phenomenon is a lot of noise with no substance .
Graham was particularly venomous with his comments , stating in the New York Times that , “ The problem with the Tea Party , I think it ’s just unsustainable because they can never come up with a coherent vision for governing the country .
It will die out . ”
Ouch …and yes , the Tea Party in whole and in part rose up righteous to attack Graham , Lott and the rest of their critics , further scrambling the GOP ’s political eggs on the eve of the midterm push .

But wait , it gets better .
A lot better .
Why ?
Because there ’s a lot of high - level conversation in the GOP ranks about championing the presidency of George W. Bush as a reason to vote Republican in November .
No , really , it ’s true .
Again from the Post :
The chairmen of the two Republican campaign committees defended the presidency of George W. Bush in television appearances over the weekend , a preview of the GOP ’s planned pushback against expected Democratic attacks on the last president .
John Cornyn , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , told C - SPAN ’s “ Newsmakers ” program that “ Bush ’s stock has gone up a lot since he left office , ” adding : “ I think a lot of people are looking back with more fondness on President Bush ’s administration , and I think history will treat him well . ”
The rhetoric from Cornyn and Sessions reflects a gamble by Republicans that Bush , who left office in 2008 deeply unpopular with broad swaths of the American public , will , as almost every president does , rebound in terms of his public image as time passes .
To date , that softening in public opinion has yet to occur .
In April , a CBS / New York Times poll showed just over one - quarter of the public ( 27 percent ) saw Bush in a favorable light while 58 percent viewed him unfavorably .
In a June NBC / Wall Street Journal survey , 50 percent said they felt negatively about Bush while 29 percent had positive views .
( The percentage of people feeling “ very ” negative — 31 percent outstripped all of those feeling positive . )
And , polling suggests that Bush is still broadly blamed for the current state of the economy , which almost certainly will be the top - of - the - mind voting issue this fall .
Fifty nine percent of respondents from a Post / ABC News poll in April said Bush was more to blame for the current state of the economy while 25 percent put the blame on President Obama .
What to say of this particular gambit ?
Oh yeah , I remember .
Bring it on .
複雑な社会になればなるほど、私たちの生活は、乱れやすくなります。
昼夜を問わず営業しているお店や社会大都会。
そんな中でひそかに進行しているのがEDです。
EDとは、「 Erectile Dysfunction 」 の略で、日本語で 「 勃起障害」あるいは「勃起不全」と訳されます。
そのために、男性であることの自信をなくしたり、また、安心して女性とセックスができなくなってしまう男性もいます。
これらに対して、ED治療薬は、勃起能力を高め男性機能を改善･回復させる役割を果たします。
バイアグラ、レビトラ、シアリスなどがあります。
それでは、ED治療薬はどのように、勃起能力を高めるのでしょうか？まず、勃起のメカニズムを理解しましょう。
勃起のメカニズムで大切なことは、ペニスには、筋肉はないということです。
その代わり、肛門周辺にあるPC筋とBC筋が関係します。
まず、男性は性的興奮を覚えると、BC筋といわれる筋肉が、勢いよくペニスに血液を送り込みます。
そして、すぐにPC筋がそれに栓をして持続力を持たせます。
ペニスの血が流れ込むところを海綿体といいます。
ペニスの勃起力は海綿体が血液でパンパンに満たされた状態だったのです。
ところが、EDになると、何らかの原因で、血流の流れが悪くなり、つまって血流がペニスに流れにくくなってしまいます。
そのために勃起力が低下したり、勃起ができない状態になるのです。
そこで、男性機能を改善するためには血管を拡張させて、血流を流れやすくすればよく、それをするのが治療薬の役目です。
したがって、どの治療薬も、血管を拡張させて、全体の血の巡り良くすると同時に、海綿体に血液を送りやすくすることが目的ですので、一般の血の巡りがよくなる薬と同じです。
実際にバイアグラは、血管拡張の薬を開発中に副作用として勃起という作用があることから偶然発見されました。
つまり、脳に働きかけるわけではないので性欲でおかしくなったり、中毒になることはありません。
脳で感じた後の血流に関係するために、治療薬を飲んでも、性欲が刺激されなければいつもどおりです。
一方で、血管に取り込まれる必要があるために、どの治療薬も、食事の影響を受けます。
なぜなら、食事後は胃や腸壁に油膜が張ってしまい、治療薬の有効成分が血管中に吸収されにくくなるからです。
そのために、これらの治療薬は空腹時に服用する必要があります。
もし、食事の後に飲むような場合も、腹八分目にして油の吸収量をしっかりと抑える必要があります。
* Gulf currents may carry BP oil to the island
* Venezuela has sent spill - fighting experts to Cuba
HAVANA , June 15 ( Reuters ) - Cuba is making preparations to protect its coast as the BP BP.
LBP.N oil spill continues spreading through the Gulf of Mexico , Cuban officials said on Tuesday .
They offered few specifics about the preparations , but said Venezuela , Cuba ’s oil - rich ally , has sent a team of spill - fighting experts to help the communist - run island .
Millions of gallons of oil have gushed into the gulf in the 57 - day - old spill and fouled 120 miles ( 190 km ) of U.S. coastline .
Patches of oil reportedly have been seen as close as 100 miles ( 160 km ) northwest of Cuba and some forecasts have said gulf currents will inevitably carry the oil to Cuba , which is 90 miles ( 145 km ) south of Key West , Florida .
International scientists say Cuba ’s waters and coastline are relatively pristine because of the lack of development common in many other countries .
Its northwest coast is a feeding and breeding ground for many species , including migratory sea turtles , sharks and manatees in danger of extinction .
“ We are preparing to do everything we can , and of course to receive the help of those who have experience in confronting ( oil spills ) , ” Vice Minister of Defense Gen. Ramon Espinosa told reporters at a conference on disaster preparedness .
He said Cuba has suffered small spills from oil tankers , but nothing of the magnitude of the BP spill .
Cuba does not have any offshore oil production , but Spanish oil giant Repsol YPF REP .
MC has contracted for a rig to drill exploration wells off of Cuba 's coast later this year or early in 2011 .
Cuba ’s Civil Defense director , Gen. Ramon Pardo Guerra , speaking at the same conference , said authorities were keeping a close eye on the spill and preparing the coastal population for its arrival .
He did not say what Venezuela had provided for Cuba , but said the South American country has long experience in dealing with oil .
“ They are specialists who have produced oil for 100 years , ” Pardo said .
U.S. officials say they met with Cuban authorities in May to discuss the spill and are providing them regular information about its direction .
But Cuba ’s Deputy Foreign Minister Dagoberto Rodriguez told a visiting delegation of Texas legislators recently that no talks had been held .
Despite 50 years of hostilities between Washington and Havana , he said Cuba was ready to cooperate with its longtime foe in the fight against the spill , said former U.S. diplomat Wayne Smith , who led the delegation to the island .

Yesterday , Fab 5 Freddy revealed on his Twitter that art - rap pioneer Rammellzee had died .
Today , Stuart Argabright , Rammellzee 's collaborator in Death Comet Crew , confirms that sad news .
He was 50 years old .
A legendary graffitti artist , fashion designer , and rapper , Rammellzee remains best known for " Beat Bop " , his 1983 single with K - Rob , which was produced by famed artist Jean - Michel Basquiat .
But his long , varied career encompassed much , much more than that .
" Beat Bop " was probably the furthest - out piece of work the genre had produced at the time , a 10 - minute odyssey featuring Rammell rapping impenetrable silliness ( " RPMs , my noooose do n't care about the rhythm that breaks " ) over spaced - out bass pings and discordant violin scratches .
Throughout , Rammell rapped in an exaggerated nasal honk , a style that the likes of the Beastie Boys ' Ad - Rock and Cypress Hill 's B - Real later used to became hugely popular .
Vinyl copies of the " Beat Bop " single eventually sold for thousands .
Rammell also collaborated with producer Bill Laswell , and Death Comet Crew released an album on the noise - rock label Troubleman Unlimited in 2004 .
Beyond rap , Rammell was also famous as a visual artist and as a notoriously elusive , mind - bogglingly odd raconteur .
Many consider him one of the pioneers of graffiti art .
He appeared in the 1982 cult - favorite film Wild Style wearing a black trench coat and toting a shotgun onstage .
His work , done in a style he called " gothic futurism " , has appeared in galleries and museums worldwide .
Director Jim Jarmusch , who cast Rammell in his 1984 film Stranger Than Paradise , once called Rammell " the kind of guy you could talk to for twenty minutes and your whole life could change , if you could only understand him . "
Dave Tompkins ' phantasmagorical new vocoder history book How to Wreck a Nice Beach ends with a chapter of Rammell dropping impenetrable science .
The man was a mysterious freak of the highest order , and you can see some YouTubed evidence of his truly singular life below ( all via Tumblin ' Erb ) :

" We 're doing it as quickly as possible , " he said .
A similar problem doomed the effort to put a bigger containment device over the blown - out well in May .
BP had to abandon the four - story box after the crystals called hydrates clogged it , threatening to make it float away .
The smaller cap , which had worked fine until now , had been in place since early June and was sucking oil up to a ship on the surface .
To get it there , though , crews had to slice away a section of the leaking pipe , meaning the flow of oil could be stronger now than before .
Before the problem with the cap , it had collected about 700,000 gallons of oil in 24 hours .
Another 438,000 gallons was burned on the surface by a different system that was not affected .
Anywhere from 67 million to 127 million gallons has spilled since the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers and blew out the well 5,000 feet underwater .
BP was leasing the rig from owner Transocean .
The Obama administration plotted its next steps Wednesday after U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans overturned a moratorium on new drilling , saying the government simply assumed that because one rig exploded , the others pose an imminent danger , too .
Feldman , a 1983 appointee of President Ronald Reagan , has reported extensive investments in the oil and gas industry , including owning less than $ 15,000 of Transocean stock , according to financial disclosure reports for 2008 , the most recent available .
He did not return calls for comment on his investments .
The White House promised an immediate appeal of his ruling .
The Interior Department imposed the moratorium last month in the wake of the BP disaster , halting approval of any new permits for deepwater projects and suspending drilling on 33 exploratory wells .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement that within the next few days he would issue a new order imposing a moratorium that eliminates any doubt it is needed and appropriate .
" It 's important that we do n't move forward with new drilling until we know it can be done in a safe way , " he told a Senate subcommittee Wednesday .
Several companies , including Shell and Marathon Oil , said they would await the outcome of any appeals before they start drilling again .
Asked about it Wednesday on NBC's " Today " show , BP managing director Bob Dudley said his company will " step back " from the issue while it investigates the rig explosion .
BP said Wednesday that Dudley has been appointed to head the new Gulf Coast Restoration Organization , which is in charge of cleaning up the spill .
He takes over from BP CEO Tony Hayward , who has been widely criticized for his handling of the crisis .
In Florida , thick pools of oil washed up along miles of national park and Pensacola Beach shoreline as health advisories against swimming and fishing in the once - pristine waters were extended for 33 miles east from the Alabama / Florida border .
" It 's pretty ugly , there 's no question about it , " said Gov. Charlie Crist , who toured Pensacola on Wednesday morning .
The oil had a chemical stench as it baked in the afternoon heat .
The beach looked as if it had been paved with a 6 - foot - wide ribbon of asphalt , much different from the tar balls that washed up two weeks earlier .
" This used to be a place where you could come and forget about all your cares in the world , " said Nancy Berry , who fought back tears as she watched her two grandsons play in the sand far from the shore line .
Beijing has loudly rejected the label of world 's top energy consumer applied yesterday by the IEA .
By next year , however , there wo n't be any question .
Check out this map of oil demand growth from the IEA .
As for why China is downplaying its energy consumption , consider the coming supply crisis .
No wonder China is buying up major oil projects around the world -->
If there 's any space left between micro - genres like witch house / drag , hauntology , hypnagogic pop/ chillwave , and drone - step , Matthew Barnes has found it .
Forest Swords , the UK producer 's one - man project , conjures many ideas associated with those tags -- faded memories , ghostly auras , dream states .
His music sometimes feels built from allusions and reference points , but the connections to sources are so elusive that Dagger Paths sounds singular first and evocative of something else second .
For me , that " something else " is often another artist who has snuck into a stylistic crevice , Mark Nelson , the Labradford member who works solo as Pan American .
Like Nelson , Barnes is adept at picking simple rhythms and sounds , repeating them at a pace both languid and insistent , and folding in texture and volume until each piece becomes sneakily dense .
Both also prefer wiry , reverb - heavy guitars , which charge their songs like lightning inside a cloud .
But where Pan American can sometimes softly float away , Forest Swords is rarely hazy or indistinct .
Most of Barnes ' sounds are clear -- take opener " Miarches " whose echoes are big and bold , less like drifting fog than brisk wind .
That boldness comes partially from Barnes ' interest in techno , hip - hop , and R&B .
Those influences give him a strong sense of beat and a knack for forceful bass lines .
The R&B strain in particular lurks in the background of everything here -- but in case you miss it among the reflecting guitars and rumbling beats , Barnes makes it explicit in an abstract take on Aaliyah 's " If Your Girl Only Knew " .
Prioritizing bass over beat , letting every sound decay and dissolve , Barnes crafts a dying echo of the original , as if he hoped to erase it from his memory * Eternal Sunshine - * style .
What sticks in my mind after listening to Dagger Paths is its visual nature .
When I get wrapped up in one of Barnes ' tracks , I picture shadowy figures , found filmstrips , or TV movies fuzzed by tape wear .
Barnes ' videos are actually clearer and simpler than that ( though " The Light " is almost exactly what I imagined ) , but they all use old footage to reflect the music 's sense of dislocation .
But it would be wrong to peg Barnes to one set of images or sounds -- my guess is he can do a lot more , and his new single , " Rattling Cage " , has a dubby , Sun Araw vibe .
As long as he keeps making music this blurrily evocative and vividly pictorial , any direction he takes will be the right one .
The Size and Scale of the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Posted by Steven Goodheart on July 6 , 2010 · 1 Comment
Day after day , night after night , the oil from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil well boils out into the Gulf :
Click HERE to see the oil discharge live .
The speed and volume of the outflow is truly incredible .
Largely due to BP ’s unwillingness to share data with outside experts , it ’s very hard to determine just how much total oil has escaped or what the flow rates are for the escaping oil .
See : Uncertainty Abounds as the Gulf Leak Meter Ticks Higher
As of this writing , the most conservative estimates , offered by BP , are that at least 35,000 barrels , or 1,470,000 gallons , of oil are pouring into the Gulf of Mexico every day .
Scientists not working for BP say that the actual outflow could be much more than this — 1.9 to 2.5 to 4.2 million gallons a day .
Click this image ( above ) to see live readouts of oil discharge rates and total discharge estimates .
This means every hour , even by the most conservative estimates , at least 61,250 gallons of toxic oil are pouring out of the BP drill site .
It ’s very hard to wrap one ’s head around such a figure .
In less than an hour , you could fill up the gas tank of 4,000 mid-sized cars .
That ’s 96,000 cars in a day — day after day after day .
With the earliest possibility of stopping , or at least slowing down , the discharge now projected to be in August ( assuming no major hurricane strike the Gulf ) , there ’s no doubt that this will be the Gulf ’s greatest man-made environmental disaster :
See : BP spill nears a somber record as Gulf ’s biggest
Depending on the oil - flow rates , the total amount of oil released and polluting the Gulf is anywhere from 114,000,000 to 195 , 000,000 gallons ( and counting ) of oil .
CNN has a terrific interactive multimedia page that allows you to change discharge rates in order to see the range of volumes involved :
Click HERE to see CNN ’s interactive information on the spill .
A site that really “ brings home ” the scale of the spill is the If It Was My Home website .
They have an interactive page called “ Visualizing the BP Oil Spill Disaster . ”
When you go to this link ( click HERE ) the page determines your location and then does an overlay of your area showing you the extent of the spill in terms of geography you know .
You can also put in any location you want to compare the spill size .
Here are a few screen shots of the kind of maps you ’ll see :
UPDATE : The New York Times has just added this very helpful interactive map , showing the oil ’s surface movement through July 5 , 2010 :
Tracking the Oil Spill in the Gulf
The Environmental Price of the BP Deepwater Horizon Catastrophe
The tragic human impact of the spill is continuing to unfold , but the the full scope of the environmental impact is almost impossible to measure .
When you look at the extent of the oil spill in images above , remember two things : ( 1 ) These overlays only show the extent of the oil spill on the surface , not the enormous underwater oil plumes , and ( 2 ) this vast area is actually the home of countless creatures , great and small .
The dead bodies that make it to shore or can be found on the surface will indicate only the smallest faction of the precious lives lost out at sea , which no one will ever see or know about .
To date , according to CNN ’s interactive site , more than 1,600 dead animals have been found by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
But again , this tells us nothing about the countless numbers of animals who have died hundreds of miles out at sea , whose bodies have sunk into the depths
Particularly at risk are Green Sea Turtles and the endangered Kemp ’s ridley turtle .
Tragically , thousands of hatchlings of this beautiful sea turtle are swimming right into the heart of the spill area .
Because their instinct is to seek shelter and food among the floating sea vegetation , they head straight for thick clots of oil and oil - soaked seaweed .
Instead of finding security and food , they are poisoned , trapped and asphyxiated .
And if that were n’t tragic enough , it turns out that shrimp boats hired by BP to corral floating oil with booms and set it on fire have been burning hundreds if not thousands of the young turtles alive .
It is enough to make you weep .
At this point , it ’s tempting to show some of the horrific images of the birds and animals dying terrible deaths by the oil , but after the initial shock wears off , I think such images only tend to numb us .
However , if you need to offer evidence of the kind of devastation that ’s taking place right now , day after day , then links like this can be helpful :
Caught in the Oil – The Big Picture ( WARNING – this Boston Globe web page has very disturbing images of Gulf animals trapped in the oil .
Not everyone needs to look at such images of suffering ; take care of your hearts . )
Being informed , however , is critical , if we are to make intelligent decisions as citizens and to be able to “ speak the truth to power . ”
I hope this blog adds to your store of useful knowledge and inspires you to action .
If any good at all comes out of this disaster , maybe it will be a heightened awareness of the fragility of our planet , of the inter - connectedness of all life , and of our need to be much , much more responsible with our use of natural resources .
We can not put our future , or the future of our ecosystems , in the hands of Big Oil and multinationals whose only goals are to make profit , regardless of the cost to humans and the environment .
This blog has talked about this again and again :
We ’re Killing Our Oceans
Global Warming and the Loss of Earth ’s Coral Reefs
The Moral Math of Climate Change
The BP Gulf Oil Disaster - Send in the Microbes !
We have to keep in mind what ’s at stake when we use Earth ’s natural resources .
And as a species , we have to have a profound change of consciousness ( and heart ! ) in terms of how we related to the natural world , and each other .
If we do not radically change , we really will destroy ourselves and much of the life on Earth .
To conclude , here are just a few of the beautiful creatures who are “ at risk ” because of the BP Gulf Oil Spill .
I hope these images of healthy animals inspire folks to do whatever they can , wherever they live , to preserve and protect our precious wild heritage .
Nature is not “ out there . ”
We are nature , and nature is us , and if we destroy nature , we destroy ourselves .
What you can do :
One of the most disturbing aspects of this catastrophe has been the degree to which BP has kept important data and information from scientists and the press .
In the name of “ safety , ” journalists and photographers are often being kept from doing the investigative reporting that is essential for an informed public .
Incidents like the following are not uncommon :

International users World Cup build - up video highlights here South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has dropped West Ham striker Benni McCarthy from his final 23 - man squad for this summer 's World Cup .
The 32 - year - old , who is his country 's record goalscorer , has struggled with his fitness and come in for criticism at home for being overweight .
McCarthy was one of five players cut from Parreira 's provisional squad .
Premier League midfield duo Steven Pienaar of Everton and Fulham 's Kagiso Dikgacoi were both selected .
Portsmouth defender Aaron Makoena - who became the first South African to reach 100 caps in the 5 - 0 friendly win over Guatemala on Monday - was also picked by the World Cup hosts , who open the tournament at Soccer City against Mexico in a Group A clash on 11 June .
Other surprise omissions from the squad were goalkeeper Rowen Fernandez , who plays for German side Arminia Bielefeld , and defender Bryce Moon , who plys his trade in Greece with PAOK .
606 : DEBATE
Moon was seen as the likeliest player to deputise at right - back behind Siboniso Gaxa but the slot went to Anele Ngcongca , who is also able to operate in midfield .
Uncapped Maritzburg United goalkeeper Shuaib Walters was selected ahead of Fernandez .
Left - back Innocent Mdledle and left - side midfielder Franklin Cale were the other two players left out of the final squad .
Midfielder Andile Jali , who was originally part of the provisional squad , was diagnosed with a mild heart condition that ruled him out of selection on 23 May .
" I am not going to talk about individuals who did not make the final squad .
We applied five principles when making our choices , " Parreira told a news conference .
" This is not the end of the road for the five footballers whose dreams I have cut short .
There will be other opportunities to play for the national team . "
McCarthy has scored a record 31 goals in 79 caps for South Africa and represented the Bafana Bafana at both the 1998 and 2002 World Cups .
His relationship with the national side has not always been an easy one - he has twice previously retired from international football when it clashed with his club career in Europe , damaging his reputation in his homeland .

A knee injury has limited his involvement for West Ham since joining them on 1 February from Premier League rivals Blackburn .
He featured in only one of South Africa 's four warm - up matches last month , coming on as a second - half substitute in a 2 - 1 win over Colombia at Soccer City on 27 May .
In the two warm - up matches prior to this , South Africa secured a goalless draw with North Korea and beat Jamaica 2 - 0 .
The subsequent victory over Guatemala made it 11 games unbeaten for Brazilian coach Parreira since taking charge of the side .
After facing Mexico in World Cup Group A on 11 June in Johannesburg , South Africa play Uruguay five days later ahead of a final clash with France on 22 June .
Full South Africa squad : Goalkeepers : Moeneeb Josephs ( Orlando Pirates ) , Itumeleng Khune ( Kaizer Chiefs ) , Shu-Aib Walters ( Maritzburg United ) Defenders : Matthew Booth , Siboniso Gaxa ( both Mamelodi Sundowns ) , Bongani Khumalo ( SuperSport United ) , Tsepo Masilela ( Maccabi Haifa ) , Aaron Mokoena ( Portsmouth ) , Anele Ngcongoa ( Racing Genk ) , Siyabonga Sangweni ( Lamontville Golden Arrows ) , Lucas Thwala ( Orlando Pirates ) .

Comets are usually thought of as icy , dusty emissaries from the deepest reaches of the solar system .
But according to a new simulation , many of them could have originated somewhere even more exotic — in budding planetary systems around other stars .
Like most stars , the sun may very well have been created in a tightly nestled birth cluster , a stellar nursery with tens , hundreds or possibly even thousands of stars .
During millions of years of intimate infancy , the newborn stars could have exchanged vast numbers of comets from the fringes of their disks , each of them winding up with an ensemble of hand - me - downs from their stellar siblings .
According to a study published online June 10 in Science , the capture mechanism could account for a substantial share of the comets in the Oort Cloud , a spherical flock of hundreds of billions of comets , and perhaps more , at the solar system 's outer fringes .
The new model could resolve the confoundingly large population of the Oort Cloud , says Harold Levison , a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colo .
Prevailing theories of solar system formation , Levison explains , hold that early in the system 's history there were plenty of icy objects left over from planetary formation .
But interactions with the newly formed giant planets ejected many of those comets into interstellar space , flung others out into what would become the Oort Cloud , and knocked some into elongated , somewhat shorter orbits in what is known as the scattered disk .
Scattered disk objects occupy elliptical orbits and may venture as close to the sun as Neptune 's orbit before looping back out to the deeper reaches of the solar system .
Models of planetesimal dispersion predict that roughly 10 times as many objects wound up in the Oort Cloud as in the scattered disk , according to the new study .
But observations do not match theory :
By one estimate , the Oort Cloud contains some 700 times as many comets as the scattered disk .
So Levison 's group set out to test a theory floating around since at least 1990 — that star - mingling billions of years ago could provide an additional cometary reservoir to populate the Oort Cloud .
In the new simulation the researchers modeled interactions among 30 to 300 stars packed in a birth cluster just a few light - years across .
They followed the evolution of the clusters until the stars dispersed , which took anywhere from 10 million to 52 million years .
Two mechanisms for comet exchange emerged :
In the more common scenario gravitational effects among neighboring stars stripped off comets that then roamed free through the cluster before hitching a ride with another star when the cluster dispersed .
The other , less common , mechanism showed that comets could migrate directly and in large numbers from one star to another during a close approach .
A rough estimation , assuming that our solar system is fairly typical , finds that one third to two thirds of the Oort Cloud comets originated in the grip of another star .
A more dramatic assessment , which the researchers assert is more realistic , comes from a simple comparison of observation and theory .
The capture process , Levison says , " is the only mechanism that we can think of that could contribute to the Oort Cloud " beyond the standard prediction , which appears to provide a woefully insufficient number of comets .
If the capture of comets from other stars indeed provided the rest , that would mean that more than 90 percent of the Oort Cloud sprang from extrasolar beginnings .
But estimates for the cloud 's size are indirect , based on observations of the few comets that venture inward to the planetary region ; the cloud itself is too distant to be directly observed .
And population estimates for the scattered disk also vary .
The contents of both reservoirs " are uncertain by an order of magnitude , " says Paul Weissman , a senior research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" So I 'm not entirely certain that they have a problem that needs solving . "
Faced with these uncertainties , Levison and his group did choose somewhat conservatively from the available population estimates , picking a relatively small figure for the size of the Oort Cloud and a large one for the scattered disk .
" I think the numbers are pretty solid , " Levison says .
Weissman takes issue , however , with the larger estimate of the contribution of extrasolar comets to the Oort Cloud .
" The claim that over 90 percent of the cloud is captured is a substantial overstatement , " Weissman says .
" What they have shown is that the number can be about one third to two thirds . "
Even that , he notes , is " a very important result . "
Regardless of whether the sun nabbed one third , two thirds or nearly all of its comets from its birth - cluster companions , why should it have made out so well ?
In the standard model of solar system formation , Levison notes , the bulk of the comets originally available in the sun 's disk wound up not in the Oort Cloud but flung clear into interstellar space .
The capture mechanism provides a way that some of those losses could have been offset .
" It 's not that our sun got more at the expense of somebody else , " Levison says .
" Everybody gets more . "
While many people dream of a company car and driver , former MP Chris Mullin found it difficult to get rid of his ministerial vehicle .
Here , he reflects on how his comic battle inspired David Cameron to cut government cars and encourage ministers onto public transport .
Although I cannot claim to have had much influence on the last government , I do appear to have had some influence on the new one .
David Cameron remarked to me some months ago that , having read my account of the struggle to shake off a ministerial car , recounted in my diaries View From the Foothills , he was proposing to limit the supply of ministerial limos .
And sure enough , he has delivered .
MULLIN'S DIARY , 29 JULY 1999 I am entitled to a car and a driver .
Entirely pointless since the 159 and 3 buses will continue to run past my door , even though I am a minister .
Jessica [ my private secretary ] , who cycles in from Brixton , was sympathetic but explained that the situation is a little more complicated than I might suppose .
For a start , red boxes cannot be transported by public transport .
She also explained that the funding of the government car pool is geared to encourage maximum use of the car .
The drivers are on a low basic wage and are heavily dependent on overtime .
So , if I accept a driver , he will be hanging around all day doing nothing and hating me for not giving him enough to do .
It was announced this week that only a handful of senior ministers who require a car for security reasons will in future be entitled to one as of right .
The rest will have to make do with access to the government car pool as the need arises .
Generally , however , they will be expected to make do with public transport .
The saving to the public purse will not be enormous - a mere £ 2.8 m - but the decision to reduce by a third the cost of the government car service sends an important signal .
Namely , that there is a connection between words and action .
One of the perennial embarrassments of being , as I was , a minister in the environment department was that every time a colleague talked of the need to tempt the great British public out of their cars and on to public transport , cameras would appear at the rear entrance filming ministers climbing into their official cars .
John Prescott 's Jaguar was a particular favourite with mischief - making journalists .
Crazy though it may seem in these days of climate change and political correctness , but the Government Car Service is - or was until recently - devoted to maximising use of the car .
Drivers are paid a low basic wage and , therefore , heavily reliant on overtime .
They are happy to be kept hanging around at all hours of the day and night .
At any given time , Speaker 's Court in the House of Commons is packed with ministerial limos , often with engines running , and drivers awaiting the pleasure of their ministerial masters .
John Prescott earned the nickname Two Jags for obvious reasons Ministers , too , are complicit , often for the best of motives .
They quickly form personal friendships with their drivers and are happy to devise unnecessary journeys in order to boost the driver 's income .
It is not uncommon for ministers in far flung constituencies , served by perfectly good train services , to insist on being driven weekly to and from London merely to create work for the driver .
The drivers , too , are not above making unnecessary journeys .
I was horrified one summer when a government car , containing not one but two drivers from the pool appeared at my office in Sunderland - a round trip of 580 miles - merely to hand over a few boxes of not very important papers which could just as easily have been delivered by Royal Mail .
What 's more they were proposing to come back and collect the boxes a few days later - until I got on the phone and put a stop to the escapade .
Yes , minister
When I became a minister in July 1999 I was determined from the outset to manage without an official car .
Mine was a Nissan Primera - only the top two or three people get Jags , armoured for security - but today a hybrid Prius is standard issue .
The type of car Mullin tried to refuse
As I recounted in my diaries , shaking off the Government Car Service was quite a struggle .
At that time , the only other minister to do so was Charles Clarke , then at the Department of Education - and he only managed to break free by saying that he needed to walk for health reasons .
Later , we were joined by Ross Cranston , the Solicitor General , and latterly by defence minister Kevan Jones .
In November 1999 , the Cabinet Office announced a review of the Government Car Service .
I duly penned a note to my colleague , the minister in charge of the review , advocating a system similar to that now being introduced .
There is no need for 171 of these cars to be on hand for every government minister , whip - and indeed , myself .
In these economic times , when everyone is making their own sacrifice , this number cannot be justified .
So the Conservatives will cut the budget for official government cars by a third
David Cameron , in a speech last September
Hypocrisy claim over Cameron bike
In due course , I went to see him , but it soon became apparent that he was rather attached to his car and that no significant change was likely .
So it proved .
It was not until last year , with the introduction of the EU 's Working Time Directive - making it impossible for drivers to work 15 - hour days - that change was at last contemplated .
Of course , it is not only ministers who are entitled to official cars .
Senior civil servants and goodness knows how many generals , admirals and air marshals in the cash - strapped Ministry of Defence are also ferried about by the Government Car Service .
In my experience , they are likely to cling to the perks of office rather more tenaciously than most ministers .
It also remains to be seen how the proposed reforms will work in practice .
My guess is that they will meet with considerable resistance .
It can only be a question of time before someone leaves official papers on a train and I predict this will be used as an excuse to try and re-open the entire issue .
Political will is going to be needed to make the reforms stick .
Chris Mullin was MP for Sunderland South from 1987 to 2010 .
The first volume of his diaries , A View from the Foothills , was published last year .
Below is a selection of your comments .
What a refreshingly interesting and honest article .
Lets not belittle the " mere £ 2.8 m " saving though - imagine how much more could be saved if we had the same eye for detail on stationery , printing and consumables and consultancy fees .
Amanda , Hampshire
It 's not only the government that need to rely less on their cars - I used to work in TV and was granted a car for the most ridiculous reasons ... even when I was only a runner .
I lost count the number of times I was picked up from my flat in a car simply so I would be on time for a day in the studio .
Jo , Kent Surprisingly perhaps , when I worked at Shell Centre in the 1980s it was not the perk of a company car that turned the high fliers on , but the chance to eat in the " Senior Mess " away from the junior riff raff ( Shell had at least five different sorts of dining in those days ) .
Philip Connolly , Hatfield Here in Sri Lanka we have ministers and deputy ministers numbering nearly 80 out of 225 member parliament and each minister enjoys a motorcade of five on average ( maybe a little less ) and armed guards and vehicles for wives for shopping , kids for schooling and so on .
On top of that each MP in given a duty - free car ( duty here is 200 % for a normal citizen ) .
Tharaka , Colombo , Sri Lanka
I work for the MoD and it pains me to see staff cars sitting outside buildings for hours at a time with their engines running so they can be ready to leave , or so the driver can be warm or the car can be warm for the so - called important person .
Staff like myself on low salaries and whose jobs are at risk have to watch this waste of public money while at the same time being told our future payrises will be almost nothing because they come from the public purse .
Joanne , Wiltshire , UK
When my father was a senior civil servant he was entitled to a car , but being based in Wales he generally only requested one when in London .
I recall one occasion when I cadged a lift and we arrived in Whitehall just as the road was closed for a state function ( the first wedding of Princess Anne ) .
The police waved the car through , and the assembled crowds started cheering and waving flags , no doubt thinking we were minor Royals or foreign dignitaries .
The etiquette of the situation was unclear , but I decided that a " Royal Wave " and a smile was appropriate .
Megan , Cheshire , UK
My dad had a staff car when commanding RAF Catterick , and we boys used to stand in line at the garden gate to salute him as he was driven off each morning .
When he was posted to RAF Brampton they gave him a bicycle .
Nicholas Riall , Neath I used to work for LUL ( London Underground ) .
When I first went for an interview I was told that I should live in London for public transport , or a car so that I could get in to work .
When I started my job I was told that there were staff taxis .
With regular " booked " staff taxis and specially ordered ones for different places , you soon see that a lot of money is being spent to get people to and from work .
I saw at least one member of staff being given a specially ordered taxi , and getting paid overtime until they phoned up to say they were at home - at normal peak time - for a journey of about five miles .
So you can see that it is n't only ministers and top civil servants that have access to cars .
All of this comes out of our pockets , and on public transport not only are you paying taxes for this , but also in your fares .
M Dowden , London
Talk about penny wise , pound foolish .
The loss of sensitive data on tubes and buses will become a weekly event .
The savings , such as they are , will come from making drivers redundant .
The savings will be cancelled out by everyone who loses a car claiming for rail fares ( first class , of course ) .
And who can forget the pointlessness of David Cameron cycling to work while his papers were chauffeured behind him in a limo ?
Dec , London
This is all ridiculous .
These people are trying to run our country and we make them take the Tube ?
I would rather they were getting on with fixing the economy than trying to catch a bus or waiting forever on a train station platform .
There is a time and a place for egalitarianism and this is not it .
This is actually detrimental to the common good .
Cameron should be in a Jag because it is his responsibility to remain safe and work efficiently - same for all ministers .
Damian Piesse , Brighton I doff my cap to the new government for doing this .
It might be only a token gesture , but it sends the right message , i.e. that ministers represent us and therefore should live their lives like us .
Who knows , over time it might lead to better public transport .
John , Newcastle upon
Tyne I 've known civil servants use official cars to go half a mile to Sheffield station ( which is about four times further by car and takes twice as long ) .
Some disabled or more elderly people or people with genuinely heavy bags probably do need this service , but the cost is increased massively by the " look how important I am " group who give civil servants a bad name .
Ron Kelly , Sheffield
If a minister wants to opt out , fair enough .
But like some have said , I want value for money from the minister .
The cost of their travel will drop on public transport , but I will not get the savings back , as they will be massively less productive spending time faffing about on public transport .
Alan , London I 'd try to refuse a Nissan Primera too , if I was him .
On the bright side , if they 're forced to use public transport everywhere , they might realise how rubbish it is outside of London .
Rob , Gloucester I was aghast to see Theresa May waft away from Downing Street , freshly minted as Home Secretary , in the back of a new Jaguar XJ .
The fresh Government had only been in place 24 hours and already there was a fleet of luxury cars - all now to be refused , I take it .
Which would be a shame in a way , as Jaguar need the orders and the publicity can only help .
It 's all very well making cuts , but we must manufacture , or die .
Julian Moseley , London UK I find this a waste of ministers ' time .
The country complains that they get paid too much , claim too much , do n't work hard enough but then we take away somewhere where they can actually work while travelling .
OK , I can see why we might insist on car pooling for civil servants but for our ministers ?
I feel the same about civil servants and ministers travelling in second class on the train .
Surely first class is quieter and easier to work in .
If a minister is travelling for a number of hours , I want them to have the optimum conditions to work in .
I work in the private sector and expect that , so why should someone with a much more important job than mine be given less ?
Jilly , Edinburgh I 've long had the opinion that public transport would be immeasurably improved by FORCING our political leaders to use it , and would cheerfully volunteer to be any minister 's " Official Drover " and herd them onto overfull / dirty / late trains and buses until they got together the will to sort them out .
Tim , Manchester I am really glad to see the big names travelling in local transport and giving a clear message to others .
Azhar , UK I heartily agree with ditching ministerial cars .
However , may I suggest some mini-buses to take small groups of people to satellite areas , esp late at night .
This may aid with an wet weather and carrying heavy papers .
To avoid losing papers , information should be electronic and kept inside close pockets .
Jaime Hepburn , Truro I agree with Jamie - a " school " ministerial bus , collecting people along the way and dropping them off at work .
Either that or car pooling .
Better for the planet , they can work in relative peace , saves money & some ministers might actually meet and talk to each other .
Anita , Orpington , UK

Broadband forum Whirlpool was brought down by a distributed denial of service attack this morning .
Update : Service restored at 10:30 am .
See below .
Update # 2 : Site down again June 30th .
See here for latest news .
From 12:45 am , Whirlpool host Bulletproof Networks noted irregular packet loss and investigated .
The hosting company discovered a large number of HTTP requests from a number of source IP addresses , all targeting Whirlpool .
Bulletproof blocked the offending source IP addresses and asked its upstream providers to do the same , restoring the site at 1:45 am .
The attack resumed five minutes later .
Again , Whirlpool was pulled offline whilst Bulletproof worked to block the attack .
It was brought back online just before business hours , but was taken offline a third time as the attack resumed .
" The service provider owners of the offending IPs in Denmark and the US have been contacted to escalate blocking of their specific addresses at source , " Bulletproof told iTnews .
The hosting company informed its customers via a series of text messages :
29/06/2010 12:46:12 AM
Alert : Bulletproof Monitoring has detected
network degredation [ sic ] .
ETR is unknown .
29/06/2010 2:13:44 AM
Alert : Network degradation with upstream providers
due to DDoS has been mitigated .
Bulletproof Networks said the outage was isolated to the Whirlpool site .
UPDATE : Bulletproof Networks COO
Lorenzo Modesto has paid tribute to the work of Bulletproof 's upstream network providers , Internode and Pacific Internet , which blocked the source IP addresses of the Whirlpool DDoS attack promptly .
The blocking of these source addresses enabled Bulletproof Networks to push Whirlpool live again from 10:30 am today .
" The most obvious way to build a robust network is to use a Tier One network upsteam - but history shows they do n't tend to be as responsive .
Non-Tier
One providers tend to have multiple paths in and are more responsive in times like this .
Our upstream providers were able to sort the issue within the hour . "
Modesto maintained his sense of humour during the attack .
" Looks like Whirlpool was the target of at least 20,000 spams or scams coming through the portal , " he told iTnews .
How to read research papers
Ezra Klein made an interesting observation a few days ago about how opinion journalists read papers by experts :
[ T ] his is one of the difficulties with analysis .
Fairly few political commentators know enough to decide which research papers are methodologically convincing and which are n’t .
So we often end up touting the papers that sound right , and the papers that sound right are , unsurprisingly , the ones that accord most closely with our view of the world .
To which Will Wilkinson said " Amen " :
This is one of the reasons I tend not to blog as much I ’d like about a lot of debates in economic policy .
I just do n’t know who to trust , and I do n’t trust myself enough to not just tout work that confirms my biases .
This is also why I tend to worry a lot about methodology in my policy papers .
How much can we trust happiness surveys ?
How exactly is inequality measured ?
How exactly is inflation measured ?
Does standard practice bias standard measurements in a particular direction ?
Of course , the motive to dig deeper is often suspicion of research you feel can’t really be right .
But this is , I believe , an honorable motive , as long as one digs honestly .
Indeed , I ’m pretty sure motivated cognition , when constrained by sound epistemic norms , is one of the mainsprings of intellectual progress .
One way to weigh competing research papers is to consider the publishing outlet .
Presumably , peer - reviewed articles will carry greater weight .
Except that Megan McArdle does n’t presume :
Especially for papers that rely on empirical work with painstakingly assembled datasets , the only way for peer reviewers to do the kind of thorough vetting that many commentators seem to imagine is implied by the words " peer review " would be to . . . well , go back and re-do the whole thing .
Obviously , this is not what happens .
Peer reviewers check for obvious anomalies , originality , and broad methodological weakness .
They do n’t replicate the work themselves .
Which means that there is immense space for things to go wrong–intentionally or not … .
This is not to say that the peer review system is worthless .
But it ’s limited .
Peer review does n’t prove that a paper is right ; it does n’t even prove that the paper is any good ( and it may serve as a gatekeeper that shuts out good , correct papers that do n’t sit well with the field ’s current establishment for one reason or another ) .
All it proves is that the paper has passed the most basic hurdles required to get published –that it be potentially interesting , and not obviously false .
This may commend it to our attention – but not to our instant belief .
This jibes with a recent Chonicle of Higher Education essay that bemoaned the explosion of research articles :
While brilliant and progressive research continues apace here and there , the amount of redundant , inconsequential , and outright poor research has swelled in recent decades , filling countless pages in journals and monographs .
Consider this tally from Science two decades ago : Only 45 percent of the articles published in the 4,500 top scientific journals were cited within the first five years after publication .
In recent years , the figure seems to have dropped further .
In a 2009 article in Online Information Review , Péter Jacsó found that 40.6 percent of the articles published in the top science and social - science journals ( the figures do not include the humanities ) were cited in the period 2002 to 2006 .
None of this provides much comfort for the layman interested in navigating through the miasma of contradictory research papers .
How can the amateur policy wonk separate the wheat from the chaff ?
Below are seven useful rules of thumb to provide you .
These are not foolproof — in fact , that ’s one of the rules — but they can provide some useful filtering while trying to discern good research from not - so - good research :
1 ) If you ca n’t read the abstract , do n’t bother with the paper .
Most smart people , including academics , do n’t like to admit when they do n’t understand something that they read .
This provides an opening for those who purposefully write obscurant or jargon - filled papers .
If you ’re befuddled after reading the paper abstract , do n’t bother with the paper — a poorly - worded abstract is the first sign of bad writing .
And bad academic writing is commonly linked to bad analytic reasoning .
2 ) It ’s not the publication , it ’s the citation count .
If you ’re trying to determine the relative importance of a paper , enter it into Google Scholar and check out the citation count .
The more a paper is cited , the greater its weight among those in the know .
Now , this does n’t always hold — sometimes a paper is cited along the lines of , " My findings clearly demonstrate that Drezner ’s ( 2007 ) argument was , like , total horses **t . "
Still , for papers that are more than a few years old , the citaion hit count is a useful metric .
3 ) Yes , peer review is better .
Nothing Megan McArdle wrote is incorrect .
That said , peer review does provide some useful functions , so the reader does n’t have to .
If nothing else , it ’s a useful signal that the author thought it could pass muster with critical colleagues .
Now , there are times when a researcher will bypass peer review to get something published sooner .
That said , in international relations , scholars who publish in non-refereed journals usually have a version of the paper intended for peer review .
4 ) Do you see a strawman ?
It ’s a causally complex world out there .
Any researcher who does n’t test an argument against viable alternatives is n’t really interested in whether he ’s right or not — he just wants to back up his gut instincts .
A " strawman " is when an author takes the most extreme caricature of the opposing argument as the viable alternative .
If the rival arguments sound absurd when you read about them in the paper , it ’s probably because the author has no interest in presenting the sane version of them .
Which means you can ignore the paper .
5 ) Are the author ’s conclusions the only possible conclusions to draw ?
Sometimes a paper can rest on solid theory and evidence , but then jump to policy conclusions that seem a bit of a stretch ( click here for one example ) .
If you can reason out different policy conclusions from the theory and data , then do n’t take the author ’s conclusions at face value .
To use some jargon , sometimes a paper ’s positivist conclusions are sound , even if the normative conclusions derived from the positive ones are a bit wobbly .
6 ) Can you falsify the author ’s argument ?
Conduct this exercise when you ’re done reading a research paper — can you picture the findings that would force the author to say , " you know what , I ca n’t explain this away — it turns out my hypothesis was wrong " ?
If you ca n’t picture that , then you can discard what you ’re reading a a piece of agitprop rather than a piece of research .
7 ) Fraudulent papers will still get through the cracks .
Trust is a public good that permeates all scholarship and reportage .
Peer reviewers assume that the author is not making up the data or plagiarizing someone else ’s idea .
We assume this because if we did n’t , peer review would be virtually impossible .
Every once in a while , an unethical author or a reporter will exploit that trust and publish something that ’s a load of crap .
The good news on this front is that the people who do ca n’t stop themselves from doing it on a regular basis , and eventually they make a mistake .
So the previous rules of thumb do n’t always work .
The publishing system is imperfect — but " imperfect " does not mean the same thing as " fatally flawed . "
With those rules of thumb , go forth and read your research papers .
Other useful rules of thumb are encouraged in the comments .

Learn What It Is And How To Control It Please note that this article is written with information describing sexual health issues relating to women who were identified as female at birth ( AFAB ) .
There are two types of female sexual fluids .
The most commonly known is called leukorrhea and is what lubricates the vaginal walls .
It is a thicker fluid and is slightly acidic to prevent infections .
Female ejaculation is a thin fluid called a prostatic - specific antigen ( PSA ) that originates in the G - spot and is pushed out the urethra ( where your urine comes out ) .
The G - spot is comprised of the Skenes / Paraurethral glands and is what makes this fluid .
Female ejaculation is real ; it is not urine , and it is a normal healthy sexual response .

There is a great deal of debate about female ejaculation , not because all women are not capable , but because there has been a genuine lack of understanding regarding women 's sexuality in our culture for far too long .
As an expert in female ejaculation , Dr. Laura Berman had me on her radio show to discuss it .
She and I agree when it comes to how it works , and I will explore with you how to achieve female ejaculation as well as the history , debates , and controversy around it in this article .
I will also review what products I think help in attaining it .
Female ejaculation is something that all women can experience .
For those that find difficulty in doing it , I can tell you that I have spent quite a bit of time researching how to overcome those obstacles , and I hope that my research will help you to enjoy this beautiful sexual experience should you desire to do it .
The Skenes glands that make up the G - spot are the equivalent of the male prostate , and they produce similar fluid .
This fluid comes out of the glands and into the urethra .
Female ejaculate can travel out and also back up into the bladder , which is referred to as retrograde ejaculation .
Because it can mix with urine , many people think that it is only urine and nothing more ; however , that is not the case .
Just as a man can urinate and ejaculate out of his urethra , so can a woman .
The main difference here is that women can do it at the same time .
I will cover this in detail later in this article ; however , what you should know is that not all of the fluid is urine , and in some cases , none of it is urine .
Female ejaculation is something that can be achieved during an orgasm ; however , it is not required for the ejaculate to come out .
Amounts depend on a variety of factors such as hydration , the length and intensity of arousal and how many times it has been done beforehand .
Do All Women Have the Same Anatomy ?
Some people erroneously think that not all women can ejaculate because they have tried and it has not worked for them .
However , all healthy women have the same anatomy , so it can just be a matter of finding the right technique and overcoming psychological issues that may inhibit a woman sexually .
For skeptics , it is essential to note that there are cases where some women may have Skenes glands that are not functioning correctly or underdeveloped .
For example , in 2002 , Emanuele Jannini of L'Aquila University in Italy found that the Skene 's glands in women have a wide variety of sizes and the number of Skenes glands they had .
He indicated that , in some extreme cases , they appeared not to be present .
However , the number of women and the details of this has not been made clear to the public .
It is also not examined if those women had other sexual deviations physically or not .
We do know that sexual development can impact whether or not a woman develops normally , and in extreme cases , you can even see things such as hermaphroditism ( having both testicular and ovarian tissue ) .
There are always exceptions , however , in the case of female ejaculation , and for the sake of addressing the norm for this article , we will be discussing the majority of healthy cis females and will not be focusing on the rare exception .
All Women Have G-spots ( Female Prostates )
All women have G - spots ; sometimes , it is also referred to as the G - Area or G - Region .
Not all women 's G - spots are easy to find , especially when a woman is not sexually excited , it may seem nonexistent ( that would be why many physicians do not feel them during medical evaluations ) .
Imagine a doctor saying that only some men have a prostate .
That would be ridiculous , right ?
Well , that about sums up this study .
Emmanuele Jannini of the University of L'Aquila in Italy has said that the female vaginal orgasm exists only in some women .
In his study , Jannini determined that on the front vaginal wall , the tissue was thicker in the women who had disclosed that they achieve vaginal orgasms .
This could be an indicator that women who have more prominent G - spots climax from stimulation to it more easily .
According to the study , the thicker tissue demonstrates the presence of a G - spot .
However , one has to examine if that is what we are really referring to when we are identifying the G - spot .
Are we saying that it is tissue , or are we saying that it is the Skenes glands under the tissue ?
If we agree that it is the Skenes glands ( which most would agree upon ) that make up the G- spot , and because all healthy women have Skenes glands , then it is only fair to say that all women have a G - spot .
However , some women have thicker tissue in front of the Skenes glands , which means that it makes their presence more pronounced and easier to find .
It also allows for more pressure to be placed on it when a penis , finger or sex toy is pressing against it .
Therefore , it would logically make sense that those women that have more tissue in front of the Skenes glands would be more prone to vaginal orgasm than those with not as much tissue .
When you look at a woman as a whole , then you can see her sexual functioning more .
Clearly , all women have a G - spot .
However , the sensitivity of that G - spot , the mass of tissue in front of it , and the size of those glands are all variables .
A woman will have to determine if she has high or low sensitivity and work with what she has .
Should she not find much pleasure through G - spot stimulation , then certainly vaginal stimulation is still an overall pleasurable sensation , especially when enhanced with clitoral stimulation .
Dr. Helen O'Connell , a well - known Australian researcher , feels that the G - spot is connected to the vagina , clitoris , and urethra to make up a " clitoral complex . "
The clitoris is shaped like a wishbone and extends through the vaginal walls and contracts during sexual arousal .
This has led some researchers to think that rather than there being a G - spot , it is a continuation of the clitoris even though the clitoris is not located there .
In a Rutgers University study , it was shown through an MRI test that the cervix , clitoris , and vagina stimulated distinct areas of the women 's sensory cortex in her brain .
What was interesting was that each woman 's brain sensed the distinct stimulation of each region , including the area of the vaginal wall where the G - spot is located .
What Is In The Female Ejaculation Fluid ?
The biggest myth out there is that female ejaculation is urine , and this is not true .
While it can mix with urine , there is a lot of back and forth by people who are confused as to exactly what it is and is not .
In studies where it has been tested , it has been determined that the female ejaculate known as prostatic - specific antigen ( PSA ) contains glucose and an enzyme , which is also known as prostate acid phosphatase .
This enzyme is a significant component in semen as it comes from the prostate in males .
Again , the G - spot in a woman is essentially the same as a man 's prostate , and that is why the fluid is similar .
In addition , when the prostatic - specific antigen ( PSA ) was discovered , it contained some elements of urine ( urea and creatine ) .
There were typically at least trace amounts , which suggests that either it simply was lining the urethra or a little came out with the ejaculate .
Those who have experience female ejaculation via squirting know that it is a sweet - smelling , watery type of fluid and is not the typical fluid that one sees when a woman is wet from sexual arousal or having had an orgasm .
This is why there has been such a strong focus on the concept of retrograde ejaculation .
Female ejaculate is relatively consistent in taste , smell , color , and consistency .
However , leukorrhea , on the other hand , varies in these factors , and like other fluids in the body , it seems to be influenced by diet and time frame of the menstrual cycle .
Factors that influence the characteristics of the fluid are menstrual cycle , diet , fluid intake .
There are women who report that it is sometimes clear and odorless , other times thicker and stronger in odor .
It is safe to say , most women 's ejaculate will vary with time , even during a single sexual episode .
It is safe for a person to taste their ejaculate , and for couples who already exchange body fluids , but not for couples needing to practice safe sex .
Why Don't Many Women Know About It Or Do It ?
Female ejaculation is not difficult ; women typically do n't know about the elusive reasons they are not doing it .
They are usually sabotaging their chances for gushing female ejaculate when they are having an orgasm without even knowing it .
One of the main reasons that women do not know they can do it is because women will often feel like they need to urinate when they are ready to expel the ejaculate and because they think that urine will come out , they hold back .
Getting Past Inhibitions
Prevention of female ejaculation is a simple clenching down of the Kegel muscles to stop the fluid from coming out .
When a woman cannot relax , bear down and push to expel the ejaculate , it may come down to a matter of inhibitions .
Often women are taught not to be messy or sexually assertive .
Pushing out ejaculate for a woman can feel like a significant sexual breakthrough as it allows her to feel a level of freedom and uninhibited sensuality that she may not have ever felt before .
Sometimes even the most confident of women have a difficult time ejaculating , so it is nothing to be embarrassed about and is certainly not an indicator that something is wrong if she cannot .
While some women have an easier time at achieving female ejaculation , that is no different than some women having more difficulty merely having an orgasm .
For those of you who do not want to make a mess of your sheets and want an easy cleanup , you can use a cheap shower curtain under a blanket or get a waterproof throw that has a waterproof center and is soft on both sides for comfort which we sell for this very reason .
Is Female Ejaculation A Gspot Orgasm ?
A common mistake that many make is to think that that female ejaculation is a result of a G - spot orgasm .
This is not true .
As mentioned earlier , female ejaculation can occur without an orgasm occurring at all .
Rather it is just the fluid that has built up in her G - spot that gets pushed out .
Pressure on the G - spot can help that fluid to come out , so that is why it is easy to make the mistake of thinking that it is a G - spot orgasm .
Female Ejaculation Debate Women who ejaculate have been known to ejaculate in large amounts .
There is a great deal of debate that still goes around , even between the most well versed sexual health professionals .
Some say that it is the ejaculate and urine mixed .
While some say that it is retrograde ejaculation , which means that the fluid has gone out the G - spot and up into an empty bladder or filled the urethra and then comes out ; others say that it is a building up of fluid that fills the Skenes glands ( G - spot ) and then like salvia in your mouth , keeps filling back up and does so at a very quick rate .
The truth is that women can urinate and ejaculate at the same time .
Therefore , sometimes even with the best intentions of simply wanting to ejaculate , women can expel some urine .
To reduce this possibility , I recommend urinating before sexual activity and if it is prolonged , taking a break just to make sure it is all expelled if this is a concern .
Female ejaculate is sweet - smelling and does not have a salty taste .
Salt from sweat may get into the mix , however , as there are a variety of fluids that can come out during a woman 's sexual arousal and climax .
Ejaculate is not yellow , so if you see that , there may be some urine being expelled during climax .
Unlike men , women do not have a valve control to shut down the urination process during sexual arousal , so understandably it can get confusing as to what exactly is coming out .
First lets get the myths out of the way and review what is true and untrue about it .
Female Ejaculation Facts
Myths Facts Female ejaculation does not exist .
Only rare women can achieve female ejaculation ( or squirt ) .
Kegel exercise is the key to achieving female ejaculation .
Only women with prominent G - Spots can achieve female ejaculation .
Female ejaculation can only be achieved through G - Spot orgasms .
Gynecologists are all educated about this issue and provide women with correct information .
Female ejaculation is urinary incontinence ( peeing ) .
Women who have given birth are the only women capable of female ejaculation .
There is only one way to achieve female ejaculation .
Some or all of female ejaculation fluids come from the Skenes / Paraurethral glands ( also known as the G - Spot ) .
Women often do not realize that they can ejaculate because they are missing the cues of when they can do it .
There are specific techniques that can be taught to a woman to teach her how to do it and how to hold it if she does not wish to ejaculate .
Women can ejaculate without having a G - Spot orgasm and , for that matter , without having an orgasm at all .
Women can increase the amount of fluid they ejaculate by following specific steps .
Women can ejaculate multiple times within a short period .
Female ejaculation is not urine , is much like the consistency of water , is clear in color , and usually smells like nothing or has a slightly sweet scent .
After testing , it was found to be similar to Prostate fluid found in men .
However , it can come out with urine .
Where Does Female Ejaculation Come From ?
As discussed , female ejaculation comes from the Paraurethral / Skenes glands , which make up the G - spot .
The first documentation of these being like the male prostate was in 1672 when Reinier De Graaf had described a collection of glands that surround the female urethra .
He described the glands as producing transparent fluid to lubricate the vagina .
However , it was not until 2001 when the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology finally began to use the term ' female prostate ' within their terminology .
It just goes to show how slow Western medicine has been in really giving female sexuality the attention that it deserves .
Part of the reason that the G - spot and its functioning was ignored was that it does not impact reproduction , and therefore , it was deemed unimportant .
However , as a woman speaking for my sex , I can say that it is truly a significant failure on the part of physicians that they have seen only reproductive functioning as important .
After all , it has been determined that prostate massage in men reduces the risk of prostate cancer .
Could it not be just as important for women to know if draining the G - spot could also provide health benefits ?
When the female prostate ( G - spot ) has become enlarged or caused discomfort , it is called female urethral diverticulum or female prostatitis .
Many urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) have been incorrectly diagnosed and treated due to this disregard for the female prostate .
Even beyond the health aspects of female sexuality , women 's sexual pleasure is notable solely for the sake of itself .
As more sexual health professionals are pushing for research in this area , we are beginning to see increased education about this , which is finally giving women the knowledge they need to be rightfully sexually empowered .
The Female Prostate Glands vs. The Bladder Because the Paraurethral ( Skenes ) glands that make up the G - spot are only about 1.5 - 2 inches in length , it is reasonable to wonder how up to two cups of fluid can come out .
However , as mentioned before , there is a great deal of debate regarding it , even among sexual health professionals .
There are Magnetic resonance images that suggest that the theory of retrograde ejaculation may be what is going on inside .
This is where the fluid has gone out the G - spot and up into an empty bladder and then comes out .
However , it could also be urine mixing with the fluid from the female prostate .
This is where the fluid has gone out the G - spot and up into an empty bladder and then comes out .
However , it could also be urine mixing with the fluid from the female prostate .
There have been clinical tests where a woman 's bladder is drained of urine before sexual stimulation and ejaculation .
Even though the women 's bladders had been drained , they were found to expel anywhere from 50 ml to 900 ml of fluid into a catheter bag .
This has lead researchers to conclude that at least some of the liquid must come from the bladder , such as in the study conducted by Samuel Salama and his colleagues at the Parly II private hospital in Le Chesnay , France .
However , even in that study , it was shown that the majority of post - orgasm urine samples contained prostatic - specific antigen ( PSA ) .
It is the PSA that many researchers say is the " true " female ejaculate , which is produced mainly by the Skene glands .
Other researchers show more urine with smaller amounts of prostatic secretions .
More Research Is Needed Some researchers , like Dr. Gary Schubach , have stated in his research that the majority of the female ejaculation originates in the bladder .
Still , the expelled fluid is not quite normal urine .
In his research , a woman 's bladder was emptied using a catheter before orgasm .
During orgasm , a catheter was in place and connected to a collection bag .
Analysis of the fluid expelled during orgasm is the basis for his claim .
Oversight of this approach is that the bladder sphincter is normally closed .
If it were not , liquid in the bladder would come out at any time .
By creating an artificial passage and collecting the fluid expelled from the bladder during pelvic muscle contractions is just part of the picture and does not explore if , during orgasm , this passage exists typically , even if only for a moment .
Some speculate that female ejaculate originates from the kidneys in large volumes , which could hold some validity in that magnetic resonance imaging has captured increased fluid in the kidneys when a woman is aroused .
Combining this fluid with the fluid that is expelled from the female prostate glands would complement the lab tests on the fluid .
Therefore , this is an excellent theory and one that should be delved into more through testing , such as ultrasound monitoring .
The bladder theory is just one of several and is assumed to be true because doctors are confused about how the fluid can come from the Skene 's glands ( the G - spot ) as it could not hold as much as 2 cups of fluid .
Thus , the reason that it must come from the bladder .
However , it may come from the kidneys and Skene 's glands .
It is still controversial , and because there have not been any recent studies as I write this article , it is still difficult to say which of the theories are correct with 100 % accuracy .
Even the latest studies only measure the fluid and are not comprehensive with a large group of women combined with fluid testing and internal imaging .
How Much Ejaculate Comes Out ?
Most women can gush as much as 0.5 - 2 cups of the fluid when ejaculating .
However , this can be affected by how hydrated a woman is , how much she pushes while ejaculating , and other factors .
The more fluid , the more chances prostatic - specific antigen ( PSA ) is being mixed with urine .
The female prostate comes in many different shapes and sizes , but the majority of women have a prostate that is positioned near the external urethra can expel similar amounts of fluid .
The amount of fluid that is expelled varies from woman to woman as well as from sexual experience to experience .
It can be a mere dribble to more than two cups .
When you think about it , two cups is a lot of liquid , but it has been documented , however , many say this amount of fluid is only when it is mixed with urine .
Typically that is the case when there is that much fluid .
How To Stop Female Ejaculation If Undesired
Some women experience female ejaculation when they do not want to .
The best way to stop it is to refrain from pushing outward during an orgasm .
Women can also clench down on the urethra by using their Kegel muscles , much like they would stop the flow of urine .
The more developed the Kegel muscles , the easier it will be to control it .

The way you collect sassafras is to pull seedlings right out of the ground .
I know , it sounds destructive , but it is n't .
Sassafras grows in clumps , and the parent tree sends out suckers under the ground , which then become seedlings ; it 's a lot like mulberry .
You find a clump — look for at least eight to 10 treelings scattered about — go to one about two to three feet tall , grasp the very base of the tree , and yank it straight up .
You should come away with the seedling and about 10 inches of the root .
You did not get all of the root , you know , and this is a good thing .
It will regrow later .
So what seems a little wanton is actually good for the sassafras cluster — it lets the surrounding seedlings grow with less competition .
All parts of this tree are useful .
Notice I did not say " edible , " because the leaves are the only part you actually eat .
You know them as file powder , and without sassafras leaves your gumbo would not be gumbo .
I left the leaves of the seedlings I pulled with my sister and brother - in - law .
They can make either tea or file powder from them .
I took the twigs and roots back to California .
Elise Bauer
What 's the difference ?
They make very different teas .
The twigs have a lemony - floral flavor and aroma that one author has compared to Froot Loops cereal — not exactly a selling point in my book , but they are lovely .
The roots , however , are the " root " in root beer .
I am not a tea drinker .
Coffee is my breakfast drink of choice .
So I was not about to switch for sassafras .
But I do like using flavored syrups from wild ingredients ; I recently made a delicious fir tip syrup from the young tips of a Douglas fir tree .
I then use these syrups to glaze meats and make homemade sodas , sorbets , or ice creams .
Sassafras is a prime candidate for this treatment .
So the first thing I did was chop some twigs , peeling back the green bark a bit to expose it — the bark is what has most of the flavor — then simmered them in hot water .
The brew quickly turned a pretty amber , a little like cola if you mixed it with an equal volume of water .
I let it steep overnight and then strained it through cheesecloth and mixed it 50 - 50 with sugar to make a simple syrup .
It was outstanding .
I mean , really outstanding .
Think root beer with a lot of lemon in it .
Here 's how to make sassafras twig syrup .
That was easy enough .
But what I really wanted to make was homemade root beer .
Root beer is my soda of choice , although I am also a big fan of good ginger ale .
And I know how to make root beer at home , and it traditionally involves yeast and a small amount of alcohol — that 's the " beer " in root beer .
I did not want to do this .
Homemade ginger ale and root beers made with fermentation are tricky .
I wanted a stable , non-alcoholic base flavoring I could then make into a soda by adding seltzer water .
The first thing I knew I needed to do was to chop the sassafras roots .
TEHRAN  A Sunni militant group whose leader was recently executed by Iranian authorities claimed responsibility on Friday for one of the deadliest terrorist attacks Iran has seen in years : a double suicide bombing outside a mosque that killed 26 people and wounded 300 .
The bombing underscored the continuing threat of religious and ethnic violence in Iran , which is unrelated to the political upheavals of the past year .
The victims included members of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , officials said , which the militant group Jundallah has singled out repeatedly in the past .
The group claims to be fighting on behalf of Sunni Muslim members of the Baluch ethnic group in Iran and Pakistan and has been a thorn in the side of Iran ’s security services for years , repeatedly bombing Zahedan and other southeastern cities .
It claimed responsibility for an attack in October 2009 that killed 40 people , including 15 members of the Revolutionary Guards .
In an Internet statement , Jundallah said two of its “ faithful and brave sons ” had detonated their bombs at a gathering of the Revolutionary Guards at a religious meeting hall in Zahedan on Thursday that commemorated the organization .

CHARLOTTE , N.C. , June 24 ( UPI ) --
An atheists organization says it rented a billboard on a Charlotte , N.C. , street named after the most famous U.S. evangelist strictly for economic reasons .
The Charlotte Atheists & Agnostics ad appeared over Billy Graham Parkway Monday and will be up for four weeks , The Charlotte Observer said .
William Warren , a spokesman for the group , said the location was chosen because two other possibilities near the interstate were too expensive and a third billboard would have been seen by fewer people in the heart of the Bible Belt .

" We got more bang for our buck there , " Warren said of the parkway .
The billboard and others going up around the state are part of a July 4 campaign by the N.C. Secular Association .
The ad shows an American flag and quotes the Pledge of Allegiance as it was originally written before the words " under God " were added in 1954 .
" We 're doing this to raise the consciousness of the people of North Carolina , " said Warren , an electronics technician who spent five years in the U.S. Marine Corps .
" We want to let them know that not everybody here is religious .
There are atheists in North Carolina , and we expect to be recognized and treated like everybody else . "
The European Parliament 's website urging its members to sign Declaration 29 seems well - meaning enough , with a frightened - looking child and a plea to end sexual harassment , child porn , and pedophilia .
However , privacy advocates are concerned over a semi- hidden rider on the declaration that allows EU member states to retain data from search engines , essentially eliminating any privacy EU citizens previously had when surfing the Web .
The stated purpose of Declaration 29 is to set up an early warning system ( EWS ) to target pedophiles and sex offenders .
The statement itself is somewhat vague about how this would be done , but claims that pedophiles currently enjoy " freedom of action , putting them on the same footing as honest citizens and making it difficult for the authorities to trace them . "
As such , the EU is calling on members to implement Directive 2006 / 24 / EC — also known as the Data Retention Directive — in order to " tackle online child pornography and sex offending rapidly and effectively . "
Once the declaration has 369 signatures , it will be adopted — as of this writing , it has 324 .
The problem is that the Data Retention Directive makes it simple for EU states to monitor the Internet searches of citizens .
This has led privacy advocates to urge parliament members to withdraw their signatures in support of Declaration 29 .
One member of the parliament , Christian Engström , indicated on his blog that he believes many of those who have signed the declaration were misled and do n't realize the full implications of the Data Retention Directive .
He notes that the marketing materials do n't mention the directive by name ( only by number ) .
Another parliament member , Cecilia Wikström , wrote an open letter to her fellow parliament members saying that she made a mistake in signing the declaration .
" The Written Declaration is supposed to be about an early - warning system for the protection of children .
Long - term storage of citizens ’ data has clearly nothing to do with ' early warning ' for any purpose , " Wikström wrote .
" [ I ]t seems very likely that MEPs signed the Written Declaration unaware of this aspect of the text , just like I did ...
The declaration is likely to get all the signature [s ] it needs and therefore I urge those of you who may have signed it by mistake to withdraw your signature . "
Given the EU 's pressure on companies like Google to keep cutting their data retention periods , the attempt to slide this one under the radar seems suspicious .
As Engström points out , concerned citizens should contact their parliament members about the issue soon , before the signature requirement is met .
Google has the power to not only remove applications from users '
Android phones , but remotely install them as well .
Last week , Google told the world it had exercised its Android " Remote Application Removal Feature , " reaching out over the airwaves and lifting two applications from citizen handsets , and as pointed out by the man who built this pair of vanished applications – security researcher Jon Oberheide – the company can use the same persistent handset connection to install applications as well .
When Google announced that it had actually used its " kill switch " to remove Oberheide 's applications , it did n't mention Oberheide – or his applications – by name .
It merely said that it had removed " two free applications built by a security researcher for research purposes " and that " these applications intentionally misrepresented their purpose in order to encourage user downloads , but they were not designed to be used maliciously , and did not have permission to access private data — or system resources beyond permission .
INTERNET . "
The announcement came by way of a blog post from Android security lead Rich Cannings .
" After the researcher voluntarily removed these applications from Android Market , we decided , per the Android Market Terms of Service , to exercise our remote application removal feature on the remaining installed copies to complete the cleanup , " Cannings said .
With a blog post of his own , Oberheide – who works for the Ann Arbor , Michigan - based security startup Scio Security – later revealed that Google has removed a pair of applications he used to demonstrate how easy it would be to bootstrap a rootkit onto Android phones via the Android Market , Google 's version of the App Store .
Oberheide built an application dubbed RootStrap that periodically phoned home to retrieve native code that executed outside of Dalvik , the Android Java virtual machine .
Then he distributed the tool through the Market in the guise of another application – Twilight Eclipse Preview – which purported to be a sneak peek of the upcoming Twilight teen vampire flick .
" An attacker could use such an approach to gain a large install base for a seemingly innocent application and then push down a local privilege escalation exploit as soon as a new vulnerability is discovered in the Linux kernel and root the device , " Oberheide wrote .
" Since carriers are fairly conservative in pushing out OTA [ over the air ] patches for their devices , an attacker could easily push out their malicious payload before the devices were patched . "
Oberheide had delivered a talk on this proof - of - concept bootstrap at the SummerCon security conference in New York .
The talk was written up by Forbes , and this alerted Google .
Forbes quotes Google 's Rich Cannings , who pointed out that unless they exploit a bug in the OS , Android apps are limited to the permissions set by users .
Though Google says that Oberheide voluntarily removed the apps from the Android Market , Oberheide tells
The Reg that the company essentially told him that if he did n't remove them , they would be removed for him .
He also tells us that Google alerted him before it started removing the apps from phones , but that he did n't receive the notification until after they 'd been removed .
Enlarge LucasArts Boba Fett :
He 's the focus of Star Wars : The Force Unleashed II .
Fan favorite Boba Fett is poised to steal scenes in another Star Wars adventure .
The bounty hunter who captured Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back has a date in the upcoming LucasArts video game Star Wars : The Force Unleashed II ( due Oct. 26 , for all game systems ) .
GAME HUNTERS : Boba Fett infiltrates ' Star Wars : The Force Unleashed II ' A follow - up to 2008's The Force Unleashed — the best - selling Star Wars video game ever — the sequel continues the story of Starkiller , Darth Vader 's secret apprentice , with events that take place between Episode III : Revenge of the Sith and Episode IV : A New Hope .
As the story continues , Starkiller , who helped ignite the rebellion against the Empire , has escaped from Vader , who then employs Boba Fett to track him down .
" We did n't want to just throw Boba Fett or other characters in the game just for the sake of making a fan appearance , " says LucasArts ' Haden Blackman , who wrote the story for both games .
" But it really made sense for ( Vader ) to hire Boba Fett . "
Adding the beloved character adds heft to a cinematic story line .
Boba
Fett " really has become a rich character over time , and for us to have him show up in a small but pivotal role was exciting , " says Blackman , who will make the official announcement today at Comic - Con .
After apparently dying in Return of the Jedi , Boba Fett has had a busy life in the subsequent Star Wars offshoots .
Young Boba appeared in Attack of the Clones and the current Clone Wars Cartoon Network series .
He stars in recent paperback Bounty Hunter : Boba Fett and the upcoming graphic novel Star Wars : Blood Ties — A Tale of Jango and Boba Fett , out Aug. 25 .
" He 's one of those characters that really resonates with fans , " Blackman says .
" That cool masked man ( with ) all the gadgets , he 's a bounty hunter , which has got to be a life of adventure and danger .
...
Fans just want more stories about him . "
Blackman hopes similar sentiments grow around Starkiller , the main character in The Force Unleashed games .
" We give him what I think is a satisfying character arc .
He starts in one place emotionally and physically , and ends up in a different place , " Blackman says .
" There are definitely more stories we can tell with this character . "

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas charged that a fire that damaged a Palestinian mosque in the Israeli - Occupied Palestinian West Bank was set by Israeli terrorists among militant colonists of the territory .
Israeli Trade Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer also said he suspected arson .
Hamas , the Muslim fundamentalist party that controls the Gaza Strip , the other territory of the Palestine Authority , said that the terrorist incident demonstrates how unfruitful the negotiations set between Abbas and the Israelis are likely to be .
Haaretz reports that extremist Israeli settlers are planning to set fire in more Palestinian mosques , i.e. planning to engage in further terrorism , as a means of fighting the closure of illegal squatter colonies on the Palestinian West Bank .
The Palestinian West Bank is Palestinian territory captured by Israel in 1967 .
Although in the international law ( formulated after WW II to prevent a repetition of the crimes of the Nazis ) it is illegal for an occupying Power to import its own citizens into an Occupied territory , the Israeli government has since 1973 been sponsoring large colonies on the West Bank , involving massive theft of Palestinian land and resources , including water .
In addition , vigilante colonists have set up scattered squatter settlements that are considered illegal even in Israeli law .
It is those that the government sometimes dismantles , in part because they are amid Palestinian villages and the colonists are difficult to protect .
The Israeli government need not worry too much .
The militant Israeli squatters are heavily armed and have a vigilante ethos , and have been attacking Palestinians in their villages and preventing them from harvesting their olive groves that lie near Israeli colonies .
Having often received carte blanche from the authorities to terrorize Palestinians in other ways , they can hardly be blamed for thinking it perfectly natural to now engage in arson against their holy sites .
The Mideast is on tenterhooks .
Jordan is terrified that far rightwing Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman will attempt to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians and displace them to Jordan .
They also fear that the Jordan river will be dried up by extensive Israeli siphoning .
Lebanon is jittery about another attack on Beirut .
Iran has pledged to defend Syria if the Israelis attack Damascus , over the alleged transfer to Lebanese Shiite party - militia Hizbullah of SCUD missiles .

I ’m sad to inform you , if you did not know , that BP has abandoned Top Kill in failure , but not before they staged a Potemkin Village for disingenuous PR .
The most ambitious bid yet to stop the worst oil spill in U.S. history ended in failure Saturday after BP was unable to overwhelm the gusher of crude with heavy fluids and junk .
President Obama called the setback " as enraging as it is heartbreaking . "
The oil giant immediately began readying its next attempted fix , using robot submarines to cut the pipe that ’s gushing the oil into the Gulf of Mexico and cap it with funnel - like device , but the only guaranteed solution remains more than two months away .
The company determined the " top kill " had failed after it spent three days pumping heavy drilling mud into the crippled well 5,000 feet underwater .
It ’s the latest in a series of failures to stop the crude that ’s fouling marshland and beaches , as estimates of how much oil is leaking grow more dire .
The spill is the worst in U.S. history — exceeding even the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster — and has dumped between 18 million and 40 million gallons into the Gulf , according to government estimates .
" This scares everybody , the fact that we ca n’t make this well stop flowing , the fact that we have n’t succeeded so far , " BP PLC Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said Saturday .
" Many of the things we ’re trying have been done on the surface before , but have never been tried at 5,000 feet . "
Frustration has grown as drifting oil closes beaches and washes up in sensitive marshland .
The damage is underscored by images of pelicans and their eggs coated in oil .
Below the surface , oyster beds and shrimp nurseries face certain death .
Fishermen complain there ’s no end in sight to the catastrophe that ’s keeping their boats idle .
News that the top kill fell short drew a sharply worded response from President Barack Obama , a day after he visited the Gulf Coast to see the damage firsthand .
" It is as enraging as it is heartbreaking , and we will not relent until this leak is contained , until the waters and shores are cleaned up , and until the people unjustly victimized by this manmade disaster are made whole , " Obama said Saturday … [ emphasis added ]
Many people want to get started with short term trading , but what they do n’t know is that you ca n’t just jump right in and expect to be successful .
There are many pieces of information that are necessary for success .
And although some of them might seem like common sense , this is often overlooked because they can be deemed as “ too simple . ”
Instead , what a lot of people do is to jump right to more advanced topics like strategy .
Strategy is important for sure , but it ’s not the first thing you should be focused upon .
Instead , familiarize yourself with the basics , master them , and then form a more complex strategy around them .
This will take you much further down the road of creating a highly profitable trading career .
Let ’s take a look at some of the things that you will need to master before you focus on finalizing a strategy .
Trading Hours
There are certain hours that certain assets are traded during .
If you are n’t available to trade during those times , you will have difficulty getting started .
For example , the U.S. stock market is open from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm on Monday through Friday , Eastern Time .
Trading stocks and indices outside of those hours is possible , but very difficult , especially if you are trying to do so over the short term .
The margin of error goes up at a very high rate .
Trading the U.S. dollar during these hours is possible , too .
However , there are other currencies out there , and knowing when these are traded the most will give you an advantage .
The three biggest currencies besides the dollar are the euro , the Japanese yen , and the pound sterling , out of Great Britain .
The euro and the pound are traded during European trading hours , usually ranging from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm , or 3:00 am to 11:00 am in New York City .
Tokyo ’s trading hours are even more inconvenient if you live in the United States .
Those start at 8:00 pm the night before .
These are the peak currency trading hours , as they are when the most people are trading , and thus prices move the most quickly .
Commodity hours tend to be similar , depending on the time of year .
If you are trading in Singapore you have similar time frames as Japan .
Just make sure you work with what ’s best for your schedule .
National Markets
Most people do n’t begin to realize that they might be trading in another nation before they begin .
At that point , it can already be very inconvenient .
The internet has made our world seem very small , but that does n’t mean it really is .
Instead , if you are trading the USD / JPY pair , but it is not during peak hours in New York or Tokyo , you will be struggling because these currencies do n’t move as quickly during European hours .
Knowing which markets to trade in will help you to speed things up with your learning process .
It will also help you to keep focused .
This is especially true of stock trading .
It is possible for a U.S. based trader to trade European stocks , or vice versa , but this can be tough to set up .
Trading with options makes this a lot easier , but you will be limited to the biggest stocks and indices out there .
This is n’t a bad thing , though .
In fact , in most cases it allows you to streamline and specialize your focus , giving you a higher correct trade rate over the long run .
Picking a Strong Broker
Every trader is looking for an advantage in the market .
Some brokers will give you the heads up when good trades are coming .
As long as you keep you money in multiple accounts you should be in good shape .
Brokers such as 24option and HighLow will give you the required education .
Without the right broker knowledge you will fall behind the crowd .
News Trading
Once you know what to trade , and when , you can focus on strategy .
News trading is a powerful strategy , especially for beginners .
It allows people without a lot of experience in technical trading to make big profits because of the fact that it relies more heavily on market psychology than how to interpret a graph .
It is most useful over the very short term , which again , gives an advantage to options traders .
Short term day traders can also use this , but the fees associated with this can add up very quickly and eat away all the money made .
It ’s a simple strategy : when something happens in the news , make a trade anticipating the direction that the news will take a specific asset .
Making the right broker choice will be important if you decide to trade this way .
Sites like the afternoongrind provide reviews of these types of brokers .
You can see etrade and td ameritrade going after each day .
Fundamental Trading
Trading with fundamental strategies is a step more advanced than trading the news .
Here , you are looking at the health of a company or a commodity and making a decision based upon that information .
Using the SEC required paperwork for U.S. based stocks and indices is a good place to start , and many sites will consolidate this info for you .
Fundamental trading tends to be more long term , which is great for position traders in the stock market , commodity futures traders , and long term traders .
Nouriel Roubini , ( born March 29 , 1958 , Istanbul , Turkey ) , Turkish - born American economist and educator who was best known for predicting the 2007 –08 subprime mortgage crisis in the United States and the subsequent global financial crisis .
Born to Iranian Jewish parents , Roubini moved with his family to Iran and Israel before they settled in Italy in 1962 .
After a year at Hebrew University of Jerusalem , he studied economics at Bocconi University in Milan ( B.A. , 1982 ) and Harvard University ( Ph.D. , 1988 ) , where he specialized in macroeconomics and international economics .
He joined the economics faculty at Yale University in 1988 and taught there until 1995 , when he moved to New York University .
He also served as a visiting scholar to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , was a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) , held single - year terms on the White House Council of Economic Advisers ( 1998–99 ) and at the U.S. Department of the Treasury ( 1999 –2000 ) , and cofounded ( 2004 ) the consulting firm Roubini Global Economics .
Roubini spent much of his early career studying countries that experienced extreme economic failures , such as Mexico ( in 1994 ) , Thailand and other countries associated with the 1997 Asian financial crisis , Russia ( 1998 ) , and Argentina ( 2000 ) .
He determined that each shared one common element : a massive current account deficit . ( www.britannica.com)
To shape the government ’s long - term response to the Gulf oil calamity , President Obama recently formed an independent , bipartisan commission to investigate the origins of the leak and BP ’s efforts to control it .
Yet one of the commission ’s two co-directors , former EPA chief William K. Reilly , sits on the board of directors of the oil giant ConocoPhillips and the chemical company Dupont , which supplies goods and services to the oil industry .
( Hat tip to The Maddow Blog . )
Now , Reilly is no doubt a relatively benevolent oilman .
Grist contributor Osha Gray Davidson recently profiled him quite favorably on the El Phoenix Sun blog , portraying Reilly as a “ bona fide environmentalist ” whose Sonoma County home is powered by solar panels .
According to Davidson , Reilly did good work at EPA under George H.W. Bush — “ until conservatives in the administration who had always seen Reilly ( and all environmentalists ) as a political liability ” undermined him ahead of the 1992 election .
But the fact remains Reilly is literally on Big Oil ’s payroll .
According to the PEU Report , Reilly brought home $ 246,515 in compensation from ConocoPhillips in 2009 , and another $ 279,526 from Dupont .
( Forbes has compensation numbers for previous years . )
Reilly holds stock in the two multinationals valued at about $ 2 million apiece , PEU Report states .
ConocoPhillips , it must be noted , has offshore - drilling projects lined up that will be affected by the commission ’s findings .
Just after Obama announced his plan to dramatically expand offshore drilling in March — before the Deepwater explosion — the company was primed to move ahead with projects in Alaska ’s environmentally sensitive Chukchi and Beaufort Seas .
“ Our understanding is that today ’s announcement means exploration and development of existing Chukchi and Beaufort leases can proceed , ” a company spokesman told Reuters .
Reilly ’s conflict of interest in this case seems clear .
Imagine the outrage if George W. Bush or a hypothetical President McCain had appointed a paid - up oilman , benevolent or not , to such a position .
But Obama gets a free ride .
Why ?
Now , Reilly is not the first Obama appointee with direct ties to the oil industry .
Indeed , two former BP execs now occupy high posts within , respectively , the Department of Energy and the Minerals Management Service .
In March 2009 , the president named BP ’s chief scientist , Steve Koonin , to the post of undersecretary of science to the Department of Energy .
The pick drew little criticism within green circles at the time — perhaps because at BP , Koonin ’s role was evidently to take the oil giant “ beyond petroleum . ”
As Koonin ’s DOE bio puts it :
At BP since 2004 , Koonin was responsible for the long - range technology strategy of going ‘ beyond petroleum ’ to alternative and renewable energy sources , providing technical advice to senior executives , and managing in the firm ’s university - based research programs .
In retrospect , the lack of protest around the choice of Koonin seems foolish .
Well before the calamity now transpiring in the Gulf , BP ’s “ beyond petroleum ” campaign was looking like a farce .
Its pre-Deepwater Horizon safety record , for example , was much worse than that of its much - vilified rival Exxon .
According to ABC News :
In the last five years , investigators found , BP has admitted to breaking U.S. environmental and safety laws and committing outright fraud .
BP paid $ 373 million in fines to avoid prosecution .
BP ’s safety violations far outstrip its fellow oil companies .
According to the Center for Public Integrity , in the last three years , BP refineries in Ohio and Texas have accounted for 97 percent of the “ egregious , willful ” violations handed out by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) .
And what of BP ’s much - heralded investments in alternative energy ?
They turn out to be so sparse that in 2008 , Greenpeace UK awarded the company its “ Emerald Paintbrush award for worst greenwash . ”
In 2008 , Greenpeace reports , the company put $ 20 billion — 93 percent of total investments — into oil and gas exploration .
Solar and wind projects got 1.39 percent and 2.79 percent , respectively .
For all we know , Koonin could well have been a progressive force within BP .
Like Reilly , he seems like a relatively benevolent oilman .
Still , he was the public face of a campaign that turned out to be a green gloss on a company whose long - term fortunes are clearly tied to petroleum drilling , processing , and vending .
Why should we expect him to move the Department of Energy “ beyond petroleum , ” when he so clearly failed to do so for BP ?
Then there ’s Sylvia V. Baca , whom Obama tapped last summer to serve as deputy administrator for land and minerals management at the now - infamous Minerals Management Service .
As Mother Jones ’ Kate Sheppard reported last week , Baca had spent her previous eight years as a BP exec .
Kate points to Baca ’s official MMS bio :
Baca had been general manager for Social Investment Programs and Strategic Partnerships at BP America Inc. in Houston , and had held several senior management positions with the company since 2001 , focusing on environmental initiatives , overseeing cooperative projects with private and public organizations , developing health , safety , and emergency response programs and working on climate change , biodiversity and sustainability objectives .
The bit about “ health , safety , and emergency response programs ” should give us pause .
As noted above , BP has the worst safety record of any oil major operating in the United States .
As for “ emergency response , ” the company was woefully unprepared for a blowout at Deepwater , as evidenced by the experimental nature of its attempts to plug the leak — and their repeated failures .
And where did Baca work before setting up shop at BP ?
Why , at the Mineral Management Service .
Sheppard aptly dubs Baca an “ excellent example of the revolving door between government and industry . ”
I frankly find it pathetic that Obama ’s oil - soaked appointments have not inspired public outrage in light of the ecological calamity taking place in the Gulf .
It ’s as if Obama ’s status as “ not - Bush ” has lulled progressives into a stupor .
But getting the Texas oilman out of the White House obviously did not end the industry ’s influence over the executive branch .
If Obama is serious about confronting climate change and reducing oil dependency , he can start by purging his administration of petro hacks .
But I doubt he ’ll do so without a major push from progressives .
Six young British consumers swap their luxury lives for the simple mud huts and shanty towns of Africa and Asia to work alongside the people who mine , manufacture , process and recycle luxury goods
Amid the pain and anguish of the London bombings , one significant narrative was lost – that of British Muslims .
They became victims , both of the terrorists and of overzealous sections of the media , which accepted the terrorists ' definitions of Islam and imposed them blindly on Muslim communities living in the UK .
This strange symbiotic relationship between a section of our media and that of the terrorist groups has silenced and disenfranchised ordinary British Muslims .
The majority of British Muslims have watched helplessly as a section of the media has encouraged leadership of the Muslim community to be overtaken by fringe elements , whipping up passions through an iconography of angry Muslims , deployed to discredit the rest of the country 's Muslim population .
This tragedy has not only redefined and refocused the way Muslims are perceived by others , but , perhaps more poignantly , has also redefined the way Muslims see themselves .
Muslims categorically reject terror as a means of achieving political goals .
Every Muslim group of any standing has unreservedly condemned 7 July bombings .
Unfortunately , the media has failed to give sufficient prominence to this overwhelming condemnation , and has often even " counterbalanced " them with statements from wholly unrepresentative fringe groups which support terrorism or extremism .
Without a doubt , this has left the British public confused as to what Muslims actually believe .
As a result , many Muslims feel they have to propitiate other people 's prejudice and ignorance .
In the face of the avalanche of negative imagery emitted almost daily , this task seems almost impossible .
Government policies born out of 7/7 , perhaps informed by political expediency , have stigmatised Muslims en masse .
This has led to further stereotyping and humiliation .
The pressure created by policies such as Prevent has placed a terrible burden upon Muslims to identify , fight and root out terrorists from within their communities .
These demands imposed on Muslims have been displaced from a government that admits its own incapacity to implement them , despite its institutional and financial power .
The government 's policies have not only stigmatised Muslim communities but also created such suspicion and discord that Muslim communities have actually been discouraged from talking about and reflecting upon extremism and terrorism .
Those who want to engage in open debate fear being cast out as Prevent opportunists – those who have massively benefited from the money and resources that the government has apparently poured into the control and prevention of extremism .
While researching for my book , 7/7 : Muslim Perspectives , I met a great deal of resistance from Muslims to expressing their feelings .
Many people I approached were uncomfortable in discussing the subject ; some feared it might attract adverse interest from the security services , others appeared worn down by the continuing media focus .
I encountered the greatest reluctance among young male Muslims , many of whom feared being spied upon .
A woman teacher bluntly asked me if this exercise had anything to do with the intelligence agencies .
She refused to contribute , as she thought it was part of the Prevent programme , and therefore most likely to be a " monitoring " project .
In the five years since the bombing , Islamophobia and anti-Muslim violence in Britain have grown disproportionately and become increasingly acceptable within mainstream culture .
I learned of a moving incident from a Metropolitan police community outreach officer , which typifies the prevailing , scarcely acknowledged atmosphere .
Having noticed his nine - year - old son showing signs of unease and worry , he decided to check up on him .
After a few affectionate remarks , the son turned to his father and enquired : " Dad … it is only Muslims who can become terrorists , innit ? "
In today 's Britain , negative characterisations of Muslims haunt the imagination of young children ; a reality to which many Muslim schoolchildren in playgrounds have become accustomed .
The most challenging and disturbing aspect of Muslim life that can fuel radicalisation is an increasingly hate - filled and divisive discourse that casts Muslims as different and as the " other " .
This rhetoric , often traded by " experts " in anti-Muslim thinktanks , is also naively accepted by some politicians and advanced by a section of media .
It gives the feeling to many British Muslims that they need continuously to prove their " oath of fealty " , their love for and loyalty to the country .
In spite of their repeated expression of allegiance , they feel they are going to be scapegoated anyway .
Changing such an attitude is the most important work to be done , but unless this is urgently undertaken , the prophecies of terror may be unwittingly fulfilled .
The way Chris Bosh finished his final season in Toronto left a sour taste in Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo 's mouth .
Bosh , an unrestricted free agent , left the Raptors earlier this month , joining Dwyane Wade and LeBron James with the Miami Heat in a sign - and - trade deal .
In an interview on 590 The Fan in Toronto , Colangelo said Bosh chose to sit out several games with an injury late in the season as the Raptors battled for the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs -- a race they lost by one game to the Chicago Bulls .
" Despite limited swelling and any excessive damage on an MRI , he felt like he needed to sit for six more games , " Colangelo said on 590 The Fan on Monday .
" I 'm not even questioning Chris ' injury .
I 'm telling you he was cleared to play subject to tolerance on his part , and the tolerance just apparently was n't there and he chose not to play . "
The team 's season was on the brink and the front office was hoping Bosh would return sooner to turn things around , Colangelo said .
Now , he 's not certain whether Bosh was thinking about the Raptors ' playoff run or his own pending free agency .
" Whether he was mentally checked out or just was n't quite into it down the stretch , he was n't the same guy , " Colangelo said .
" I think everybody saw that , but no one wanted to acknowledge it . "
Colangelo also said it was hard to build around Bosh as the team 's franchise player .
" We tried in vain to put pieces around Chris .
Different pieces , different styles .
It did n't work out , " he said .
" No matter what type of player we brought in , it did n't seem to have the right mix with him as that centerpiece . "
China has introduced a new version of its standard 9 mm military pistol ( the Type 92 ) .
The new version has a polymer body , a longer ( by 8.5 percent ) barrel , a Picatinny accessory rail and several minor changes , apparently the result of user feedback .
The original Type 92 was a 1.7 pound ( 790 gram ) weapon with a 4.33 inch ( 111 mm ) barrel .
The 15 round magazines had quality control issues and the 14.5 pound double - action trigger pull was not popular either .
The Type 92 is slowly replacing the Type 54 , which is a Chinese copy of the 890 gram Russian World War II era T - 33 .
This weapon uses the 7.62x25 mm cartridge , and the Russians stopped making them in 1954 , three years after China began producing it .
The Chinese still produce the Type 54 , but in a version chambered for the 9x19 mm Parabellum , which is a world standard for pistols .
The Type 92 is also available in a version chambered for the Chinese 5.8x27 mm cartridge , for which a 20 round box magazine is available .
Both the Type 54 and Type 92 are exported for military , police and civilian use .
The Type 54 is very popular with Chinese gangsters .
Chinese pistols are not noted for their slick design , but rather for their low price .
The U.S. currently uses the M9 , which is a 952 gram ( 34 ounce ) , 8.5 inch ( 217 mm ) long weapon that has a 4.9 inch ( 125 mm ) barrel and a magazine that holds 15 rounds .
It replaced the M1911 .45 ( 11.4 mm ) caliber ACP .
This was a 1.1 kg ( 39 ) ounce , 8.25 inch ( 210 mm ) long weapon with a 5 inch ( 127 mm ) barrel and a 7 round magazine .
Both pistols are only accurate at up to about 50 meters .
The M1911 has more hitting power , while the M9 is a bit more accurate .
SEOUL , South Korea 
When Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan abruptly stepped down Wednesday , largely for his failure to move an American air base off Okinawa , he was essentially admitting he had not won popular support for a prominent campaign pledge : ending Japan ’s postwar dependence on the United States for its security .
“ This has proved impossible in my time , ” Mr. Hatoyama said in a teary speech to explain his decision to step down .
“ Someday , the time will come when Japan ’s peace will have to be ensured by the Japanese people themselves . ”
Mr. Hatoyama ’s plunge in popularity , just eight months after his victory ended a half - century of nearly unbroken one - party control , suggested that the Japanese public had rejected his attempt to rethink Japan ’s cold - war - era alliance with the United States , its most important ally .
Rising tensions between North and South Korea in recent weeks and an increasingly assertive China reinforced the public ’s sense that Japan needed the United States more than ever .
The Obama administration ’s reaction to the resignation suggested that it would not miss Mr. Hatoyama much either .
The White House , in its statement , pointedly did not thank or praise him , saying only that the alliance would “ continue to strengthen , ” regardless of who was in charge .
Senior officials often seemed frustrated by his decision - making , and President Obama never developed a rapport with him .
When last we saw director Christopher Nolan , he was wreaking havoc on the streets of Chicago and blowing up buildings with " The Dark Knight . "
Because of that , the anticipation factor is pretty high for his dream - probing new film , " Inception , " starring Leonardo DiCaprio .
In Los Angeles recently , DiCaprio told me that he thinks that 's a good thing .
Leonardo DiCaprio : I think any film that has a lot of expectation and that can actually deliver is something very rare in Hollywood these days .
This is a very ambitious film ; it 's high concept art and Chris Nolan is a visionary filmmaker .
He created this world all by himself .
It 's something that he 's been thinking about for eight years , so we all really jumped on the opportunity to be a part of that experience .
But I think he knows to never underestimate his audiences .
Q : What does he do to prepare his actors and pass on his passion to you ?
DiCaprio :
He makes you feel comfortable . …
I 'm there to try to create a character that is emotionally palpable and realistic .
Q : After doing this movie , did you have a different interpretation or expectation from your own dreams ?
DiCaprio : I tried to take a very conventional approach to researching this movie , so I read all about dream analysis .
I tried to approach this like I 've approached other films , but I realized very quickly that that was n't going to work .
This was Chris Nolan 's dream world , and he had his own set of rules and his own structure to it .
When you talk about the world of the dream , you immediately think that anything is possible and that world is infinite .
But he put his own structure to it , so I needed to understand what that Rubik 's Cube was in his mind .
It took months to tap into how my character directly related to these different levels of the subconscious .
It was an insane experience , but a very unique and sort of sci - fi experience .
Q : Back in the real world , you are very involved in all things environmental .
What 's your reaction to what 's going on with the oil spill in the gulf ?
DiCaprio :
Like everyone else , I 'm depending on , and everyone 's hoping that our president is going to make the right decisions .
I have faith in him ; I think he 's a thoughtful person with good intentions for our country and our environment and the people that have been affected by the oil spill . …
And we need to make sure that ultimately we understand that oil is a finite resource and we 're running out of it , and we need to use that oil to start paving the way to new solutions for creating energy .

A police officer captured by a surveillance camera repeatedly striking an Iraq war veteran with his baton while the veteran lay in the lobby of a housing project in Manhattan was acquitted Monday of assault and other charges .
Jurors deliberated in State Supreme Court in Manhattan for about a day before rendering the verdict for the officer , David London .
Officer London , who has been on desk duty since the episode in July 2008 , showed no emotion as the forewoman read the words “ not guilty ” on each of the counts against him : second - degree assault , filing false records , falsifying business records and making a false written statement .
But moments later , Officer London  flanked by his lawyers , Stephen C. Worth and Cary London , who is not related to the officer  bowed in his seat and sobbed , clutching crumpled tissue and a small red Bible in his fist .

I recently read an article at Cracked .com discussing six things from history that we all picture incorrectly .
The Great Pyramids of Egypt and velociraptors are included .
Also included is Jesus , and the many incarnations that his visual representation has taken on throughout the years .
My favorite is the Chinese version , not necessarily because of how he looks , but because I could n’t stop laughing when I read the simple caption below the following picture at the Cracked article : “ Chinesus ! ”

Actually , would n’t it be Chinesus Clist ?

Millions of England fans have watched England win their crunch World Cup match against Slovenia .
The result prompted celebrations across the country , where many businesses and schools had made special arrangements for people to watch the match .
The 1 - 0 victory saw England qualify for the second round in South Africa , following a strike from Jermaine Defoe .
But thousands of fans in south - west London and Salford missed the match as power cuts affected homes .
Power was out in areas in south - west London for most of the game , while 1,300 homes were affected in the Eccles area .
One of those hit was TV presenter Declan Donnelly .
" We were watching the game in a pub in Kew , " he told the BBC News website .
" One minute before the goal , the power went . "
Kew resident Chris Caulfield 's viewing was also disrupted .
" I can't believe I have a HD wide - screen TV and we 're listening to the match on a wind - up radio .
God bless Trevor Baylis . "
An estimated 100,000 fans watched the match at the Glastonbury Festival .
England fans in the country travelled to Port Elizabeth to watch the game , which was played at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium .
Fans leaving the stadium said they felt the team had finally got their World Cup campaign under way .
Dan Thomas , 30 , a sales manager from Guildford , Surrey , said : " It was an excellent game .
We defended well , passed well , it was a completely different performance . "
Image caption Residents in west London had to resort to wind - up radios
He said he was now going to cancel his ticket home to stay for the next match .
Derek Zackon , 50 , from Carshalton , south - west London , said : " It was a nervous start but they got the job done .
" The whole country must have been on the edge of their seats for the last 15 minutes . "
Many schools in the UK closed early to let pupils see the game .
Students at John Cleveland College , in Leicestershire , were told last week they could leave early .
It said it had a positive response , with only two or three people expressing concerns .
The Association of School and College Lecturers said it was a matter for individual schools to decide , but it was not really a problem as most schoolchildren finished at 3 pm and would be home for 4 pm .
Some local authorities allowed staff to use their flexi - time to watch the match .
Analysis England had enough chances in the second half to make this a much more comfortable and convincing win .
Questions remain about their ability to dominate lesser opponents but in the last 16 there wo n't be many of them anyway .
At least the mood of the fans is lifting .
" We 're not going home " rung out on the streets outside the stadium here in Port Elizabeth , inside it felt like a home game , with huge local support .
Their loyalties will be split in Bloemfontein if the reward for finishing second to the USA is a last 16 clash with Ghana .
England 's recent record against Germany - their other potential oppenents - is good , and the team is at least on this performance improving .
Fans ' nerves exposed during game Defoe fires England into last 16 Can you watch ? :

The Local Government Association said it depended on the job , as a community support officer on shift was a different matter to someone working in the post room .
" If you look at it from a common sense perspective , you can make arrangements so an employee can make time up later in the week , that 's a reasonable approach , " a spokesman said .
" It 's finding a balance between what everyone wants to get out of it , watching England win , and ensuring services continue as normal . "
Meanwhile , Downing Street said the prime minister had a meeting with the Irish Taoiseach Brian Cowan at 1515 BST but would try to watch the second half .
On Tuesday , the TUC called on bosses to let staff watch the match either at work or away from the office if appropriate .
The union 's general secretary Brendan Barber said employers should discuss the issue with workers " to avoid any tensions " .
But a survey of more than 140 firms by the London Chamber of Commerce found that two - thirds were not making any special arrangements as they could not afford the drop in productivity .
Supermarket giant Tesco appointed 1,900 " World Cup Champions " with responsibilities which include organising flexible rotas so staff could watch the games , and communicating all match fixtures and in - store World Cup related activities to colleagues .
David Potts , retail director at Tesco , said : " We have a diverse workforce and many will want to watch their countries play and so we are doing all we can to accommodate this with options to shift swap or make the time up at a later date as well as playing all matches within our staff rooms . "
Cereal manufacturer Kellogg 's erected big screens for 600 staff in the central atrium of the company 's Manchester HQ .

Military personnel serving in Afghanistan were not able to watch the match live , the Ministry of Defence said , but a replay of the game would be shown on the British Forces Broadcasting Service ( BFBS ) .
Troops in more remote locations , without satellite TV , would be sent a DVD later , the MoD added .
Wimbledon rules prevent the screening of the World Cup .
The club has refused to relent on this ban and did not publicly show the match on its big screen .
Meanwhile , for those who wanted to fit in shopping around the match , the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent showed the game in one of its cinemas for free .
Heathrow Airport in west London has installed extra screens in each terminal to allow people flying out to catch the matches .
And for those who would rather be outdoors there were big screens in a handful of cities - Leeds , Manchester , Leicester , Middlesbrough and Swansea .
Behavioral problems with children can result from problems within the family , trouble with friends and health problems like mild autism or a myriad of other things .
If you know your kid well , you may believe none of these is the case .
Indeed , you know that you can chalk up many behavioral problems to plain old boredom .
Most schools teach everything in a homogenizing manner with courses that are designed to work well with the typical students .
Your child is , of course , a unique student , who has a unique way of learning .
While teachers at the school your child attends may recommend that you talk to your family doctor and get a prescription for one of the popular behavioral changing drugs on the market , do n’t feel like you must take their advice .
Read this !
Many of the people we study who are our “ so called ” geniuses of the past would have been diagnosed with ADD or similar learning disabilities by today ’s educational standards .
But there is a way to get your child to change his or her behavior without using medication .
Parents have reached phenomenal success by closely examining their child ’s thoughts and behavior and discovering what it is about the learning process the child finds boring .
This kind of parenting may seem to take more time than some families have to offer but rest assured there are shortcuts along the way .
One such shortcut for quickly getting to the bottom of what is causing your child ’s problems at school is to ask him or her to keep a daily journal .
Much can be learned from reviewing your child ’s writing , especially when she is allowed to write freely about her feelings .
It is probable that a child will take the process of writing their thoughts down more seriously than verbal communication , in part due to the difficulty of the task .
That is why you can give more credence to how your child expresses themselves on paper rather than on analyzing every “ off the cuff ” remark they might make to you .
When you read your child ’s journal – with their permission of course !
– you will find what subjects they are truly interested in and why .
You can take this information and use it to find ways of challenging your child by giving them extra opportunities to explore and study a topic of interest .
Very soon your child will see , on his or her own , more in - depth exploration of a subject can help him or her to decipher and interpret information .
An example that is easy to understand would be for a child who is interested in art .
Encourage him to learn about art history and to explore his love for general history as it relates to periods in time surrounding the creation of their favorite art pieces .
Once the child ’s mind is challenged by learning , boredom will slip away and so too will the behavioral problems in school .
Vrooom !

Here is an excerpt from MaryEllen Resendez 's article on ABC15.com :
" Two men shot earlier this week could be the result of the ongoing battle between Mexican drug cartels now spilling over deep into Arizona , officials say .
Pinal County investigators say an area known as the smuggling corridor now stretches from Mexico 's border to metro Phoenix .
The area , once an area for family hiking and off road vehicles has government signs warning residents of the drug and human smugglers .
Night vision cameras have photographed military armed cartel members delivering drugs to vehicles along Highway 8 .
' We are three counties deep .
How is it that you see pictures like these , not American with semi and fully automatic rifles .
How is that okay ? ' asked Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu .
Babeu said he no longer has control over parts of his county .
' We are outgunned , we are out manned and we do n't have the resources here locally to fight this , ' he said at a Friday news conference ...
Babeu said he does n't believe the drug cartel problems will not be solved when SB 1070 becomes a law , or with President Obama 's promise of 1,200 troops spread out among four border states .
' It will fall short .
What is truly needed in 3,000 soldiers for Arizona alone , ' Babeu said . "

Analysis : I 've written at length about the debate over border violence " spillover " - the confusion over what it really entails , and whether or not it 's actually happening .
The naysayers point to crime statistics , which in several major border cities show that the incidence of major crimes has gone down .
El Paso is even considered the 2nd or 3rd safest city in the whole country .
However , I do n't believe you can use crime statistics alone to determine whether or not border violence spillover is occurring ; there is just way too much anecdotal evidence to the contrary .
Sometimes people point to a few sheriffs in border counties and say they 're just being paranoid .
However , this county is not even along the border - it's three counties in and roughly 80 miles from Arizona 's border with Mexico .
Even more disturbing is this image I was sent this morning of a sign posted along mile marker 150 of Interstate 8 by the US Bureau of Land Management :
If you 're a tourist or any other American driving along I - 8 and see this sign , what are you going to think ?
Personally , you can tell me a hundred times that San Diego and El Paso and other cities along the border have declining crime rates , but if I see this sign , I 'm going to book it out of there as fast as I can .
Worse yet , this sign comes across ( to me , anyway ) as an acknowledgement by a federal government agency that this activity is occurring well within US territory with their knowledge , and US law enforcement does n't have the resources to protect everyone from the threat posed by drug and human smugglers .
Here 's a local news video relative to the story :
If this situation does n't constitute border violence spillover , then I do n't know what does .
The launch of Dell 's Streak 5 - inch tablet - phone is quickly turning into a fiasco , despite the company 's attempts to bring clarity to the matter .
Official information about the Dell Streak conflicts with other official information .
Web pages that reveal more details about the Streak 's price and release date have appeared and disappeared .
Even the Streak 's name has changed , once dubbed the Mini 5 .
In other words , this is how you do n't introduce a new product .
Here are some of the ways the Dell Streak launch has gone wrong :
Price
At the D8 Conference in early June , Dell Communication Solutions President Ron Gerriques said the Streak would cost $ 500 unlocked .
This week , people who pre-ordered supposedly had access to a purchase page , where the price was listed as $ 550 unlocked , $ 300 with a two - year AT&T contract .
That page no longer exists , and neither Dell nor AT&T will confirm the information .
Release Date
Dell also posted a notice to its website on Tuesday saying online Dell Streak sales would begin Wednesday , backing up Gerriques ' claim at D8 that the Streak would go in sale by the end of July .
Dell then pulled the notice from its website and told Computerworld that it was a mistake .
" I can say definitely that the Dell Streak wo n't go on sale in July , " spokesman Matt Parretta added .
For now , the Dell Streak release date is sometime this summer .
Someone needs to tell that to whoever runs the product information sign - up page , which still says , " The Dell Streak will be available for purchase in late July ! "
Carrier
On Monday , Dell 's community blogger Lionel Menchaca clarified that the Streak is coming only to AT&T .
An earlier filing to the Federal Communications Commission suggested that the Streak would also be available on T - Mobile , but Menchaca said the device will not be certified for T - Mobile 's overall network and there are no plans to support the carrier 's 3G network .
I understand that interpretations of FCC filings are basically rumor , but this should have been clarified earlier .
A couple of commenters at Dell 's blog put off buying a T - Mobile - subsidized Nexus One in favor of the oversized Streak , and now they 're out of luck on both fronts , with the Nexus One discontinued .
Just to be clear , I 'm not knocking the Streak itself .
Early reviews have been mixed , but it 's definitely a unique product and I think techies could have a fun time trying to use it as a gigantic smartphone alternative with VoIP .
Dell just needs to get its act together , stop churning out conflicting information , and launch the darned thing already .
... and it works great !
I built a dual Xeon machine back in 2004 , and earlier this year it was finally reaching the end of its useful life for me .
It was big , loud , and hot , and I was using an old Dell laptop I bought for $ 200 more and more .
I wanted to consolidate into just one machine , so a few weeks ago I bought a brand new Lenovo Thinkpad T410s , which is one great laptop !
Now , this has the Intel integrated graphics , which works great for most of my tasks , but I do like to play a game every once in awhile .
Certainly , the integrated graphics on this new laptop actually offer better performance than my old computer , but still not good for gaming at all .
The game that gets most of my time , EVE Online , could run but only with every single graphic option turned to " Lowest " or " Off . "
Not pretty .
I wanted to have better gaming performance while in my home office ( I do n't game " on the go " ) .
I thought about building a small gaming desktop , but that would have added another computer back into the mix and I really liked the idea of just having the one machine with all my stuff on it .
So , I needed to upgrade the graphics performance of my Thinkpad .
Luckily , some members of the community over at NoteBookReview have been busy figuring out how to hook up desktop graphics cards to laptops .
Using a couple parts from a Taiwan manufacturer called HWTools , it is possible to connect a desktop graphics card to the laptop using either ExpressCard or internal mPCIe connectors ( or both ) .
An external power supply is also needed .
Some caveats : an external monitor is needed - this will not run the laptops internal screen .
It is not a mobile solution - this is great for people like me , who game at their desk with external monitors .
PCIe bandwidth through ExpressCard or an mPCIe connector is not 16 x like on desktop PCIe , it is only 1x .
This limits the performance of the card to only 60 - 70 % of its full potential if connected by 16 x .
Still , it is a tremendous improvement over the integrated graphics !
The part from HWTools will allow for an x2 link on some laptops if you use two physical connections ( i.e. ExpressCard and mPCIe or two mPCIe ) .
This allows performance at 80 - 90 % of 16 x .
Final caveat , this thing can be a major pain in the ass to get set up .
It is not plug and play , with many ( most ) laptops requiring custom boot disks to handle memory and pci allocations issues that prevent the setup from functioning until taken care of .
Fortunately , just today NBR member nand o4 released a new bootdisk package that introduces some much - needed ease to the configuration process .
So , I ordered a Sapphire 2GB 5850 , an Antec 550W PSU , and the necessary parts from HWTools .
Spent today fiddling around with it , setting it up .
Luckily , the T410s did not require any fiddling with PCI , IGP , or memory allocation to get working .
Most machines need it , so yay for me .
On the flipside , however , I did find that an x2 link is not possible for my Thinkpad at this time .
My two internal mPCIe connections are not numbered correctly for this to happen .
I will wait to see if any workarounds are developed in the future .
Still , even on an x1 link , I am extremely pleased .
With x1 , it is very convenient to hook up the 5850 - just dock and sleep the laptop , plug in the vid card to ExpressCard , switch monitors to vid card input , and wake up - now I have real gaming performance !
I can now run EVE Online at full 1920x1200 resolution , 8xAA , 8xAF , with every graphics option set to full at 100 fps .
I know EVE is not a graphically demanding game by today 's standards but it is a shocking improvement to me who is used to playing with all graphics options set to poop - like quality .
I have been out of the " hardware scene " for years , so I do not know what benchmarks people like to use today , so I ran 3DMark06 .
With the integrated graphics , my score was 1,720 .
With the 5850 hooked up , I get 12,765 !
Very wonderful for me and now I can try all sorts of new games that I could n't before .

App Engine ’s Java SDK ships with three different mechanisms for persisting data :
JPA – the javax .
persistence .* package
JDO – Java Data Objects
The low - level API
The formal documentation has got some good examples for working with JDO and JPA , but the documentation for working with the low - level API is still a tad sparse .
The original purpose of the low - level API was to provide developers a way to build libraries that could do persistence or even build persistence libraries themselves – alternative persistence mechanisms such as Objectify , Twig , SimpleDS and Slim3 all build on top of this API .
For most developers , it may be simpler to use either JDO , JPA or a third - party library , but there are cases in which the low - level API is useful .
This post will be a beginner ’s guide to writing and retrieving data using this API – we ’ll save more advanced topics for future posts .
For those newer to App Engine , let ’s define a few terms before we continue :
Entity –
An entity is an object representation of a datastore row .
Unlike a row in a relational database , there are no predefined columns .
There ’s only one giant Bigtable , and your entities are all part of that table .
Entity Kind –
There are no tables corresponding to types of data .
The Kind of the entity is stored as part of the Entity Key .
Entity Key –
The primary way by which entities are fetched – even when you issue queries , the datastore does a batch get by key of entities .
It ’s similar to a primary key in an RDBMS .
The Key encodes your application ID , your Entity ’s Kind , any parent entities and other metadata .
Description of the key is out of scope of this article , but you ’ll be able to find plenty of content about Keys when you refer to your favorite search engine .
Properties – Entities do n’t have columns – they have properties .
A property represents a field of your Entity .
For instance , a Person Entity would have a Kind of Person , a Key corresponding to a unique identifier corresponding to their name ( for all real world scenarios , this is only true for me , as I ’m the only Ikai Lan in the world ) , and Properties : age , height , weight , eye color , etc .
There are a lot more terms , but these are the ones we ’ll be using frequently in this article .
Let ’s describe a few key features of the low - level API which differ from using a higher level tool such as the JDO and JPA interfaces .
Depending on your point of view , these could be either advantages or disadvantages :
Typeless entities .
Think of an Entity as a Java class with a Key property ( datastore Key ) , a Kind property ( String ) and Properties ( HashMap of Properties ) .
This means that for a given entity kind , it is possible to have two different entities with completely different properties .
You could have a Person entity that defines age and weight as its properties , and a separate Person entity that defines height and eye color .
No Managers .
You instantiate a DatastoreService from a DatastoreServiceFactory , then you get ( ) , put ( ) and query ( ) *.
No need to worry about opening or closing managers , detaching objects , marking items dirty , and so forth .
You instantiate a DatastoreService from a DatastoreServiceFactory , then you get ( ) , put ( ) and query ( ) *.
No need to worry about opening or closing managers , detaching objects , marking items dirty , and so forth .
Lower startup time .
For lower traffic Java websites , loading a PersistenceManagerFactory or EntityManagerFactory can incur additional startup time cost .
We ’ll cover queries in a future post .
In this post , we ’ll just use get ( ) and put ( ) .
In this article , we ’ll treat App Engine ’s datastore as if it were just a giant Map .
Frankly , this is n’t a bad simplication – at its lowest level , Bigtable is a key - value store , which means that the Map abstraction is n’t too far from reality .
Let ’s create two Entities representing Persons .
We ’ll name them Alice and Bob .
Let ’s define them now :
import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Entity ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore .Key ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore .KeyFactory ; Entity alice = new Entity ( " Alice " , " Person " ) ; alice.setProperty (" gender " , " female " ) ; alice.setProperty ( " age " , 20 ) ; Key bobKey = KeyFactory.createKey ( " Person " , " Bob " ) ; Entity bob = new Entity ( bobKey ) ; bob.setProperty ( " gender " , " male " ) ; bob.setProperty ( " age " , " 23 " ) ;
What we ’ve demonstrated here are two of the basic ways to create entities .
Entity contains five constructors .
We ’re just demonstrating two of them here .
We ’re defining Alice with a raw constructor .
We ’re passing two Strings : her key name as well as her kind .
As we mentioned before – Entities are typeless , and we can specify just about any String as her type .
Effectively , this means that the number of kinds we can have is limited only by the number of kinds that we need , and as long as we do n’t lose track of them , we could potentially have hundreds of different kinds without having to create a class for each one .
We could even define new kinds at runtime , if we so dared .
The key name is what we ’ll use to retrieve Alice later on when we need her again .
Think of it as a Map or Dictionary Key .
Once we have an Entity object , we need to define her properties .
For now , we ’ll define her gender and her age .
Note that , again , Properties behave like Maps , and this means that not only can Entities have hundreds of types of different properties , we could also create new properties at runtime at the expense of compiler type - safety .
Choose your poison carefully .
We ’re creating Bob ’s instance a bit differently , but not too differently .
Using KeyFactory ’s static createKey method , we create a Key instance .
Note the constructor arguments – they are exactly the same : a kind and a key name .
In our simple example , this does n’t really give us any additional benefits except for adding an additional line of code , but more advanced usages in which we may want to create an Entity with a parent , this technique may result in more clear code .
And again – we set Bob ’s properties using something similar to a Map .
If you ’ve been reading Entity ’s Javadoc or following along in your IDE , you ’ve probably realized by now that Entity does not contain setKey ( ) or setKind ( ) methods .
This is because an Entity ’s key is immutable .
Once an Entity has a key , it can never be changed .
You cannot retrieve an Entity from the datastore and change its key – you must create a new Entity with a new Key and delete the old Entity .
This is also true of Entities instantiated in local memory .
Speaking of unsaved Entities , let ’s go ahead and save them now .
We ’ll create an instance of the Datastore client and save Alice and Bob :
import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.DatastoreService ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.DatastoreServiceFactory ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Entity ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore .Key ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore .KeyFactory ; Entity alice = new Entity ( " Person " , " Alice " ) ; alice.setProperty (" gender " , " female " ) ; alice.setProperty ( " age " , 20 ) ; Key bobKey = KeyFactory.createKey ( " Person " , " Bob " ) ; Entity bob = new Entity ( bobKey ) ; bob.setProperty ( " gender " , " male " ) ; bob.setProperty ( " age " , " 23 " ) ; DatastoreService datastore = DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService ( ) ; datastore.put( alice ) ; datastore.put ( bob ) ;
That ’s it !
DatastoreService ’s put ( ) method returns a Key that we can use .
Now let ’s demonstrate retrieving Alice and Bob by Key from another class :
import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.DatastoreService ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.DatastoreServiceFactory ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Entity ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.EntityNotFoundException ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore .Key ; import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.KeyFactory ; Key bobKey = KeyFactory.createKey ( " Person " , " Bob " ) ; Key aliceKey = KeyFactory.createKey ( " Person " , " Alice " ) ; DatastoreService datastore = DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService ( ) ; Entity alice , bob ; try { alice = datastore.get ( aliceKey ) ; bob = datastore.get ( bob Key ) ; Long aliceAge = ( Long ) alice.getProperty ( " age " ) ; Long bobAge = ( Long ) bob.getProperty ( " age " ) ; System.out.println ( ” Alice ’s age : “ + aliceAge ) ; System.out.println ( ” Bob ’s age : “ + bobAge ) ; } catch ( EntityNotFoundException e ) { //
Alice or Bob does n't exist ! }
The DatastoreService instance ’s get ( ) method takes a Key parameter ; this is the same parameter we used earlier to construct the Entity representing Bob !
This methods throws an EntityNotFoundException .
We retrieve individual properties using the Entity class ’s getProperty ( ) method – in the case of age , we cast this to a Long .
So there you have it : the basics of working with the low - level API .
I ’ll likely add more articles in the future about queries , transactions , and more advanced things you can do .
Major General Smedley Butler USMC
Throughout the years various men of military service have spoken up and spoken out against the actions of the American military .
Some men speak up about atrocities that have gone covered up , about discrimination , about deceptions that have been used against the American public , and about actions that have been taken that are contrary to what they view as American principles .
Major General Smedley Butler is one of the most outspoken military service men who opposed the actions of the military that he served in .
Marine Smedley Darling Butler is one of the most highly decorated military men from the pre-World War II era .
He served from 1898 to 1931 and saw action all over the world .
Butler ( second from right ) in Veracruz , Mexico - 1914
Butler became a prominent political figure and was one of America ’s important leaders of the liberal movement of the 1930s .
Butler advocated military isolationism and was against American involvement in World War II .
His isolationist views are certainly unpopular today , and in fact are not compatible with the current geopolitical situation .
His views , however , developed from 33 years of serving as what he called “ a gangster for capitalism . ”
Smedley Butler at his 1931 retirement ceremony
Though Butler was not a member of the American Communist Party he did give speeches at Communist Party meetings in the 1930s as well as many speeches for the League Against War and Fascism .
When asked about the company he was keeping he noted , “ They told me I ’d find a nest of communists here .
I told them ‘ What the hell of it ! ’ ”
Smedley Butler preparing to speak at one of his stops in the 1930s
All told Butler gave over 1,200 speeches in over 700 cities during his speaking tour of the United States .
In 1935 Butler published War is a Racket , which got high praise at the time , as well as strong criticism .
The forward by Lowell Thomas spoke of Butler ’s “ moral as well as physical courage ” and noted that “ Even his opponents concede that in his stand on public questions , General Butler has been motivated by the same fiery integrity and loyal patriotism which has distinguished his service in countless Marine campaigns . ”
What Butler fought so hard to do was to take the focus off of moral and ideological arguments for war and concentrate on the geopolitical factors that actually motivated war .
He tried to raise awareness of what the real motivating factors of war were as well as the consequences of war .
He was one of the first Americans to really bring the economic implications of war to the forefront of the public conscience .
In War is a Racket Butler “ names names ” and lays out in wonderfully blunt detail how the American “ military machine ” was used to the benefit of wealthy American industrialists .
He noted how proponents of war typically call on God as a supporter of the cause and how they embellish the mission as one of liberation and the spreading of freedom , but that these people tend to shy away from discussing the economic details of military ventures .
Butler did n’t choose sides when it came to expressing his views on war .
Butler could certainly be considered a liberal but he spoke out against the liberal FDR administration and also broke ties with anti-fascist groups when they called for war to defend against fascism .
In 1935 he commented to a veterans meeting on the subject of the growing interest in the FDR administration to become involved in the conflicts of Europe that , “ The political leaders of this country are for another conflict to cover up their blunders . ”
Though most today would agree that his isolationist views would have been harmful had they been followed by the country in regard to American involvement in WWII his views on imperialism and the economic implications of war are still as relevant today as ever .
The following is an excerpt from a speech he gave in 1933 :
“ War is just a racket .
A racket is best described , I believe , as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people .
Only a small inside group knows what it is about .
It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses .
I believe in adequate defense at the coastline and nothing else .
If a nation comes over here to fight , then we 'll fight .
The trouble with America is that when the dollar only earns 6 percent over here , then it gets restless and goes overseas to get 100 percent .
Then the flag follows the dollar and the soldiers follow the flag .
I would n't go to war again as I have done to protect some lousy investment of the bankers .
There are only two things we should fight for .
One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights .
War for any other reason is simply a racket .
There is n't a trick in the racketeering bag that the military gang is blind to .
It has its " finger men " to point out enemies , its " muscle men " to destroy enemies , its " brain men " to plan war preparations , and a " Big Boss " Super - Nationalistic - Capitalism .
It may seem odd for me , a military man to adopt such a comparison .
Truthfulness compels me to .
I spent thirty - three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country 's most agile military force , the Marine Corps .
I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major - General .
And during that period , I spent most of my time being a high class muscle - man for Big Business , for Wall Street and for the Bankers .
In short , I was a racketeer , a gangster for capitalism .
I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time .
Now I am sure of it .
Like all the members of the military profession , I never had a thought of my own until I left the service .
My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher - ups .
This is typical with everyone in the military service .
I helped make Mexico , especially Tampico , safe for American oil interests in 1914 .
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in .
I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street .
The record of racketeering is long .
I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909 - 1912 .
I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916 .
In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested .
During those years , I had , as the boys in the back room would say , a swell racket .
Looking back on it , I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints .
The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts .
I operated on three continents . ”
http://www.fas.org/man/smedley.htm
In a few selected quotes from War is a Racket he writes :
WAR is a racket .
It always has been .
It is possibly the oldest , easily the most profitable , surely the most vicious .
It is the only one international in scope .
It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives ...
In the World War a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict .
At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War .
That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns .
How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows ...
Out of war nations acquire additional territory , if they are victorious .
They just take it .
This newly acquired territory promptly is exploited by the few – the selfsame few who wrung dollars out of blood in the war .
The general public shoulders the bill ...
And what is this bill ?
This bill renders a horrible accounting .
Newly placed gravestones .
Mangled bodies .
Shattered minds .
Broken hearts and homes .
Economic instability .
Depression and all its attendant miseries .
Back - breaking taxation for generations and generations ... ... a war that might well cost us tens of billions of dollars , hundreds of thousands of lives of Americans , and many more hundreds of thousands of physically maimed and mentally unbalanced men .
Of course , for this loss , there would be a compensating profit – fortunes would be made .
Millions and billions of dollars would be piled up .
By a few .
Munitions makers .
Bankers .
Ship builders .
Manufacturers .
Meat packers .
Speculators .
They would fare well .
Yes , they are getting ready for another war .
Why should n't they ?
It pays high dividends ...
The normal profits of a business concern in the United States are six , eight , ten , and sometimes twelve percent .
But war - time profits – ah ! that is another matter – twenty , sixty , one hundred , three hundred , and even eighteen hundred per cent – the sky is the limit .
All that traffic will bear .
Uncle Sam has the money .
Let 's get it ...
Of course , it is n't put that crudely in war time .
It is dressed into speeches about patriotism , love of country , and " we must all put our shoulders to the wheel , " but the profits jump and leap and skyrocket – and are safely pocketed .
Butler goes on to name American companies that saw huge increases in profits during World War I .
Below is a listing of pre-war vs. intra-war profits for American companies that are included in Butler ’s analysis as well as some additional companies .
Company Average profits in the last pre-war year Average profits during the four years of war U. S. Steel $ 105,331,000 $ 259,653,000 Du Pont $ 6,092,000 $ 58,076,000 Bethlehem Steel $ 6,840,000 $ 49,427,000 Anaconda Copper $ 10,649,000 $ 34,549,000 Utah Copper $ 5,776,000 $ 21,622,000 American Smelting $ 11,566,000 $ 18,602,000 Republic Iron and Steel $ 4,177,000 $ 17,548,000 International Mercantile $ 6,690,00 $ 14,229,000 Atlas Powder $ 485,000 $ 2,374,000 American and British Man . $ 172,000 $ 325,000 Canadian Car & Foundry $ 1,335,000 $ 2,201,000 Crocker Wheeler $ 206,000 $ 666,000 Hercules Powder $ 1,271,000 $ 7,430,000 Niles , Bement Pond $ 656,000 $ 6,146,000 Scovill Mfg. Co. $ 655,000 $ 7,678,000 General Motors $ 6,954,000 $ 21,700,000
It has been estimated by statisticians and economists and researchers that the war cost your Uncle Sam $ 52,000,000,000 .
Of this sum , $ 39,000,000,000 was expended in the actual war itself .
This expenditure yielded $ 16,000,000,000 in profits .
That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way .
This $ 16,000,000,000 profits is not to be sneezed at .
It is quite a tidy sum .
And it went to a very few ...
Who provides the profits – these nice little profits of 20 , 100 , 300 , 1,500 and 1,800 per cent ?
We all pay them – in taxation .
We paid the bankers their profits when we bought Liberty Bonds at $ 100.00 and sold them back at $ 84 or $ 86 to the bankers .
These bankers collected $ 100 plus .
It was a simple manipulation .
The bankers control the security marts .
It was easy for them to depress the price of these bonds .
Then all of us – the people – got frightened and sold the bonds at $ 84 or $ 86 .
The bankers bought them .
Then these same bankers stimulated a boom and government bonds went to par – and above .
Then the bankers collected their profits .
But the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill .
If you do n't believe this , visit the American cemeteries on the battlefields abroad .
Or visit any of the veteran 's hospitals in the United States .
On a tour of the country , in the midst of which I am at the time of this writing , I have visited eighteen government hospitals for veterans .
In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men – men who were the pick of the nation eighteen years ago .
The very able chief surgeon at the government hospital ; at Milwaukee , where there are 3,800 of the living dead , told me that mortality among veterans is three times as great as among those who stayed at home ...
Perhaps the following sounds familiar of the current Bush administration as well ?
Just replace “ Germans ” with “ Iraqis . ”
So vicious was this war propaganda that even God was brought into it .
With few exceptions our clergymen joined in the clamor to kill , kill , kill .
To kill the Germans .
God is on our side ... it is His will that the Germans be killed .
And in Germany , the good pastors called upon the Germans to kill the allies ... to please the same God .
That was a part of the general propaganda , built up to make people war conscious and murder conscious .
Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die .
This was the " war to end all wars . "
This was the " war to make the world safe for democracy . "
No one mentioned to them , as they marched away , that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits .
No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here .
No one told them that the ships on which they were going to cross might be torpedoed by submarines built with United States patents .
They were just told it was to be a " glorious adventure . " ...
Butler proposed that the only way to actually prevent war is take the profits out of war .
He proposed several ways to achieve this .
What is important to note is that it is possible to take the profitability out of war , but it must be done at an international level .
Taking the profitability out of war and out of the weapons industry is really the way that is most likely to be able to achieve some level of global peace .
Of course there has never been any effort to do this in America , in fact the opposite is true , and right now the Bush administration is making war even more profitable , only ensuring its proliferation .
The General concludes by proclaiming :
TO HELL WITH WAR !

All ,
I received this question from a customer yesterday ( below ) , and unfortunately I do not have the answer .
Please let us know if you know the answer , it would be greatly appreciated ...
" What we are trying to figure out is if removing the packages SUNWpostgr - 83 - devel , SUNWpostgr - 83 - pl , SUNWpostgr - devel , SUNWpostgr - pl will cause any harm to our systems .
For example , in the PDF that you sent yesterday , it states that package SUNWpostgr - pl is part of the core server package .
I am not sure as to what the core server package is , but when you try to remove those packages from prodreg it gives about 2 or 3 warnings on the performing the action .
Just to be on the cautious side , we want to verify that removing those packages will not have any negative impact on our systems .
The reasons behind wanting to perform these actions are CVE - 2010 - 1169 , CVE - 2010 - 1170 , and CVE - 2010 - 1447 . "
Thank You ,
Paul

By George Friedman U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited some interesting spots over the July 4 weekend .
Her itinerary included Poland and Ukraine , both intriguing choices in light of the recent Obama - Medvedev talks in Washington .
But she also traveled to a region that has not been on the American radar screen much in the last two years — namely , the Caucasus — visiting Georgia , Azerbaijan and Armenia .
The stop in Poland coincided with the signing of a new agreement on ballistic missile defense and was designed to sustain U.S. - Polish relations in the face of the German - Russian discussions we have discussed .
The stop in Ukraine was meant simply to show the flag in a country rapidly moving into the Russian orbit .
In both cases , the trip was about the Russians .
Regardless of how warm the atmospherics are between the United States and Russia , the fact is that the Russians are continuing to rebuild their regional influence and are taking advantage of European disequilibrium to build new relationships there , too .
The United States , still focused on Iraq and Afghanistan , has limited surplus capacity to apply to resisting the Russians .
No amount of atmospherics can hide that fact , certainly not from the Poles or the Ukrainians .
Therefore , if not a substantial contribution , the secretary of state 's visit was a symbolic one .
But when there is little of substance , symbols matter .
That the Poland and Ukraine stops so obviously were about the Russians makes the stops in Georgia , Azerbaijan and Armenia all the more interesting .
Clinton 's statements during the Caucasian leg of her visit were positive , as one would expect .
She expressed her support for Georgia without committing the United States to any arms shipments for Georgia to resist the Russians , who currently are stationed inside Georgia 's northern secessionist regions .
In Azerbaijan and Armenia , she called on both countries to settle the issue of Nagorno - Karabakh , a disputed region within western Azerbaijan proper .
Armenia took control of the region by force following the Soviet collapse .
For Azerbaijan , the return of Nagorno - Karabakh under a U.N. resolution is fundamental to its national security and political strategy .
For Armenia , retreat is not politically possible .
This means Clinton 's call for negotiations and her offer of U.S. help are not particularly significant , especially since the call was for Washington to help under the guise of international , not bilateral , negotiations .
This is particularly true after Clinton seemed to indicate that the collapse in Turkish - Armenian talks was Turkey 's responsibility and that it was up to Turkey to make the next move .
Given that her visit to the region seems on the surface to have achieved little — and indeed , little seems to have been intended — it is worth taking time to understand why she went there in the first place , and the region 's strategic significance .
The Strategic Significance of the Caucasus The Caucasus is the point where Russia , Iran and Turkey meet .
For most of the 19th century , the three powers dueled for dominance of the region .
This dispute froze during the Soviet period but is certainly in motion again .
With none of these primary powers directly controlling the region , there are secondary competitions involving Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia , both among these secondary powers and between the secondary powers and the major powers .
And given that the region involves the Russians , Iranians and Turks , it is inevitable that the global power would have an interest as well — hence , Hillary Clinton 's visit .
Of all the regions of the world , this one is among the most potentially explosive .
It is the most likely to draw in major powers and the most likely to involve the United States .
It is quiet now — but like the Balkans in 1990 , quiet does not necessarily reassure any of the players .
Therefore , seven players are involved in a very small space .
Think of it as a cauldron framed by Russia , Iran and Turkey , occasionally stirred by Washington , for whom each of the other three major powers poses special challenges of varying degrees .
The Caucasus region dominates a land bridge between the Black and Caspian seas .
The bridge connects Turkey and Iran to the south with Russia in the north .
The region is divided between two mountain ranges , the Greater Caucasus to the north and the Lesser Caucasus in the south ; and two plains divided from one another , one in Western Georgia on the Black Sea and another , larger plain in the east in Azerbaijan along the Kura River .
A narrow river valley cuts through Georgia , connecting the two plains .
The Greater Caucasus Mountains serve as the southern frontier of Russia .
To the north of these mountains , running east to west , lies the Russian agricultural heartland , flat and without any natural barriers .
Thus , ever since the beginning of the 19th century , Russia has fought for a significant portion of the Caucasus to block any ambitions by the Turkish or Persian empires .
The Caucasus mountains are so difficult to traverse by major military forces that as long as Russia maintains a hold somewhere in the Caucasus , its southern frontier is secure .
During the latter part of the 19th century and for most of the Soviet period ( except a brief time at the beginning of the era ) , the Soviet position in the Caucasus ran along the frontier with Turkey and Persia ( later Iran ) .
Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia were incorporated into the Soviet Union , giving the Soviets a deep penetration of the Caucasus and , along with this , security .
After the fall of the Soviet Union , the three Caucasian republics broke free of Moscow , pushing Russia 's frontier north by between about 160 to 320 kilometers ( 100 - 200 miles ) .
The Russians still maintained a position in the Caucasus , but their position was not secure .
The northern portion of the Caucasus consisted of Chechnya , Ingushetia , Dagestan and others , all of which had significant Islamist insurgencies under way .
If the Russians abandoned the northeastern Caucasus , their position was breached .
But if they stood , they faced an interminable fight .
Georgia borders most of the Russian frontier .
In the chaos of the fall of the Soviet Union , various Georgian regions attempted to secede from Georgia with Russian encouragement .
From the Georgian point of view , Russia represented a threat .
But from the Russian point of view , Georgia represented a double threat .
First , the Russians suspected the Georgians of supporting Chechen rebels in the 1990s — a charge the Georgians deny .
The more important threat was that the United States selected Georgia as its main ally in the region .
The choice made sense if the United States was conducting an encirclement strategy of Russia , which Washington was doing in the 1990s ( though it became somewhat distracted from this strategy after 2001 ) .
In response to what it saw as U.S. pressure around its periphery , the Russians countered in Georgia in 2008 to demonstrate U.S. impotence in the region .
The Russians also maintained a close relationship with Armenia , where they continue to station more than 3,000 troops .
The Armenians are deeply hostile to the Turks over demands that Turkey admit to massacres of large number of Armenians in 1915 - 16 .
The Armenians and Turks were recently involved in negotiations over the normalization of relations , but these talks collapsed — in our view , because of Russian interference .
The issue was further complicated when a U.S. congressional committee passed a resolution in March condemning Turkey for committing genocide , infuriating the Turks .
One of the countercharges against Armenia is that it has conducted its own massacres of Azerbaijanis .
Around the time of the Soviet breakup , it conducted a war against Azerbaijan , replete with the ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis in a region known as Nagorno - Karabakh in western Azerbaijan , leaving Azerbaijan with a massive refugee problem .
While the U.N. Security Council condemned the invasion , the conflict has been frozen , to use the jargon of diplomats .
The Importance of Azerbaijan For its part , Azerbaijan cannot afford to fight a war against Russian troops in Armenia while it also shares a northern border with Russia .
Azerbaijan also faces a significant Iranian problem .
There are more Azerbaijanis living in Iran than in Azerbaijan ; Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is a prominent Azerbaijani - Iranian .
The Soviets occupied all of Azerbaijan during World War II but were forced to retreat under British and American pressure after the war , leaving most of Azerbaijan inside Iran .
The remainder became a Soviet republic and then an independent state .
The Azerbaijanis are deeply concerned about the Iranians .
Azerbaijan is profoundly different from Iran .
It is Muslim but heavily secular .
It maintains close and formal relations with Israel .
It has supported the war in Afghanistan and made logistical facilities available to the United States .
The Azerbaijanis claim that Iran is sending clerics north to build Shiite schools that threaten the regime .
Obviously , Iran also operates an intelligence network there .
Adding to the complexity , Azerbaijan has long been a major producer of oil and has recently become an exporter of natural gas near the capital of Baku , exporting it to Turkey via a pipeline passing through Georgia .
From the Turkish point of view , this provides alternative sources of energy to Russia and Iran , something that obviously pleases the United States .
It is also an obvious reason why Russia sees Azerbaijan as undermining its position as the region 's dominant energy exporter .
The Russians have an interest , demonstrated in 2008 , to move southward into Georgia .
Obviously , if they were able to do this — preferably by a change in government and policy in Tbilisi — they would link up with their position in Armenia , becoming a force both on the Turkish border and facing Azerbaijan .
The Russians would like to be able to integrate Azerbaijan 's exports into its broader energy policy , which would concentrate power in Russian hands and increase Russian influence on Russia 's periphery .
This was made clear by Russia 's recent offer to buy all of Azerbaijan 's natural gas at European - level prices .
The Turks would obviously oppose this for the same reason the Russians would want it .
Hence , the Turks must support Georgia .
Iran , which should be viewed as an Azerbaijani country as well as a Persian one , has two reasons to want to dominate Azerbaijan .
First , it would give Tehran access to Baku oil , and second , it would give Tehran strategic bargaining power with the Russians , something it does not currently have .
In addition , talk of present unrest in Iran notwithstanding , Iran 's single most vulnerable point in the long term is the potential for Azerbaijanis living in Iran to want to unite with an independent Azerbaijani state .
This is not in the offing , but if any critical vulnerability exists in the Iranian polity , this is it .
Consider this from the American side .
When we look at the map , we notice that Azerbaijan borders both Russia and Iran .
That strategic position alone makes it a major asset to the United States .
Add to it oil in Baku and investment by U.S. companies , and Azerbaijan becomes even more attractive .
Add to this that its oil exports support Turkey and weaken Russian influence , and its value goes up again .
Finally , add to it that Turkey infuriated Azerbaijan by negotiating with Armenia without tying the issue of Nagorno - Karabakh to any Turkish - Armenian settlement .
Altogether , the United States has the opportunity to forge a beneficial relationship with Azerbaijan that would put U.S. hands on one of Turkey 's sources of oil .
At a time when the Turks recognize a declining dependence on the United States , anything that could increase that dependence helps Washington .
Moreover , Azerbaijan is a platform from which Washington could make the Iranians uncomfortable , or from which to conduct negotiations with Iran .
An American strategy should include Georgia , but Georgia is always going to be weaker than Russia , and unless the United States is prepared to commit major forces there , the Russians can act , overtly and covertly , at their discretion .
A Georgian strategy requires a strong rear base , which Azerbaijan provides , not only strategically but also as a source of capital for Georgia .
Georgian - Azerbaijani relations are good , and in the long run so is Turkey 's relation with these two countries .
For Azerbaijan , the burning issue is Nagorno - Karabakh .
This is not a burning issue for the United States , but the creation of a stable platform in the region is .
Armenia , by far the weakest country economically , is allied with the Russians , and it has Russian troops on its territory .
Given that the United States has no interest in who governs Nagorno - Karabakh and there is a U.N. resolution on the table favoring Azerbaijan that serves as cover , it is difficult to understand why the United States is effectively neutral .
If the United States is committed to Georgia , which is official policy , then it follows that satisfying Azerbaijan and bringing it into a close relationship to the United States would be beneficial to Washington 's ability to manage relations with Russia , Iran and Turkey .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Azerbaijan a month ago and Clinton visited this weekend .
As complex as the politics of this region are to outsiders , they are clearly increasing in importance to the United States .
We could put it this way : Bosnia and Kosovo were obscure concepts to the world until they blew up .
Nagorno - Karabakh , South Ossetia and Abkhazia are equally obscure now .
They will not remain obscure unless strategic measures are taken .
It is not clear to us that Clinton was simply making a courtesy call or had strategy on her mind .
But the logic of the American position is that it should think strategically about the Caucasus , and in doing so , logic and regional dynamics point to a strong relationship with Azerbaijan .
“ Coathanger Christ ” on display in Scotland ( Click image for story )
So I had this crazy idea that on Thursday I might start a new blog segment called Throwback Thursday where I look back at a wrestler from the past and explore his / her journey through the world of professional wrestling .
Sound good to you ..?
Well , like it or not , I ’m doing it ! 😀
Today ’s wrestler , Yokozuna was chosen because I ’ve seen that silly KGB commercial too many times with the way to say “ I surrender ” to a sumo wrestler .
I figured I ’d embrace and run with it .
So , what to say about Yokozuna .
Well first off , the character was billed from Japan , but the man behind the character , Rodney Anoa ’i was actually of Samoan descent and born in the United States .
If his last name looks familiar to you , that ’s because he shares the same name with his uncles , The Wild Samoans .
When I first saw Yoko in the WWF , he was 500 lb. monster managed by Mr. Fuji .
As he entered the ring , he was greeted by two Japanese geisha looking women who handed him flowers , and he would do a traditional sumo toss of salt to purify the ring .
He would then go on to squash his opponents with ease as he was easily 300 lbs. larger than his opponents .
He would cap off his matches with a move known as the Bonzai Drop where he would drag his opponents broken body over to the corner , go up to the second rope , and then jump & sit his fat ass on the man ’s chest and face .
OUCH !
One of the memories I have of Yokozuna was from WrestleMania IX in Las Vegas .
Yoko squared off against the World Champion Bret Hart .
“ The Hitman ” had the match well in hand , locking the Sharpshooter on Yoko .
That is until Mr. Fuji threw salt in Hart ’s eyes allowing Yoko to escape and then dominate the latter part of the match .
The sad part about this memory of Yokozuna was the fact that his championship celebration was cut dramatically short when Hulk Hogan came out of nowhere to help Bret Hart and was challenged by Mr. Fuji & Yoko to a title match just seconds after the match with Hart .
Well , that did n’t go so well for Yokozuna .
Mr. Fuji accidentally threw salt in Yoko ’s eyes and within a minute , Hogan clothes - lined him and then dropped the leg for the 1 - 2 - 3 becoming the World Champion .
Yokozuna would eventually go on to beat Hogan for the title later that year , but the record book was written as Yoko became one of the shortest reigning champions in the history of the WWF .
Another memory I have of Yoko was how deathly afraid of caskets he was when he was feuding with The Undertaker .
They eventually had a casket match ( Royal Rumble 1994 ) where Paul Bearer had The Undertaker build a double - wide , double - deep casket specifically designed for Yoko .
The match , however , did not go the deadman ’s way as Yoko and Mr. Fuji were prepared and had extra wrestlers run down to help make sure he was n’t placed in the giant box .
Eventually , Yokozuna got out of the singles wrestling game and went into the tag team division .
He at one point in time teamed with guys the likes of Owen Hart & Crush .
Yoko and Owen even had two different title reigns as tag champions due in large part to help on the outside from Mr. Fuji and his “ American Spokesperson ” Jim Cornette .
In October 2000 , Yokozuna passed away from heart complications at the age of 34 .
He was in his hotel room in Liverpool , England when it happened .
I think it ’s safe to say that his weight and line of work contributed to his early passing , but it ’s always sad when someone so young passes before his time .
Yoko was arguably one of the best big man in the business , and from what I ’ve read , he also was a great man in general , beloved by his fellow wrestlers .
If anyone has any ideas for wrestlers that they would like to see talked about in Throwback Thursday , drop me a message either in a comment , or on Twitter or on Facebook .
Stay with us here because this one is n't obvious .

One good measure of the intensity with which phone and cable companies dislike the Federal Communications Commission ’s plan to extend its regulatory oversight over access to broadband Internet is the amount of money they are spending on political contributions .
Last month , 74 House Democrats sent a letter to the F.C.C. ’s chairman , Julius Genachowski , warning him “ not to move forward with a proposal that undermines critically important investment in broadband and the jobs that come with it . ”
Rather than extend its authority over telecommunications networks to broadband under the 1996 Telecommunications
Act , they demanded that the F.C.C. wait for Congress to pass specific legislation .
The message parroted views held by AT&T , Comcast and Verizon  the biggest broadband service providers in the country .
( Comcast warned that the F.C.C. ’s efforts could “ chill investment and innovation . ” )
Their executives and political action committees have been among the top 20 campaign contributors to 58 of the 74 lawmakers in the past two election cycles .
As the F.C.C. proceeds with its plan to regulate broadband access , it seems likely we can expect more of this resistance from members of Congress .
( Natural News ) Australian courts recently ruled that Vioxx , a popular prescription painkiller , should never have been approved and allowed on the market .
The case represents the world 's first successful class action lawsuit against a drug company for damage caused by its drugs .
Merck , the drug giant that produced Vioxx , was deemed by the courts as negligent for failing to properly inform doctors who were prescribing the drug about the dangers and health risks associated with the drug .
As a result , thousands of patients around the world have suffered severe injury or death because of Vioxx .
Graeme Peterson , a 59 - year - old man represented in the case , was awarded the equivalent of about $ 266,000 for injuries inflicted upon him by Vioxx .
He suffered a heart attack from the drug in 2003 that has left him unable to work since .
He took the drug for more than four years , and still keeps a Vioxx tablet with him as a reminder of what almost killed him .
Though great for Australians , injured patients in the U.K. have not had the same success .
Norman Lamb , a member of the British Parliament , explained that he and others have been trying to convince Merck for years that it should compensate the many British citizens who were injured by the drug .
But Merck continues to deny liability and the British government has failed to successfully negotiate a settlement .
" Ministers made promising noises then after a meeting between the Government and the company they weakened their position .
I believe that the ministers came under pressure from the company and their own civil servants to shut up , " explained Lamb in a U.K. article .
Unfortunately , this is typically the case with most drug company lawsuits .
The Australian case is a landmark victory that should typify how class action lawsuits against drug companies are handled and hopefully a similar victory will one day be achieved for the many British cases of Vioxx injuries .
One such case involves Raymond Eaton , whose wife died from heart problems that were likely caused by Vioxx .
Mrs. Eaton , who had been suffering from a severely debilitating form of rheumatoid arthritis , was immediately prescribed Vioxx upon its release .
The drug helped her pain , but four years later , she suffered a coronary from which she never recovered .
Since she never had any heart problems prior to taking Vioxx , Raymond is convinced that the drug was responsible .
Over 80 million people around the world were taking Vioxx prior to its being pulled from the market , and many lawyers from other countries have been awaiting the outcome of the Australian litigation .
The success of the case established a precedence for Merck 's liability due to negligence , providing a way for the thousands , if not millions , of injured patients around the world to receive restitution for damages caused by Vioxx .

A lawyer representing traditional owners of Muckaty Station says he will argue in court that the Federal Government has no right to select the area as the site of a nuclear waste dump .
Some traditional owners of Muckaty Station , north of Tennant Creek , say they were not properly consulted about plans to construct the waste facility .
Lawyer George Newhouse says he will be seeking a declaration against the Government 's decision when the case is heard in the Federal Court on Monday .
" The nomination of Muckaty as a proposed site is void , " he said .
" It is void because proper process was n't followed and the traditional owners for that site were not consulted and did not agree . "
He says the challenge against the proposal is not focused on securing compensation .
" This case is about proper processes not being followed and a nomination of the site being void .
" It really is n't about , it 's not a compensation claim at all . "
The Territory 's Labor Senator Trish Crossin says if the court case is not successful , the Federal Government has the legislation ready to proceed with the Muckaty nomination .
" If for example that court case is not successful and we proceed then with the Ngapa clan nomination , we have legislation sitting in the Senate that proceeds with that nomination . "

The suicides at Foxconn have highlighted the issue of highly stressful working conditions in the global electronics industry .
Foxconn has responded with psychologists , punch bags , swimming pools , and asking employees to promise not to kill themselves .
But these moves do nothing to change the actual working conditions .
Suicide numbers are a big red herring because even if they go down , huge numbers of workers will still suffer from low wages , long hours , and many other tough and unhealthy working conditions .
A recent BBC documentary series , " Blood , Sweat and Luxuries " took six young British consumers and placed them exotic locations working in the same jobs as locals , and having to survive on the same wages .
It 's an eye opening series because it showed the horrible work conditions that billions of people face daily , every week , for years , and decades .
These were strong , healthy , young British adults , yet they would pass out from the back breaking work , suffer panic attacks , and many other maladies , after just a few hours on the job .
They carried huge amounts of dirt in Ghana 's gold fields ; they processed leather in stinking abattoirs in Ethiopia ; they dug deep holes in coffee plantations ; and they had to work in an electronics factory in the Philippines where workers prepared tiny components for disk drives , processing one component every 3 seconds .
If they even took a moment to glance up from their tasks , or be distracted , they would fall behind in their quota and have their wages docked .
It was incredible how much work had to be done for so little money by so many people .
And the reason they were paid so little is that the electronics factory had to accept tiny profit margins in order to win its contracts .
All the large tech companies such as Apple , Nokia , Dell , etc have agreements with their suppliers that they do not employ children , and that they will abide by certain standards to protect workers .
But it 's not clear how these are monitored , enforced , or how much in common they share across the electronics industry .
What is common across the electronics industry is a relentless focus on reducing manufacturing costs , and the largest manufacturing cost is labor ; which is why employees are pushed to work faster , while maintaining high quality work , and at the lowest wages acceptable .
We reap the benefits in the form of cheap digital gadgets , gizmos , and computers .
We have absolutely no idea about all the blood , sweat , and human suffering that went into creating our digital devices .
For the six young Brits that took part in that five week program , the experience was life changing .
On their return they made big changes in their life styles , some changed their diets , and they all changed their buying habits .
Some raised money and collected clothes and books for the families they met during their stay .
And they found a new respect for Fair Trade goods .
One of them said that she used to dismiss Fair Trade coffee as some kind of marketing ploy , a trendy fashion .
Now she does n't , and is happy to pay extra because she knows it does make a difference in the lives of many people .
Would you buy a Fair Trade iPhone or Android smartphone ?
Would you buy a Fair Trade Dell or HP PC if there were such choices ?
And how much extra would you be willing to pay ?
And more importantly , what would it take for you to be assured that the Fair Trade premium was making a difference in the lives of electronics workers ?
It was n't that long ago when PCs typically cost $ 5,000 and lots of people paid it willingly .
These days you can pick up powerful notebooks for under $ 1000 , and netbooks for under $ 400 .
And a $ 100 smartphone is more powerful than PCs from just a few years ago .
Surely , we should be able to afford to pay a Fair Trade premium on electronics without too much suffering on our part .
And hopefully , the global media attention on the Foxconn suicides will result in improved working conditions for millions of electronics workers , and Fair Trade electronics goods will become commonplace .
I really have n't done a huge amount of work on Test : : Harness since it was released as core , so I decided to take a look at how it is now .
I was reading a blog post where someone commented that Perl 's Test : : Class does n't offer a progress bar and I thought , that should be easy to hack into prove .
The way to do this now is to write a plugin for App : : Prove , bundled with Test : : Harness .
Just create a package named App :: Prove :: Plugin : : $ PluginName and you can load it like this :
prove - P$ PluginName t/
The plugin must provide a load method .
Mine looks like this :
package App:: Prove :: Plugin :: ProgressBar ; use strict ; use warnings ; my $ NUM_TESTS ; sub load { my ( $ class , $ p ) = @_ ; $ NUM_TESTS = $p->{app_prove}->_get_tests ;
$p->{app_prove}->formatter(' App::Prove::Plugin::ProgressBar::Formatter ' ) ; return 1 ; }
The plugin architecture is not well - documented , so you have to do some digging through the code to understand all of it .
There 's also a couple of interesting things to note above .
First , _get_tests is not documented , so this is theoretically fragile .
We use it , though , because we 're going to base our progress bar on " X out of Y " test programs run .
Next , the formatter method is documented to take a formatter object , but in reality , it only takes a class name .
This is why the $ NUM_TESTS variable is declared with a file scope .
Now that we have a plugin , we need to write the formatter .
Unfortunately , this will also take advantage of undocumented methods .
My idea is to reuse TAP :: Formatter :: Console with " really_quiet " verbosity .
This turns off most of Test :: Harness 's output , only emitting test failures and the summary .
That 's exactly what I need .
Note that this is in the same file as the plugin and we use the $ NUM_TESTS variable here ( a bit of a hack to get around the formatter bug ) .
package App:: Prove :: Plugin:: ProgressBar:: Formatter ; use Term :: ProgressBar ; use parent ' TAP :: Formatter :: Console ' ; __PACKAGE__->mk_methods(qw[ progress curr_prog is_failing ] ) ; sub new { my ( $ class , $ args ) = @_ ; # The - 2 is ' really_quiet ' , but it 's not well - documented $ args ->{verbosity} = - 2 ; my $ self = $ class -> SUPER ::new ( $args ) ; my $ progress = Term :: ProgressBar -> new ( { name => ' Test Programs Run ' , count => $ NUM_TESTS , } ) ; $ self -> progress ( $ progress ) ; $ self->curr_prog ( 1 ) ; $ self ->_set_colors ( ' green ' ) ; return $ self ; } sub open_test { my ( $ self , $ test , $ parser ) = @_ ; $ parser -> callback ( EOF => sub { $ self -> _set_colors ( ' red ' ) if $ self -> is_failing ; $ self -> progress -> update ( $ self->curr_prog ) ; $ self ->_set_colors ( ' reset ' ) ; $ self->curr_prog ( $ self->curr_prog + 1 ) ; } ) ; $ parser -> callback ( test => sub { my $ test = shift ; if ( not $ test -> is_ok ) { print " \r " , ( ' ' x $ self -> progress -> term_width ) ; $ self -> is_failing ( 1 ) ; } } ) ; $ self -> SUPER ::open_test( $ test , $ parser ) ; }
I had originally used Term :: ANSIColor in the formatter for color support , but I remembered that I can access it through my parent formatter and that handles colours on Windows as well .
Again , this is digging through the code and is not well documented .
The open_test method is where the magic is .
We set up a parser callback for EOF ( end of each test program ) .
The progress bar starts out as green , but if there are any test failures ( checked in the test callback ) , we set the output to red for the rest of the progress bar run .
The callback then updates the progress bar and bumps up the curr_prog ( ) value , thus allowing the progress bar to have a correct value in the future .
Also , note this odd line in the test callback :
print " \r " , ( ' ' x $ self -> progress -> term_width ) ;
That merely puts us to the start of the line and prints spaces equal to what the progress bar thinks the term width is ( another undocumented method ) .
This is to print spaces over the progress bar if there are failures .
This is needed because when the test output is printed on failure and we do n't wipe out the progress bar , we get a partial progress bar scrolling up the screen .
Put all this together and you can do this :
prove - PProgressBar t/
And now you have a red / green progress bar for your test runs instead of a list of files spewing over the screen .
It 's on github if you want to play with it .
Young activists and union workers are expected to meet in Washington , D.C. , June 10 - 13 , during a national young workers summit hosted by the AFL - CIO .
The summit called “ Next Up ” is said to be the first of its kind that will bring young people under age 35 together to discuss ways in which they can help lead the labor movement forward .
Organizers say the gathering will address current issues and cement ideas to continue making the modern labor movement even more relevant to the next generation of young workers .
The “ Next Up ” summit is the culmination of five - city listening tour by leaders in the AFL - CIO and will become the kick - off of a long - term outreach program for working people under age 35 .
Young labor leaders and activists hope to share ideas and experiences in order to learn how to become more engaged with working people in general in local communities nationwide .
AFL - CIO officers and labor leaders will meet with young activists during the summit to hear their concerns and feedback about what challenges youth face these days .
“ We ’re experiencing the economic crisis – but young workers have been hurt disproportionately , ” said Liz Shuler , AFL - CIO secretary - treasurer in a statement .
“ Young people need the union movement and we need young workers to be engaged .
Participants at the young workers summit are going to develop an action plan and identify more of what we need to do to make sure we ’re fully integrating and calling upon our young members . ”
Over the last several months Shuler met with young workers across the country in five different cities .
She listened to what they had to say about the issues they face at the workplace and in their unions .
Passionate and often creative ideas about how to address those issues were shared .
Those forums set the stage for the summit and the labor movement ’s commitment to outreach and include young workers .
A survey conducted by the AFL - CIO found that only 31 percent of 18 - to 35 - year - olds makes enough money to cover their bills and put some aside .
Almost a third are uninsured and one in three still live at home with their parents .
A similar study recently released by the Economic Policy Institute notes the emerging challenges facing jobless young workers , which lack a safety net and often do n’t qualify for unemployed benefits .
The AFL - CIO says it is committed to a long - term , sustainable young worker program whose objectives are to attract , engage and empower young workers .
Organizers of the “ Next Up ” summit say it will encourage a space for young union workers to join forces in the national fight for economic and social justice in the broader progressive movement .
Directed toward young workers text from an ad on the young workers summit ’s website says , “ You are ‘ Next Up . ’
Be at the Young Workers Summit in June and add your voice to our collective future . ”
The website : www.aflcio.org/nextup has more information regarding the summit including agenda highlights and cool videos , Facebook and Twitter links .
Registration is free , which includes breakfast , snacks / beverages during the day and two reception dinners .

On any given day in the Bay Area , it 's common to come across aspiring musicians hawking homemade music CDs on the streets of Oakland , Berkeley or San Francisco .
Kazi Reeves , 25 , who spends time each week outside Peet 's Coffee Shop on Oakland 's Lakeshore Avenue , is an easygoing pitchman who uses an iPod and headphones to offer potential customers a free sample .
He is unabashedly friendly and upbeat , except when it comes to the Johannes Mehserle trial in Los Angeles .
" I expect an unfair verdict , " Reeves said .
" A fair verdict would at least be manslaughter , " he said .
Anything less " would be enough for me to take to the streets and protest , " he said .
Mehserle , a former BART police officer , is charged with murdering train passenger Oscar Grant , who was shot in the back as he lay on a platform at an Oakland train station .
The New Year 's Day 2009 shooting was captured on video and has been viewed by millions of people .
Mehserle , who is white , killed Grant , who was black , moments after he was removed from the train along with several others , allegedly for fighting .
The death of Grant , 22 , sparked two nights of demonstrations and vandalism in downtown Oakland .
Mehserle 's attorney , Michael Rains , succeeded in his bid to move the trial from Alameda County because of extensive media coverage .
The trial , in Los Angeles County Superior Court , is expected to wrap up in the coming days and be handed over to the jury .
Distrust of police
The jury , which has no black people , has sparked the usual suspicions and fears among young and old in the African American community that a lesser verdict will be reached .
For young black men like Reeves , who was 7 years old in 1992 when the Rodney King beating verdict sparked three days of riots in Los Angeles , police interactions such as the one that led to Grant 's death are all too familiar , he said .
About two years ago , Reeves said , Richmond police who had identified him as a bank robbery suspect yanked him from his vehicle .
Two young African American men sitting with him Monday , who identified themselves only as Mike and Curtis , nodded their heads .
Mike said police in San Leandro rousted him a few months ago when they saw him enter a friend 's home .
The men have a different perspective than those who have not experienced such interactions with police .
" Ask the cops how hard it is to resist arrest when you 're lying face - down with a knee in your back , " Reeves said .
Mehserle 's claim that the shooting was accidental may be plausible , he said , but Grant is dead and someone needs to be held accountable for that .
If the shoe were on the other foot , and the victim was a white guy , regardless of the cop 's race , someone would surely answer for it , Reeves said .
Tears do n't convince
The former police officer 's teary - eyed explanation from the witness stand last week did nothing to change Reeves ' opinion of the case .
If anything , it only hardened his well - founded cynicism toward the justice system .
" I 've seen a lot of brothers who offered tearful apologies , " he said .
" They were n't cops , and they received the maximum sentence . "
Oakland not villain
For scores of people in the Bay Area , the videotaped killing of Grant is the Bay Area equivalent of the 1991 Rodney King beating in Los Angeles .
To them , the Grant video is the latest in a pattern of African American residents being abused by government authorities who are sworn to protect them .
Still , while there will almost surely be some public reaction to the Mehserle verdict on the streets of Oakland , about the only thing more discouraging to some than absolving the former officer of blame and responsibility would be to vent that anger at the struggling city of Oakland and its residents .
This article has been corrected since it appeared in print editions .
The infamous Southern California booby trapping drug dealer , Nicholas John Smit , has been arrested and will face charges in court today for allegedly setting deadly traps to kill police officers after he was arrested for growing weed .
Smit could face life in prison for attempting to kill the police officer who arrested him from growing weed , an offense that would have only given him several months in jail if he had been convicted .
Karl Anglin , an agent from the LA office of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , told the AP , " This guy we are dealing with is not very intelligent , that 's for sure . "
So what exactly are the feds claiming that Smit did ?
According to the AP :
The first attack came in early December , when someone left a crude device known as a punji trap on the front porch of officer 's home .
The weapon was made from a series of wooden boards pierced by dozens of upward - pointing nails .
In another attack , a natural gas pipe was pushed into a hole drilled through the roof of the gang enforcement unit 's headquarters .
The building filled with flammable vapor , but the gas was detected before anyone was hurt .
The officer was again targeted March 5 when an explosive device that did not detonate was left on his car .
The ATF got involved in the case on Feb. 23 after a handmade gun was attached to a sliding gate at the Police Department 's gang enforcement building sent a bullet whizzing past an officer 's face when he entered .
Who knew that messing with meth head bikers could be so dangerous ?
Also arrested last week was Smit 's friend , Steven Hansen , a convicted arsonist , who police suspect played a role in setting the traps .

Harriet Harman , the acting Labour leader , today called for a rule change to ensure half the party 's shadow cabinet are women .
In a speech to the Unite union 's annual conference in Manchester , Harman said it was " time for Labour women to step out of the shadows " .
She said there were now 81 female Labour MPs , more than those in all the other parties put together .
" Labour is the only party in parliament which speaks up for women in this country , " she added .
" We have some excellent experienced women and some brilliant new women MPs .
We still do have twice as many men MPs as women .
The Labour men are great – but they are not twice as good as the women . "
Harman 's call was backed by Ed Miliband , the shadow climate change secretary .
In a tweet sent today , Miliband said : " Very sympathetic to what Harriet has said today on 50 % women in shadow cabinet .
Will ultimately be a PLP decision , but I will be supporting it . "
Harman has ruled herself out of the Labour leadership race , to the surprise of many observers .
Last month , she said she could not run for the position of Labour leader while holding the post of deputy .
Yvette Cooper , the shadow work and pensions secretary , has also ruled herself out of contention .
Her husband , Ed Balls , will contest the leadership .
Cooper berated David Cameron in the Guardian last week for " shocking sexism " in joking that Balls had ordered her not to stand .
Diane Abbott , the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington , in London , has thrown her hat into the ring , but has yet to secure the 33 nominations from parliamentary colleagues she needs to formally enter the race .
Jon Trickett , the MP for Hemsworth who served as Brown 's former private parliamentary secretary for the last 18 months of his premiership , gave his nomination to Abbott todayyesterday .
The leftwing MP , whose constituency neighbours those of Ed Miliband and Balls , said that now both were in the race he had decided to back Abbot to ensure her voice was added to the leadership debate .
" I listened to the views of Labour members and trade unions , and they want to see the widest possible debate , " he added .
Harman used some of her six questions to Cameron at yesterday 's prime minister 's question time to take him to task over the decision to grant anonymity to men accused of rape , and over tax breaks to married couples .
She said Labour would be an " effective " opposition , speaking up for public services and jobs , and warned that the party 's opponents would make a determined effort to denigrate everything it had done in government .
" We will not let them , " she said .
" For every child who , instead of being cooped up in a flat , is playing in a brand - new children 's centre , that is our legacy .
" For every patient who , instead of waiting in pain , is cared for by doctors and nurses in a brand - new hospital , that is our legacy .
For every villager in Africa whose life has been transformed by cancelling third - world debt , that is our legacy . "
The acting leader gave her address to the union conference on the same day her husband , Jack Dromey , gave his farewell speech as Unite 's deputy general secretary following his election as MP for Birmingham Erdington .
Harman said rebuilding and renewing Labour following the election defeat was an important task , stressing that the party had to " listen and learn " .
The Labour leadership election will involve up to 4 million people , making it the biggest election in any political party or any organisation in this country , she said , adding : " This leadership election is crucial opportunity for the Labour party to reflect , renew itself , and re-engage with the people of Britain . "

Editor 's note : The International Convention on Cluster Munitions , prohibiting all use , stockpiling , production and transfer of such weapons , comes into effect on Aug .
1 . Villagers in Laos , meantime , continue to find creative ways to use scrap metal from these deadly munitions as part of their everyday lives .
VIENTIANE , Laos —
A scorching sun settled across southern Laos , as farmers burned the land to make new fields .
A woman hacked at weeds with two young children in tow , the heat of a nearby fire caking her in a sweaty , sooty film .
She paused a moment , wiped her neck , then hoisted her hoe .
Sitting behind her thatched hut was the casing of a 750 - pound bomb made at Pine Bluff Arsenal , Arkansas .
Its label was clear : “ Special firework .
Handle carefully .
Keep fire away . ”
Laotians everywhere continue to unearth American bombs , dropped nearly 40 years ago .
Today , wartime remnants spark some of the country ’s most creative construction and engineering .
Villagers turn scrap into tools and utensils — everything from bowls to buckets , boats , spoons , knives , hoes , troughs , ladders , planters , cowbells , stilts and pedestals for satellite dishes .
In a largely rural country of subsistence farmers who live on $ 2 a day or less , a hunk of metal is a lucrative find .
Prices fluctuate , and they depend on quality , but a pound of scrap sells for roughly five cents .
If kept at home , the casing to a large bomb can be packed with dirt and planted with herbs , filled with slop for the pigs or saved as a bank account until family circumstances require its sale .
The metal is everywhere — from tiny pieces of shrapnel to millions of fully intact explosives .
Between 1964 and 1973 the United States military dumped more than 2 million tons of bombs in 580,000 sorties , the equivalent of one raid over Laos every eight minutes for nine years .
It was a secret war , unauthorized by Congress , aimed at stopping communist forces with ties to neighboring Vietnam .
The raids are documented in U.S. Airforce Bombing Data maps , in which little red dots signify hits .
Almost all of Laos appears pimpled in red , but some targets stream in solid crimson rivers .
For many reasons — human error , failure to arm , faulty parts — up to 30 percent of the bombs did n’t detonate when dropped .
Millions sit in the soil today , still volatile .
And valuable .
The Ho Chi Minh Trail — which was not a single road but a network of interwoven routes — was one of the heaviest hit areas .
It remains some of the most contaminated land .
In Attapeu province , a woman fetched water from the Xe Xou River using a pail of lightweight aluminum that still bore the warning from a fuze label .
Just yards away , her neighbors stored rice in an American - made MK - 24 parachute flare canister with the serial number PSNM - 370-570-6-57-1407 .
“ Young children found it in the forest and sold it to me , ” said a man named Ka Lot .
Two hundred miles northwest , in Khammouane province , a man named Pae sat on the wooden slats of his raised hut , above a ladder made from aluminum tubes shaped like extra - tall beer cans — dispensers that shot little bombs out the back end .
Those “ bombies ” were designed to scatter across large plots of land .
“ When I found the canisters I thought , oh , I can make so many things , ” Pae said .
“ I can cut them and make cowbells .
And also spoons , and a bucket to carry water , and I can make a basin to wash laundry . ”
A few miles up the road , a woman named Haum watered a raised garden of thick green scallions growing in a bomb casing .
“ Oh , this came from the airplane , ” she said .
“ My parents had this a long time .
This is the best planter . ”
Steel lasts longer than wood .
And that ’s precisely why villagers also turn bomb casings into stilts that hold their homes and barns .
In Xieng Khouang province , a villager named Vandee straddled his legs across the framework of a barn he was building atop 10 rusty casings , slightly dented , some with holes , but sturdy nonetheless .
“ I did n’t buy these , ” Vandee said .
“ I found them all around here . ”
The faded label on one of his casings noted the type of bomb : CBU - 58 , a cluster munition that encased 650 baseball - sized bombies .
Vandee lives near a village called Ban Napia where , each year , villagers make 150,000 aluminum spoons from flares , fuzes , fighter jets remnants and other war scrap .
Ovens are dug into the packed earth surrounding village homes .
The metal is heated until it shimmers as liquid , then poured into perfectly shaped molds of dinner spoons .
Each cooled utensil emerges with a little tail , a string of excess metal to be chopped off .
If rough , the spoons are sanded , then gathered for sale to tourists , restaurateurs and local market vendors .
It ’s a dicey business .
Every day , Laotians risk their lives collecting the metal that makes their tools and utensils .
More than 20,000 people have been killed or maimed in incidents involving unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) since the end of war , according to the National Survey of UXO Victims and Accidents published by the National Regulatory Authority for the UXO / Mine Action Sector .
Accidents happen when UXO is hit , tossed , jiggled or otherwise moved .
Still , most trips from field to factory require movement from person to person , sometimes over hundreds of precarious miles .
Much of it ends at several foundries in Pakxan , on the banks of the Mekong River bordering Thailand .
Each day , scrap trucks unload tons of metal from every conceivable source : cars , trucks , airplanes , barrels , umbrellas , bicycles , frying pans , gas cans , demolished homes — and bombs .
The scrap amasses in piles 15 feet high , 20 feet long .
It ’s stuffed into compacting machines that squeeze the metal into tightly packed bricks .
One by one , a worker shoves those bricks into a raging furnace .
An employee named Vilaisack said the foundry where he works makes up to two tons of rebar each day , all of it shipped to markets across Laos .
He did n’t worry about UXO among all the scrap .
“ We do n’t buy anything unsafe , ” he said .
Yet bits of bomb scrap lay on the ground nearby .
His sweat - drenched colleague stood on a platform above that sputtering furnace , stirring the metal as it ruptured and hissed .
Sometimes , the flames burned green .
Sometimes , the fire surged with sudden little explosions .
Eventually , the metal inside that fire would leave the foundry in long ropes of rebar , which would form the framework of shops and homes , all across Laos .

Being a pornstar is n’t as easy as one may think .
Mind you a female pornstar does n’t have to worry about getting hard , keeping hard or shooting a giant wad of cum on cue .
But she does have to worry about where that giant wad of cum is going to land .
Like say , 90 percent of porn , in her mouth .
There are so many hilarious things wrong with this video .
So many questions that begged to be asked .
Is this her first time doing a porn ?
Is this the first time she ’s ever seen a porn ?
Why choose the porn career avenue if the smell of cum makes you gag in a ‘ oh my god , body seizing , good chance I ’m going to vomit ’ way and not an ‘ attempting to deep throat my first cock ’ way ( which is infinitely more adorable for some reason ) ?
Phrases we never thought we ’d hear from a pornstar :
“ I gag from just the smell of cum . ”
“ No you do n’t understand , I have a bad gag reflex . ”
The guy in the video is obviously quite the gentleman .
Taking time to smoothly convince her that shooting his cum in her mouth will be fine .
Even when she ’s retching , when she ’s opening and closing her mouth like a goldfish dropped on the floor from some bumblesome stepkid , when she looks up at him with those PTSD eyes just begging for it to all be over , that ’s when he tells her , “ You ’re so fucking sexy right now . ”
Even with the gagging , we could n’t agree more .
She hates to drink cum ! brought to you by PornHub

Mexico City , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Fifteen suspects were killed Tuesday in a shootout with soldiers in the tourist town of Taxco , Mexico , the national defense secretary said in a news release .
A citizen 's complaint about presumed illicit activities at a house led authorities to dispatch soldiers to a house in the town , which is located about 100 miles southwest of Mexico City , the release said .
Upon arriving at the house at 10:10 a.m. local time , they were greeted by gunfire and , acting in self - defense , responded with gunfire of their own , it said .
The battle continued for about 40 minutes , after which authorities determined that 15 " aggressors " were dead , and 16 long guns , six pistols , two home - made explosive devices and a vehicle were confiscated , it said .
The process of identifying the bodies was under way , it said .
The announcement of the killings came shortly before President Felipe Calderon , whose battle against drug trafficking has been a priority since he assumed office in December 2006 , addressed the nation .
While not referring to the Taxco shooting , Calderon said , " As I said from the first , this is a fight that will take time and cost resources and human lives . "
" Our future is in play ... we are going to continue ahead and we will win this fight , " he said in a nationally televised address .
Firefox 4 Beta 1 has officially been announced , with Mozilla hoping that its next generation browser can prevent rivals like Google Chrome and Apple 's Safari from eating into its market .
The candidate build surfaced at the end of June , but the company has now formally rolled out Firefox 4 Beta 1 for testers .
Firefox 4 will bring a host of new features , and the first full beta release will showcase the biggest change , a big change to the user interface .
Top tabs
By default tabs will now be at the top of the browser – in a style reminiscent of Opera and Chrome , and will be joined by new features such as a revamped add - on manager , WebM HD video support and privacy improvements .
" Firefox 4 Beta 1 includes dozens of major features and improvements – by testing them early we 'll be able to respond to your feedback for future versions of Firefox , " blogged Mozilla .
" Once you download Firefox 4 Beta 1 , you 're part of our beta program and will receive regular updates as more features launch . "
User experience
Mozilla explained that the decision to move the tabs was based on improving the user experience .
" If you are using a Windows PC , the most noticeable new feature will be the look of the browser .
" We moved the tabs to the top to make it easier to focus on the web content and easier to control the tools in your Web browser .
" Also , if you have Windows 7 or Windows Vista the Menu bar was replaced with a single Firefox button so you can get to the most used options with just one click .
These changes will be coming soon for Mac and Linux . "
Has anyone at the 2010 World Cup paid attention to this ?
Based on the constant vuvuzela buzz on TV ( and the just - as - constant and more annoying buzz of vuvuzela bitching on Twtiter ) I ’m going to say NO .

NIST Policy on Hash Functions
August 5 , 2015
SHA -1 : Federal agencies should stop using SHA - 1 for generating digital signatures , generating time stamps and for other applications that require collision resistance .
Federal agencies may use SHA - 1 for the following applications : verifying old digital signatures and time stamps , generating and verifying hash - based message authentication codes ( HMACs ) , key derivation functions ( KDFs ) , and random bit / number generation .
Further guidance on the use of SHA - 1 is provided in SP 800 - 131A .
SHA - 2 ( i.e. , SHA - 224 , SHA - 256 , SHA - 384 , SHA - 512 , SHA - 512/224 and SHA -512/256 ) : Federal agencies may use these hash functions for all applications that employ secure hash algorithms .
NIST encourages application and protocol designers to implement SHA - 256 at a minimum for any applications of hash functions requiring interoperability .
Further guidance on the use of SHA - 2 is provided in SP 800 - 57 Part 1 , section 5.6.2 and SP 800 - 131A .
SHA - 3 ( i.e. , SHA3 - 224 , SHA3 - 256 , SHA3 - 384 , SHA3 - 512 , SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 ) : Federal agencies may use the four fixed - length SHA - 3 algorithms — SHA3 - 224 , SHA3 - 256 , SHA3 - 384 , and SHA3 - 512 for all applications that employ secure hash algorithms .
The SHA - 3 Extendable - Output Functions ( XOFs ) , SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 , can be specialized to hash functions , subject to additional security considerations .
Guideline for using the XOFs will be provided in the future .
Currently there is no need to transition applications from SHA - 2 to SHA - 3 .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration will no longer do joint briefings with BP on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , and instead will have former Coast Guard Commandant Adm .
Thad Allen handle the daily briefings on his own , senior administration officials told CNN on Tuesday .
According to the senior administration officials , the change is an effort to control the message , release accurate information about the oil spill and speak in one voice to deliver the daily message on latest developments .
Allen , the administration 's point man on the oil spill , later told reporters in New Orleans that his job is to speak " very frankly with the American public . "
" I think we need to be communicating with the American people through my voice as the national incident commander , " he said .
The move come amid growing frustration from the White House that BP is delivering inaccurate information and not being transparent , said the senior administration officials , who spoke on condition of not being identified by name .
One official said the last straw was Saturday , when BP officials downplayed the possibility that the amount of oil flowing could actually increase from BP 's latest strategy to cut the broken pipe and cap the leak .
" Instead of being straight with the American people as Carol Browner ( the assistant to the president for energy and climate change ) has done on behalf of the administration , BP minimized its significance , " the official said .
Senior administration officials say Browner appeared on several Sunday political talk shows to set the record straight .
Browner has said the flow of oil could increase by as much as 20 percent when the pipe , known as a riser , is cut .
The end to joint briefings also comes as the White House has been using progressively tougher language against BP after coming under fire for appearing to be BP 's partner in fighting the oil spill .
Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry , who had acted as one of the principal government briefers , will no longer participate in the daily briefings , the officials said .
They added that Landry was not being pushed out , but instead was resuming her duties preparing for hurricane coverage .
The Coast Guard 's Unified Area Command spokesman , Howard Wright , said Landry 's shift in duties had been in the works .
" As planned , starting Tuesday , June 1st , the first day of hurricane season , Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry will rotate back to her role as Coast Guard Eighth District Commander in order to focus solely on coordinated federal hurricane response planning and preparation efforts in the Gulf of Mexico , " Wright said .
" She will clearly bring an expert consideration of the effects the BP oil spill could have on all Gulf Coast hurricane response capabilities and recovery scenarios . "
I was born and brought up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
As a Mormon I devoted considerable amounts of time and material in furthering the purposes of the church , including serving a two - year mission to Okinawa , Japan .
Those who live the church ’s teaching of integrity and honesty , discipline and moderation , and pursuit of education often enjoy a great deal of personal success .
I was no exception .
In my many years as a member I had wonderful experiences and made many great friends .
Mormons are generally good - hearted and wellmeaning .
Nevertheless , there was a growing problem — I was n’t happy .
As I grew older , became more educated , and experienced more of the outside world , I was encountering cognitive dissonance .
The world I was coming to know did not match the world I thought to exist .
At first , I tried to separate and balance two different worldviews , but as time passed they pulled closer and eventually collided , forcing me to work ever harder to keep them separate .
With each new idea that challenged my sacredly held religious worldview I became frantic .
Ultimate confrontation was drawing near and the world seemed very dark and lonely .
In what can only be described as a very difficult choice I opted to leave the church , risking everything .
For members , leaving the church is unthinkable .
Those who do leave often face confusion , self - loathing , doubt , emotional scarring , and loss of friends , family , and even jobs .
Mormonism is not just a way of thinking ; it is a way of life .
It encompasses every aspect of one ’s life from what you eat or drink to what books and movies you see .
As an active member my entire world was the church .
Reinforcement of beliefs , no matter how absurd , came at every turn .
At one point I dropped out of law school , going on a religious quest to try and harmonize my heartfelt faith with my mind .
Every answer I could devise or find to assuage my anxiety and fears only made things spin further out of control .
Mental gymnastics were required to make the church ’s teachings fit with everything from evolution to Native American history ; archeology to philosophy ; linguistics to genetics ; the list seemed endless .
It became an impossible balancing act .
Everything I studied wore me down and challenged my faith .
The demons seemed to be everywhere ; all was dark and confusing .
Enter Carl Sagan .
I discovered The Demon - Haunted World on the library shelf one day .
I had heard of Sagan , of course , but knew little of him .
At a time when friends had left me , where I could not confide with my own family , the book ’s dedication invited me toward the candle ( “ To Tonio , my grandson .
I wish you a world free of demons and full of light . ” ) .
Sagan ’s book became a way for me to talk out my thoughts ; thoughts I could not share with anyone else .
When my first child on the way there was nothing more that I desired than a world free of demons for him .
I felt trapped , as if I were chained in Plato ’s cave — I was tired of the shadows the Church projected on the wall .
I realized that what I had believed in for so long was not real .
The chains were unlocked .
My commitment to the truth was stronger than my commitment to the church .
I became convinced that the truth is worth searching for — it is “ the most precious thing ” Sagan speaks of .
Sagan provided me the mirror that showed that my shackles were self chosen and that my collaboration and complacency were furthering the very things causing me so much trouble .
I wanted easy answers .
Sagan promoted an attitude of questioning and openness that required evidence .
Science as presented by Sagan is liberating — it is there for all to enjoy irrespective of race , gender , creed , or citizenship .
Science could be used by all equally and effectively .
The Church demanded faith , labeling doubt as weakness .
To Sagan , even doubt is useful .
Doubt was not to be feared , but embraced .
Doubt is humbling and so I was humbled .
I learned to be comfortable with not knowing all the answers .
The Church told me to trust in prayers , fasting , priesthood blessings , and revelation based on feelings .
Reason and evidence were secondary ; and in cases where they did not support faith , they were irrelevant , or worse .
On the surface much of The Demon - Haunted World seems preoccupied with science and the debunking of such wild notions as Atlantis , Bigfoot , and alien abductions — things I had already outgrown .
The demons of the world , however , are more subtle and hidden , yet more threatening and menacing .
At a deeper level Sagan was championing reason .
He illustratively showed that knowledge is always useful , even if we are wrong .
Failure , which is inevitable , is and can be instructive .
After reading Carl Sagan ’s The Demon- Haunted World I realized I could master the demons .
For Sagan , illusions require collaborators .
No longer a collaborator , I changed and exorcised my own demons .
No longer silent , I voiced my thoughts to my family .
To my utter astonishment , they confessed to having similar struggles with the same ideas , but like me , they were afraid to share them .
Talking with them the door of dialogue , examination , and honesty opened .
Carl Sagan provided the key .

Two men are the first people in Victoria to face charges over alleged racially motivated crime .
Victoria 's racial and religious tolerance laws were enacted in January 2002 .
The men have been charged with inciting racial hatred and assault offences over an attack on a young Indian man in February .
Chief Police Commissioner Simon Overland says police needed the approval of the Director of Public Prosecutions before proceeding .
" You 've ultimately got to prove the charge ... to the criminal standard , which is a pretty high standard , " he said .
" We obviously feel that we have enough evidence .
The director agreed with that and these matters will now proceed through court .
" These people are innocent until proven guilty but they will face those charges and have to defend them . "
It is alleged the pair and a third man , who is yet to be charged , racially and physically abused an Indian student on a bus heading for Portsea in February .
Commissioner Overland says if a victim 's race is proven to be a factor in a crime , harsher penalties would apply .
" There have been changes made to the Sentencing Act that make that an aggravating factor that magistrates and judges need to take into account in sentencing , " he said .
" If it 's proven I would expect that it would add to the sentence that 's imposed . "
The president of the Federation of Indian Associations of Victoria , Vasan Srinivasan , has welcomed the police charges .
" I really appreciate the way Victoria Police has taken on this issue , " he said .
A 13 - year - old girl is expected to fully recover after being attacked by a shark while swimming near an island off the coast of North Carolina .
Carley Schlentz of Greensboro , N.C. , sustained bites to her left foot while swimming with friends near Topsail Island , a 26 - mile barrier island off the state 's coast .
Schlentz , who was immediately rushed to Cape Fear Hospital after Friday 's attack , reportedly received 60 stitches .
" I felt like something grabbed my foot but then it got really sharp and it was n't letting go , " the girl said in an interview with MyFox8.com .
" So I pulled away and by then it had already bitten me twice , " she said .
" Then I pulled it out ( of the water ) to see what it was and it was pretty bad .
The ligament was spread out and you could see it . "

When the CRU emails were published , Pennsylvania State University ( PSU ) received many emails and letters accusing paleoclimate researcher Dr. Michael Mann of various types of research misconduct .
PSU assembled the various informal accusations into a set of four allegations and began an internal investigation into Mann ’s activities .
Three of the four allegations were dismissed by the preliminary inquiry on February 3 , but the inquiry concluded that the existing panel lacked the expertise to make a judgment on the last allegation and empaneled a faculty investigation .
That investigation released its conclusions yesterday , finding unanimously that :
Dr. Michael Mann did not engage in , nor did he participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions that seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community for proposing , conducting , or reporting research , or other scholarly activities .
The four allegations initially levied against Mann were as follows :
Did [ Mann ] engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions with the intent to suppress or falsify data ?
Did [ Mann ] engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions with the intent to delete , conceal or otherwise destroy emails , information and / or data , related to AR4 , as suggested by Phil Jones ?
Did [ Mann ] engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any misuse of privileged or confidential information available to [ him ] in [ his ] capacity as an academic scholar ?
Did [ Mann ] engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions that seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community for proposing , conducting , or reporting research or other scholarly activities ?
The initial inquiry found that there was no evidence to support the first three , and arguably most serious , allegations – suppression or falsification of data , destruction of data related to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , and misuse of confidential information .
The fourth charge , deviation from accepted practices , was more of a catch - all for anything not specifically addressed in the first three , and so the faculty investigators could , if they chose , revisit the first three charges .
And , as the investigation report shows , the investigators specifically revisited the third allegation .
The investigation found that Mann had not deviated from accepted practices in the process of proposing his research , noting that the number of NSF and NOAA grants Mann had earned ( five and four respectively between 1999 and 2010 ) meant that his proposed work met “ the highest prevailing standards , both in terms of scientific / technical quality and ethical considerations . ”
The investigation also found that Mann had not deviated from accepted practices in the process of conducting his research , both with regard to data collection , data analysis , and the sharing of data and source code .
The investigators interviewed three eminent climate researchers , Dr. William Curry of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , Dr. Jerry McManus of Columbia University , and Dr. Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and all three largely agreed that it was standard practice to analyze data that others had collected and that it was normal to keep data and code private for some period of time .
Lindzen felt that data gathered and analyzed using public funds should be expected to be public , but Curry pointed out that his agreement with the NSF let him keep data private for two years .
The investigation found that Mann had made all of his data available on - line since 2000 and that his code was now available as well when it was reasonable to make it available .
For example , Mann ’s recent MATLAB code is not compiler / processor dependent like his early FORTRAN77 code was , and so making the early code public was n’t reasonable but publishing the MATLAB code was .
Furthermore , the investigation found that it was not reasonable that Mann ’s research conduct was too different from accepted practices when his work had been reproduced ( albeit it with slight changes ) repeatedly since his 1998 / 1999 papers .
In addition , the investigators felt that Mann ’s teaming up with other researchers represented a check on any ethical violations
Mann might have otherwise been tempted to commit :
The checks and balances inherent in such a scientific team approach further diminishes chances that anything unethical or inappropriate occurred in the conduct of the research .
The investigation also pointed out that the sheer number and type of awards that Mann has won , even when placed under “ intense scrutiny from scientists who may or may not agree with his scientific conclusions ” suggested that Mann ’s research conduct was well within accepted practices .
The combination of these three different lines of evidence convinced the investigators that Mann had not deviated from accepted practices for research conduct .
The investigation found that Mann had not deviated from accepted practices with regard to reporting his research , specifically with respect to publishing peer - reviewed papers .
According to the investigation report , Mann ’s 39 papers as first author and 55 papers as a co-author meant that his work had been reviewed in detail by “ dozens of the most highly qualified scientists in the world ” and that Mann would not have been as successful in publishing had his papers “ been outside of accepted practices in his field . ”
Mann himself mentioned an issue in the CRU emails regarding peer review , namely that a number of editors of the journal Climate Research resigned as a result of the publication of several papers deemed by the editors to be of low quality .
A detailed description of what happened by one of the editors who resigned , Dr. Hans von Storch , is available here .
Given this statement , it ’s clear that the CRU email discussions regarding the journal Climate Research related to a quality control issue , not any attempt by scientists to pervert the peer - review process .
That the investigation neglected to mention this issue at all in their conclusions even though Mann himself brought it up suggests that the investigation agreed with Mann ’s interpretation of events .
Finally , the investigation found that Mann did deviate slightly from accepted practices by sharing unpublished manuscripts from colleagues with other colleagues without first getting explicit permission to do so .
However , the investigation found that he was “ careless ” in this , and that being careless was not considered research misconduct – only reckless , knowingly , or intentional actions qualified as research misconduct .
The investigation report contained summaries of all five interviews ( the three mentioned above , Mann himself , as well as Dean William Easterling of Penn State – Mann ’s supervisor ) , and there were a couple of interesting points made in the summaries .
Mann himself pointed out that the published emails represented only part of a larger context and that the publication of the emails would chill communication among scientists , something that has been noted at S&R before .
The second interesting point was made by Lindzen :
When told that the first three allegations against Dr. Mann were dismissed at the inquiry stage of the RA - 10 process , Dr. Lindzen ’s response was : “ It ’s thoroughly amazing .
I mean these are issues that he explicitly stated in the emails .
I ’m wondering what ’s going on ? ”
This suggests that Lindzen felt that the PSU process was a “ whitewash , ” a claim that he made explicit in an email interview reported by the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review .
Other people accusing Penn State of a “ whitewash ” include Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute in both the Washington Post and the New York Times , Nate Benefield of the Commonwealth Foundation in the Centre Daily Times of Pennsylvania , and John Roskam , executive director of the Melbourne , Australia - based free - market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs , in Australia ’s ABC News .
In an interview for The Daily Climate ’s report on the Mann investigation , PSU spokeswoman Lisa Power said :
Obviously the topic of climate change and climate research is one of great debate , ” said Powers .
“ From our perspective we have done due diligence …
Academic misconduct does not happen very often , and when it does , we consider it to be a very serious matter . ”
The university , Powers added , receives $ 765 million annually in research money .
“ We would not put our reputation at risk over a single researcher .
Our expectations are very high . ”
Powers ’ point about research money and reputation echos the conclusions of an S&R investigation on this issue which found that
There is no reason to believe that the PSU administration would risk the university ’s excellent reputation for any single faculty researcher , and especially not for such a small monetary gain as a few million dollars over the last four years .
In addition , another S&R investigation found that the usual claim that “ it ’s all about the research grants ” was n’t reasonable given the massive disparity in available money for climate research vs. fossil fuel - related industries .
The flatbed truck , loaded with steel pipe out of Chattanooga westbound for Oklahoma City , was 30 miles out of Little Rock , cruise control set right at the posted speed limit .
200 feet behind him was another tractor trailer , pulling a dry van loaded with shelves and fixtures for a new Auto Zone store in California .
There had been a light sprinkle earlier , but the road was mostly dry
The Pontiac Transport minivan was headed for Memphis , with a perfectly average couple in the front and their two little girls in their car seats in the back , going to see their Grandma .
The two teenage boys on the overpass were bored .
It probably seemed fairly harmless to put a rock in the plastic shopping bag they found in a ditch and drop it off the overpass to watch somebody dodge it .
When the bag fluttered down in front of the minivan driver he jerked the wheel to the left , dropping his left front tire off the pavement , sending the van onto the wet grass in the shallow median .
With the cruise control set at 70 mph it came out into the westbound lanes at full speed .
The driver of the flatbed got off on the shoulder as far as he could go to the right , the dry van behind him locked all 18 wheels and drifted to the right .
The sloped nose of the minivan went under the left side tandems of the flatbed ; the 17,000 pounds they were carrying flipped it out the back like a potato chip in a high wind .
When the smoke and the dust settled the flatbed was off the road on the grass verge on the right side of the road ; the dry van behind it was stopped on the shoulder ; the minivan was upright out to the right of the flatbed , the highest part maybe waist high off the ground .
The two truck drivers got to it almost simultaneously , the dry van driver carrying a 3 ' crowbar , their only available tool .
The only sign of life was a continuous keening whimper coming from the center area of the minivan .
The crowbar was inadequate to gain access .
An Arkansas State Trooper arrived about ten minutes later , without any tools that would gain access to the minivan , so he joined the truck drivers in standing helpless , listening to that godawful whimpering , refusing to loan his sidearm to the dryvan driver so he could at least do the humane thing .
About 25 minutes after the crash an ambulance arrived , equipped with all manner of medical supplies and equipment and two well - trained paramedics , but no tools that would gain access to the interior of the minivan .
About this time the nature of the keening from inside changed ; one of the girls had fallen silent .
About 35 minutes after the crash a Fire Department Rescue Team arrived , having covered the nearly 50 miles from their station as quickly as they could .
As if a malevolent God with a twisted sense of humor was in charge , the whimpering faded out as they unloaded their equipment .
The foregoing happened , in front of me .
I was driving the dry van .
Out of compassion I have no doubt that the family of the dead was told , as is standard in car / truck wrecks , that the dead " died instantly " .
Based on 15 years and some million - and - a - half miles on American roads , and witnessing dozens ( or hundreds ) of such crashes , I can tell you it 's rarely actually true .
What it really means is that the fate of the dead was sealed upon impact , regardless of how long it took them to get there .
Before we dive into how one can best avoid a fate worse than quick death , let 's review some physics .
Most passenger vehicles on American roads typically weigh between 3,000 and 4,500 pounds .
The biggest passenger vehicle generally encountered , the H1 Hummer , weighs just over 10,000 pounds .
My Freightliner , pulling an empty 53 ' dry van trailer , weighs between 32,000 and 33,000 pounds .
Empty .
Under Federal ( and State ) regulations my maximum legal gross weight is 80,000 pounds , 20 times that of a minivan , eight times what a Hummer weighs .
My tires weigh about 120 pounds each , and are inflated to between 100 - 120 psi .
Just my fuel tanks , when full , weigh as much as the average passenger car .
If we get tangled up , whether it 's your fault , my fault or nobody 's fault at all , you will lose .
Every time .
I cannot adequately teach anyone what they really need to know about sharing roads with commercial trucks in this forum ; riding with me for a week would be ample , but I 'll try .
Since the vast majority of miles driven by trucks is on Interstates and freeways , and most fatal wrecks occur there , that will be my focus .
It takes me longer to do anything in an 80,000 pound truck that 's 65 feet long and bends in the middle than a car ; accelerating , changing lanes , stopping .
Please bear that in mind .
Entering an Interstate in a car should be a simple process ; there 's a clearly marked acceleration lane to allow you to match speed with traffic .
Use it .
Jumping out into a traffic lane at 40 mph in front of a truck going 65 apparently seems like a good idea to a lot of people , but I 've never figured out why .
Most truckers will move over a lane if they can to give merging traffic a clear lane , but running alongside them in the acceleration lane assuming they can or will , then having to brake sharply at the end of the lane ( or darting just in front of them ) is downright stupid .
If you follow a truck onto an Interstate it will seem like it takes it forever to get up to speed ; it seems that way to the guy driving it too .
The dumbest thing you can do is to pop out from behind it without bothering to check on the traffic in the next lane that is already at speed .
The extra ten seconds you have to remain behind the truck is rarely fatal ; the pop - out move frequently is .
Interstates and freeways , by definition , have two or more traffic lanes travelling the same direction separated from opposing traffic by a barrier or median .
READ ALL THE SIGNS !!
In many places , especially in and near metropolitan areas , there are restrictions on which lanes trucks are allowed to use .
The most popular on three - lane roads has become " Trucks must use right two lanes " .
This Rule makes the center lane the Passing lane for trucks , which makes it a piss - poor place for dawdling .
" Keep Right Except to Pass " and " Slower Traffic Keep Right " are , next to speed limits , the most widely ignored signs ( and traffic regulations ) out there .
Most of the time when you look in your mirror ( those shiny things that let you look behind you that few people use ) and see nothing but the grill of a Peterbilt it 's because you are failing to " Keep Right Except to Pass " .
That driver does n't want to tailgate you , he wants to pass ; getting out of the way would be a good plan at this point , but not dawdling with an open lane to your right would be a better plan in future .
There are two safe places to drive in relation to heavy trucks ; behind them or in front of them .
Beside them is a really bad idea for a variety of reasons .
First , it 's much harder for the driver to stay aware of exactly where you are , particularly on the " off " ( right ) side , and you really want the driver of any truck around you to know exactly where you are and where you intend to go .
Running over you is terribly inconvenient .
Perhaps the top reason to avoid running alongside a truck is those tires I mentioned earlier .
The majority of trailer tires on commercial vehicles are recaps , inflated to 120 psi .
When one lets go it can throw chunks weighing 50 pounds or more at velocities well exceeding the truck 's speed , and sounds like a grenade going off .
Scares the hell out of me when it happens 50 feet behind me ; it can ( and does ) knock the window out of a car that 's alongside , even if no rubber hits the car .
If you are going to pass a truck , go ahead and get it completed .
DON'T DAWDLE ALONGSIDE !
Trucks have a modern innovation many people are apparently unfamiliar with , lights down each side ( and on each corner ) that flash ( cars have these too but they are rarely used ) .
These are known to professional drivers as " directional signals " or simply " turn signals " .
If you will watch carefully these give you advance notice of where that vehicle is going to be in the very near future , which is a very good place to arrange to not be when it gets there .
They are NOT an indication that it 's time to speed up so you are n't behind it ; behind it beats under it every time .
There will also be times when you see a truck in front of you suddenly start flashing these " directional signals " on both sides at the same time .
This configuration is known as " emergency flashers " and usually means there is some bad shit of some kind ahead you probably want to hit as slowly as possible .
When traffic is heavy you will notice that trucks tend to leave a gap between their front bumper and the vehicle ahead .
While this space may look invitingly like it is custom designed to fit your car it is actually the driver 's estimate of his safe stopping distance in case the traffic in front stops suddenly .
If you dart into that space and traffic does stop you just made his stopping distance fall somewhere between your headrest and dash .
This is almost always unpleasant .
Should you need to move into such a space simply pull up alongside the space , match your speed to the speed of the vehicle that defines the front of the space , find the control for YOUR " directional signal " ( usually a stick protruding from the left side of your steering column , push it up for " right " or down for " left " , with a little practice you 'll figure it out ) , and give the truck a moment to give you room , they almost always will .
Allow me a sidebar to explain one of the great mysteries of the road , the Phantom Traffic Jam .
Everybody experiences these , where multiple lanes of traffic sharply slow or stop , but no cause is ever encountered .
These are almost invariably caused by assholes who run up almost to their desired Exit three or four lanes to the left of the actual Exit Ramp , then have to force their way across multiple lanes , essentially stopping two lanes at a time until they finally get to the lane they should have been in a mile back .
Avoid being one of these Assholes ( which the Law should allow me to squash ) .
Sharing the road with trucks is a fact of life in America ; EVERYTHING you eat , drink , sit on , work with or play with has to move by truck several times , from raw material to delivery to the point of purchase , before you get your hands on it .
The entire American economy depends on there being millions of trucks in motion 24 hours a day , and there are roughly 50,000 more every year .
Dying under one is largely optional , and the choice is , for the most part , yours .
I forgot to mention , for our Lady Kossacks :
Anything you do , or show , in your car is on glorious display to the truckers you pass .
Our view from the neck down is completely unimpeded , and we are bored .
If you WANT to provide a show , a little portable scenery , then may Dog bless you .
If that 's not your intention keeping your skirt south of your ass might be indicated ...
Note : in one version of the diary , TBK included the following material worth reading : Before I try to pass along a few survival tips to my fellow Kossacks let me address a point or two brought up in the first " Mangled " Diary .
Some folks were upset by what they perceived to be a " Trucks own the road " attitude on my part ( and on the part of truckers in general ) .
While I freely acknowledge that the rules governing right - of - way apply equally to all road users , I also firmly believe that they are trumped , every time , by the Laws of Physics .
In the entire history of motorized transport not a single post - mortum appeal of a fine point of the rules of right - of - way has overturned the original verdict .
Others objected to any suggestion that it is worth their effort to make my life easier on the road .
Fair enough , but consider this :
If you pull the ever - popular " Pull out in front of a truck to immediately turn " maneuver , or any other such move that requires me to slow sharply and drop multiple gears , I will burn between a half and full gallon of diesel regaining my momentum , dumping an extra few pounds of carbon into the air that did n't have to be there .
Anyway , by now I 'm sure that most are aware of the tragic wreck that happened in Washington Thursday night ; apparently the driver did n't get a chance to read my original Diary and now never will .
There may have been alcohol involved , but even if there was it did n't cause the wreck .
The driver failing to remain aware of what was going on around her did .
It does n't matter if it 's because you are reading a newspaper , working on a laptop , concentrating on a cell phone conversation , carrying three shots of Jack Daniels too many or just chatting with your girlfriends in the car , if you are driving and doing anything that keeps you from giving the world around you your full attention you are a danger to yourself , those in your car and sharing the road with you and , perhaps most importantly , me .
The fact that most auto accidents happen within a few miles of home is easily attributable to the fact that most driving is also done close to home , but that misses the more important factor .
Folks driving the same road every day DON'T PAY ATTENTION !!
Everything is routine , they make the same turns at the same places at the same time every morning , without having to think about any of it , so they have plenty of time to review the paperwork for the 8:00 meeting or finish the sports section on the way .
Until something slightly out of the ordinary happens and they kill a pedestrian or drive under a bus that 's running a few minutes late .
The fact that I have managed to drive a truck for roughly 15 years without an accident , driving in whatever conditions and at whatever time is necessary , is partially attributable to luck , but is primarily because I am fanatical about keeping track of every vehicle I can see , calculating what the stupidest possible thing they can do is and having a response ready in case they do it .
If there is a deer in the treeline alongside the road I want to know it , not because it affects me just standing there but because it may not keep standing there .
By far the most important single thing any driver can do to maximize their chances of completing any trip , whether it 's across the Country or two blocks to the store is PAY ATTENTION !
Drunk drivers and idiot kids with cars will both have a much harder time killing you if you have already noticed their erratic driving and considered your options for getting out of their way .
No matter how good a driver you are , no matter how good your reflexes , no matter how attentive you may be bad shit can ( and will , if you drive enough ) happen to or around you .
No matter what happens , KEEP DRIVING !
As long as you have control of your vehicle , use it .
If you lose control , keep trying because you just might get it back .
You can quit driving when you 're dead , but until them putting your hands over your eyes will NEVER improve the situation , but will frequently make it far worse than it has to be .
There are three kinds of things you can hit with a car ; things travelling the same direction as you , things that are not moving relative to you and things that are oncoming .
I list them in that order because that is the order of desirability for hitting them .
Hitting something ( usually a vehicle , obviously ) travelling the same direction is rarely fatal ( unless the speed differential is extreme , in which case you were n't paying attention ) , as long as that 's all you hit .
The most popular way to make this situation far worse is to then hit either a stationary object or an oncoming one by the simple expedient of allowing undirected physics to determine the outcome by not continuing to drive .
Even at high speed a simple sideswipe is not a serious matter ( if you are n't a piece of sheet metal ) but I can't tell you how many times I 've seen a few hundred dollars worth of damage turn tragic because one ( or both ) drivers quit .
NEVER QUIT !
Stationary objects are fairly easy to avoid hitting because , well , they are stationary .
Some , like bridge abutments , are particularly important to avoid hitting because they wo n't move even after you hit them .
The number one way to avoid hitting this kind of stationary object is NEVER LEAVE THE ROAD .
No matter what is happening IN the road you will almost invariably make it worse by leaving any road at high speed .
Hitting a deer or a dog or ass - ending a car that pulls out in front of you is almost always less destructive than what happens if you leave the road , thereby entering an area heavily populated with stationary objects we professionals call " not on the road " .
The only thing worse than hitting a stationary object is hitting one that is oncoming , thereby adding your speed to it 's speed to make the impact truly spectacular .
This is to be avoided at all costs .
If , for any reason , you find yourself driving in the median of a divided highway STAY THERE .
There is nothing in a median that will be as painful to hit as coming out into opposing traffic will be .
There are two primary elements of " control " that you want to maintain , and use , when the shit gets in the fanbelt ; steering and speed .
GET RID OF SPEED .
No matter what kind of bad shit is about to happen to you it will almost invariably be less unpleasant if you are going less fast .
When things go wrong shed speed as fast as you can while not losing control .
Jumping on the brakes with both feet in most emergencies is a bad idea because , anti-lock brakes or not , it is a very good way to relinquish all directional control .
Using your brakes to rapidly bleed speed , on the other hand , is usually the best idea you will have all day when the fan blades get shmeared .
South Georgia , 20 miles or so north of the Florida line on I - 95 .
Raining like two cows pissin ' on the same flat rock .
The kind of rain you only encounter south of Atlanta and east of Mobile , or in a hurricane or monsoon .
The kind of rain where fresh roadkill can be either a bass or a possum , when driving uphill too fast can cause the bends ...
Southbound traffic was fairly light , a line of 8 or 9 trucks spaced out so that the spray from one was mostly below windshield level before the next ran into it , staying in the right lane at about 62 or 63 mph , not so much because of the half - inch of water waiting its turn to run off the road as the feeling of disaster hovering in the air , looking for somewhere to land .
Northbound traffic was heavier , mostly tourists from places like Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania where rain has the common decency to form into individual drops before falling , running nose - to - tail at 55 mph , with trucks scattered here and there amongst them and irritated about it .
One jackass from New Jersey or Vermont or some other jackass incubator dragging his 30 ' camper trailer in the left lane , not moving any faster than the slow lane but apparently only licensed to drive in the left ; behind him , just clear of the cloud of spray coming off the camper tires , a Peterbilt pulling a flatbed with sideboards , loaded with citrus going somewhere up the seaboard .
The last driver in the southbound line saw him first , and warned the trucks in front .
A blue Chevrolet Stepside pickup , lowered to about 3 " off the ground , riding on extra - wide slicks all around , neon lights underneath , stereo decals ( a Table of Contents for thieves ) covering the back windows , every available accessory except a chandolier and a rudder , only one of which would have been useful .
Driver reclining against the door like he was on a couch watching TV , the one hand on the wheel in constant motion as he surfed his way south at about 70 mph .
He was too cool for words .
The southbound drivers started making their estimates on how far he would make it before he crashed ; the most optimistic ( and least experienced ) thought he might make it to the State line .
The cynical bastard leading the pack was just hoping he got past him .
It was bound to happen , so it did , when he was about 50 yards in front of the lead truck of the pack .
Either he over - corrected or hit a wave , but either way the front of the truck drifted left and dropped the left - front tire off the pavement , causing a sharp pull to the left , which the driver tried to counteract by jerking the wheel right .
It did n't bring the front back on the road but it did kick the back wheels out to the left , sending the pickup across the pond that was pretending to be a median like a flat rock .
The citrus - hauler first saw the pickup when it came out of the camper spray , broadside on , still travelling something over 50 , sideways .
With nowhere to go and no time to get there he instinctively stabbed at his brakes , locking his trailer tires which started a drift to the right .
On impact , the left side of the Peterbilt bumper hit square on the driver 's door of the pickup , at a combined closing speed of probably 100 mph , the driver of the pickup trying desperately to get away from the door he'd been reclining against a couple of seconds earlier .
He might as well have flapped his arms and tried to fly .
The pickup windows that did n't blow out instantly turned red ; the impact slowed the Peterbilt but his trailer continued to sweep right , gathering up a couple of carloads of tourists and blocking the road .
The chain - reaction collisions started immediately .
The southbound truck convoy rolled on , agreeing instantly that trying to stop would do far more harm than good .
In between warning non-involved northbound trucks of what was happening right in front of them the driver of the front truck , a cold - blooded bastard who had long since quit being impressed by random death , remarked that whoever called 911 needed to have them load the ambulance with extra sponges and buckets , or a ShopVac ...
Many folks seem to think that they must drive at least the posted limit , regardless of conditions ; these people are frequently known as roadkill .
They might get away with it for years , luck apparently having an affinity for the stupid , but depending on luck when travelling at 100 feet - per - second is not my idea of fun .
Perhaps the most deceptively dangerous driving conditions present themselves when a road is freshly wet , especially if the weather has been dry for a while .
After a few minutes the accumulated oil and rubber and bug guts will wash off , but for those few minutes the road is as slick as it will ever be without ice .
I saw a multi-car accident Tuesday afternoon just outside St. Louis on I - 55 North under exactly these conditions .
A small ( but heavy ) rain squall moved across the highway and within a minutes cars were spinning across four lanes .
One driver losing visibility and hitting their brakes , causing another driver to swerve on a road slicker than babboon snot ...
ANY less - than - optimal condition should trigger an immediate reduction in speed , whether it is rain , fog , snow , heavier traffic or livestock in the road .
At 70 mph you are covering almost 100 feet every second ; at 50 mph it 's closer to 70 feet .
Go out into your front yard and mark off these differences so you can visualize them , the difference can be huge .
At the same time , the difference can be barely significant .
Most trips by car are in the neighborhood of ten miles or less ; at 70 mph ten miles takes about 8 1/2 minutes .
Cutting your speed to 60 mph for the same trip adds an entire minute - and - a - half , ninety seconds , while increasing significantly your chances of completing it unhindered by death or dismemberment , both of which are notorious for the delays they cause .
I wo n't even mention the significant improvement in fuel efficiency , and reduction in emissions , because everybody knows Liberals do n't care ...
The time to chop your speed is NOT when you hit adverse conditions , it 's when you see them .
Every year we hear about horrendous chain - reaction crashes involving dozens of vehicles piling up in fog banks .
In somewhere between a million - and - a - half and two million highway miles I have never seen fog , except where it was artificially produced , that went immediately from clear to thick .
If you run into fog that reduces your visibility at all lose some speed ; if the fog clears you can resume your speed with the loss of a few seconds .
If it thickens and you are going 50 instead of 70 that thirty feet - per - second difference might well be a life - or - death difference .
A note to those who drive SUVs ; STOP WATCHING THE COMMERCIALS !!
Four wheel drive WILL give you increased traction to get started on snow or ice ( or mud or sand ) , but , at speed , it makes you MORE likely to get in a skid and makes any skid MORE likely to result in a loss of control , and SUVs are invariably more top - heavy than other passenger vehicles and thus more prone to rolling over , always a bad thing .
A four wheel drive vehicle CAN proceed on snowy or icy roads roads better than a two - wheel - drive vehicle , but it CANNOT safely proceed faster , because the limiting factor , once in motion , is not driving traction , it 's steering traction , and having power to the steer tires does NOT increase steering traction .
Front - wheel - drive cars are NOT better on snow because the front tires both steer and drive but because the weight of the engine sits over the drive tires .
I see dozens of wrecks every winter that could easily be avoided if folks would understand this one paragraph .
There 's an easy way to gauge whether your speed on sub-optimal roads is appropriate , regardless of whether you are dealing with rain or snow or ice ; swerve 6 inches either way .
If you are afraid to do so because you fear losing control , you are going too fast .
A gazillion different things can happen that will force you to change position within your lane , a chunk of truck tire ( a " gator " ) , an ice ball off a truck ( I 've dropped these things that would weigh 100 + pounds ) , somebody 's ladder .
If you can't swerve by 6 " you are n't really in control , you 're a passenger .
By far the most dangerous road condition in winter is " black ice " , which is hard to see because it 's transparent and has no snow sticking to it .
It does n't matter what you are driving , black ice is a killer .
Watch for it especially under overpasses , where daytime melt runs off the overhead road and refreezes on the road below .
If you are driving in winter and notice lots of trucks pulled off onto the shoulder for no apparent reason , it 's probably because there 's bad black ice ahead .
Note that this does n't apply necessarily to trucks parked on the shoulder of exit and entrance ramps , an every night thing now .
This was extremely rare a few years ago , as it's the worst possible place to park to sleep , but it has been caused by adding trucks to the road far faster than parking places have been added while reducing the allowed hours of operation .
Rest areas are full most nights by 8:30 or so , truckstops by 10:00 or 11:00 .
After that ramps are the only place left .
A final note that I may have covered in a previous Diary but am too lazy to go check ; if road conditions are less than ideal forget that you have a cruise control , TURN IT OFF !
You need to be actively in control of everything , and having your car trying to accellerate when you are busy avoiding an obstruction or evading a skidding car is not helpful .
I will not be citing any scholarly studies in this section , because I 'm not aware of any that are based on gathering observations for over 100,000 miles a year since the advent of portable phones .
I have watched , with interest , since " portable phones " came in bags with shoulder straps and weighed ten pounds , and were rare as virgin dancers in Las Vegas .
You , or a family member , are more likely to be injured or killed by a driver talking on a cell phone than a drunk driver !!
An individual driver on the phone is slightly less dangerous than a drunk , but in the aggregate they are far worse because they vastly outnumber drunks , particularly during the daytime .
Their contribution to motor vehicle accidents is grossly under- reported and under - appreciated because , unlike drunks , there 's a cellphone in damned - near every car and truck on the road , so it 's usually not even worthy of note .
Drivers with a cell phone stuck to their head are , like drunks , blissfully unaware of their surroundings .
In polite company I call them " cell - zombies " ; most of the time I more accurately call them stupid motherfuckers .
If you are observant they are usually fairly easy to recognize .
They invariably stay glued in whatever lane they happen to start out in , even when a lane change would be appropriate or safer , to the extent of never noticing an emergency vehicle behind them with flashing lights ( until they bump the siren ) .
Generally , their speed will gradually decrease , because like everything else they are n't paying attention to their speedometer .
Drivers on cell phones , when they finally DO realize they must change lanes , are far less likely than the average driver to signal the change or visually clear the lane they are moving into , and , since they frequently fail to keep track of where they are geographically , are more likely than most to cross several lanes at once , having run past their exit while getting caught up on what Suzy is cooking for dinner .
They are more likely to run red lights because they do n't notice them , and will invariably be the last to react to visible road hazards ahead .
I understand that in today 's world it is almost unavoidable that even the most responsible driver will get / make fairly important calls while driving , but it is fairly easy to minimize the chances that doing so will contribute to your hurting or killing someone .
First , if the call cannot be cut short within about a minute , get off the road .
If the call requires that you give or receive detailed instructions or write anything longer than a phone number down , get off the road .
While you are actually on the phone you have to consciously and aggressively compensate for the deficiencies celling causes , by forcing yourself to remain hyper - aware of your surroundings and keeping your eyes moving , constantly , from the road in front to your mirrors to your instruments ( as you should anyway ) .
And for the Love of Corn , if you have a teenager who drives ( that you want to keep around ) find some way to get across to them that there is no way that somebody who is , at best , marginally safe to drive on dry roads in broad daylight can pull it off when their feeble little addled mind is absorbed with what they are texting or talking about .
The most dangerous car on the road is NOT the 1978 Cutlass Supreme with lots of Bondo and a 40 - year - old drunk at the wheel ; it 's a Pontiac Sunbird with 4 or 5 teenaged girls in it , most or all of whom are on the phone .
The only way it can be worse is if the driver is texting .
DON'T BE A TWIT , YOU CANNOT SAFELY TEXT AND DRIVE !!
I 've never been entirely sure just how long a New York Minute actually is , most doin's by city folk being something of a mystery to me , but based on the context it 's used in I always assumed it was some indefinite but short period of time ( as well as the title of a very good Don Henley song ) .
A week ago Monday I was reminded of just how quickly things can change , and it very nearly got me ( and some other people ) killed .
I had a load of PVC pipe fittings that went to Denver and Seattle , got the first half of the load delivered in Denver first thing Monday and headed on up to final - out Wednesday .
Weather was good , mostly cloudy , about 20 degrees with a stiff breeze out of the north that was carrying a continuous stream of fine powder snow across I - 80 as I crossed Wyoming .
Traction was unimpaired , but I was easing along at 65 mph instead of the posted 75 just ' cause .
About 20 miles west of Rawlins , after a couple of hours of running on the same stuff , I topped a hill ( MM 184 for those into details ) and knew I was in serious trouble .
Scattered at random over the mile - and - a - half long downslope in front of me were between 15 and 20 various trucks and cars , including a couple of State Trooper cruisers that were slid off to the right .
Over on the eastbound side , where traffic was trying to go uphill , a couple of jack - knifed rigs had effectively closed the road , and a few cars had apparently slid off here and there .
I really did n't have time for sightseeing , since I was still going west at 65 mph .
I immediately offered up the Trucker 's Prayer ( " Oh , Shit " ) to anybody who might be listening .
Ice .
Gingerly , like I was extracting old , unstable dynamite from the rectal cavity of a menopausal grizzly with a toothache , I applied a little brake .
Nothing happened .
Casually glancing in my left mirror I observed the interesting phenomenom of seeing my trailer tires not turning , while I proceeded west at a steady 65 mph .
( the metering valve on tractor - trailers , if properly adjusted , always applies braking pressure to the trailer slightly ahead of the tractor )
After enjoying watching my trailer tires for a leisurely 11 milliseconds or so , I redirected my attention forward , and started trying to figure out what and where I was going to hit , first .
The small part of my brain that calculates pot odds for me when I 'm playing poker chimed in that it figured there was a 49 % chance that I would hit another vehicle before leaving the road , an equal chance I would leave the road before hitting another vehicle , a 1 % chance I would make the bottom of the hill intact and upright and a 1 % chance that I could build a cushion of profanity and levitate my truck to the next upslope .
I immediately started cussing , with enthusiasm .
I could n't turn the steering wheel , because if all eight trailer tires can lock without any discernible effect the two up front are n't going to grab much , and I was still pointed down the road , although drifting very slowly to the left because of the wind .
I could n't just activate my ejection seat and bail out because I do n't have an ejection seat .
I could n't detect any levitation starting , so I had to try something desperate .
Most big trucks have what 's commonly called a " Jake brake " , an engine compression brake that functions by starving one or more cylinders of fuel and using the compression of the engine to slow the drive wheels .
Normally , using it in extremely slick conditions is suicidal , because slowing the middle sets of wheels on a vehicle that bends in the middle will cause it to bend in the middle , which tends to be unpleasant at 65 mph , but since I had that ejection seat problem I had to do something , and turning around so I hit ass - first did n't seem all that terrible a prospect .
My truck is a fairly new model , with the Jake brake control in a stick off the right side of the steering column , and gives me the choice of how many cylinders I want to starve , from 1 to 6 .
I tried 1 , then 2 , and nothing happened .
Gingerly , very gingerly , I tried 3 .
The truck did n't jump out from under me but I noticed that my southerly drift ceased , so I was going straight down what appeared to be the middle of the road .
About this time my " Low Air Warning " alarms and lights went off , a response to the fact that I had been blowing my air horns continuously to try to warn the folks downhill that I was coming .
The funny thing about air brake systems is that if the air pressure drops below safe operating pressure all the brakes lock , which would have been suboptimal right at that moment , so I decided that everybody who was paying attention already knew I was coming so I quit blowing the horn .
I had to get some sort of steering control , so I decided to try another notch of Jake brake , and eased it up to 4 .
Contrary to expectations , again the truck did n't jump out from under me , but started a gradual drift back to the right .
Well , hell , the wind would make me drift left , the Jake would make me drift right , what more could anybody want ??
I wish I could claim that superior driving skills left me around to write this Diary , but the truth is I got extremely lucky .
Since my load was light to start with , and half of it had already been removed in Denver , there was practically no weight on my trailer tires , so it did n't immediately jack - knife when I tried the brakes and did n't have enough weight to push things out of line when I started Jaking it .
The problem was a matter of timing : a break in the clouds when the Sun was at just the right angle had allowed the road to warm just enough to melt enough snow to wet the surface .
When the clouds closed it froze into a thin layer of ice without offering any visible clues to what was going on under the steady stream of migrating snow .
There 's no great moral to this story , just a reminder that when driving , like when living , there 's merit to Don Henley 's words :
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
A final note : I will quit Posting this when folks quit driving like idiots ...
EPILOGUE ( by SD ) :
In his last diary here , at least for a while , The Baculum King announced his real name as Jeffrey D. Greer .
He specifically invited people to republish this diary as they saw fit ( which I had previously promised him that I would do . )
He announced that he would be spending the next 24 to 46 months reachable at this address : Jeffrey D. Greer # 21561-076
FCI YAZOO CITY LOW
FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION
P.O. BOX 5000
YAZOO CITY , MS 39194
He can ( as of this last report ) receive letters and packages there .
He continued :
For the love of corn , please do n't send anything that might be considered " contraband " , but if you run across any cheap African hunting books , recent or old ...
Some folks asked how they could drop a few dollars into my commissary account , apparently that 's best done with a USPS money order made out to " Jeffrey D. Greer # 21561-076 " sent to : Federal Bureau of Prisons
Jeffrey D. Greer
# 21561-076
Post Office Box 474701
Des Moines , Iowa 50947-0001
Again , please do n't consider this a solicitation for shit , it is provided strictly for those who asked .
Ya'll keep up the good work during my absence , hold this Administration 's feet to the fire when they need it , support them when they warrant it and watch those Republican bastards , they can't be as stupid as their public face would lead one to believe : they are up to something .
The Baculum King let people know , as is discussed in comments in his last diary , that he was convicted of extortion ( of Las Vegas casinos who had let papers with unprotected private customer information into a load on his truck . )
I looked into his case and I can say that while I would not recommend that anyone else get as close to the line between legal " hard bargaining " and illegal extortion as he did , if I were a defense attorney I would have had absolutely no problem defending his actions in good conscience .
I agree with his view that if he " crossed the line , " many other more powerful players cross that line in business negotiations routinely .
Others hold a more negative view of his actions ; that too is in that last diary 's comments .
( It probably does n't matter much to you , but it 's there . )
If you appreciate the service TBK did in writing this diary , you know where to reach him and where to thank him .
For my part , having taught one daughter to drive this past year , I will send him my thanks for giving them something this good to read .

GAITHERSBURG , Md. 
A federal advisory panel voted unanimously Thursday that federal drug regulators should approve a medicine that could help prevent pregnancy if taken as late as five days after unprotected sex .
The pill , called ella , sprang from government labs and appears to be more effective than Plan B , a morning - after pill now available over the counter to women 18 and older that gradually loses efficacy after intercourse and can be taken at latest three days after sex .
Ella , by contrast , works just as well on the fifth day as the first after sex .
Ella blocks the effects of progesterone , a female hormone that spurs ovulation .
It is a chemical relative to RU - 486 , the abortion pill , and some mystery remains over exactly how it works .
That mystery spurred a fierce debate outside the committee over whether it should be considered an abortion drug , a debate that prompted the posting of several uniformed police officers around the meeting room .
The F.D.A. usually follows the advice of its advisory panels but not always .
The dispute is whether the drug works by delaying ovulation ( as the pill ’s manufacturer claims ) or by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting itself in the uterus ( as anti-abortion advocates say ) .

Republicans who are loath to do their own jobs are thankfully not reticent to run around pointing fingers at Obama and demand , “ Mr. President !
Do your job ! ”
This is said in what I can assure you is not a racist tone , because the only racism we need to worry about is reverse racism , as you would know if you were a rich white man who has suffered mightily trying to get someone to stop you and ask for your birth certificate .
It just sucks to be ignored .
Advertisements
But never fear , while the President dithers away his year and half of office , atrophied permanent fixtures of government welfare decay such as Governor Perry and Senator McCain , he of the illegals are “ intentionally causing accidents ” on highways , are busy running for office by implying that the President is n’t doing his job .
Lots of finger pointing here over the election year hot button issue of illegal immigration — a problem neither Perry or McCain can or should have done anything about previously , seeing as , you know ….
they are impotent .
‘ Cuz if you just listen to them , they will tell you that Washington is broken !
Which is sort of an argument to NOT reelect them , but please , have some pity and reelect them because if the President would do their job , they would n’t have to .
Or something .
And also , McCain ’s ego is fragile and there ’s no earmark like an ego boost .
But it ’s not just the mens playing politics this season .
Certainly - not - a- racist Governor Jan Brewer of the “ Papers Please ” bill in Arizona is running an ad demanding that the dark man in office “ Do his job ” !
“ Washington is broken Mr. President , ” the governor says in the ad .
“ Do your job .
Secure our borders . ”
But , I thought Gov Brewer ’s new illegal immigration law was going to secure our borders ?
No ?
Why does she need Obama to help her ?
Oh , stop asking questions you naughty liberal elite !
Brewer has requested 6,000 National Guard troops .
She only got 524 out of the 1200 deployed to stalk our borders .
I guess a good many of them are off fighting for our freedoms in that war that their President started and the rest of them are in the Gulf helping to clean up the consequences of their President ’s deregulation policies .
Why does Brewer hate America ?
Apparently , brown people are the new gay marriage .
Razzle , dazzle angry voter !
Look over here !
Seems like Republicans are always askin ’ the feds for resources they themselves both decry and deplete , in what can only be an attempt to demonstrate yet again that government does n’t work , or more to the point , that a Democratic President ca n’t do his job .
Dare I suggest that they need to pay attention to the President instead of spending their time mocking and obstructing him for political points ?
Maybe they would learn something .
Oh , what am I saying ?
We know how they feel about education .
Also , I ca n’t help wantin ’ to ask one of our Party of No-ers if Washington is broken , is n’t that sort of a reflection on them ?
After their 8 - year reckless deregulation bender through every sector of our economy , the American people sent them packing to rehab only to have the Republicans come out dry drunks who did n’t really address their addiction .
Talk about following in Bush ’s footsteps .
Instead , they cling to their crutches of obstruction , stalling , blocking , and whining no before they point childish , gleeful fingers at the President in the desperate hope it will catch on .
Yeah , they ’re still playing follow - the - leader , but I guess they never look behind them to see if anyone is following .
Poor things .
And this , I promise you , is an example of the rampant reverse racism threatening our nation !
But lest you think the Republicans have no diversity , no room for dissent within the authoritarian structure of their platform , Sarah Palin screeches , “ Mr. President , do your job because I quit mine ! ”
See ?
Ain’t that an original twist on the theme that all Americans can get behind ?
Because nothing says “ can - do American spirit ” quite like quitting .
I mean , where do ya’ think Brewer got the idea that she should point fingers at the dark man in office and demand that he do his job ?
From none other than Tea Party leader and most - definitely - not - a - racist - but - afraid - of - the - dark - people in Hawaii Sarah Palin , that bastion of reasoned thought and hard work :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51-Ucawn9bg
Sarah Palin ’s father ( he of the “ teachin ’ his daughter to skin a donkey ” quote ) Chuck Heath explained to writers Conroy and Walshe ( authors of “ Sarah From Alaska ” ) that the presence of so many Asians and Pacific Islanders made Palin uncomfortable in Hawaii : “ They were a minority type thing and it was n’t glamorous , so she came home . ”
Yes , a minority type thing .
But she is not a racist !
Stop that BS !
Just because Sarah Palin has been trekking through the nation spewing her hysterical hatred and transparent jealousy of the President does n’t mean she does n’t have an idea about stuff .
She does !
You can read any and all of ‘em on her Fraudbook page .
And I have to thank Sarah Palin for kindly having her “ ideas ” ghost - written , her single act of charity since she took to the stage bedazzled in red as our National Celebrity of Hate and Lies .
Meanwhile the House Minority Leader John Orange Man Boehner ( have we seen his birth certificate ? ) is busy saying the financial problems of every day Americans are small like a ant and we should n’t try to fix them ‘ cuz the free market will … …
Regulate itself .
Uh-huh .
And I ’m just spit - ballin’ here , but I do n’t think the majority of Americans will cotton to Boehner ’s suggestion that we move the retirement age up again to 70 ( after Republicans privatize our Social Security and Medicare , this wo n’t be an issue because we will have to work until we fall over dead , which will greatly reduce the number of us who get to retirement age anyway in a perfect conservative dance of Darwinian regression ) .
Gotta love that laissez - faire government !
Maybe it ’s just me , but I ’m tired .
Maybe I need to quit my job and run around the country trying to start a Civil War .
I hear that ’s what Real Americans do now .
I hear it pays “ rill ” good .
We can expect more shock and awe from the Republicans this election season , especially since they lost that great GOP get out the vote tactic of the falsely inflated terrorist threat levels .
Do n’t change a horse in midstream cuz ya’ know , only the Republicans can keep you safe — even though the biggest domestic terrorist attack happened on their watch after the East coast elite faux Texan rancher ignored Intel .
Sigh .
Will someone please save these dry drunks from themselves ?
Our nation is at risk .
Buckle up cuz we ’re going to be forced to watch the Republicans compete to see who best appeal to their furious flock , using the lowest form of reptilian , tribal fear of the brown people .
I ’m bettin ’ on Brewer since we lost the chicken lady .
What is the deal with achievements ?
– asked in my best Jerry Seinfeld voice , of course .
( Kids , ask your parents . )
Remember when the goal of a videogame was , well , to beat the game ?
Rescue the princess , piece together the Triforce , kill the big alien monster , defeat all the other fighters .
Or maybe , as in the case of Tetris , postpone your inevitable defeat as long as possible and rack up a high score .
When you were at the arcade ( again , kids , ask your parents ) feeding quarters into the machine and you got the chance to put in your initials , the only indicator of your success was a number : your score .
It did n't say how few quarters you used , or how many power - ups you got along the way , or if you found all the secret zones .
But somewhere along the way , winning the game or getting a high score simply was n't enough .
Maybe it was the advent of online gaming , suddenly being connected to other gamers all around the world .
Or maybe it was savvier marketing by game designers , realizing that adding side goals increases re-playability .
They 're like little gold stars that the game gives you so you 'll keep playing another five minutes .
Oh !
I just got an achievement for playing for five minutes !
If I play 10 more minutes , I 'll get another one !
Many of the iPhone games I 've played include achievements as well , and they certainly make you look at a game differently :
This time when I play , I 'll go as fast as possible to get a " shortest time " achievement .
And then I 'll play it slowly to make sure I get all the coins for another achievement .
Next I 'll work on killing all the bad guys .
Usually the achievements are set up so that there 's no way you can get all of them your first time through – they require different types of gameplay and strategy , many of which wo n't actually move you toward the actual goal of the game .
Zack Hiwiller 's spoof " If Mario Was Designed in 2010 " sums it up well , playing off the idea that a simple goal like finishing off Bowser and rescuing the princess simply would n't be enough motivation for today 's gamers .
And Armor Games ' " Achievement Unlocked " is a little Flash metagame that 's purely about getting achievements .
The slogan : " Do n't worry , metagaming is all that matters . "
The " game " involves moving a little blue elephant around on a single level , but in the meantime the screen fills up with achievements for everything from " finding the menu screen " to " not moving . "
Of course , if unlocking achievements were limited to the world of videogames , that would be one thing .
But they 're spilling over .
Hiwiller himself had a post titled simply Achievement Unlocked which was , from what I can tell , a video of himself proposing to his girlfriend .
The Dallas Video Game Examiner suggested last year you should spice up your resume with videogame achievements .
The most frightening example of real - life achievements , though , has to be Jesse Schell 's talk at the DICE Summit in February .
You may have seen this already , but Schell predicts a time ( in the not - so - distant future ) when technology has become cheap and ubiquitous enough that almost everything we do will be a sort of game .
Brush your teeth ?
Ten points !
Brushed your teeth every day this week ?
Bonus !
You get points for taking the bus or walking , points for paying attention to ads on your TV and having Dr. Pepper five days in a row .
Schell ends on an optimistic note about how all of this record - keeping and game - playing might make us better people .
But it does n't change the fact that the world he envisions is one in which our actions are chosen by the points we get for them .
While we 're not in Schell 's world yet , I know that my perspective can be easily swayed by this idea .
Maybe today I 'm trying to hit a certain number of pageviews ; maybe I want to get my inbox down to zero ; maybe I get a little rush every time I can check another thing off my to - do list .
But if videogame achievements can make us ignore the end goal in favor of a little gold star , is there any doubt that real - life " achievements " can distract us from what 's actually important in life ?
Certainly , incentives can be used to drive good behavior , but there 's no guarantee that companies or organizations able to provide the most effective incentives will be the ones with the most altruistic motives .
( And , of course , if I 'm the one unconsciously making up my own achievements , I know they 're not always going to be what 's best for me . )
I 'm not saying that achievements in videogames are inherently a bad thing .
I 'm just saying that perhaps we should take a step back and consider how they make us relate to the world .
Now , if you 'll excuse me , I need to go check off another completed post .
Three more and I get a gold star !
Edited : I had made a comment about games today being " made for the ADHD crowd , " and was chastised by a reader who is actually diagnosed with ADHD .
This reader pointed out that my statement was casual , insulting , and showed a lack of understanding about what ADHD actually is , and just helps to further stigmatize those who have it .
My sincere apologies — I 've removed that line from the post .

A behind the scenes look at Microsoft , interviewing Scott Guthrie and other key figures at Microsoft on the initial steps towards what became the .NET Framework .
Scott Guthrie describes how he prototyped the first version of ASP.
NET over one weekend in the Christmas of ' 97 , and how Microsoft took the risky decision ( at least at the time ) to build almost all of it in C# .
Performance was a massive issue - with the initial versions of ASP.
NET maxing out at only 4/5 requests per second - but eventually evolving into a system that could cope with thousands .
Everything we now take for granted - easy access to the file system , COM interop , even adding two numbers together - were huge milestones at the time .
You can catch the next episode , on the evolution of Visual Studio .NET here , or the previous one on the early developer tools at Microsoft .

A Phoenix police officer prepares to arrest a demonstrator in front of the U.S. District Courthouse in Phoenix last week while the court considered a lawsuit against the anti-illegal - immigration statute .

MEXICO CITY 
The other side of the border is also preparing for the implementation of Arizona 's new immigration law , which could lead to a surge of deportees back to Mexico .
Migrant shelters along the border in Mexico say they 're bracing for new arrivals after the law goes into effect Thursday .
NEWS HUNT : Help rate the best ( and worst ) immigration stories FULL COVERAGE : Read more about Arizona 's law Mexico 's government has added more workers to its consulate in Phoenix to assist detained Mexicans .
Migrants who have been deported say they 're watching to see how the law is enforced before deciding whether to try again to cross the border illegally into Arizona .
" On the plane , everybody was talking about the law , " said Ernesto González , a deportee who arrived here last week on a U.S. government flight from Tucson .
" Everybody knows it 's coming . "
Arizona 's law makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally .
It requires police to check a person 's immigration status when the person has been involved in another offense and the officer has reasonable cause to suspect the person is in the country illegally .
The check can be made only during the course of a lawful police action , such as a traffic stop or investigation of a crime .
The law also allows Arizona citizens to sue police departments if they feel the new law is not being enforced — a provision related to " sanctuary cities , " where local government officials refuse to enforce anti-illegal - immigration laws .
The Obama administration and several rights groups have sued to stop the law from taking effect .
The Mexican government has filed a " friend of the court " brief supporting the lawsuits .
In Nogales , Sonora , the state shelter for migrant children added 50 beds to the 100 it already had , Director Maria Isabel Arvizu said .
The San Juan Bosco shelter in Nogales also is expecting more migrants , Director Francisco Loureiro said .
" All of us are getting ready for people to come back , " Arvizu said .
The Mexican Foreign Ministry declined to comment on preparations for the law .
But El Universal newspaper reported that the consulate in Phoenix increased its consular - protection staff from eight to 11 and is distributing pamphlets to inform Mexicans about the law .
Across Mexico , radio talk shows , blogs and the news media have turned Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer into a household name .
On Friday , a morning show on Televisa aired a comedy skit in which an actor dressed as the Republican governor rampages through Mexico City with a stun gun , zapping people .
The country 's newspapers have been running articles daily about the legal battle over the law .
Academics in Mexico say they are paying attention to the Arizona law and similar proposals in other U.S. states , said Victor Manuel Sánchez , a researcher at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences , a graduate school in Mexico City .
" It 's going to have an effect on the ways people migrate , " Sánchez said .
The Mexican government has also made changes to its own immigration laws after some rights groups , such as Amnesty International , claimed it was mistreating illegal immigrants in its country .
This month , Mexico increased the punishment for migrant smugglers from a maximum of 12 years in prison to 16 years .
And the Mexican Interior Ministry said it will step up efforts to protect migrants here in response to a report by the United Nations that accused Mexico police of robbing migrants and extorting bribes from them .
However , Mexico retains Article 67 , a law that requires local Mexican authorities to check the immigration papers of all foreigners who come to them for help .
Many Mexicans coming off the deportation flight here last week said the risk of being punished as criminals under the Arizona law was making them think twice about trying to get back into the state .
" I think people are going to think harder about it and decide not to risk it because it 's scary to think that you 'll be tried as a criminal and they 'll want to put you in jail , " said Francisco Juárez , who jumped a border fence into Arizona on Tuesday and was caught minutes later by the Border Patrol .
Others , though , said nothing would stop them .
" My wife is up there .
My whole life is up there , " said Efrén de la Paz , 34 .
" Of course I 'm going to try again . "

Trust takes a long time to build , and only a few moments to be destroyed .
That has to be one of the great trust platitudes .
In fact , it literally is : there ’s a website that ranks the most popular trust quotes , and essentially that quote is number 3 ( numbers one and two are inexplicably complex ) .
Many truisms are in fact true ; that ’s how they came to be truisms .
But some are not ; and this is an example .
Trust Takes a Long Time to Build ?
Not necessarily , in fact frequently not .
That ’s what I want to talk about today .
Trust Takes Only a Few Moments to Be Destroyed ?
Even less true .
That ’s what I ’ll talk about next .
Trust Takes Time : Not .
“ At once my mind was made up .
I knew I could trust this young man implicitly , ” goes a tale of petty larceny from the web .
Researchers tell us that the propensity to trust can be increased or decreased simply by chemicals ; increased by Oxytocin , decreased by testosterone .
Neither takes long to administer .
How about trustworthiness ?
Think about the symbolism that goes on when you enter your physician ’s office : the white coat , the stethoscope , the faint odor of something ( I always assume ether , which probably went out with Sherlock Holmes ) , the degree on the wall .
How long does that take ?
Not long .
“ I trusted him instantly , ” says Emma - Jane Corser of her husband , whom she met online .
She ’s not alone .
This is profoundly common human behavior ; we all make split - second decisions based on a variety of factors , few of which boil down to the kind of analytically - based routine we like to think of ourselves as following .
Peter Tingling and Michael Brydon write incisively in Sloan Management Review about “ evidence - based decision - making ” and “ decision - based evidence making . ” Jeffrey Gitomer says , “ People buy with their hearts , and rationalize it with their brains . ”
Trust is hardly the only kind of decision we make quickly .
What Kind of Trust Takes Time ?
Of course , platitudes do n’t achieve that status out of thin air .
There ’s usually something to them , and of course there ’s something here too .
In the Trust Equation , one of the factors is reliability ( the others are credibility , intimacy , and an other - orientation ) .
Reliability is the only factor that requires the passage of time to be evaluated .
Think of all the ways we link trustworthiness to time .
She walks the talk .
He does what he says he ’ll do .
She ’s never let me down .
He ’s always been there for me .
If she says she ’ll do it , you can take it to the bank .
And so forth .
Finally , there ’s what the social scientists and trust academics call “ generalized ” trust — the propensity to believe well of the motives of strangers , and to be generally optimistic about the future .
That one , it turns out , takes ages to turn around — negatively or positively .
As Dr. Eric Uslaner points out , generalized trust is pretty much installed with mother ’s milk .
So : does trust take time or not ?
Clearly , this is one of those cases where the right answer is , “ it depends . ”
And what it depends on is the type of trust we ’re talking about .
Does it take a long time to be seen as trustworthy ?
Let ’s break it down :
Type of Trust Takes Time ?
Trustworthiness
Credibility Not much
Reliability Yes , by definition
Intimacy
Not necessarily ; usually pretty clear pretty quickly
Other - focus
Not necessarily ; usually pretty clear pretty quickly
Propensity to trust
In institutions Shifts over a few years
In specific people Not much time
Generalized trust A long time — typically from birth

EA CEO John Riccitiello defended his company 's new Online Pass initiative , saying that these days development work was n't finished " when a game ships . "
Last month , EA unveiled its new Online Pass plan , which was essentially EA Sports ' version of the Project Ten Dollar initiative : Gamers who buy used copies of the EA Sports titles must pay $ 10 for a pass to play multiplayer online - the same pass comes in new copies of the game , free .
Most people assumed that , like Project Ten Dollar , this initiative was designed to either curb used sales or to allow EA to actually see some money for transactions .
EA responded that the goal of the Online Pass was to offer more value and content for online users , not to curb the used market - a statement which had pretty much everyone reading coughing into their fists .
Speaking with IndustryGamers , Riccitiello emphasized his support for the system when asked whether or not he thought that comment was " disingenuous . "
Ten years ago , five years ago , we 'd gold master a game , the dev team would move on to something else and no one was there .
Today , what happens with a game is a team is there where you [ use data ] to improve it , provide great post - release content , new services like we did with FIFA and Madden recently with Ultimate Team .
I mean the project is only half done when we ship it .
It keeps going .
We 're selling services ...
We 're going to prove that what we say is not disingenuous .
That said , Riccitiello admitted he understood why people were skeptical of anything that came out of the mouth of publishers - that some gamers were " people that carry a cynicism about publishers in general , and they 're always going to . "
When asked what he'd tell a gamer who bought the latest Madden or FIFA used only to find that he had to pay an extra $ 10 to play online , Riccitiello answered : " Well , we thank you for your business .
You did n't used to be a customer of ours , and now you are .
We 're going to prove to you that that ten dollars is exceptionally well spent . "
If you have time , the whole interview is well worth a read , covering multiple topics like what 's coming at E3 and the highly - publicized Activision / Bungie team - up .
Riccitiello certainly sounds more candid and gamer - ish than certain other CEOs I could name , but then again that 's part of his job , is n't it ?
Regarding the Online Pass thing , though ... I have to say that I think he 's both right and wrong .
On the one hand , yes , it 's true that the advent of DLC means that developers can continue supporting games after release .
There does come a point during development where literally no new content can be added , and at that point the developers either move on , get fired , or sit around doing nothing - why not put them to work ?
And supporting a game after its launch is work that they deserve to be paid for .
So in that regard , Riccitiello is absolutely correct .
On the other hand - come on , dude .
Everybody and their dog knows that even if the Online Pass was n't designed specifically to curtail the used game market , that 's certainly going to be an ancillary effect of the whole thing .
Just be straight and say " Yeah , we 'd like to see some money off of used game sales , that 'd be nice , " and people would buy it a whole lot easier .

John “ Jack ” Roberts Jr. , 59 , used to be a respected real estate attorney in Massachusetts .
He coached his town ’s basketball team , and routinely volunteered his time for local causes .
Now , he faces charges of larceny after admitting that he stole $ 650,000 from a client to fuel his online poker habit .
Roberts took the money from a Middleboro resident named Norman Sasville .
He wired the money directly to his favorite online poker sites in the United States , where he liked to play in poker tournaments during his spare time .
He pleaded guilty on Friday in Barnstable Superior Court .
The disbarred attorney has since been sent to Taunton State Hospital for a pre-trial psychiatric evaluation .
“ He ’s had some issues , ” said assistant district attorney Nicole Manoog .
Robets has in the past been treated for mental health issues , and twice attempted suicide .
The judge presiding over the case decided Roberts should be evaluated so that a fitting sentence could be delivered .
This is actually the second time Roberts has been caught stealing from clients to fuel his habit of gambling at American poker rooms .
In 2007 , he was sentenced to house arrest after admitting to stealing $ 137,000 from a woman ’s estate to play poker online .
Roberts was in control of the woman ’s $ 600,000 estate , and was entrusted with managing its finances .
Roberts will not be prosecuted for gambling online , since American gambling laws do not actually forbid online gambling , despite popular belief .
American players can sign up at poker rooms and other gambling sites that are hosted in other countries .
The actual laws only forbid banks from processing financial transactions to and from online gambling sites in the US , but there are plenty of other ways to fund online gaming accounts .

Ms. Gameel has the burdens , but not the privileges , of her male counterparts .
“ I feel like a man , ” she said .
“ Men are the ones who are supposed to struggle and carry the burden of their family .
A woman is meant to provide love , affection and be sheltered .
She should n’t be out and about all the time . ”
The oldest of four children , Ms. Gameel , in her fourth year of accounting studies , had to provide when her father , an illiterate construction worker , retired with severe asthma at 51 and her mother grew too overweight to sew clothes in a factory for less than $ 50 a month .
At first , when she was 19 , she worked as a secretary in a small company that sells air - conditioners .
She liked the office job , and her salary was twice what she makes selling headscarfs .
But her boss was a little too attentive — “ he would keep dropping things on purpose so that I would have to bend down and get them . ”
When Ms. Gameel complained to colleagues , word got to her boss , and he fired her .
Women ’s greater presence in the work force has not translated into any fundamental shift in prevailing attitudes toward women in public life .
Indeed , in a recent survey in association with the International Herald Tribune by the Pew Research Center in Washington , Egypt emerged as one country where women in the workplace clearly take a back seat to men and equal rights are a goal rather than reality .
Sixty - one percent of respondents in Egypt said women should be allowed to work outside the home .
But 75 percent said that when jobs are scarce , men should have more right to work .
American Airlines workers at John F. Kennedy Airport apparently lost luggage belonging to security officials for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , officials said Tuesday .
The lost suitcase -- with weapons inside -- was eventually discovered in Los Angeles .
Four Glock 9 mm handguns that were in the bag are now missing and police officials say they believe they were stolen .
The bag was supposed to have been on the flight from JFK to Washington DC where additional Israeli security officers were being assigned to help with the Israeli leader 's visit with President Obama at the White House .
Port Authority police at JFK are now investigating whether the guns were stolen in New York or after the errant bag arrived in Los Angeles , a PA spokesman said .
Officials said security protocols require travelers with handguns to pack the weapons and send them via checked luggage .
One source said the bag was inspected by Transportation Security Administration screeners who put a seal over the bag at Kennedy Airport , clearing the weapons for shipment to Washington .
A spokesman for the Israeli Consulate referred all calls about the lost bag and the missing handguns to American Airlines .
" When you have a situation related to security , we allow the appropriate law enforcement agencies to handle the situation and we refrain from commenting publicly , so that we do n't hamper an investigation , " said Tim Wagner , a spokesman for American Airlines .

According to Wilco guitarist Nels Cline , the band has left Nonesuch Records , its home for most of the past decade , and is starting its own label .
Cline dropped this particular bombshell during an interview with Express Night Out .
Thanks to James DuBray for the tip .
Talking to Express Night Out , Cline says , " I think our main task now is to work on new material and a new album .
And now that we have our own record label , there 's going to be funny things to come out . "
He adds , " I do n't know the name of it .
Jeff [ Tweedy ] was basically not wanting to be on a record label for a while -- he did n't renew his contract with Nonesuch -- so we 're striking out on our own , our own label .
There might be a 7 " or something , a little souvenir when we do this Mass MoCA [ the Wilco - curated Solid Sound Festival ] .
I 'm not sure , really .
Basically , Jeff and [ Wilco 's manager ]
Tony Margherita are the masterminds , so I 'm just cruising with what they want to do . "
A rep for the band confirms that Wilco 's deal with Nonesuch has expired , but does not confirm that the band will definitely be releasing future albums on their own , though it is a possibility .
UPDATE : A rep for Nonesuch writes in with this statement : " Nonesuch 's contract with Wilco has indeed been fulfilled .
It has been a privilege to work with the band ; we love them and the experience of hearing their music evolve and seeing their audience grow over the past decade is a testament to their creative vision .
We wish Wilco the best and hope our paths will cross again . "
So if you 're attending the Solid Sound Festival next month , keep an eye out .
You could take home the very first product released on Wilco 's mysterious new label .
Wilco and Nonesuch have a storied history .
The label signed Wilco after the band was dropped by Nonesuch 's fellow Warner Music Group imprint Reprise during the making of the now - classic Yankee Hotel Foxtrot .
A report of a dog crying in distress can constitute an emergency that justifies police entering a home without a warrant , a state appeals court ruled Thursday in upholding a Los Angeles County man 's conviction for animal cruelty .
In appealing Keith Chung 's conviction and 16 - month prison sentence , his lawyer argued that officers may disregard the normal requirement that they obtain a search warrant only if a human life is at stake .
But the Second District Court of Appeal said that although pets are considered personal property , protecting them is a legitimate government concern .
Police can conduct a search without a judge 's approval " when an officer reasonably believes immediate warrantless entry into a residence is required to aid a live animal in distress , " Presiding Justice Joan Dempsey Klein said in the 3 - 0 ruling .
The court said a woman in Marina del Rey called police early one morning in July 2007 and said she and her husband had been awakened by the sound of a dog howling in apparent pain for about 15 minutes in Chung 's condominium upstairs .
She said she heard similar noises several times a week .
Police went to see Chung , who told them he did n't own any dogs .
When an officer heard what sounded like a dog whimpering from inside , he handcuffed Chung and entered the condominium .
There he found an injured dog lying on a towel in the patio and the body of another dog in the freezer , the court said .
After unsuccessfully challenging the search , Chung pleaded no contest to animal cruelty .
In his appeal , his lawyer argued that police should have sought a warrant before entering because there were innocent explanations for the sounds reported by the neighbor , who was embroiled in another dispute with Chung over water damage to her unit .
Chung 's lawyer , William Heyman , said he would appeal the ruling .

STAMFORD , Conn . --
A Connecticut police officer has been arrested on a misdemeanor charge for allegedly showing a female motorist a cell phone picture of his genitals during a traffic stop .
Stamford Officer Paul Mabey , who was named the city 's " Officer of the Year " in 2006 , was charged with disorderly conduct Wednesday and released on a promise to appear in Superior Court at a later date .
He was suspended with pay on Friday .
Police say a 26 - year - old Norwalk woman came forward last week with allegations that Mabey made inappropriate passes at her and showed her the cell phone picture during a traffic stop on May 26 .
The 40 - year - old Mabey could n't be reached for comment Thursday .
There 's no phone listing for him .
The 14 - year police veteran is married with a baby .
" We can confirm that the majority of products that we sell are own label products .
Our suppliers generally have a policy that the animals supplied to them are not fed on GM feed , however it is extremely difficult to confirm at the current time that any feed is completely GM free .
Additionally , due to the nature of animal movements it is impossible to guarantee that animals have never been fed GM feed during their life .
Greece is imprisoning unaccompanied migrant children in violation of EU laws and often in appalling conditions , human rights campaigners have revealed .
In a report detailing how asylum seekers and irregular migrants are being detained " as a matter of course , rather than a last resort , " Amnesty International has excoriated Athens for its policy of imprisoning children for long periods .
Conditions are so appalling , the report says , that children resort to hunger strikes in protest at their imprisonment , and some even attempt suicide .
" It is never acceptable that children are detained .
Children should not be subjected to poor conditions and long periods of confinement , " said says Nicolas Beger , head of the group 's Brussels office .
" Although Greece is experiencing economic hardship and is receiving a large number of migrants , these issues cannot serve as an excuse for treating children in such a way . "
The group documents how conditions in a " vast number " of the country 's immigrant detention centres are poor , with overcrowding and sanitation a problem .
Unaccompanied children who are captured by authorities when arriving in Greece are usually detained following their arrest for irregular entry .
Where a deportation order is issued , detention continues until a legal guardian is appointed and a place found in a special reception centre for unaccompanied children .
Overcrowding is problem particularly in the summer when a large number of migrants attempt to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to what they believe to be the promised land of the European Union .
At the Pagani immigration detention centre in the summer of 2009 , some 150 children went on hunger strike to protest the length and poor conditions of detention .
More than 850 people , including 200 unaccompanied children , 150 women and 50 small children , were kept in overcrowded and insanitary conditions .
It was only after a visit from the UN High Commission for Refugees , and the ombudsman for the rights of the child , that the authorities released 570 people , mainly families with kids and unaccompanied children .
In a letter to the European Commission , the group has demanded the EU executive take action to ensure that Greece adheres to its legal obligations to migrants and refugees - and particularly their children .
Amnesty International believes that there should be a prohibition on the detention of unaccompanied children provided by law , but even in the absence of such a step forward , Greece is beholden to a number of international and EU obligations that should prevent such situations from occurring .
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , to which Greece is a party , states that in their best interests , ‘‘unaccompanied or separated children should not , as a general rule , be detained , and that a government provide " special protection and assistance " to children who are not in their family environment .
Furthermore , the EU's Reception Conditions Directive sets out special provisions for unaccompanied asylum - seeking minors .
" The reality for migrants in Greece is dire , " said Mr Beger .
" The EU must put pressure on Greece to improve the situation .
Each and every person has the right to basic legal assistance and to humane treatment upon arriving in an EU country . "
Avec le dernier décret d’application publié au JO , la Hadopi est prête à envoyer ses premiers e-mails d’avertissements , même si la consultation pour définir les moyens de sécurisation des accès Internet ne fait que commencer .
Hadopi , c’est parti : la
Haute autorité pour la diffusion des œuvres et la protection des droits sur Internet , chargée de lutter contre le téléchargement illégal , est prête à fonctionner .
Le dernier décret d’application nécessaire pour son fonctionnement a en effet été publié ce mardi 27 juillet au Journal Officiel .
Ce décret définit les conditions de saisine par les ayants droit de la Commission de Protection des Droits ( CPD ) , chargée d’appliquer le système d’avertissement et de sanction des internautes pirates .
Une fois saisie par les ayants droit , cette Commission devra décider si des poursuites peuvent être lancées à l’encontre des supposés pirates .
Au cours du Conseil des ministres qui s’est tenu ce 28 juillet , Frédéric Mitterrand , le ministre de la Culture et de la Communication , a officiellement annoncé , après bien des péripéties et plusieurs déconvenues , que la Hadopi « est désormais en état de commencer son action ».
Ainsi , la chasse aux pirates pourrait être ouverte dès la rentrée : les premiers e-mails d’avertissements adressés aux internautes supposés coupables de téléchargement illégalement pourraient être envoyés début septembre .
Les ayants droit , de leur côté , ne veulent pas perdre de temps .
Selon La Tribune , la Commission de Protection des Droit a reçu ce 26 juillet sa première lettre pour une demande de saisine .
Si la Commission juge cette demande recevable , les e-mails d’avertissements pourront partir dans un délai de 15 jours suivant la validation de la demande des ayants droit .
Dernier point : définir un label pour les logiciels de sécurisation des accès Internet
Toutefois , un dernier volet de taille n’a pas encore été officiellement mis en place par la Hadopi .
Il s’agit des moyens à déployer par les internautes pour sécuriser leur accès Internet et ainsi leur éviter de recevoir un avertissement pour « négligence caractérisée ».
Cette « négligence caractérisée » se concrétisera sous forme d’une contravention qui sanctionnera l’abonné Internet reconnu coupable par la justice .
Il s’agit d’une amende de 1500 euros , qui peut être doublée en cas de récidive ( 3000 euros ) .
Pour les personnes morales ( entreprises , associations … ) , la fourchette de la contravention passe de 7500 à 15 000 euros .
Peine complémentaire : l’abonné peut être condamné à une suspension d’accès Internet pendant un mois .
Ainsi , afin d’aider les internautes à sécuriser leurs accès Internet , la Hadopi vient de lancer une consultation destinée aux professionnels afin de définir les moyens de sécurisation des accès Internet privés ou publics , pour qu’ils ne puissent pas être utilisés « pour la reproduction , la représentation ou la mise à disposition sans autorisation d’une oeuvre protégée par un droit d’auteur » , note la Hadopi .
Cette consultation devrait permettre au point un label Hadopi permettant d’encadrer les logiciels destinés à sécuriser la connexion Internet d’un abonné , que les FAI pourront ensuite proposer à leurs clients .
Une première synthèse de cette consultation professionnelle est attendue pour la fin du mois de septembre .

God on Lawns
God : Hey St. Francis , you know all about gardens and nature .
What in the world is going on down there in the Midwest ?
What happened to the dandelions , violets , thistle and stuff I started eons ago ?
I had a perfect " no maintenance " garden plan .
Those plants grow in any type of soil , withstand drought and multiply with abandon .
The nectar from the long lasting blossoms attracts butterflies , honey bees and flocks of songbirds .
I expected to see a vast garden of colors by now .
But all I see are these green rectangles .
St. Francis :
It 's the tribes that settled there , Lord .
The Suburbanites .
They started calling your flowers " weeds " and went to great lengths to kill them and replace them with grass .
God : Grass ?
But it 's so boring .
It 's not colorful .
It does n't attract butterflies , birds and bees , only grubs and sod worms .
It 's temperamental with temperatures .
Do these Suburbanites really want all that grass growing there ?
St. Francis : Apparently so , Lord .
They go to great pains to grow it and keep it green .
The begin each spring by fertilizing grass and poisoning any other plant that crops up in the lawn .
God :
The spring rains and warm weather probably make grass grow really fast .
That must make the Suburbanites happy .
St. Francis : Apparently not , Lord .
As soon as it grows a little , they cut it ... sometimes twice a week .
God :
They cut it ?
Do they then bail it like hay ?
St. Francis :
Not exactly , Lord .
Most of them rake it up and put it in bags .
God :
They bag it ?
Why ?
Is it a cash crop ?
Do they sell it ?
St. Francis : No Sir. Just the opposite .
They pay to throw it away .
God :
Now let me get this straight .
They fertilize grass so when it does grow , they cut it off and pay to throw it away ?
St. Francis : Yes , Sir .
God :
These Suburbanites must be relieved in the summer when we cut back on the rain and turn up the heat .
That surely slows the growth and saves them a lot of work .
St. Francis :
You are not going to believe this Lord .
When the grass stops growing so fast , they drag out hoses and pay more money to water it so they can continue to mow it and pay to get rid of it .
God :
What nonsense .
At least they kept some of the trees .
That was a sheer stroke of genius , if I do say so myself .
The trees grow leaves in the spring to provide beauty and shade in the summer .
In the autumn they fall to the ground and form a natural blanket to keep moisture in the soil and protect the trees and bushes .
Plus , as they rot , the leaves form compost to enhance the soil .
It 's a natural circle of life .
St. Francis :
You better sit down , Lord .
The Suburbanites have drawn a new circle .
As soon as the leaves fall , they rake them into great piles and pay to have them hauled away .
God : No .
What do they do to protect the shrub and tree roots in the winter and to keep the soil moist and loose ?
St. Francis :
After throwing away the leaves , they go out and buy something which they call mulch .
The haul it home and spread it around in place of the leaves .
God :
And where do they get this mulch ?
St. Francis :
They cut down trees and grind them up to make the mulch .
God : Enough .
I do n't want to think about this anymore .
Sister Catherine , you 're in charge of the arts .
What movie have you scheduled for us tonight ?
Sister Catherine : " Dumb and Dumber " , Lord .
It 's a real stupid movie about .....
God : Never mind , I think I just heard the whole story from St. Francis .

Without a challenge to their lies and distortions , the right wing will continue to shape the political discussion about race -- and strip the concept of racism of all meaning .
THE FIRESTORM that erupted when low - level U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) employee and civil rights activist Shirley Sherrod was fired was yet another example of the racial paranoia that consumes the Obama White House .
Moreover , it demonstrates the degree to which the " national discussion " on race has shifted so far to the right that the meaning and substance of racism has been reduced to either name - calling -- or any mention of anything involving race .
The controversy over Sherrod took place in the aftermath of the NAACP calling out Tea Party racism -- after a year of politicians and the mass media treating the Tea Partiers as a legitimate expression of politics instead of a " movement " built of race - baiting and scapegoating .
Conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart struck back at the NAACP with a doctored video clip intended to disparage Sherrod and make it seem as if she discriminated against a white farmer in her capacity as a government official .
In the full speech , however , Sherrod described her history from a farming family in the deep South , who faced a childhood shaped by white supremacy and whose father was murdered by white racists the same year as the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 .
An all - white jury refused to indict the racist murderers , but despite all of that , Sherrod came to see that ordinary white farmers were also victimized by a system of the " haves and have - nots . "
Columnist : Keeanga - Yamahtta Taylor Keeanga - Yamahtta Taylor is on the editorial board of the International Socialist Review .
She is a frequent contributor on the subject of race and class and has written extensively on the struggle for housing justice .
Her articles have also appeared on the Black Commentator , CounterPunch and Gaper 's Block Web sites .
The pathetic White House reaction to Breitbart 's smear was to be expected .
The Obama administration has yet to have anything meaningful to say about the persistence of racism in the U.S.
While NAACP President Ben Jealous was denouncing Tea Party racism at the organization 's national convention -- and receiving death threats as a result -- Michelle Obama used her keynote position to talk about " childhood obesity " in the Black community .
Once the doctored video of Sherrod was posted on the Internet , the NAACP also piled on , calling her a racist and demanding her resignation .
In doing so , the organization defanged its denunciation of racism in Tea Party organizations by clumsily trying to equate what it believed to be Sherrod 's " racism " with the racism of the Tea Partiers .
Apparently , having just passed a resolution against racism in the Tea Party " movement , " the NAACP felt its message would be diluted if it did n't also immediately denounce the perceived " racism " of Sherrod .
But even after recognizing that they had made a mistake in accepting Breitbart 's video as legitimate and after apologizing to Sherrod , NAACP officials continued to insist that they measure " civil and human rights with one yardstick . "
The organization released a statement in which it claimed a " zero - tolerance policy against racial discrimination , whether practiced by Blacks , whites or any other group . "
THESE ATTEMPTS to equate as racist acts " practiced by Blacks , whites or any other groups " distort who the historic and contemporary victims of racism in this country are .
There is no history of whites being the victims of racial discrimination in the U.S.
Where such charges have been raised , they have come from right - wingers with an agenda against affirmative action and other social programs created to help African Americans , who were not only slaves in this country , but then faced another 100 years of legal discrimination after slavery that only ended one generation ago .
The civil rights movement and the Black Power era were instrumental in exposing racism at the core of American society and demanding legal remedies to create more opportunities for African Americans .
As a result , by the early 1970s , Black poverty was cut in half , and more Blacks gained access to colleges and universities .
Such reforms transformed Black life in the U.S .
Yet despite these historic blows to racism in America , the U.S. remains a deeply racist society in which African Americans suffer from discrimination in employment , education , housing , health care and , most prominently , the criminal justice system .
This history is the reason why the NAACP denouncing " all racism " is confusing and misleading .
It is also why media attempts to equate the NAACP and various Tea Party organizations as Black and white mirrors of each other is an affront to the historic struggle against racism in the U.S .
The NAACP has spent its 100 years of existence attempting to challenge racism and discrimination against African Americans .
The Tea Party groups , on the other hand , are the modern inheritors of white supremacist formations like the White Citizens ' Councils , with their cries for state 's rights , hatred of dark - skinned immigrants , and fear and suspicion of government programs for the poor .
Even with the election of Barack Obama , African Americans continue to do worse in the U.S. because of racism .
One look at any of the statistics that measure the quality of life in U.S. society proves that Blacks are worse off -- whether it's the 16 percent unemployment rate for African Americans , compared to 9 percent for whites ; or it's the sharp edge of the foreclosure crisis coming in Black communities .
Conservatives claim these disparities exist for reasons that range from biological to cultural .
But racism and discrimination are the real reasons .
Moreover , in the name of " color blindness , " the right wing has attacked what meager social programs did exist in the aftermath of the 1960s and ' 70s movements .
Right - wingers claim that any programs set aside for African Americans or other minorities are , by definition , racist .
Thus , the Reagan administration used the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and the Justice Department not to challenge discrimination and bigotry against Blacks , but affirmative action programs -- on the grounds that because these programs used " racial quotas , " they were , in fact , racist .
This turns the concept completely on its head -- racism is no longer about systemic and systematic oppression , but any instance where the issue of race is considered .
UNFORTUNATELY , WITHOUT a strong movement against racism , and with the right - wing monologue blaming African Americans for their own poverty , unemployment and underfunded schools -- combined with the Democratic Party 's turn to the right during the 1980s and after ---- there was little resistance in the mass media or in formal politics to this redefinition of racism .
Liberal organizations that tied their lot to the success of the Democratic Party felt pressure to adapt to the " new " message about personal responsibility as the central explanation for Black deprivation and disproportionate levels of poverty .
Thus , while the NAACP recognizes a political vacuum in left Black politics and is attempting to address it in part by calling out Tea Party racism and mobilizing alongside the AFL - CIO for the October 2 march for jobs , it is nevertheless doing so within a political framework that sees the Democratic Party in general and the Obama administration in particular as an ally in the struggle .
The implications are important .
Consider Rev. Al Sharpton 's response to the firing of Shirley Sherrod .
Instead of criticizing Obama -- as he would have if any entity other than the Obama administration had handled the situation as poorly -- Sharpton claimed that any critique of Obama would " create the impression that Black leadership is fractured . "
He went on to explain why holding Obama accountable would be a bad idea : " We are only greasing the rails for the right wing to run a train through our ambitions and goals for having civil and human rights in this country . "
Without a politically independent , activist challenge to the right - wing lies and distortions about racism -- and the liberal acquiescence to them -- the right will continue to shape and dominate the debates and discussions about racism .
And that will make it impossible to have " civil and human rights in this country . "
Engineers at Oregon State University have made a significant advance toward producing electricity from sewage , by the use of new coatings on the anodes of microbial electrochemical cells that increased the electricity production about 20 times .
The findings , just published online in Biosensors and Bioelectronics , a professional journal , bring the researchers one step closer to technology that could clean biowaste at the same time it produces useful levels of electricity -- a promising new innovation in wastewater treatment and renewable energy .
Engineers found that by coating graphite anodes with a nanoparticle layer of gold , the production of electricity increased 20 times .
Coatings with palladium produced an increase , but not nearly as much .
And the researchers believe nanoparticle coatings of iron -- which would be a lot cheaper than gold -- could produce electricity increases similar to that of gold , for at least some types of bacteria .
" This is an important step toward our goal , " said Frank Chaplen , an associate professor of biological and ecological engineering .
" We still need some improvements in design of the cathode chamber , and a better understanding of the interaction between different microbial species .
But the new approach is clearly producing more electricity . "
In this technology , bacteria from biowaste such as sewage are placed in an anode chamber , where they form a biofilm , consume nutrients and grow , in the process releasing electrons .
In this context , the sewage is literally the fuel for electricity production .
In related technology , a similar approach may be able to produce hydrogen gas instead of electricity , with the potential to be used in hydrogen fuel cells that may power the automobiles of the future .
In either case , the treatment of wastewater could be changed from an energy - consuming technology into one that produces usable energy .
Researchers in the OSU College of Engineering and College of Agricultural Sciences , including Hong Liu , an assistant professor of biological and ecological engineering , are national leaders in development of this technology , which could significantly reduce the cost of wastewater treatment in the United States .
It might also find applications in rural areas or developing nations , where the lack of an adequate power supply makes wastewater treatment impractical .
It may be possible to create sewage treatment plants that are completely self - sufficient in terms of energy usage .
The technology already works on a laboratory basis , researchers say , but advances are necessary to lower its cost , improve efficiency and electrical output , and identify the lowest cost materials that can be used .
This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation and the Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute .
" Recent advances in nanofabrication provide a unique opportunity to develop efficient electrode materials due to the remarkable structural , electrical and chemical properties of nanomaterials , " the researchers wrote in their report .
" This study demonstrated that nano - decoration can greatly enhance the performance of microbial anodes . "
It 's time once again for the Federal Communications Commission to consider its broadcast ownership rules .
That means another huge petition from Clear Channel Communications calling for the elimination of any restrictions on the number of radio stations that the company can buy .
Why ?
The Internet .
" Today , terrestrial radio stations compete not only with their local peers but also with the growing panoply of regulated and unregulated competitors at the local , regional , and global levels , " Clear Channel writes .
" These competitors use new technologies and services to deliver music , entertainment , and news in formats and on platforms that today ’s audiences demand .
Many of these outlets did not exist in 1996 , and several were in nascent stages in 2006 ; today , satellite radio and internet - based services are robust competitors to terrestrial radio stations . "
Given broadcast radio's " past dominance as a purveyor of audio content , " Clear Channel adds , the presence of these new competitors " axiomatically reduces radio broadcasters ' share of the market , " making the agency 's ownership restrictions outdated .
Who has a share of what ?
That mention of 1996 refers to the Telecommunications Act , passed by Congress that year .
The massive law eliminated any national restrictions on the number of terrestrial radio stations an entity could purchase , capping the maximum in big local markets ( New York , Los Angeles ) at eight , and in the smallest at five .
As a consequence , Clear Channel famously went on a buying spree , snapping up 1,168 commercial licenses by 2006 and winning a reputation as " radio 's big bully . "
Then , as the audience for over - the - air radio shrank , the company lightened its load .
At present the broadcaster owns 857 signals , or 5.9 percent of the nation 's 14,400 - plus free , over - the - air radio licenses .
So does nearly six percent represent the kind of " media consolidation " that critics constantly inveigh against ?
It depends on how you look at it .
The American Federation of Radio and Television Artists , also commenting in this proceeding , notes that if you add Cumulus Media 's almost 400 stations to the mix , the duo controls about 74 of the revenue in any given terrestrial market .
Not bad for companies that respectively owned 62 and 53 stations in 1996 .
But Clear Channel sees it differently , arguing that if you consider the growth in Internet and satellite based radio over the last decade , the company 's share of the audiosphere is n't that big .
What 's informative about the filing is that it chronicles the degree to which audio listening really has changed .
For example :
Edison and Arbitron research indicate that 70 million Americans now listen to Internet radio on a monthly basis , up from 50 million four years ago .
In 2006 the majority of these sources were terrestrial stations streaming on their websites .
Today they 're more likely to be independent online broadcasters like Pandora , which I 'm listening to as I write this post .
The Pew Research Center indicates that a third of cell phone users now use their devices for some kind of audio playback .
i Phone owners are particularly fierce in this regard .
Over 74 percent listen to music or talk " radio " on their gadgets .
In 2006 , only one out of five Americans over the age of 12 had even heard of podcasts .
A mere tenth had actually listened to one .
By 2009 that share had jumped to one in five , and 43 percent knew of their existence .
" In sum , terrestrial radio competes in a far more diverse and robust media environment than ever before , " Clear Channel concludes .
" Yet , none of the new competitors to free , over - the - air radio broadcasting are constrained by government - imposed limits on the number of outlets that can be owned . "
What is radio again ?
These stats raise three challenging questions for the FCC .
First , what exactly is " radio " now ?
Does the category include music downloads and DJ - less music streams ?
Are podcasts radio ?
Second , what share does terrestrial radio now command of this category as a whole ?
Finally , the Commission is going to have to come up with some kind of renewed assessment of the extent to which radio , which has become a hybrid of terrestrial and Web - based services , still serves the " public interest , convenience , and necessity , " especially when it comes to coverage of local issues .
Clear Channel is particularly sensitive to the localism thing .
The company pushed back hard against allegations that its stations dropped the ball on emergency coverage for the town of Minot , North Dakota , following a 2002 toxic spill in that area .
In pursuit of these questions , the FCC is commissioning a series of studies about radio .
These will include an assessment of the amount of local news that radio stations provide , and a survey that will " examine the availability and usage of local content on the Internet , " and how much of this content is provided by sources affiliated with local radio stations , television stations , or newspapers .
Clear Channel has its own online service : iheartradio.com .
The irony of Clear Channel 's filing , however , is that while the company emphasizes the increasing power of the Internet , its urgent call for a relaxation of the FCC 's radio station ownership rules suggests that these old - school radio licenses are still very valuable .
For years the company has doggedly pursued the authority to buy more stations , testifying to its dedication ( or at least attachment ) to the medium , despite years of financial trouble .
This passion makes us wonder whether over - the - air radio's " past dominance " is really a thing of the past .
Indeed , the growth of Internet radio seems only to whet Clear Channel 's appetite for more conventional licenses .
" All of these competing platforms are allowed to grow freely to meet marketplace demands , " the company insists .
" Giving terrestrial radio broadcasters equal treatment by eliminating the local radio ownership caps will enable the industry to remain competitive in the current , unsettled economy and in today ’s age of media abundance . "

Developer of full spectrum photovoltaic devices , RoseStreet Labs Energy ( RSLE ) , demonstrated a breakthrough multiband photovoltaic device in a laboratory .
The photovoltaic device includes three different light absorption regions , which are embedded into a single - layered thin film device .
The new find is on the basis of the RSLE ’s proprietary IBand technology .
This is the first intermediate band solar power cell to be demonstrated in a laboratory .
With this technology , the possibility of a thin film solar efficiency of higher than 35 % is achievable , by the capture of sun ’s full spectrum .
The new solar cell is based on the mismatched alloys ’ discovery .
The single junction device delivers high power output and enhanced solar light absorption .
The fabrication of the new photovoltaic device was done on a high - volume CVD based technology .
With this fabrication , it signifies the possibility of high volume commercialization .
RSLE ’s Chief Executive Officer , Bob Forcier , said that the new breakthrough has pioneered new semiconductor devices for solar photovoltaic conversion and modern semiconductor applications .
This new find suits perfectly with their PV commercialization process , he said .
RSLE CTO , Wladek Walukiewicz , stated that this breakthrough demonstration allows tham to progress in the PV research at a faster pace .
He added that the IBand technology works well with RSLE ’s nitride product development .

Chris Smith – Anti Gun Congressmen Up for Re-election
New Jersey –-( Ammoland.com ) - Attention New Jersey readers .
As a gun rights supporter , I have some good news … and some bad news .
In a year with so many attacks on your Second Amendment rights , I hate to give you bad news , but I feel you deserve to hear the truth .
Congressman , Chris Smith of New Jersey , has voted rabidly anti-gun .
At virtually every opportunity , Congressman Chris Smith has voted with the gun control crowd .
The truth is , Chris Smith is gun-banner Sarah Brady ’s best friend .
More on that in a minute .
This year ’s elections are in full swing , and the gun-grabbers know if they can pick up just a few more seats in the U.S. Congress , they ’ll finally have the votes needed to ram their anti-gun agenda into law !
We ’re talking about the point of no return .
With all that ’s at stake this election year , and with your June 8th Republican Primary fast approaching , it ’s crucial that freedom - loving New Jersey citizens know exactly where their candidates stand on the Second Amendment .
That ’s why the National Association for Gun Rights recently surveyed your candidates for U.S. Congress in New Jersey ’s Fourth District .
And today , I must report some very disturbing news .
One of the front runners in your upcoming Republican Primary — incumbent Chris Smith -– is supporting gun control .
Even more alarming is his horrible record of voting for gun control .
He ’s got a long history of votes on issues that are important to gun owners …
… And his record is one gun-banner Sarah Brady would be proud of .
In fact , in 1993 , Congressman Chris Smith stood with the anti-gun crowd and VOTED FOR the dangerous , anti-gun “ Brady Bill . ”
But he did n’t stop there .
In 1998 , he voted for anti-gun Chuck Schumer ’s bill to criminalize self defense .
And in 1999 , Chris Smith voted to make private sales of firearms illegal .
Then , in 2004 , he sided with the District of Columbia by supporting America ’s most heinous gun control laws .
Smith has voted with the gun control crowd for mandatory trigger locks , has opposed de-funding the anti-gun United Nations , and in 2001 , Chris Smith even voted for firearms registration legislation .
Maybe the worst of all his sins , Chris Smith voted to ban an entire class of semi-automatic hunting and target firearms by supporting the Clinton Gun Ban .
But … I ’ve run out of room .
Frankly , I could n’t possibly list all the times Congressman Chris Smith has voted against gun owners …
I do n’t have that much paper .
So , let ’s be clear : there ’s no question where Chris Smith stands on your right to keep and bear arms –- he ’s against it , and he ’s voted against it almost every chance he ’s had !
That ’s why it ’s vital you send Chris Smith a message .
Demand that he publicly apologize for his support of gun control , and pledge that in the future , he will stand up to the gun-grabbers and cast his votes in support of the Second Amendment .
But , there is a silver lining to this black cloud .
You see , Republican Alan Bateman — the other candidate in your race — has returned his Candidate Survey in 100 % support for your gun rights .
Republican Alan Bateman has pledged to stand up for the Second Amendment and fight the gun-grabbers every move tooth and nail .
And he ’s pledged to be a leader on gun issues
Really , in this primary race for your Congressional seat , there is only one pro-gun candidate , Alan Bateman , and then there ’s Chris Smith , a certified anti-gun candidate , based on his record in Congress .
But there is n’t much time .
Here ’s what you can do to help :
Thank Republican candidate Alan Bateman for pledging his 100 % support for your right to keep and bear arms ;
Give Congressman Chris Smith an earful .
Demand that he apologize for his long , long history of supporting gun control , and that he change his anti-gun ways .
There ’s no doubt about it , the upcoming Congressional elections will have a greater impact on our Second Amendment rights than any other election in our lifetime .
And with so much at stake , I ’m really going above and beyond to make sure every person in New Jersey ’s Fourth District who cares about the Second Amendment knows exactly where their candidates stand .
And I ’m counting on good folks like you to help make that possible .
But most importantly , contact Congressman Chris Smith and tell him to come clean on his anti-gun voting record .
Demand that he publicly apologize for betraying the Second Amendment rights of New Jersey citizens , and promise that he will never support gun control again .
There ’s not a moment to lose .
Please act today !
Sincerely ,
Dudley Brown
Executive Director

Image caption BP says it shares public frustration at its inability to plug the leaking well
The US government has toughened its rhetoric towards BP as frustration builds about the company 's inability to plug a leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar pledged to " keep our boot on their neck until the job gets done " .
BP Plc would be accountable , " civilly and in whatever way is necessary " , he said on a tour of the Gulf .
Earlier on Monday , BP pledged $ 500 m ( £ 346 m ) to study the spill 's impact on the environment .
The company says it will be Wednesday before it tries a so - called " top kill " bid to plug the leak - firing heavy mud and cement down into the blown out well 5,000 ft ( 1,500 m ) below the surface of the Gulf .
A BP official said the bid - which comes more than a month after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded , killing 11 - stood a 60 - 70 % chance of success .
BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said if the " top kill " failed there was a chance the flow of oil could temporarily be increased .
He said if that happened BP would immediately install a new containment device to go over the old riser .
Familiar mantra
A delegation of White House officials and senators - led by Mr Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano - flew over the Louisiana coastline on Monday to assess the extent of the pollution .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
Ken Salazar is threatening a move that would make a rodeo hero proud : he says his boot is on BP 's neck , but he is ready to push them out of the way Read Mark 's thoughts in full
The BBC's Paul Adams in Washington says the officials both repeated a now - familiar mantra : BP is responsible for the damage and the administration will maintain pressure on the oil company until the crisis is over .
Ms Napolitano said : " We are going to stay on this and stay on BP until this gets done and it gets done the right way . "
Meanwhile , the Republican governor of Louisiana , Bobby Jindal , is voicing frustration at aspects of the federal government 's response .
It seems likely that the longer this environmental crisis drags on , without any convincing end in sight , the more vulnerable the administration will be to suggestions that it could and should be doing more , our correspondent says .
It is also fending off charges that offshore drilling permits and environmental waivers continue to be granted despite a moratorium announced by the president .
Mr Salazar said the pause was still in effect and would be until lessons had been learnt and additional safety measures put in place .
Also on Monday , BP pledged to fund a 10 - year research effort aimed at studying the long - term effect of the spill on the shoreline and marine environments in the Gulf of Mexico , and the impact of the response efforts .
" This will be a key part of the process of restoration , and for improving the industry response capability for the future , " BP chief executive Tony Hayward said in a statement .
' Missed deadlines '
In a round of appearances on US television news programmes on Monday morning , Mr Suttles said BP was aware that frustration with the company was growing over its inability to stop the leak .
The fact that it 's taken this long is painful to everybody Doug Suttles , BP Chief Operations Officer
In pictures : Spill 's impact
" We are doing everything we can , everything I know , " Mr Suttles told NBC 's Today show .
" Everyone is frustrated , " he added .
" I think the people of the region are frustrated .
I know we are , I know the government is .
The fact that it 's taken this long is painful to everybody . "
Meanwhile , the US government regulators who oversee offshore oil drilling have granted at least 19 environmental waivers for gulf drilling projects and 17 drilling permits since the oil leak began more than a month ago , the New York Times reported on Monday .
The new permits and waivers would appear to contradict President Barack Obama 's declaration of a moratorium on new offshore drilling , issued soon after the rig explosion
Scientists in Florida are concerned that large plumes of oil floating beneath the surface in the Gulf of Mexico originated from the Deepwater Horizon spill , and want to test their samples against oil collected by BP .
But the oil corporation is refusing to cooperate .
University of South Florida scientist David Hollander said he was “ just taken aback ” by BP ’s unwillingness to assist in a scientific inquiry into the trouble .
“ It was a little unsettling . ”
BP has publicly refused to acknowledge responsibility for the large masses of petroleum floating deep in the gulf which could be headed towards Florida .
Company CEO
Tony Hayward has gone so far as to insist the oil is “ on the surface ” of the ocean and that “ there are n’t any plumes . ”
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , however , is now saying oil has been discovered under the surface , although at “ very low concentrations . ”
In addition to not cooperating with scientists , BP has refused to grant media requests to fly over the gulf to capture images of oil slicks — refusals that also have been backed by federal agencies involved in the response effort .

Auto Industry Grumbles German Car Makers Fear US Trade Sanctions
The German automobile industry is recovering rapidly from the economic downturn .
But new challenges may await .
Politicians in Washington may be considering a levy on cars imported from Germany .
These letters were posted by people on Breed specific Message boards and by some rescue groups ..
If you can read these without crying you must be very cold hearted .
Yes , I Gas Dogs and Cats for a Living .
I'm an Animal Control officer in a very small town in central North Carolina .
I'm in my mid thirties , and have been working for the town in different positions since high school .
There is not much work here , and working for the county provides good pay and benefits for a person like me without a higher education .
I 'm the person you all write about how horrible I am .
I 'm the one that gasses the dogs and cats and makes them suffer .
I'm the one that pulls their dead corpses out smelling of Carbon Monoxide and throws them into green plastic bags .
But I 'm also the one that hates my job and hates what I have to do .
First off , all you people out there that judge me , do n't .
God is judging me , and I know I 'm going to Hell .
Yes , I 'm going to hell .
I wont lie , it 's despicable , cold , cruel and I feel like a serial killer .
I 'm not all to blame , if the law would mandate spay and neuter , lots of these dogs and cats would n't be here for me to gas .
I 'm the devil , I know it , but I want you people to see that there is another side to me the devil Gas Chamber man .
The shelter usually gasses on Friday morning .
Friday's are the day that most people look forward to , this is the day that I hate , and wish that time will stand still on Thursday night .
Thursday night , late , after nobody 's around , my friend and I go through a fast food line , and buy 50 dollars worth of cheeseburgers and fries , and chicken .
I 'm not allowed to feed the dogs on Thursday , for I 'm told that they will make a mess in the gas chamber , and why waste the food .
So , Thursday night , with the lights still closed , I go into the saddest room that anyone can every imagine , and let all the doomed dogs out out their cages .
I have never been bit , and in all my years doing this , the dogs have never fought over the food .
My buddy and I , open each wrapper of cheeseburger and chicken sandwich , and feed them to the skinny , starving dogs .
They swallow the food so fast , that I do n't believe they even taste it .
There tails are wagging , and some do n't even go for the food , they roll on their backs wanting a scratch on their bellys .
They start running , jumping and kissing me and my buddy .
They go back to their food , and come back to us .
All their eyes are on us with such trust and hope , and their tails wag so fast , that I have come out with black and blues on my thighs ..
They devour the food , then it 's time for them to devour some love and peace .
My buddy and I sit down on the dirty , pee stained concrete floor , and we let the dogs jump on us .
They lick us , they put their butts in the air to play , and they play with each other .
Some lick each other , but most are glued on me and my buddy .
I look into the eyes of each dog .
I give each dog a name .
They will not die without a name .
I give each dog 5 minutes of unconditional love and touch .
I talk to them , and tell them that I 'm so sorry that tomorrow they will die a gruesome , long , torturous death at the hands of me in the gas chamber .
Some tilt their heads to try to understand .
I tell them , that they will be in a better place , and I beg them not to hate me .
I tell them that I know I 'm going to hell , but they will all be playing with all the dogs and cats in heaven .
After about 30 minutes , I take each dog individually , into their feces filled concrete jail cell , and pet them and scratch them under their chins .
Some give me their paw , and I just want to die .
I just want to die .
I close the jail cell on each dog , and ask them to forgive me .
As my buddy and I are walking out , we watch as every dogis smiling at us and them do n't even move their heads .
They will sleep , with a full belly , and a false sense of security .
As we walk out of the doomed dog room , my buddy and I go to the cat room .
We take our box , and put the very friendly kittens and pregnant cats in our box .
The shelter does n't keep tabs on the cats , like they do the dogs .
As I hand pick which cats are going to make it out , I feel like I 'm playing God , deciding whose going to live and die .
We take the cats into my truck , and put them on blankets in the back .
Usually , as soon as we start to drive away , there are purring cats sitting on our necks or rubbing against us .
My buddy and I take our one way two hour trip to a county that is very wealthy and they use injection to kill animals .
We go to exclusive neighborhoods , and let one or two cats out at a time .
They do n't want to run , they want to stay with us .
We shoo them away , which makes me feel sad .
I tell them that these rich people will adopt them , and if worse comes to worse and they do get put down , they will be put down with a painless needle being cradled by a loving veterinarian .
After the last cat is free , we drive back to our town .
It 's about 5 in the morning now , about two hours until I have to gas my best friends .
I go home , take a shower , take my 4 anti-anxiety pills and drive to work ..
I do n't eat , I ca n't eat .
It 's now time , to put these animals in the gas chamber .
I put my ear plugs in , and when I go to the collect the dogs , the dogs are so excited to see me , that they jump up to kiss me and think they are going to play .
I put them in the rolling cage and take them to the gas chamber .
They know .
They just know .
They can smell the death ..
They can smell the fear .
They start whimpering , the second I put them in the box .
The boss tells me to squeeze in as many as I can to save on gas .
He watches .
He knows I hate him , he knows I hate my job .
I do as I 'm told .
He watches until all the dogs , and cats ( thrown in together ) are fighting and screaming .
The sounds is very muffled to me because of my ear plugs .
He walks out , I turn the gas on , and walk out .
I walk out as fast as I can .
I walk into the bathroom , and I take a pin and draw blood from my hand .
Why ?
The pain and blood takes my brain off of what I just did .
In 40 minutes , I have to go back and unload the dead animals .
I pray that none survived , which happens when I overstuff the chamber .
I pull them out with thick gloves , and the smell of carbon monoxide makes me sick .
So does the vomit and blood , and all the bowel movements .
I pull them out , put them in plastic bags .
They are in heaven now , I tell myself .
I then start cleaning up the mess , the mess , that YOU PEOPLE are creating by not spay or neutering your animals .
The mess that YOU PEOPLE are creating by not demanding that a vet come in and do this humanely .
You ARE THE TAXPAYERS , DEMAND that this practice STOP !
So , do n't call me the monster , the devil , the gasser , call the politicians , the shelter directors , and the county people the devil .
Heck , call the governor , tell him to make it stop .
As usual , I will take sleeping pills tonight to drown out the screams I heard in the past , before I discovered the ear plugs .
I will jump and twitch in my sleep , and I believe I 'm starting to hallucinate .
This is my life .
Do n't judge me .
Believe me , I judge myself enough .
Interview at the Dog PoundPlease crosspost this far & wide with permission from the author .... As a journalist , I decided to go to the dog pound , and interview some of the inmates .
I wanted to know what it was like in there from their perspective .
What follows is not for the faint of heart .
I entered the building , and one of the workers accompanied me to the holding area .
This is where dogs are kept before they are allowed up for adoption IF they are allowed up for adoption .
If the dogs are found to be aggressive in any way , euthanasia is employed .
Fortunately , if fortunately  is the word to be used here this is a Canadian establishment , and they use lethal injection , not a gas chamber .
The pound worker led me past a big steel door that says  Employees Only .
 What is in there ?  I asked .
From the look he gave me , I knew that this is where dogs go in , and never return .
We moved on to a row of kennels .
The dogs were barking loudly , there was the acrid smell of urine and feces , and a feeling of despair seemed to permeate the room .
Go ahead ,  the worker said .
 They re all yours .
PeteI looked into the first kennel , and saw only the back of a medium sized dog who was curled up in the corner of his kennel , shivering .
He was mostly white , with some black spots .
 Hello ?  I said .
 May I come in ?
He lifted his head , as though it weighed more than he could bear .
When he looked at me , I could see he was a Pitbull .
His eyes were gentle , but filled with grief .
Enter ,  was all he said .
I stepped in , closing the gate behind me .
He put his head back down , facing away from me .
I crouched down a few feet away .
My name is Pete .
Petey my Master called me ,  he said , still not looking at me .
Why are you here Pete ? 
I asked .
I am here because Master cannot afford to move to another province .
I am here because someone with power said I am vicious , and a killer .
Someone who never met me .
Master took me for a walk one day , and some lady started to scream when she saw me .
I got frightened , and barked at her .
The dog police came , and they took me away .
I have been with Master for 10 years .
The last time I saw him , he just held me and cried .
He kept telling me he was sorry .
I worry for him .
Whatever will he do without me ?
Pete shivered even more .
A tear slid down my face .
I am supposed to remain objective , but this was wrong so wrong .
Thank you Pete .  I said .
He said nothing as I got up and left his kennel .
PopperThe kennel next to Petes held a very young looking dog .
Pure Border Collie by my guess .
He stood on his hind legs , looking at me through the gate .
Hello .
My names Popper .
He tilted his head .
 Are you here to take me home ?  No , I m sorry ,  I replied .
 But I would like to talk with you . Sure .
What would you like to talk about ? Popper , how did you come to be in this place ?
I asked .
Popper dropped down from the gate , with a perplexed look on his face .
He walked to the back of the kennel , then back to the front .
I noticed he had one blue eye , and one brown .
He was quite beautiful .
His black and white coat was shiny and thick .
I am not certain WHY I am here .
I think maybe my family will come back for me .
They bought me when I was only 6 weeks old .
I remember they said how smart Border Collies are , and how it would be so easy to train me .
They were very excited at first .
The little ones played with me all the time .
But the trouble with little Masters is , they refuse to stay in a group .
I constantly had to nip their heels to keep them together .
He looked confused .
 Why wont they stay in a group ?  he sighed .
 So I did what I thought I should do .
I am not quite sure why the little ones screamed when I did my job , but they did , and the Masters got very angry at me .
They also got angry when I had to relieve myself , and did so in the house .
I am not sure where they expected me to go .
All they said was that I was the smartest breed in the world , and I should just KNOW better .
Then they left me in the yard for a month or so .
I got bored a lot , and I dug holes in the grass .
The next thing I knew , the Masters brought me here .
Popper jumped back up on the gate , his white paws protruding through the links .
He looked at me with his lovely eyes , and asked  Will you please let them know I want to come home ?
Please tell them I promise I will be good ?  I will Popper ,  I said .
SpartanMy heart was breaking .
I was beginning to regret coming here , but their stories had to be told .
I moved along .
The next dog I saw looked to be easily 100 lbs. , a Rottweiler .
He was handsome indeed , except for the scars on his face and back .
He tilted his head , and looked me right in the eyes .
Hello .
Who are you ? he asked .
I am a reporter ,  I replied .
 May I speak with you for a little while ?  Most certainly .
My name is Spartan .
You can come in , I wont bite ,  he said .
Thank you Spartan .
I will .
I entered his kennel , reached out and stroked his giant head .
He made a loud grumbling noise , and closed his eyes .
Spartan , why are you here ?
Before he could answer my question , he was suddenly in the grip of a nasty coughing spasm .
It sounded painful .
Please excuse me ,  he said when it passed .
 Kennel cough .
It seems all of us who come in here get it .
Why am I here ?
Well , about two years ago , I was born in the backyard of some person I cant even recall .
I had 11 brothers and sisters .
I recall a day when a big man came and gave that person some money , and took me away from my mother .
They had to chain her up , as she was very angry that he took me .
They chained her and beat her .
I came to know the man by the name of Jim .
I overheard him telling his friends that I would grow up to be big and mean like my mother .
But as I grew older , all I wanted to do was play and be friends with everyone .
Jim said I needed to be taught how to be mean , so he chained me up in the yard .
No more house for me , he said , I was too spoiled .
When people came by to visit , I was so happy to see them .
I wanted them to come and play .
But that made Jim angry , so he beat me with sticks and chains .
When he came near , I would roll onto my back so he would know I wasnt a bad dog .
That made him beat me more .
Spartans eyes clouded with grief .
 Then hebrought me here .
I reached out and stroked Spartans massive gentle head once more .
 I am so sorry Spartan .
Some people are just plain evil .
I gave him a kiss and left his kennel .
As I walked away , Spartan called out ,  What will happen to me , nice lady ?
I shook my head .
 I cant say Spartan .
Maybe someone kind will come and get you .
We can only hope .
PatsyI walked a little further down .
I could see a shape moving at the back of the next kennel .
 Hello ?  I called out .
Suddenly the shape lunged at the gate in a fury , barking and gnashing its teeth .
I stumbled backwards , and crashed into an adjacent kennel .
The other dogs began barking loudly and jumping at their gates .
Dont go near her ,  a small female voice came from behind me .
 Shes mad .
I gathered myself back together , and saw a little Jack Russell Terrier behind me .
Thanks for the warning ,  I was still trembling .
Across the way , the other dog , apparently a Husky and German Shepherd cross , was glaring at me , lips curled back revealing brown stained teeth .
Her ribs and hips showed through her dull , matted grey coat .
The little dog invited me into her kennel , and I gladly went in .
Who are you ?  My name is Patsy .
The little brown and white dog held a paw up to the gate in greeting .
My owner surrendered me .
She said she wanted a cute little dog like the one on the TV show , Frasier .
She didnt bother to look into the type of dog I am . 
Patsy heaved a sigh .
I suppose she expected me to just lie about and only need a short walk each day , just like Eddie , but my energy was so high that I needed to run and play . 
She glanced at her surroundings .
 Now I am here .
I suppose it could be worse .
I could be like her . 
Patsy looked towards the still growling dog across the way .
What happened to make her so vicious ? 
I asked .
From what we could gather ,  she replied .
 she was found tied in a back yard .
She only had a three foot chain .
Some days there was no water .
Rarely was there any food .
One day a nice neighbour came by and brought her some meat .
By then it was too late .
She was already mad .
She broke off her chain , and bit the poor man badly .
We know she will be going behind the steel door .
I am sad to say , I think it will be best .
Perhaps then she will know some peace .
Just then , the door at the end of the building opened , and a woman stepped inside .
All the dogs began to bark wildly , then one by one , they went quiet .
I whispered to Patsy ,  Who is that ?
Why have all the dogs gone quiet ?
Patsy breathed deeply through her little nose , and closed her eyes .
 SHE is a Rescuer .
Cant you smell it ? she asked .
Smell what ?
I was confused .
Compassion .
Love . Sorrow .
It emanates from her pores .
She is here for one of us , but nobody knows who just yet . 
Patsy looked hopeful .
The Rescuer moved from kennel to kennel , looking at each dog .
I sat quietly watching .
I could see tears in her eyes as she made eye contact with each one .
She stopped at Spartans cage and spoke quietly to him .
No more beatings my man .
No more .
You are coming with me .
From here on in , its all going to get better .
The Rescuer produced a leash , opened the kennel door , and took Spartan away .
As he walked beside her , his little stubby tail wagged with delight .
Patsy sighed again .
I could see the disappointment in her eyes , and it grieved me .
They all had the same look , as they watched The Rescuer depart .
I am so sorry Patsy ,  I said in a whisper .
 But you are a little dog , and everyone loves little dogs .
I am convinced you will be rescued soon .
Patsys brown eyes twinkled at me , a little bit of hope returning .
I had heard and seen enough .
I needed to tell people how it was for these unfortunate creatures .
They were all here through no fault of their own .
I stood to leave .
I passed by many other dogs I did not interview , looking at each one , wishing I could take them all home with me and give them the love they deserved .
I stood by the door taking one last glance back , when it opened , and one of the pound workers came in .
His face was drawn and sad .
He walked by without a word , and stopped at Petes kennel .
I heard him take a deep breath , then he paused , and opened the kennel door .
The words were muffled , but I am sure I heard him say  I m sorry old boy .
He came out , with Petey in tow .
The old dogs head hung down in resignation , and they both disappeared behind the big steel door .

The Blue Bowl ( from poetry 180 )
Jane Kenyon
Like primitives we buried the cat
with his bowl .
Bare - handed
we scraped sand and gravel
back into the hole .
They fell with a hiss
and thud on his side ,
on his long red fur , the white feathers
between his toes , and his
long , not to say aquiline , nose .
We stood and brushed each other off .
There are sorrows keener than these .
Silent the rest of the day , we worked ,
ate , stared , and slept .
It stormed
all night ; now it clears , and a robin
burbles from a dripping bush
like the neighbor who means well
but always says the wrong thing .
Comment :
The philosophical significance of death is that death is not - being .
However , death also has a political significance in a metaphorical sense : Benardete points out Hesiod ’s identification of justice with Hades .
This poem is obviously not political .
It deals with the mere fact of death .
There are sorrows keener than these .
And yet it feels this cat died trying something unjust .
“ The white feathers between his toes ” and the nose that is not birdlike ( “ not to say aquiline ” ) make me wonder if this cat ate a bird and died from that in some way .
The cat ’s bowl is the only tool mentioned in the whole poem ; the bowl does not merely represent , but dictates literally , the cat ’s portion in life .
So like Hesiod and Genesis we ’re back to the beginning , wondering about justice and the realm it belongs to : “ like primitives , ” “ we scraped sand and gravel . ”
It is n’t clear this beginning has anything to do with life ; “ back into the hole ” is the most elementary sense of justice , that of restitution .
Without other people , it seems this sense could exist ( i.e. environmentalism , and emphasis on “ it seems ” – please do not get carried away with this thought ) .
Whatever this other realm is , it does n’t need us .
The only sounds are the “ hiss ” and the “ thud ” prior to the robin burbling .
The cat is on its side .
“ Hiss ” and “ side ” recall the serpent in the Garden , and while it seems a stretch , I do n’t think it ’s out of line to recall those pictures of Mary stepping on a snake ’s head one sometimes sees in devotional tracts .
But there ’s no triumph here , just restitution ( “ we stood and brushed each other off ” ) , and that consoles no one .
Perhaps the identification of justice with death is the fact that justice must always be accompanied by loss .
In Plato , these issues are somewhat clearer .
The just is distinct from the beautiful , and both in turn are distinct from the good .
That the just is not necessarily good leads to the notion that inasmuch as a city needs justice , that city is imperfect .
Perfect justice is no justice ( and also , re : the above – the locus of justice can become human association .
There may not even be a perfect sense of justice ) .
I ’ll conclude by casting doubt on “ there are sorrows keener than these . ”
That ’s something we tell ourselves , part of the myth that accompanies our intuitive and even more rational notions of how things are morally .
The list immediately following this statement has “ worked , ate , slept , ” governed by “ silent ” and with “ stared ” in between “ ate ” and “ slept . ”
The center of the list is “ ate . ” “ Silent ” and “ stared ” are a reminder that beginnings are very discomforting , to say the least .
The myth ’s power cannot adequately address our sense of loss .
We are moved to events that recall another myth – it storms , a bird calls out from a “ dripping bush . ”
Death implies life ; unjust Creation was replaced by a just race after the Flood .
Of course this cannot satisfy , even for a cat .
It would feel wrong , after all , to let one ’s sense of loss be entirely dictated by the fact of loss , or even what we use to make sense of loss .

Hundreds of thousands of Facebook users are falling victim to so - called " clickjacking " attacks , warn web security labs .
Facebook members see links to subjects such as " World Cup 2010 in HD " or " Justin Bieber 's phone number " that their friends appear to have " liked " .
Clicking the link tricks users into recommending the site on Facebook too .
Security experts say the scam currently has no malicious intent but could be adapted to deliver malware .
The link generally takes the user through to a page containing an instruction , such as asking them to click a button to confirm that they are over 18 .
However , wherever they click on the page it adds a link to their own Facebook profile saying they have also " liked " the site .
Currently the purpose of clickjacking is " trivial " and does not actively result in any malware or phishing attacks , said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos .
" At the moment the attacks which we 've seen are more like old - school viruses - written for the heck of it to see how many fans they can get .
" But our feeling is that it would be fairly easy for the bad guys to introduce some revenue generation for themselves , " he told BBC News .
Clickjacking works across all computer operating systems , added Mr Cluley .
The Facebook attack uses iFrames , which essentially places an invisible button over an entire web page , so that wherever the user clicks , they end up hitting the button - in this case a hidden Facebook " like " button .
A free plug - in called NoScript , built for the Firefox web browser , includes pop -up warnings about potential clickjacks .
However , it will also query clicks on Flash videos , commonly used on many websites - and it is not easy to install , said Mr Cluley .
" You have to be a little bit nerdy to configure it . "
ALBANY  New Yorkers who like to smoke will have to dig a little deeper to light up next month , after the Legislature passed a bill on Monday that will give the state the highest cigarette taxes in the country .
The new law , part of an emergency budget measure to keep the government running , adds another $ 1.60 in state taxes to every cigarette pack sold starting on July 1 , pushing the average price of a pack to about $ 9.20 .
The average price in New York City , which imposes its own cigarette taxes , will be even higher , nearly $ 11 a pack .
Those who prefer other tobacco products will also be forced to pay significantly more .
The tax on smokeless tobacco will more than double , to $ 2 an ounce from 96 cents an ounce , starting on Aug .
1 . And the wholesale tax on cigars , dips and other kinds of tobacco will rise to 75 percent from 46 percent .
EXCLUSIVE : Comedy Central has ordered Jon Benjamin Has a Van to series with a 10 - episode order .
The pickup caps a great week for Benjamin who landed his first Emmy nomination on Thursday for his voice work as the title character on the FX animated comedy Archer .
And with the pickup at Comedy Central , Benjamin now plays the title character on 3 series , Jon Benjamin Has a Van , Archer and another animated comedy , Fox ’s midseason entry Bob ’s Burgers , in which he voices the central character Bob Belcher .
Jon Benjamin Has a Van is a newsmagazine - style sketch show starring Benjamin as an investigative reporter hitting the streets in his custom van to do human interest stories .
Absolutely Prods. is producing the series , with Benjamin , Andrew Steele and Funny or Die executive producing .
“ The show is largely scripted with a touch of improv , said Kent Alterman , head of original programming and production for Comedy Central .
“ It has its own identity and comes out of Jon finding different ways to tell stories . ”
Alterman first developed a project with Benjamin during his first stint at Comedy Central as head of the New York development office a decade ago .
Jon Benjamin Has a Van was inspired by videos Benjamin did for Midnight Pajama Jam , his live comedy show with Jon Glaser .
Through his relationship with Comedy Central via The Important Things with Demetri Martin , on which Benjamin has served as a writer / producer / performer , he showed the videos to the network ’s executives who ordered a pilot based on the concept .
It was one of 9 pilot / presentations Comedy Central announced as part of its 2010 - 11 development slate in May .
“ Part of the show is playing the character , a more morose verson of me , but mostly it is me driving around in a van and finding stories along the way , ” Benjamin said .
While the show is less about Benjamin and much more about the people he encounters , either in man - on - the - street quick hitters or more extended scripted interviews , there is a slight parallel to Borat .
“ It ’s Borat without the funny accent , I do n’t ’ have that in my range , ” Benjamin said .
“ But we ’ll try to do a lightly European accent . ”
The series will be blending “ real and concocted ” segments leaving people guessing which parts are scripted and which are not , Benjamin added .
“ Hopefully it will develop into a drinking game . ”
For Benjamin , who has built a solid voice - over career with stints on Dr. Katz , Family Guy and Archer , among others , this marks the first on - screen starring vehicle .
“ It will be a grave disappointment ( for fans ) , ” he said .
“ I ’m cute but not the best thing to look at . ”
Jon Benjamin also marks the third new series order for Kent Alterman since he took the programming reins of Comedy Central at the beginning of the year .
It joins upcoming series Workaholics and The Onion Sports Show , slated for debuts in 1Q 2011 .
Jon Benjamin is expected to start production in New York ( guerilla - style segments ) and Los Angeles ( scripted sketches ) in the fall for a summer 2011 premiere .
Summer has proven a strong launching pad for Comedy Central this year with the return of Futurama and the summer season of Tosh.0 doing great in the ratings .
Benjamin is with CAA which reps all parties involved .
So , yesterday was the official start of akademy .
After spending friday night in the park with some random guys , one of whom hack on Qt in the mobile space ( welcome to Finland , I guess ) , and spending the evening with a bunch of us crammed at a table designed for half as many at a bar , the day of talks began bright and early , about 6 hours after the sun came up 😉 Naturally I was tired …
For some reason , in Finland I wake up when the sun comes up , but in Phoenix , I could sleep through the fracking apocalypse ; I even slept through an earthquake when I was in San Diego once .
So , yeah , that combined with far more socializing than I am used to is more or less putting a drain on me .
The day opened up with a cool MeeGo talk , motivating me enough to try to set up the MeeGo development environment , and to try to put together RPMs of the KDE Plasma Mobile Shell which could be deployed to MeeGo devices .
Should be pretty cool .
The MeeGo SDK wants to install to /usr , using , more or less , tar , so uhm , no .
🙂 I tried installing it to me / home / development root , but it did n’t seem to function so well , so oh fsck .
I also mailed Peter Robinson about putting together a Fedora Classroom session to teach the basics of RPM packaging , with a bit of a meego touch to it , since he is the packager of the MeeGo UX in Fedora 🙂
I also managed to sleep through Artur ’s talk on plasma - mobile , which made me feel like a bit of a dork .
😦
Most of the other talks have been really awesome , and I ’m sad that they had to occur in two tracks , meaning that there were lots of conflicts in what I was wanting to attend .
And then …. party .
Chani , sandsmark and I stopped at a pizza joint near the club before hand and split two pizzas , and met the developer of Simon , the speech recognition program , so that was really cool .
And then a few doors over , to the club .
Wowies .
I forgot how much fun dancing has been , it ’s been too long since I got to .
Well , I mean , to dance music , not live 80s soft rock - ish bar bands , like was on the ferry from Stockholm to Tampere .
When I got home at 2 am , one of my socks had a hole in it .
Oh and it was still light out at 2 am , a nice twilight .
And today , MOAR TALKS .
And I ’m just as tired , even though I managed to only wake up at 8:30 instead of 4 and 6 like I have been .
So , I ’ve gone to a few of the talks today , but for some reason , I am finding less to go to , the tracks are a * little * less interesting today .
😦
But still , there are an incredible amount of good talks . 🙂
After closing tonight , there will be a meetup of plasma hackers , so if you are or want to be a plasma hacker , find a bunch of us after the closing presentations .
Not sure where , or anything , but the details SHALL COME .
Tomorrow is the e.V. ’s AGM , where all of the e.V. members sit around and talk about mystery stuff ( Knut ’s dancing , probably ) , so I plan on SLEEPING IN , like until 10 or 11 . mmmmmm~ , delicious sleep .
and then hackfests .

One chapter is closing — and another is opening — as Stanford University moves toward the creation of its first “ bookless library . ”
Box by box , decades of past scholarship are being packed up and emptied from two old libraries , Physics and Engineering , to make way for the future : a smaller but more efficient and largely electronic library that can accommodate the vast , expanding and interrelated literature of Physics , Computer Science and Engineering .
“ The role of this new library is less to do with shelving and checking out books — and much more about research and discovery , ” said Andrew Herkovic , director of communications and development at Stanford Libraries .
Libraries are the very heart of the research university , the center for scholarship .
But the accumulation of information online is shifting their sense of identity .
For 40 years , the metal shelves of the modest Physics and Engineering libraries were magnets to thousands of students and faculty , including Nobel Prize winners Douglas Osheroff , Robert Laughlin and Steven Chu , who now directs the U.S. Department of Energy .
On the wall of the Physics Library are 16 original prints by photographer Ansel Adams , dedicated to pioneering physicist Russell Varian .
A cardboard cutout of a cheerful Albert Einstein greets visitors .
A playful collection of clocks — illustrating the randomness of time — decorate a wall .
The future library — on the second floor of “ The Octagon , ” the centerpiece of the university ’s new science and engineering quad that opens later this year — will offer a stark contrast .
It is only half the size of the current Engineering Library , but saves its space for people , not things .
It features soft seating , “ brainstorm islands , ” a digital bulletin board and group event space .
There are few shelves and it will feature a self - checkout system .
It is developing a completely electronic reference desk , and there will be four Kindle 2 e-readers on site .
Its online journal search tool , called xSearch , can scan 28 online databases , a grant directory and more than 12,000 scientific journals .
Several factors are driving the shift .
Stanford is running out of room , restricted by an agreement with Santa Clara County that limits how much it can grow .
Increasingly , the university seeks to preserve precious square footage .
Adding to its pressures is the steady flow of books .
Stanford buys 100,000 volumes a year — or 273 every day .
“ Most of the libraries on campus are approaching saturation , ” Herkovic said .
“ For every book that comes in , we ’ve got to find another book to send off . ”
This fierce competition for space on campus means that many , perhaps most , books will be shipped 38 miles away to a Livermore storage facility .
Stanford ’s plight is not unique .
Four miles off its Durham , N.C. , campus , Duke University has a high - density storage facility , with shelves 30 feet high , to hold 15 million books .
Harvard ’s repository is 35 miles away in the rural town of Southborough , Mass .
“ You just get to the point where you ’re busting at the seams , ” said Lori Goetsch , president of the Association of College and Research Libraries and dean of libraries at Kansas State in Manhattan , Kan . — which stores its books more than 80 miles away , in Lawrence .
The sciences are the perfect place to test bookless libraries , librarians say .
In math , online books tend to render formulas badly .
And those in the humanities , arts and social sciences still embrace the serendipitous discoveries made while browsing .
Johanna Drucker , UCLA professor of information studies , asks : “ What version of a work should be digitized as representative ?
Leo Tolstoy ’s original Russian text ?
Or the Maude translation ?
Should we digitize the sanitized version of Mark Twain ’s classics , or the originals ? ”
But technical information is readily and conveniently accessed online .
“ Physics was one of the first disciplines to really develop a strong electronic presence , ” Goetsch said .
Science and engineering students agree , saying there is little nostalgia for paper .
“ As far as research articles go , physics publication is already essentially entirely online , ” said physics graduate student Daniel Weissman .
“ And old journal editions from before the Internet era have largely been digitized , so you can get those articles online too .
So that just leaves reference books — and yeah , you ’re starting to see more and more of those in online versions , too . ”
But the transition is tougher for Physics librarian Stella Ota , who is responsible for the fate of thousands of old books as she prepares for the June 9 closure .
“ It is challenging — I ’ll look at a book and say , ‘ This is important work , but not currently used , ’ ” she said .
So the 1937 edition of Webel ’s Technical Dictionary , German - English , is moving to Livermore .
So is the huge and heavy Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies , with glossy photos .
“ Or perhaps it is worn , or damaged , or food was spilled , ” so it will be given away , she said .
That is the fate of the 1970 - 79 Bibliography of Astronomy , as well as the decrepit Selected Physical Constants .
A lucky few will be selected for the few shelves at the new library .
“ When I look back , then there is a certain sadness for me .
Any change is hard .
And there are moments of joy , when I see bookplates of former faculty who owned and donated the book , and sometimes made notes on the side , ” Ota said .
“ But looking forward , I see an opportunity to create something new . ”

The Pey'j ( Beyond Good & Evil Cocktail )
Ingredients :
60 mls bacon rum
10 mls maple syrup
3 dashes Angostura bitters
10 mls water
Directions : Place all ingredients in glass .
Fill the glass with ice and stir until the cocktail is very cold .
Drink with friends and discuss how much Beyond Good & Evil 2 needs to come out .
Now , bacon rum is n’t that common .
In addition to sending in his recipe for this cocktail , Shay Leighton also sent in the recipe he uses to make your very own bacon rum .
“ First , I must confess after some of the long nights of Cocktails and Games down at the Mana Bar there has been known to be some ( very ) sore heads , and as any good gamer knows the only one cure for a hangover is BACON .
Sadly for this drink you are going to need to eat piles of it , or you could invite your gang around for a post drinks night breakfast .
First job you need to do is cook about 1.5 kg ( 3.3 lbs ) of bacon .
You ’re going to really want to fry that sucker because we need to collect as much fat as we can .
The way to do this is just cook a couple of rashers of bacon at a time , remove the bacon ( do with this what you may ) then pour the fat off into another pot on the side .
Next we are going to get our bottle of Rum ( I use and recommend Appleton Estate VX ) and pour it in to a large mixing bowl .
Please make sure to that the rum you are using is not garbage , it will ruin this drink terribly .
Once you have cooked all your bacon and collected all of the fat .
Place the ‘ Fat Pot ’ on a very low heat till all the fat is liquid again .
Then pour you warmed fat into your rum and stir for about 10 min. really mix it right in .
You want to then cling film over the top of the mixing bowl .
Leave out ( at room temperature ) for 3 - 4 hour then stick it in the fridge over night .
The next day strain the , now solid fat and rum though something ( I use cheese cloth ) back into the original bottle .
Now we have Bacon Rum . ”
I have attracted heat in some quarters for my perceived cynicism and negativity regarding the Edmonton Oilers .
This perception is probably because I actually am extremely cynical and pessimistic , and even when Steve Tambellini pulls off a smart move I am left with the lingering suspicion that he is taking belated action that will just make it easier for him to screw us up next time .
Bluntly , I 'm not sure he understands that the team which scores the most goals , not the team which is tallest , wins the hockey game .
At 6 ' 4 " , Jean - Francois Jacques is very tall .
He is also an extremely bad hockey player - probably one of the worst regular NHL forwards of all time .
Through his first sixty - three NHL games in parts of four injury - prone seasons , he recorded one solitary point and was - 17 .
Last year he had eleven points , was - 15 , and at age twenty - four had by far his best ever NHL campaign .
His career NHL points - per - game of 0.11 is worse than the Oiler totals of such offensive dynamos as Dan LaCouture , Brad Winchester , Mike Bishai , Louie Debrusk , and yes , even Jason Bonsignore .
His career best of 0.22 is still worse than the Oiler totals of renowned superstars Georges Laraque , Toby Petersen , Jiri Dopita , and Kelly Buchberger .
The only Edmonton forward to play more than a full NHL season and have fewer points per game than Jacques has in his career was renowned enforcer / cinder block Dave Brown , who is 0.003 points per game in arrears of the Crazy Train .
Over a full eighty - two game season , that averages out to almost a quarter of a point .
Jean - Francois Jacques is terrible .
Jean - Francois Jacques is - 32 in his career .
This is the tenth - worst total of all time among Edmonton forwards to have played more than eighty - two games with the Oilers .
Every player ahead of him on the list , except Patrick O'Sullivan , played more games than Jacques .
Every single player ahead of him had both more points and more points - per - game than Jacques .
Jacques and O'Sullivan are the only two not to play multiple seasons for the Oilers in the mid-1990s , which was a pretty much automatic path to a sure big minus .
Only O'Sullivan , David Oliver , and Shayne Corson played less than twice as many games as Jacques .
And not one of those players - not one !
- got as little ice time as Jacques did to commit this atrocity against ice hockey .
Jean - Francois Jacques is terrible .
Per OilersNation 's Jason Gregor , Jean - Francois Jacques is also $ 615,000 richer , having signed a one - year extension with the Oilers today and capgeek reports that it 's a one - way deal .
There 's no plausible excuse to bring back a plug like Jacques who is twenty - five , injury - prone , and such a disaster as a hockey player that the historic levels of his awfulness genuinely beggar belief .
Jean - Francois Jacques is terrible .
He is worse than terrible .
He is not a good player , he is not a good goon .
$ 615,000 is cheap for an NHL player but Jean - Francois Jacques is not an NHL player .
$ 615 would be bad value for Jean - Francois Jacques .
If he were to develop into even a mediocre player - if he were to round into a poor man 's Zack Stortini who could play against the worst opposition and not humiliate himself - it would constitute an unprecedented career turn - around for an oft - injured forward with 255 professional games under his belt .
This post will necessarily be short , for there is very little to say .
Last year 's version of the Edmonton Oilers was the worst of all time , and Steve Tambellini has willingly chosen to retain some of the worst parts of it .
Anything short of pessimism and cynicism would be naivete .
Jean - Francois Jacques is terrible .
And he is an Oiler .
How can his team not be terrible as well ?
There 's nothing worse than watching a 30 - second ad to watch some 30 - second clip of something the world inevitably finds funnier than you do .
Google / YouTube are acknowledging this phenomenon of the consumer psyche and will introduce an ad - skip button this year .

The idea is as simple as this :
If an advertiser 's commercial is n't captivating enough to watch in its own right , it 'll be skipped by viewers .
If viewers do n't watch the ad , Google does n't charge the advertiser .
Now I know what you 're thinking :
Why would anyone watch an ad voluntarily ?
See exhibit A , the lead video in which the god of the infomercial , Ron Popeil , does his thing .
The only way that 9 - minute clip could be more captivating is to put ANOTHER 9 - minute Ron Popeil clip in front of it .

This skippable ad model will inevitably lead to better ads — at least in terms of catering the online attention span — and , for those of us * with the libidinal fortitude to turn a blind eye on GoDaddy - esque BOOBIES BOOBIES BOOBIES teasers , a lot more free time .

Proposals for Guangdong 's main TV company to broadcast in Mandarin have angered citizens in the province
A Chinese " culture war " has spilled onto the streets of a southern city as hundreds of inhabitants held an unusual mass rally to defend their local language .
Proposals for Guangdong 's main television company to broadcast primarily in Mandarin – China 's official language – have angered citizens in the province , who fear that Cantonese is being sidelined .
Some worry that Cantonese , which is also spoken in some other parts of the mainland , Hong Kong and Macau , is on its way to extinction .
According to the official People 's Daily newspaper , it is the first language for half of the 14 million residents of the provincial capital Guangzhou , while the other half speak mainly Mandarin .
Up to a thousand protesters gathered in the centre of Guangzhou shouting slogans , before police dispersed them peacefully .
A witness said most were in their twenties , although some were middle - aged .
The controversy broke out when the local committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference – a political advisory body – urged authorities to ensure that Mandarin , which is spoken across the country , is used on Guangzhou TV 's main shows .
It said the move would promote unity and help tourists and athletes who will arrive in the city for the Asian Games this November .
Although the network has said it will continue to broadcast in both languages , residents fear that Cantonese is being squeezed out and could ultimately be dropped completely .
They argue there are already plenty of Mandarin channels for people to watch and say that a decline in the use of the language will also erode the area 's cultural heritage .
In a poll on the committee 's own website , 80 % of the 30,000 respondents said Guangzhou TV stations should broadcast in Cantonese .
The English edition of the official newspaper The Global Times described the row as a " culture war " .
It reported that the company spent 30 m yuan ( £ 3 m ) switching its business channel to Mandarin last year , only to see ratings drop .
" Promoting Mandarin does not mean Guangzhou has to eliminate its dialect , " Su Zhijia , the city 's deputy Party secretary , told China Daily .
" The city government has never had such a plan to abandon or weaken Cantonese . "
He praised local culture , but said that residents should improve their Mandarin and use it on formal occasions and in public places , reflecting the government 's policy of promoting it .
The influx of workers from other areas of China has been perhaps equally important in Mandarin 's ascendance in the area – although some migrant teenagers are said to have adopted Cantonese because they think it is more fashionable .
Last year , Lu Hanen , a local campaigner , told the South China Morning Post : " I do n't think we can stop Cantonese from being eliminated , but I want to slow [ the decline ] . "

What 's up ?'
Germany already leads the world on renewable energy and could become first G20 country to kick the fossil - fuel habit
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Germany could derive all of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2050 and become the world 's first major industrial nation to kick the fossil - fuel habit , the country 's Federal Environment Agency said today .
The country already gets 16 % of its electricity from wind , solar and other renewable sources – three times ' higher than the level it had achieved 15 years ago .
" A complete conversion to renewable energy by 2050 is possible from a technical and ecological point of view , " said Jochen Flasbarth , president of the Federal Environment Agency .
" It 's a very realistic target based on technology that already exists – it's not a pie - in - the - sky prediction , " he said .
Thanks to its Renewable Energy Act , Germany is the world leader in photovoltaics : it expects to add more than 5,000 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity this year to reach a total of 14,000 megawatts .
It is also the second - biggest wind - power producer after the United States .
Some 300,000 renewable energy jobs have been created in Germany in the last decade .
The government has set goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % between 1990 and 2020 , and by 80 - 85 % by 2050 .
That goal could be achieved if Germany switches completely to renewable sources by 2050 , Flasbarth said .
About 40 % of Germany 's greenhouse gases come from electricity production , in particular , from coal - fired power plants .
Flasbarth said the Environment Agency 's study found that switching to green electricity by 2050 would have economic advantages , especially for the vital export - oriented manufacturing industry .
It would also create tens of thousands of jobs .
" The costs of a complete switch to renewables are a lot less than the costs to future generations that climate change will cause , " he said .
Last month a report by the UK's Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth , mid Wales , said Britain could eliminate all its carbon emissions by 2030 by overhauling its power supply .
Maybe you saw the headlines blasting the rich ( again ! ) for failing to spend money in order to enable us to get out of this everlasting recession .
It turns out that in boom times , the rich spent $ 145 per day .
Now they are only spending $ 119 .
So , there we go : a new scapegoat !
Those greedy rich people are failing to do their duty .
The press reports that the rich are not booking at the Four Seasons , not putting on the Ritz , and not filling their closets with furs and jewels from Saks .
It gets worse .
The women who shop for goodies by Dries van Noten and John Galliano told the New York Times that their husbands are telling them to cool it on designer bags , shoes , and dresses .
Yet another reason for the recession : patriarchy !
But still , I ’m not entirely sure I can follow this .
In normal times , we are told that the rich are rich only at the expense of everyone else .
One man ’s wealth is another man ’s poverty .
It ’s a fixed pie , and one reason for human suffering is precisely the tendency of the rich to spend their filthy lucre on fripperies .
They engage in conspicuous consumption that does nothing but feed their egos even as the world ’s poor suffer .
Suddenly , the line has changed .
Now it is the moral obligation of the rich to cough up in order to help the rest of us .
Especially now that government stimulus has proven to be ineffective , the rich should make it their patriotic obligation to spend , spend , spend !
To be sure , the left - leaning commentariat is not willing to go so far as to favor tax cuts for the rich .
For that would put us " in an Alice in Wonderland world , " says Sam Pizzigati of the Institute for Policy Studies , in which we help the people we are supposed to hate .

I ’m just trying to come to terms with the intellectual model here .
On the one hand , the rich are usually blamed for poverty simply because they have money while others do not .
On the other hand , their failure to behave like rich people is also to blame for economic hard times .
It ’s like this swath of the population ca n’t do anything right .

Now , under crude Keynesian thinking , one can sort of make sense of this .
The idea is that a rich person buys a yacht and that provides jobs for yacht salesmen , boat makers , wood finishers , boat repairmen , paint makers , and everyone else involved in making and maintaining the yachting world .
These people get money and in turn spend it on clothes , booze , movies , and other things along those lines .
This is the circular flow of perpetual economic motion that keeps the world afloat ; any saving then becomes a " paradox " because it delays recovery .
The trouble is that spending is not the cause of economic growth .
Investment , which begins in saving , is the root of economic growth .
It does n’t matter that consumption makes up a certain percentage of economic activity .
That ’s only the surface you are looking at .
Spending and consumption without saving and investment is a prescription for devouring the prospects for prosperity down the line .
In this case , the best thing that the rich can do for a future of economic growth is not to spend but to save toward investment .
The circular - flow model that sees spending as the fuel of economic activity fails to account for saving and investment , which come about only through deferred consumption .
The view that economies grow through consumption leaves out the real drama behind the scenes .
As Robert Murphy explains , " The finished goods you buy at the store are made of components that passed through probably thousands of different hands , in dozens of countries , before all coming together into the item you throw in your grocery cart . "
Speaking of Liberty Jr. , Llewellyn H. Rock ...
Best Price : $ 1.80 Buy New $ 8.65 ( as of 07:35 EST - Details )
The core problem with the economic boom is precisely that it led to wealth - consuming activities that secretly ate away the core productivity of the economic structure .
What needs to happen is a retrenchment , a new pattern of saving and deferred consumption .
And why would people save ?
In order to spend later , once the foundations of future prosperity are rebuilt .
But this takes time ( another feature of reality left out of circular flow ) .
The best approach the government can take is to back off , let people keep what they earn , and permit the economy to rebuild on its own .
In other words , tax cuts for the rich would in fact help get us out of recession .
But there is no reason to limit these cuts to the rich .
There should be tax cuts for everyone .
And that has to go along with massive cuts in government spending too , so that we stop running debts that have to be paid later with inflated dollars .
In other words , stimulus and browbeating the rich to spend more are going to have exactly the opposite effect .
They will delay recovery .
In fact , the current political environment is following the script of the Great Depression in delaying prosperity year after year through terrible political ideas and policies .
The rich can indeed help us all , not by spending but by being thrifty and even miserly for as long as necessary to fix what the government has broken .

Anatomy of an elf
ELF segments
The first thing Haiku does when it encounters something that resembles a file system driver is to load it and inspect the list of modules provided .
Normally , loading a Haiku add - on means identifying three program headers from the ELF add - on image : the ones corresponding to the .text ( code ) section , the .data section and a third segment where dynamic linking information can be found .
We can find information about these segments running :
$ readelf -l generated / objects / haiku/x86/release/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/iso9660/iso9660
Elf file type is DYN ( Shared object file ) Entry point 0x1070
There are 3 program headers , starting at offset 52 Program Headers : Type Offset VirtAddr PhysAddr FileSiz MemSiz Flg Align LOAD 0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x04440 0x04440 R E 0x1000 LOAD 0x004440 0x00005440 0x00005440 0x00364 0x00384 RW
0x1000 DYNAMIC 0x004454 0x00005454 0x00005454 0x000c0 0x000c0 RW
0x4 Section to Segment mapping : Segment Sections ... 00 .hash .dynsym .dynstr .gnu.version .gnu.version_r .rel.dyn .rel.plt .init .plt .text .fini .rodata .eh_frame 01 .ctors .dtors .data.rel.ro .dynamic .got .data .bss 02 .dynamic
. text
.data
As one can easily see , each segment contains more than just theandsections .
The PT_LOAD segment corresponding to the . text section is not writable , while the PT_LOAD segment corresponding to the .data section is not executable .
These are simple protections against certain types of exploits : e.g. changing the code at runtime to code written by an attacker , or executing ( code masked as ) data received from the attacker .
Haiku uses the segment 's protection information to differentiate between the . text section and the .data sections .
LKL based ELFs
Images that link to LKL ( at least at this moment ) generate a single PT_LOAD segment which encapsulates ( among others ) both the .text and the .data sections :
$ readelf -l generated / objects / haiku/x86/release/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/lklhaikufs/lklhaikufs
Elf file type is DYN ( Shared object file ) Entry point 0x18790
There are 3 program headers , starting at offset 52 Program Headers : Type Offset VirtAddr PhysAddr FileSiz MemSiz Flg Align LOAD 0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x134520 0x13d310 RWE
0x1000 DYNAMIC 0x12c5a4 0x0012c5a4 0x0012c5a4 0x000c8 0x000c8 RW
0x4 NOTE 0x000094 0x00000094 0x00000094 0x00024 0x00024 R 0x4 Section to Segment mapping : Segment Sections ... 00 .note.gnu.build-id .hash .dynsym .dynstr .gnu.version .gnu.version_r .rel.dyn .rel.plt .init .plt .text .cpuinit.text .meminit.text .fini .rodata .eh_frame .ctors .dtors .data.rel.ro .dynamic .got .data .cpuinit.data .meminit.data .bss 01 .dynamic 02 .note.gnu.build-id
As we need to be able to execute the . text section and to write data from the .data section at the same time , this PT_LOAD segment must be mapped as RWE .
At first glance , the fix appeared trivial : if a section is executable we 'll consider it the . text section and we 'll treat it as a special writable . text section .
This trick however does not work on all architectures as Ingo Weinhold informed me :
bonefish@backbone:~/develop/haiku/haiku/generated-ppc>
readelf -- segments objects/haiku/ppc/release/add-ons/kernel/bus_managers/pci/pci
Elf file type is DYN ( Shared object file ) Entry point 0x3f270
There are 3 program headers , starting at offset 52 Program Headers : Type Offset VirtAddr PhysAddr FileSiz MemSiz Flg Align LOAD 0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0xa5c50 0xa5c50 R E 0x1000 LOAD 0x0a5c50 0x000a6c50 0x000a6c50 0x464d0 0x46678 RWE
0x1000 DYNAMIC 0x0a5c6 c 0x000a6c6 c 0x000a6c6 c 0x000c0 0x000c0 RW
0x4 Section to Segment mapping : Segment Sections ... 00 .hash .dynsym .dynstr .gnu.version .gnu.version_r .rela.dyn .rela.plt .init .text .fini .rodata 01 .eh_frame .ctors .dtors .data.rel.ro .dynamic .data .got .sdata .sbss .plt .bss 02 .dynamic
On PPC the .data section has the same protection bits as our LKL - based module on x86 , namely RWE .
Because the PT_LOAD program headers can appear in any order in the ELF file , on PPC my solution could have treated .data as program code , and ignore the real program code .
The problem has been properly fixed , but this means R1 / Alpha 1 , or R1 / Alpha 2 users cannot use LKL .

Google is clearly the best general - purpose search engine on the Web ( see www.pcmag.com/searchengines).
But most people do n't use it to its best advantage .
Do you just plug in a keyword or two and hope for the best ?
That may be the quickest way to search , but with more than 3 billion pages in Google 's index , it 's still a struggle to pare results to a manageable number .
But Google is an remarkably powerful tool that can ease and enhance your Internet exploration .
Google 's search options go beyond simple keywords , the Web , and even its own programmers .
Let 's look at some of Google 's lesser - known options .
Syntax Search Tricks
Using a special syntax is a way to tell Google that you want to restrict your searches to certain elements or characteristics of Web pages .
Google has a fairly complete list of its syntax elements at www.google.com/help/operators.html.
Here are some advanced operators that can help narrow down your search results .
Intitle : at the beginning of a query word or phrase ( intitle : " Three Blind Mice " ) restricts your search results to just the titles of Web pages .
Intext : does the opposite of intitle : , searching only the body text , ignoring titles , links , and so forth .
Intext : is perfect when what you 're searching for might commonly appear in URLs .
If you 're looking for the term HTML , for example , and you do n't want to get results such as www.mysite.com/index.html, you can enter intext : html .
Link : lets you see which pages are linking to your Web page or to another page you 're interested in .
For example , try typing in link : https://www.pcmag.com.
Try using site : ( which restricts results to top - level domains ) with intitle : to find certain types of pages .
For example , get scholarly pages about Mark Twain by searching for intitle : " Mark Twain " site : edu .
Experiment with mixing various elements ; you 'll develop several strategies for finding the stuff you want more effectively .
The site : command is very helpful as an alternative to the mediocre search engines built into many sites .
Swiss Army Google
Google has a number of services that can help you accomplish tasks you may never have thought to use Google for .
For example , the new calculator feature ( www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator) lets you do both math and a variety of conversions from the search box .
For extra fun , try the query " Answer to life the universe and everything . "
Let Google help you figure out whether you 've got the right spelling and the right word for your search .
Enter a misspelled word or phrase into the query box ( try " thre blund mise " ) and Google may suggest a proper spelling .
This does n't always succeed ; it works best when the word you 're searching for can be found in a dictionary .
Once you search for a properly spelled word , look at the results page , which repeats your query .
( If you 're searching for " three blind mice , " underneath the search window will appear a statement such as Searched the web for " three blind mice . " )
You 'll discover that you can click on each word in your search phrase and get a definition from a dictionary .
Suppose you want to contact someone and do n't have his phone number handy .
Google can help you with that , too .
Just enter a name , city , and state .
( The city is optional , but you must enter a state . )
If a phone number matches the listing , you 'll see it at the top of the search results along with a map link to the address .
If you 'd rather restrict your results , use rphonebook : for residential listings or bphonebook : for business listings .
If you 'd rather use a search form for business phone listings , try Yellow Search ( www.buzztoolbox.com/google/yellowsearch.shtml).
Extended Googling
Google offers several services that give you a head start in focusing your search .
Google Groups ( http://groups.google.com) indexes literally millions of messages from decades of discussion on Usenet .
Google even helps you with your shopping via two tools : Froogle ( http://froogle.google.com), which indexes products from online stores , and Google Catalogs ( http://catalogs.google.com), which features products from more 6,000 paper catalogs in a searchable index .
And this only scratches the surface .
You can get a complete list of Google 's tools and services at www.google.com/options/index.html.
You 're probably used to using Google in your browser .
But have you ever thought of using Google outside your browser ?
Google Alert ( www.googlealert.com) monitors your search terms and e-mails you information about new additions to Google 's Web index .
( Google Alert is not affiliated with Google ; it uses Google 's Web services API to perform its searches . )
If you 're more interested in news stories than general Web content , check out the beta version of Google News Alerts ( www.google.com/newsalerts).
This service ( which is affiliated with Google ) will monitor up to 50 news queries per e-mail address and send you information about news stories that match your query .
( Hint : Use the intitle : and source : syntax elements with Google News to limit the number of alerts you get . )
Google on the telephone ?
Yup .
This service is brought to you by the folks at Google Labs ( http://labs.google.com), a place for experimental Google ideas and features ( which may come and go , so what 's there at this writing might not be there when you decide to check it out ) .
With Google Voice Search ( http://labs1.google.com/gvs.html), you dial the Voice Search phone number , speak your keywords , and then click on the indicated link .
Every time you say a new search term , the results page will refresh with your new query ( you must have JavaScript enabled for this to work ) .
Remember , this service is still in an experimental phase , so do n't expect 100 percent success .
In 2002 , Google released the Google API ( application programming interface ) , a way for programmers to access Google 's search engine results without violating the Google Terms of Service .
A lot of people have created useful ( and occasionally not - so - useful but interesting ) applications not available from Google itself , such as Google Alert .
For many applications , you 'll need an API key , which is available free from www.google.com/apis.
See the figures for two more examples , and visit www.pcmag.com/solutions for more .
Thanks to its many different search properties , Google goes far beyond a regular search engine .
Give the tricks in this article a try .
You 'll be amazed at how many different ways Google can improve your Internet searching .
Online Extra : More Google Tips
Here are a few more clever ways to tweak your Google searches .
Search Within a Timeframe
Daterange : ( start dateend date ) .
You can restrict your searches to pages that were indexed within a certain time period .
Daterange : searches by when Google indexed a page , not when the page itself was created .
This operator can help you ensure that results will have fresh content ( by using recent dates ) , or you can use it to avoid a topic 's current - news blizzard and concentrate only on older results .
Daterange : is actually more useful if you go elsewhere to take advantage of it , because daterange : requires Julian dates , not standard Gregorian dates .
You can find converters on the Web ( such as http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/JulianDate.html), but an easier way is to do a Google daterange : search by filling in a form at www.researchbuzz.com/toolbox/goofresh.shtml or www.faganfinder.com/engines/google.shtml.
If one special syntax element is good , two must be better , right ?
Sometimes .
Though some operators can't be mixed ( you ca n't use the link : operator with anything else ) many can be , quickly narrowing your results to a less overwhelming number .
More Google API Applications
Staggernation.com offers three tools based on the Google API .
The Google API Web Search by Host ( GAWSH ) lists the Web hosts of the results for a given query ( www.staggernation.com/gawsh/).
When you click on the triangle next to each host , you get a list of results for that host .
The Google API Relation Browsing Outliner ( GARBO ) is a little more complicated :
You enter a URL and choose whether you want pages that related to the URL or linked to the URL ( www.staggernation.com/garbo/).
Click on the triangle next to an URL to get a list of pages linked or related to that particular URL .
CapeMail is an e-mail search application that allows you to send an e-mail to [ email protected ] with the text of your query in the subject line and get the first ten results for that query back .
Maybe it's not something you 'd do every day , but if your cell phone does e-mail and does n't do Web browsing , this is a very handy address to know .
Phnom Penh , Cambodia ( CNN ) --
" I come back here to where I killed people .
And I feel terrible .
My mind , my soul , my body is spinning inside .
All the things I did are flashing through my mind . "
The speaker is a man named Suon .
Sitting alongside a field , the former Khmer Rouge militia commander explains in the documentary " Enemies of the People " how he slit people 's throats and talks about drinking gall bladder bile .
The film had its premiere in Asia just ahead of the first verdict to be handed down by the Cambodian genocide tribunal on Monday .
It has already won the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival
At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia 's population -- died under the 1975 - 1979 Khmer Rouge from execution , disease , starvation and overwork , according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia .
Four of the ultra-Maoist regime 's former leaders are waiting to see if they will stand trial before a U.N. - backed tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

Kaing Guek Eav , alias Duch , the head of the infamous torture prison in the country 's capital of Phnom Penh , has stood trial on charges including crimes against humanity .
The verdict will be announced in his case on Monday , more than 30 years after the fall of the regime .
In the film , directed and produced by Cambodian Teth Sambath and Briton Rob Lemkin , Teth tracks down about 100 former Khmer Rouge fighters who were responsible for the killing to learn why they participated .
" We do n't have the answers from the Khmer Rouge leaders and from other Khmer Rouge cadre about why there [ was ] starvation , why they [ were ] killing the people , " he said .
" I am very worried that if we [ cannot ] find out the real history , the Khmer Rouge history would be hidden ... the new generation they would not understand . "
Powerful moments in the film , which opens Friday in the United States , include a woman who said she cried in secret so the Khmer Rouge would not kill her .
There is also Soun 's description of killing a pretty woman he had asked to stay with him but was ordered to get rid of .
" When they talk [ about ] how they kill [ed ] people , it made me feel very frightened , but I kept it in my heart , " said Teth , 42 , who lost his brother , mother and father to the Khmer Rouge .
" I wanted to get the truth , so I had to ask -- even if there are bad things , because it 's for history .
We had to ask everything , even bad or good .
We need to get everything out . "
Teth 's odyssey began in 1996 .
His family 's earnings went to his search for the fighters , leading him crisscrossing the southeast Asian nation looking for scarred men and women .
But he never told his family or close friends about his mission since he did not want to bring up the hard and sad memories of the past .
A journalist for the English - language Phnom Penh Post , Teth eventually met Nuon Chea , the second - in - command under Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and who is now waiting for the genocide tribunal to decide if he will stand trial for crimes against humanity .
He befriended Nuon Chea .
At first , Teth did not tell him how his family died because he wanted to get to the truth .
But after years of visits , Nuon Chea told Teth about the orders to kill -- especially those expelled from the party and labeled criminals .
" They were killed and destroyed .
If we had let them live , the party line would have been hijacked .
They were enemies of the people , " Nuon Chea told him .
Teth said he and Nuon Chea are friends , but " it does n't mean I support him . "
" There is a difference between friendship and the law , " he said .
" If the law judges him and sends him to jail , okay , yes . "
Teth has rejected a request from the genocide court reviewing Nuon Chea 's case for a copy of the film .
" I told all these people [ the killers ] , I do not work for the court .
I do not work for anyone but all the people ... to know about the real history .
If I give this kind of stuff to the court , it means that I betray Nuon Chea and I betray the killers , " he said .
In the film Teth brings Nuon Chea together with Suon and another former fighter , Khoun .
The two men listen to Nuon Chea , who counsels them that since they had no intention to kill and were following orders , they had committed no sin -- and under Buddhism , need not fear punishment .
" You can start life again , " he tells them .
But Suon , in the next scene , is unconvinced .
" How many holes in hell must I go through before I can be reborn as a human being again ?
I feel desperate , but I do n't know what to do .
I will never again see sunlight as a human being in this world , " he says .
Teth and Lemkin said they have had positive feedback to the film , with Cambodians telling them they had never seen such confessions .
" This film can tell the people the truth , can tell the victims the truth .
It can tell the new generation how to avoid -- not to repeat -- the mistakes from the past , " Teth said .
" One more thing -- it can encourage other Khmer Rouge perpetrators to come out , to confess and to join together to make a real story [ of their experience ] . "
Teth noted that the killers had felt better after confessing what they had done , and Lemkin noted that the process had in turn helped his co-director and producer .
" Another aspect of what this film is really about is that he is trying to lay to rest the ghosts of his dead family in the hope that perhaps he and his new young family , living family , can find a way to go forward , " he said .
" He wanted to find that there was some kind of rationality , and I think in discovering the humanity of the killers ... he discovers something that is very much healing and a kind of cathartic resolution to this very , very terrible loss that he had to live through . "
Layers of the Past by Eti Bonn - Muller
Combining data from two centuries ' worth of images creates a new view of the ancient Near East
By superimposing additional layers of images , CAMEL is also able to show features that have disappeared over time .
On top of the 2002 detail image ( bottom ) is a declassified 1960s U.S. spy satellite image ( middle ) and a 1937 photograph ( top ) taken by Erich Schmidt , a pioneer of aerial archaeological survey , from the Oriental Institute .
A digital composite of these images helped researchers see that an ancient water system ( line of dots in the foreground of the top image ) had been obscured by modern development .
( See below for image credits . )
Archaeologists have long been frustrated by their inability to visualize how ancient sites and their environs once looked .
But this is no longer a problem with CAMEL — the snappy acronym for the Center for Ancient Middle Eastern Landscapes at the University of Chicago 's Oriental Institute — a souped - up version of the " virtual globe " idea .
CAMEL draws from a giant pool of three types of images : topographic maps dating from the mid-19th century to the present , pioneering aerial photographs taken by archaeologists between the 1920s and 1950s , and remote - sensing data such as satellite imagery .
It then merges these components to create pictures of on - the - ground features such as archaeological sites that show how the landscape of the Middle East — broadly defined by CAMEL 's researchers as extending from Greece to Afghanistan to the Horn of Africa — has changed over the past two centuries .
The resulting image is a dense jumble of varying pixel sizes and colors , but digitally peeling away its layers is like unearthing a rich , virtual trove of information .
This data is invaluable , especially to scholars studying the Middle East .
Before the mid-20th - century advent of mechanized farming techniques , deep plowing , urban development , and modern warfare , this landscape had remained relatively untouched for thousands of years .
Through composite CAMEL images , it is now possible to follow everything from the course of ancient rivers and patterns of vegetation growth to the emergence of recent looters ' holes and the damage sustained to millennia - old mud-brick palaces during the latest wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
CAMEL is also revolutionizing the way archaeologists approach fieldwork in the region .
" For the first time , we can actually see sites as part of a broader archaeological landscape of topography , ancient agriculture , herding systems , and roads , " says Oriental Institute ( OI ) director Gil Stein , who used CAMEL data at Tell Zeidan , the sixth - to fifth - millennium B.C. site in Syria where he directs excavations .
" This is one of the single best resources in existence for doing landscape archaeology in the Near East . "
Using a composite CAMEL image of the area surrounding Tell Zeidan , Stein and his team were able to reconstruct an ancient river terrace system and locate 64 possible archaeological sites , which they then mapped and surveyed for surface finds .
" We can now start to understand Tell Zeidan 's role as a regional center dominating a hinterland of small surrounding agricultural villages , " he says .
" In three weeks , we were able to do work that would otherwise have taken us three months . "
CAMEL team members under the direction of Scott Branting , an assistant professor of archaeology at the OI , work with Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) to combine the three types of images .
They usually start with two — preferably one that contains a good deal of spatial information , such as a satellite image , and another with less information , such as an old , hand - drawn map — and match their coordinates .
The computer then stretches and fits , or " georectifies , " the images .
With them aligned one on top of another , it is possible to begin layering other types of images , including aerial photographs , on top of the georectified one .
Among the myriad benefits of the resulting image is the ability to overlay real - time GPS data on it , so archaeologists in the field using a tablet PC can actually see themselves on the image .
The CAMEL " lab " , as the university calls it , is the brainchild of geographer - turned - archaeologist Tony Wilkinson , formerly an associate professor at the OI and now a professor at Durham University in the United Kingdom .
In 1996 , Wilkinson realized the importance of developing tools to work with Cold War - era spy satellite imagery , which had just begun to be declassified .
So the following year , he began to amass these images .
The OI now houses some 1,200 declassified spy satellite images , one of the largest collections in the world alongside the U.S. Geological Survey .
Working out of a cramped room in the basement of the OI , Wilkinson started looking for other visual materials that might augment them .
James Henry Breasted , founder of the Oriental Institute , took aerial photographs of archaeological sites while on expeditions throughout the Middle East .
Here , he poses with his camera in front of the Royal Air Force biplane used for his flight over Egypt in 1920 , when he captured the photo shown at the top of the stack of images above .

Today , the 12 - year - old lab is well equipped .
Since 2004 , it has been under the direction of Branting , who expanded on these ideas by digitizing thousands of maps and photographs from the OI 's collection and ramping up the purchase of more recent satellite images .
The team , including current graduate students and CAMEL associate directors Joshua Trampier and Robert Tate , is made up of about two dozen students and volunteers .
One of its main goals is to make the information accessible to the public in an online archive .
For now , the team provides information to researchers upon e-mail request ( http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/camel).
A potential problem is that data could fall into the hands of looters , but Branting is optimistic that CAMEL may also be able to help the good guys .
" If somebody has the wherewithal to know that he should use remote - sensing imagery to loot , he 's going to be able to purchase very high - resolution stuff anyway , " says Branting .
Making the information available , he argues , and developing partnerships throughout the region with local agencies such as Egypt 's Supreme Council of Antiquities , " at least puts them on an even playing field to try and stop it . "
Branting 's team is working with researchers at the University of Arkansas to develop a way to automate the labor - intensive process of georectification for the declassified spy satellite imagery ; for the time being , they do it by hand .
In 2009 , the team finished digitizing the OI 's collection of more than 4,500 maps , but it will be another three - plus years before all of the thousands of aerial photos are digitized .
In addition , new satellite images continue to be reproduced ( and declassified ) every year .
Branting has also started to reach out to overseas research centers , including the Albright Institute in Jerusalem , to digitize their map collections so researchers do n't need to travel to Israel to access them .
" Ideally , we 'd like to create a very deep temporal landscape , " says Branting .
" This will probably always be an ongoing project to a certain extent . "
And , undoubtedly , an invaluable one .
" We can now reconstruct the earliest urban landscapes in the world , " adds Stein .
" It 's incredible . "

I often see a football match described as a battle or a fight for survival but in 1969 a tie between Honduras and El Salvador proved to be the catalyst that turned simmering border tension and immigration issues into all - out war .
The two teams met in a play - off that had more at stake than simply a place at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico and each side was subjected to abuse , xenophobia and hatred when playing in the other country .
After losing 3 - 0 in El Salvador , Honduras coach Mario Griffin wryly observed : " We 're awfully lucky that we lost . "
El Salvador progressed to the World Cup finals but neither side prospered from the Soccer War , as it has become known , which broke out less than three weeks after Honduras were eliminated .
The war lasted 100 hours and left an estimated 6,000 dead and 12,000 wounded .
The legendary Polish foreign correspondent Ryszard Kapuscinski covered the war and wrote afterwards : " In Latin America , the border between soccer and politics is vague .
" There is a long list of governments that have been overthrown after the defeat of the national team . "
Last year Honduras 's attempt to qualify for the World Cup finals took place amid a backdrop of political turmoil .
Ousted president Zelaya celebrated Honduras 's qualification
President Manuel Zelaya was forced into exile in July amid a power struggle over his plans for constitutional change .
Roberto Micheletti was sworn in as interim leader , although Zelaya returned to Honduras in September and sought sanctuary in the Brazilian embassy as he tried to return to power .
It was a delicate situation that could easily have become far worse when Honduras , who are represented in the Premier League by Tottenham 's Wilson Palacios and Wigan duo Hendry Thomas and Maynor Figueroa , travelled to El Salvador for their final qualifier on 14 October .
A Honduras victory combined with the United States avoiding defeat against Costa Rica would ensure their place at the finals in South Africa 2010 .
Honduran football association president Rafael Callejas was inside the Estadio Cuscatlan in San Salvador and saw veteran striker Carlos Pavon put his side in front just after the hour but news of the score between the US and Costa Rica was scarce .
The game was not broadcast inside the stadium and the reception on both of Callejas 's mobile phones was terrible .
He eventually found out that Costa Rica had raced into an early 2 - 0 lead and later discovered that Michael Bradley had pulled a goal back for the US after 71 minutes .
" I was happy we were winning but sad because I knew that Costa Rica were still in front , " Callejas told me .
" There was a lot of speculation and it was not until a minute after the final whistle that all the Hondurans inside the ground found out the US had scored a late equaliser , meaning that we had qualified . "
It was the first time since 1982 they had made it to a World Cup finals .

Perhaps more significantly , in a reversal of the events of 1969 it seems that 40 years on their footballing triumph played its role in preventing an outbreak of violence .
" If we had not qualified for the World Cup the differences in Honduras would have become enhanced and probably we would have had high levels of violence , " added Callejas .
" People were tranquilised by the game , it gave them hope and happiness . "
Callejas should have a better understanding than most of the relationship between politics and football in Honduras , having been president of the nation from 1990 to 1994 .
He believes Honduras to be a country that lives and breathes football and noted : " Everybody is not only a fan but they are also a reporter , director and coach . "
And the 66 - year - old describes the team 's qualification for South Africa as a balm that brought Honduras together at a time when it was badly fracturing .
" You can not imagine how happy people were - they forgot everything , " he said .
" There were groups that wanted us to lose until we won and then they were also happy . "
Photographs showed the ousted Zelaya celebrating inside the Brazilian embassy , while Callejas claimed the populace was so keen to celebrate with their heroes that the team feared for their safety on their return from El Salvador .
" We could not organise anything , " stated Callejas .
" We could not even get on a bus because every time we tried people just climbed on it and ran in front of it .
" There was no way the police or army could protect the players .
In the end we parked in front of the presidential palace - not necessarily to see the president but to run away from all that was happening and protect the players . "
Micheletti came out to greet the triumphant squad and Callejas , doubtless an old hand at such matters , fully admits that the maximum possible political gain was made of the situation .
An election held in Honduras in November was won by Pofirio Lobo , a member of the opposition to Zelaya 's Liberal Party .
The legitimacy of it was questioned by many observers but Lobo was sworn in as president in January and Zelaya left for exile in the Dominican Republic .
The political crisis in Honduras seems to be over and Callejas is now focused on the World Cup , when his team will try to qualify from a group that also comprises Spain , Chile and Switzerland .
At the end of his report on the Soccer War , Kapuscinski concluded : " The only chance small countries from the Third World have of evoking a lively international interest is when they shed blood .
This is a sad truth but it is so . "
But whatever happens in South Africa , the Honduras team has already shown the power that football has to unite people .

Lilith Tour type Music
The organizers of the 2010 Lilith Fair — initially one of the most - anticipated tours of the summer — have just announced the cancellation of 10 dates : Salt Lake City , Montreal , Raleigh , Charlotte , West Palm Beach , Tampa , Birmingham , Austin , Houston , and Dallas .
These cancellations come on the back of previously - announced pulled shows in Nashville and Phoenix , and in the wake of artists like Norah Jones and Kelly Clarkson bailing from one or more scheduled dates on the tour .
Meanwhile , the shows that are going on — tonight is the tour ’s third night , in Vancouver — are suffering from embarrassingly low attendance , and being moved to venues half the size of the original stops .
In the just - released cancellation announcement , Lilith co-founder Terry McBride says , “ We are in the midst of one of the most challenging summer concert seasons with many tours being cancelled outright .
Everyone involved with the tour would like to apologize to the fans and artists scheduled to play in these markets , and express appreciation for all the support for the festival ’s return .
Lilith remains the only tour of its kind , and we are confident that fans will be amazed by what each date has to offer . ”
Refunds are of course being offered , and fans are encouraged to check the website to find out how the cancelled shows may affect the artist lineups in their towns .
But meanwhile , it ’s time to put on your fantasy management caps , Mixers :
Why is this tour struggling ?
Head Lilith lady Sarah McLachlan recently told EW she thought this summer ’s Fair was less of a “ need ” and more of a “ want ” — so do you people not want it ?
Or do you really not have the money to make it out to the show ?

I first published this Cookies and Cream Cheesecake Cupcakes recipe in 2010 .
Since then , that post has received over a million hits and over 175,000 Pinterest pins and 46,000 “ likes ” on Stumble Upon .
It was the first post I ever published to go viral , and it was absolutely thrilling .
Since then I ’ve had posts achieve similar internet attention , but that was the first one and I ’ll always remember it !
When I was brainstorming video ideas for April , I quickly realized I absolutely needed to create a video on these cupcakes since they are one of my most popular recipes .
This post is now the updated version of that original 2010 post .
The original post has over 300 comments , some of which are questions about the recipe and some of which are very entertaining .
I think the video answers a lot of questions you may have , as just seeing how something is made gives you so much more confidence to enter the kitchen .
At least I think so !
Cookies and Cream Cheesecake Cupcakes Recipe Tips :
The recipe posted below is HALVED from the original recipe here .
Having 30 of these cupcakes in my house is way too dangerous .
Also , making 30 cupcake requires three muffins tins and I only have 2 .
Both options are available to you for whichever yield you prefer !
Yes , 275 °F is the right temperature .
You want to bake these in a cooler oven to avoid having overbaked or cracked cupcakes .
Allow the cupcakes to come to room temperature before chilling in the fridge for at least 4 hours .
I like to chill overnight .
I ran out of paper liners in the making of this video , but DEFINITELY use them if you have them .
The cupcakes will still turn out without them , but they ’re much prettier , easier to transport , and easier to clean with them .
I like to use standard white paper cupcake liners so the Oreo on the bottom peeks through like in the top photo .
Bake these for 22 minutes , or until the cheesecake is set .
If the batter is still slightly jiggly in the middle , that is fine .
Err on the side of underbaking vs. overbaking .
However , you may still need to add an extra minute or two of baking time if your oven runs cold .
You can substitute nonfat plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream , but I prefer sour cream .
You can also use light cream cheese if you want , again I prefer full - fat .
Since these are made with cream cheese , they need to be stored in the refrigerator .
If you plan on bringing them to a party or potluck , that ’s fine .
Just be aware that they should n’t sit at room temperature for an extended period of time .
I watched the ugly side of Israel collide with its more noble version , as Rabbi Ascherman and I visited a rural area in the northern West Bank where Jewish settlers have taken over land that Palestinian farmers say is theirs .
Image Rabbi Arik Ascherman , executive director of Rabbis for Human Rights .

“ If we try to enter our land , settlers will be waiting , and we will be beaten , ” said Muhammad Moqbel , a 71 - year - old Palestinian from the village of Qaryout who pointed to fields that he said had been stolen by settlers .
Last year , he said , he was hospitalized with a broken rib after settlers attacked while he was picking his own olives .
Rabbis for Human Rights has helped Palestinians recover some land through lawsuits in Israeli courts .
And Rabbi Ascherman and other Jewish activists escort such farmers to protect them .
The settlers still attack , but soldiers are more likely to intervene when it is rabbis being clubbed .
As Mr. Moqbel and Rabbi Ascherman were explaining all this to me , a settler vehicle came down to confront us .
And then another .
The settlers photographed us .
We photographed them .
I asked them if they would agree to be interviewed .
They refused to respond to my questions .
“ They ’re just trying to intimidate us , ” Rabbi Ascherman said .
As was the case in the American civil rights movement , the activists here often become targets .
Palestinian youths have stoned Rabbi Ascherman ’s car , and he has been arrested and beaten up by security forces and settlers alike .
( His car is almost as ancient as Jerusalem , and he has to lift the hood and fiddle with wires to get it started , which impedes fast getaways . )
Fusion is arguably the perfect way to power the world .
For one thing , there is enough fusion fuel to supply all of the world 's energy needs for millions of years .
Furthermore , it produces no environmentally damaging wastes , no carbon dioxide emissions and there could be no accidents that require evacuating the population surrounding a fusion power plant .
Fusion plants would also not need significant land area , and fusion fuels ( lithium and deuterium ) are available in seawater .
Unfortunately , it is hard to make fusion work .
Indeed , after more than 60 years of fusion research , no device has yet made more energy than it consumes .
Iter , the next fusion machine and the first to be built as an international collaboration , is designed to demonstrate the scientific feasibility of net energy production .
It is expected that Iter will produce about 500MW of fusion power – 10 times the input power .
Just as importantly , it will show how to integrate the many cutting - edge technologies required for efficient and reliable future power station designs .
Put simply , it is the big step needed to prove the viability of fusion as a commercial energy source .
Unfortunately , Iter 's construction expenses have risen from about € 5bn to over € 13bn and the cost overruns have prompted some to question why chasing nuclear fusion is a priority .
How sure are we that Iter will work ?
Could this money be spent more wisely in other areas of energy research , such as renewables or new fission ?
My answer is that fusion is more than desirable .
It may be crucially necessary .
Burning coal , oil , or natural gas generates 80 % of the world 's primary energy .
This simply can't continue much longer .
Fossil fuels are diminishing resources , and burning them adversely affects climate and the environment .
If we ask what energy sources could take over the role of fossil fuels , there are only three candidates with sufficient long - term resource : solar , nuclear fission with uranium or thorium breeders and nuclear fusion .
Other sources will play important but lesser roles , for example wind may provide 10 - 20 % of energy supply .
All three long - term options require substantial research and development before they are ready , or cheap enough , to be deployed on a large scale .
None are certain to deliver everything so it would be foolish not to fund research on all three .
How likely is Iter 's success ?
To make fusion we must heat a very hot gas ( or plasma ) of hydrogen - like fuels to temperatures 10 times those at the centre of the sun ( 100 - 200 m degrees C ) and hold it in place in a containment vessel using powerful magnetic fields .
Experiments at the Joint European Torus ( Jet ) in the UK regularly achieve such conditions .
Indeed Jet has produced 16MW of fusion power .
So fusion works .
Sophisticated computer simulations and empirical extrapolations from Jet and other machines predict that Iter will reach and perhaps exceed its target performance .
If this is true then we could see following Iter with the first electricity - producing prototype fusion reactor by the end of the 2030s .
Is Iter worth the increased cost ?
Iter has to be large and technically advanced – and that comes with a big bill .
Of the € 13bn price tag ( over 10 years ) , Europe , as host of Iter , pays 45 % ( around € 6bn ) .
The cost overrun in 2011 / 2013 will be € 1.4bn .
It has now been decided to redeploy funds to cover the gap from the overall European research budget .
For a commodity so vital to the way we live our lives , the € 10bn spent yearly by the public sector worldwide on energy research is pitifully low – about 0.2 % of the approximately €5tn world energy market .
Compare this with the $ 20 bn ( €15.5 bn ) that BP has set aside to deal with all aspects of the Gulf oil spill .
With this perspective Iter 's cost seems appropriate .
I would argue that the ultimate prize of commercial fusion power makes
Iter a project well worth pursuing .
Indeed , I would advocate increases in all areas of energy research worldwide , including renewables and fission .
Perhaps we will end up with many energy options – several belts and braces , too – but it is too early to tell .
Let 's do the research .
We owe it to our grandchildren .
Consumer Reports wo n't recommend iPhone 4
Gripping the gap between the iPhone 4's two antennas ( the vertical line on the right side of the photo ) can cause ' significant ' signal loss , according to Consumer Reports .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Influential product review magazine Consumer Reports said Monday it will not recommend Apple 's new iPhone 4 to consumers because of reception problems .
" Consumer Reports ' engineers have just completed testing the iPhone 4 , and have confirmed that there there is a problem with its reception , " the magazine said in a blog post on its website .
" When your finger or hand touches a spot on the phone 's lower left side -- an easy thing , especially for lefties -- the signal can significantly degrade enough to cause you to lose your connection altogether if you 're in an area with a weak signal . "
Apple acknowledged the problem earlier this month , claiming that the issue was a software glitch , not a hardware problem .
The company said the formula it used to calculate how many signal bars to display was incorrect , exacerbating the apparent decline in signal strength for customers in weak signal areas .
But Consumer Reports said its study called into question Apple 's " optical illusion " claim :
It tested the iPhone 4 along with several other AT&T phones , including the iPhone 3GS , in a controlled signal environment .
None had the signal - loss problems that the iPhone 4 demonstrated .
The review said electrically bridging the gap between the phone 's two antennas appears to be the cause of problem .
The magazine suggested covering the gap with a non-conductive material like duct tape as an " affordable " solution .
" It may not be pretty , but it works , " the magazine said in its blog .
Consumer Reports noted that the iPhone 4 otherwise ranked highest on the list of smart phone ratings that it released Monday .
But the magazine said it will not recommend Apple 's new device until the company unveils " a permanent -- and free -- fix for the antenna problem . "
As an alternative , Consumer Reports said it continues to recommend the older iPhone 3GS , which is still available from Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) .
Apple said it will release a free software update in the next several weeks to fix the software glitch .
It will use a new formula recommended by AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) , the iPhone 's exclusive carrier , for calculating how many bars to display .
Apple said it will also make the first three bars a bit taller to make them easier to see .
Still , the company has not admitted to any hardware issue .
Apple sells a $ 29 " bumper " case , which the company suggested in late June as a possible solution to the reception issue .

Reinhart and Rogoff ’s recent influential study of financial crises finds a recurring root – the country ’s property markets .
This column argues that a similar housing bubble may be developing in China .
Urgent research is needed to determine the risk of a full blown crisis .
China is experiencing spectacularly fast growth – so fast that many fear it is driven by a bubble – a property bubble to be precise .
Recent memories of what happened when the US housing market bubble burst make the possibility of a Chinese housing bubble a critical concern for the world economy .
So , is there a bubble or is it simply hot air ?
Financial bubbles are governed by something like the economic equivalent of physics Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle .
It is impossible to observe a bubble with certainty without actually altering the bubble itself .
If people knew it was a bubble , it would n't be a bubble – it would have already collapsed .
It would not , however , be impossible to envision “ diagnostic tests ” that would provide a probabilistic identification of a bubble .
Unfortunately the state of economics does not provide such a procedure ( see Flood and Hodrick 1990 for an early analysis of what would be required to determine convincingly whether or not a speculative bubble exists ) .
The problem is particularly acute in the case of Chinese housing .
Data limitations arise from the fact that there was no real private market in land or housing units in China until the late 1990s , so it is only possible to compare current conditions to little more than a decade of previous data .
It is not hard to find highly respected professional investors with opinions on both sides of the question over China ’s bubble ( see the article by Barboza 2010 in The New York Times for a discussion ) .
New evidence on a Chinese housing bubble
Our look at the available data strongly suggests that prices are quite risky at current levels , and that it would take little more than a modest decline in expected appreciation to engender sharp drops in prices .
The first foundation of this conclusion is that home prices in China are at their all time highs , and have been appreciating at especially high rates recently .
This is documented in Figure 1 which plots real and nominal price indexes developed at the Tsinghua University for newly constructed homes in 35 major cities .
Real prices more than doubled over the past decade , with appreciation rates escalating at the beginning of 2007 and then again in early 2009 .
The most recent data show a record 41 % ( annualized ) growth rate for the first quarter of 2010 .

The underlying data source is the Institute of Real Estate Studies , Tsinghua University .
See the discussion in Wu , Gyourko and Deng ( 2010 ) for more on how these indexes are created .
But it was not high price levels alone that convinced Case and Shiller ( 2003 ) and Shiller ( 2005 ) that US house prices had become unsustainable – it was the all - time high price - to - rent and price - to - income ratios .
Information on price - to - rent ratios is less widely available for Chinese markets .
Figure 2 plots them since early 2007 for eight major Chinese cities .
Price - to - income ratios are then plotted in Figure 3 for these same markets , using data back to 1999 .
For those unfamiliar with these markets , they are listed on the map in Figure 4 .
Each is among the largest markets in China , with none having a population below 8 million .
Price - to - rent ratios have increased by at least 30 % over the past 3 or so years in each of these cities .
The jump was very large in Beijing , rising by almost three - quarters from 26.4 in 2007 to 45.9 in the first quarter of 2010 .
Hangzhou , Shanghai and Shenzhen also have seen their price - to - rent ratios rise sharply to over 40 .
Even though income growth has been strong in urban China , price - to - income ratios also have been increasing in these same markets .
Income growth did keep pace with house price appreciation in the other large markets , so housing has not become less affordable everywhere , according to this metric .

Chinese government data indicate that these price rises are underpinned by rapidly escalating land values .
Because the Chinese government still owns all the land in urban areas and leases its use for long periods of time , we can observe land prices independently from home sales ( which include the land plus the structure ) .
We collected data on all the residential land parcel auctions in Beijing dating back to Q1 2003 , and created a constant quality price index for Beijing residential land , controlling for a number of location and site quality variables that are described in Wu et al. ( 2010 ) .
Figure 5 shows that real , constant quality land values increased by over 750 % since 2003 in the Chinese capital , with more than half of that rise occurring over the past two years .
Additional regression analysis showed that state - owned enterprises controlled by the central government played a meaningful role in this increase , as prices were 27 % higher on the parcels they won at auction compared to otherwise equivalent land sites purchased by other investors .

Suspicions if not proof
While it is impossible to conduct a formal test of whether there is any fundamental mispricing in Chinese land and housing markets with these limited data , there certainly is much to make one more than a little suspicious that prices are unsustainable .
The magnitude of the increase in land values over the past 2 - 3 years in Beijing is , to our knowledge , unprecedented .
These increases post - date the Summer Olympics and the recent price surge in early 2010 suggests a relationship to the Chinese stimulus package which itself is temporary .
The role of state - owned enterprises also is potentially worrisome .
It could be that these entities are superior investors and are purchasing sites that are of especially high quality in ways that we cannot control for in our empirical analysis .
However , it also could be that moral hazard is at work here , as these entities are thought to have access to low cost capital from state - owned banks and may believe they are too big to fail .
If this is the driving force , then prices are being bid up as one arm of the government buys from another .
More broadly , the sharp rises in price - to - rent ratios in Beijing and the other large markets look to be very difficult to explain fundamentally .
Most true fundamentals just do not change so discretely or in such magnitudes as to be able to explain these changes .
The standard economic model of home valuation indicates that owners must be expecting very high rates of price appreciation for these price - to - rent ratios to be sustainable .
That people might believe in such high appreciation is not incredible given the recent history of Chinese house prices .
However , this sort of backward looking expectation formation is a classic element of bubble psychology .
Moreover that history is quite limited and tells us that prices never go up forever – much less at the extremely high rates experienced over the past few years .
What happens if the bubble bursts ?
To provide some insight into just how risky prices and price - to - rent ratios are at these levels , we calculated what would happen if people began to expect that their homes would grow in value by only 4 % per year .
For Beijing , prices would fall by over 40 % , absent offsetting rent increases or other countervailing factors .
While a 4 % rate of appreciation is lower than what has been experienced in the capital city over the past few quarters , house prices did grow by less than that for five consecutive years from 1999 - 2003 .
Indeed , 4 % is not an especially low rate of appreciation in the broad scheme of things .
If it were to continue for a decade , prices would be 48 % higher ; over 20 years , prices would more than double ( +119 % ) .
Reinhart and Rogoff ’s recent study of financial crises often finds the genesis in the country ’s property markets ( see Reinhart 2008 on this site ) .
Recent data indicate there is reason to suspect a similar predicament in China ’s housing sector .
Whether it leads to a full blown crisis is another matter , of course , that depends upon the amount of leverage in the system and the safety and soundness of the regulatory environment , among other factors .
Those clearly are matters in need of urgent research if we are to fully understand the potential fallout from a meaningful drop in Chinese house prices .

Israel joined Egypt today in easing the blockade of the Gaza Strip amid ongoing international anger over its killing of nine Turkish citizens in a raid on a flotilla seeking to bring aid to Gaza earlier this month .
Israel removed cookies , soda , canned fruit , and other snack foods from the list of goods barred from entry into the impoverished territory , though it maintained its ban on imports of cement and other building materials that Gazans and international aid groups say the territory needs to recover from the pounding it took in Israel 's 2008 - 2009 offensive , which left much of the infrastructure in ruins and destroyed hundreds of homes .
Israeli officials said the easing had nothing to do with the controversial raid on the flotilla , which prompted dozens of governments to call for an end to an economic blockade that has pushed Gazan unemployment above 40 percent .
But it follows a similar symbolic easing by Egypt , Israel 's partner in the blockade of Gaza and its Islamist Hamas government .
IN PICTURES : The Gaza flotilla and the aftermath of the Israeli naval raid and Palestinian smugglers on the Egypt Gaza border
Egypt reopened the Rafah crossing with Gaza last week to a select group of individuals , either Palestinians with medical conditions that can't be treated at home or those with enough clout to wrangle a pass to get through .
The view from Rafah now is a lens onto complicated internal politics and economic contradictions in Gaza , where most people live in deep poverty but many are prospering .
An " open " Gaza border may conjure images of thousands of people rushing to escape the densely populated strip where , according to Amnesty International , 80 percent of the population depends on external aid for survival .
But in the stifling midday heat on a recent day , the Rafah crossing was quiet , save an occasional family carrying suitcases into Egypt or a pickup truck laden with household appliances headed for Gaza .
Only 200 people have been entering Egypt daily since the border opened , according to press reports .
Tough to get out
This may be due to the difficulty in leaving the Strip .
On the Egyptian side , most Gazans said they had waited between five and 10 hours to exit and many said it was their third or fourth attempt since the border opened last week .
" Those with connections [ to Hamas ] can get out , " said a woman who had been trying to leave Gaza for three days .
" For those of us without , it 's more difficult . "
She was on her way to Cairo to reunite with family members for the first time in 20 years .
A roughly equal number of people were entering ( or re-entering ) Gaza , most of them carrying goods into the territory : washing machines , gas stoves , plastic chairs , foam mats , refrigerators , bicycles with training wheels , and flat screen TVs .
Conspicuously absent , however , was any sign of the humanitarian aid that the United Nations and human rights groups have said Gazans desperately need .
Orange Ministry of Health ambulances sporadically entered Egypt en route to Cairo hospitals with sick Palestinians .
Three Toyota Rav 4s marked with Red Crescent signs exited Egypt .
Though Egypt is allowing returning Gazans to take what they can carry , it does n't allow the proper import of goods into Gaza .
Not far from this official border crossing , smuggling tunnels dot the countryside – both a vital lifeline for many Gazans and the foundation of new fortunes , as well as an important source of tax revenue for Hamas .
Egypt is building a new border fence it says will extend up to 100 feet underground to foil the tunnels .
But while Israel says Gaza 's humanitarian travails are exaggerated , UN and other humanitarian aid organizations say living standards have steadily eroded during the blockade , which has been strictly enforced since Hamas won a brief civil war for control of the territory with the rival Fatah party in 2007 .
Healthcare
Take healthcare , which Israel 's actions today do n't address .
Israel allows a flow of drugs into the territory , though distribution is often disrupted and temporary shortages occur .
But Tony Laurance , head of the World Health Organization 's office for the West Bank and Gaza , says that hundreds of pieces of medical equipment have been held up on the Israel side of the border for almost a year , and that 's putting lives at risk .
" So far as health services are concerned , what we ’re concerned with is the declining quality of care available primarily because of the blockade , " he says .
Mr. Laurance says many of the " essential tools " of the medical profession are no longer available in Gaza .
For instance , Israel bans the import of uninterrupted power supply systems , arguing that their batteries could be used to make bombs .
But that means when Gaza 's power goes out , as it frequently does , medical equipment stops running , and its shelf - life is reduced by frequent power shortages .
" You ’ve got a declining dilapidated infrastructure where nothing of any consequence has been done for the past three years , " he says .
He points to Gaza 's second - largest hospital , where only one of three elevators is working because of a ban on importing spare parts , and where most of the sterilizers for surgical equipment are n't working for the same reason .
Though Israel has explained that some of the items on its banned list are because of fear they could be used in weapons , " Very often we are n't given any reason at all . "
Border scene
As Gazans arrived at the border carrying suitcases , they were swarmed by local children hoping to load their bags into taxis in exchange for a few cents .
Many of the Palestinians looked well fed and well dressed .
One woman , surrounded by her four children , carried some of her belongings in a sack that used to contain grain , bearing the words " Palestine Refugees : For Immediate Distribution . "
Some said they were headed for Cairo Airport , others to cities throughout Egypt .
When asked if he was on his way to the hospital , an elderly wheelchair - bound man with no teeth answered somewhat indignantly , " no " ; he was going to visit family in a village fives minutes away .
The scene at the edge of Egypt , surrounded by peach orchards , is mostly silent .
An Israeli observation jet occasionally booms overhead , and five times a day the call to prayer echoes from both Egypt and Gaza .
It is easy to imagine what a closed border looks like .

Jerusalem ( CNN ) -- Israeli navy commando soldiers who boarded a Gaza - bound aid flotilla on May 31 , resulting in violence between troops and activists that left nine Turks dead , " operated properly , with professionalism , bravery and resourcefulness " and " exhibited correct decision making , " according to an Israeli army review of the incident released Monday .
" The use of live fire was justified and the entire operation is estimable , " the statement said .
The review was conducted by a team of experts , and their conclusions were presented Monday , the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement .
The flotilla incident provides an opportunity to learn for future missions , said Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi , Israel Defense Forces ' chief of the general staff , in a second statement .
" The IDF is confident enough to critically examine itself and improve based on the conclusions , " Ashkenazi said .
While no failures or negligence were found , " nonetheless , an examination as thorough as this brings up mistakes which must be corrected for future incidents . "
" Not all possible intelligence - gathering methods were fully implemented " during the flotilla operation , the experts found , and naval and Israeli defense intelligence had insufficient coordination .
However , it was uncertain that even " an optimal intelligence effort " would have resulted in a complete intelligence picture , the statement said .
" The team also pointed out that the anticipated level of violence used against the forces was underestimated , " and no plans were formulated in the event of " more dangerous scenarios , " according to the IDF .
Israel has maintained its troops used force on the activists after they were attacked by those on board one boat in the flotilla , the Mavi Marmara .
Soldiers were attacked with knives , metal poles and other objects , Israeli officials have said .
But passengers on board the boat insist they were fired upon without provocation .
The incident left a wide - ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the Jewish state and Turkey , its powerful regional ally , badly shaken and drew international outrage .
The Israeli Commission of Inquiry also is conducting an ongoing investigation into the incident and is not expected to complete it for some time .
Maj . Gen. Giora Eiland , who headed the army team of experts conducting the review , said in his summary the flotilla raid " should be viewed with perspective " and " the damage caused to Israel is not as severe as it seemed following the incident , " the statement said .
" In this inquiry we found that there were some professional mistakes regarding both the intelligence and the decision - making process in some of the operational mistakes , " Eiland said .
" But also we did find some very positive findings , and one of them that should be emphasized is the very professional and courageous way that the Israeli commandos behaved on this ship . "
The army review experts found that decision makers , on the day of the incident , were not presented with alternative courses of action other than " a full boarding of the flotilla . "
" The team emphasized the fact that as far is currently known , no country in the world holds the ability to stop a vessel at sea in a non-hostile manner , " the statement said , despite " unfounded and irresponsible " comments made after the incident took place .
But , the experts pointed out , alternatives other than boarding the flotilla might have been available , given enough advance preparation .
Media relations preparations in advance of the operation were satisfactory , the statement said , " However , the release of press statements and visual materials was delayed due to the need to maintain reliability , the obligation to notify the families of the critically injured soldiers and the long authorization process at the levels above the IDF Spokesperson Unit . "
Better coordination is needed between the defense forces , the Foreign Ministry and other foreign affairs institutions , the experts found .
And the presence of the Israeli navy commander during the operation " proved effective in terms of the decision making process , saving lives and more . "
" We continue to send our soldiers every day , in the air , on land and at sea , to missions much more dangerous than this flotilla , " Ashkenazi said . " ... I would n't want commanders and soldiers to embark on missions much more complicated and dangerous , knowing that back on land , or past the border at home , there waits an investigation committee .
Therefore , the centrality of the examination , its thoroughness and quality , are a central method in our military culture . "
" I just want to say how flattered I was in the last election to be introduced as the best Republican in the Democratic Party , " she told several hundred civic leaders at the downtown Los Angeles meeting .
" I accept . "
I 've known Marcy Winograd since 2005 .
There 's little doubt in my mind that if she 's elected to Congress Tuesday she 'll catapult immediately into the prominence of being among the half dozen best members .
Best ?
Well , best in terms of serving the interests of working families and best in terms of pushing forward powerful ideas that drag the hidebound system away from the status quo and away from the narrow machinations of lobbyists and powerful corporate interests .
Just that .
She 'll always be controversial and never really fit in with the go - along - to - get - along crew .
But one thing we do n't need is another one of 435 cutout congressional clowns .
Marcy will never be one of those .
I guarantee it .
And how bad is Jane Harman ?
If you 've been readingwith any frequency , you already know she 's always been the worst kind of corporate shill , consistently voting -- and , more important , working behind the scenes -- against the interests of working families and pushing a Big Business agenda .
When she said , unaware of the age of 24/7 news coverage , that she 's really a Republican at heart , she had no idea it would come back to haunt her .
Her aisle crossing vote , for example , in favor of the draconian , anti-consumer bankruptcy bill that has forced so many families on CA - 36 out of their homes is one thing .
But it is hard for many people to understand , even though every single Republican voted for something the banks and credit card companies were clamoring for -- and paying congressmen to support -- while most Democrats opposed it .
This documented statement by Harman , however , which she desperately tries claiming never happened ( like the espionage phone call she was taped in the midst of ) , is easy to understand :
She now imperiously denies having ever said it .
It is n't the only time she 's been caught in a lie like that .
In fact this one that Rachel Maddow caught is far more serious .
How serious ?
Jane Harman should n't be running for reelection .
She should be in federal prison .

US officials reacted angrily today at the inclusion of Israel ’s nuclear arsenal as a topic of discussion for the IAEA meeting , insisting that it was “ untimely and uncalled for . ”
The meeting is the first IAEA meeting to oficially mention Israel since 1991 , and included several Arab nations urging Israel to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ( NPT ) .
Israel has repeatedly and angrily refused to be a part of the treaty or to submit its arsenal to any international oversight .
The discussion led to a pointed exchange between US and Iranian delegates , ending with US envoy Glyn Davies claiming that the inclusion of Israel ’s nuclear weapons as a topic of discussion was a plot by Iran to “ take the heat off ” US pressure against their civilian nuclear program .
Davies added that the mere mentioning of Israel will harm the push for the nuclear - free Middle East , which the US at least nominally supports .
Israel is the only nation in the Middle East that is a non-signatory of the NPT , and is also the only nation in the region with a nuclear arsenal .
A 2012 NPT Conference has been set up to discuss how to achieve a nuclear free Middle East .
The IAEA has also asked for international help in convincing Israel to join the NPT .
Happy Anniversary Video Watchdog !
Video Watchdog # 1 June , 1990 .
I was a child of the Famous Monsters of Filmland generation .
A late arrival granted but I still spent the majority of the 1970�s thumbing through my dog eared copies of this B & W treasure trove as a supplement to watching the movies it showcased on broadcast television .
In 1979 , on a routine supply run with my mother to the Pantry Pride grocery store , I discovered the premier issue of Fangoria on their magazine rack .
Through its lurid pages , many in gore soaked color , I discovered a whole subset of the horror genre that had previously eluded me and my fascination with the works of directors like Herschel Gordon Lewis , Ted V. Mikels , Ray Dennis Steckler , and many others was born .
Then in 1990 , while visiting a small comic book store in Leesburg , I found the third and final entry in my movie magazine trinity .
This was the one that tied everything that came before it together and blasted off into the future , Video Watchdog .
In the eleven years between to introductions of Fangoria and Video Watchdog , a fascinating phenomenon had completely revamped the playing field for monster movie lovers like me .
The rise of home video that began in the early 80�s was now in full swing and film fans wielded the previously unimaginable power of being able to watch a wide variety of their favorite films and catch some obscure new ones any time they pleased .
We could even own them if we wanted although that was generally cost prohibitive in the early years .
That �s where a magazine like Video Watchdog , subtitled The Perfectionist�s Guide To Fantastic Video would prove invaluable .
The early graphics left much to be desired but the information was great !
In 1990 , personal computers were still a rarity and the Internet was some vague concept the average person knew almost nothing about .
A fright fan�s resources were extremely limited .
Periodicals like Castle of Frankenstein had attempted to compile lists of horror and science fiction movies but the task proved almost impossible .
Book�s like Michael Weldon�s recently ( 1987 ) published Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film had proven to be must haves on the bookshelf of any self respecting lover of creepy cinema but no matter how well researched these terror tomes were , they were outdated as soon as they were printed .
The home video market was an unwieldy beast on its best day and fans needed something more dynamic that could keep up with its ever changing faces .
As it turned out , Tim Lucas and his wife Donna gave horror film aficionados everywhere exactly what they had been burning torches for !
Lucas had been developing the concept that would eventually become Video Watchdog magazine with a similarly titled column in the pages of Fangoria�s off shoot publication , Gorezone .
Many of the films that were becoming readily available to the ravenous home video market warranted more than single paragraph synopsis to educate and inform fans on their merits and detractions .
With the help of his wife and friends with a similar interest in venting their obsessions for fantastic film , the first issue of Video Watchdog was born and it wasted little time crawling onto the shelves of specialty shops .
Following an increasingly irregular inoculation of Creature Feature that fateful Saturday , I hoped in my car and headed south from Ocala to the little town of Leesburg , Florida about thirty minutes away .
It was an enjoyable ride on a sunny Saturday and since my hometown was somewhat lacking in resources to feed my interest in comic books that had recently been rekindled in college , this was my closest outlet .
I discovered the little hole in the wall shop , the name of which , if it ever in had one besides � Comics� , eludes me , several months earlier .
Todd , the proprietor , was happy to get my business and did everything he could within reason to help me stretch my comic dollar .
As I stood at the counter that day haggling over prices , a small publication on the new issues shelf caught my eye .
It was only slightly larger than a TV Guide and had an intriguing cover photo of an oddly attractive female zombie rising from the water .
I asked Todd about it and he said it was a new magazine his distributor had shipped him a single issue of as a trial and beyond that he had not even opened it .
I had no reservations about opening the issue and it didn�t take flipping through more than a few pages before it landed squarely on top of my purchase stack for that day .
20 years later - Video Watchdog # 157 June , 2010 .
The premier issue of Video Watchdog was a banquet for an information starved film fanatic like me .
For my four dollars and fifty cents , I learned who filmmaker Jesse Franco was , the real deal behind the film that provided the cover photo - Carnival of Souls , and the different ratios films could be broadcast and transferred in .
There were also reviews for videos of movies I had always wanted to see and many I had never heard of before .
If that wasn�t enough to justify my cash outlay , there was also information on movies that had been dubiously retitled on home video and pages of trivia and lore on the types of films I loved .
Needless to say , I was hooked from day one !
For reasons lost to time , I did not subscribe to Video Watchdog immediately .
I suppose I was content that it would be their on my comic store�s shelf whenever I went in so the need to prepay in advance was negated .
I quickly learned after a few early issues were printed in limited runs and my competition on the shelves began to increase , that home delivery was the only way to go and this is one of the few magazines , equaled only by Fangoria , which still follows me around to this very day .
Over the years I spent many an afternoon or evening devouring the pages of this publication after leaving a trail of manila envelope shards between my mailbox and the front door .
My ceaseless fascination with fantastic films has been nurtured and expanded by the information within its pages and I have watched in satisfaction as it grew in popularity and eventually found its way onto the shelves of national bookstore chains .
Today , one hundred and fifty - six issues later , Video Watchdog is now full color and far more stylized than its modest beginnings .
Many writers have come and gone , the VHS and laserdisc formats that filled it�s early pages are now antiquated , and the focus has shifted to a much more global one as more and more products become available every day .
Surprisingly , the one constant in the magazine , aside from Tim and Donna Lucas�s tireless efforts and personal touches , is the size .
Video Watchdog is still the little magazine crammed full of information from cover to cover .
It is an honor to congratulate them on twenty years spent entertaining and informing film fans everywhere and to wish them another double decade of success !

Rescue workers continued Tuesday to search the Superstition Mountains in triple - digit heat for three Utah men who went missing while looking for the stuff of legend .
Lost Dutchman Park
Families of the missing said the men planned to search the mountain range for the fabled Lost Dutchman Mine that , according to folklore , was discovered by an Old West prospector somewhere in the wilderness east of Apache Junction in the latter 1800s .
A look back : 2 missing hikers found in Superstitions
Curtis Merworth , 48 , Ardean Charles , 67 , and Malcolm Meeks , 51 , have been in that wilderness since at least Sunday , when they were reported missing .
Their vehicle � a silver , Saturn VUE hybrid with Utah plates � remains parked at the First Water Trailhead , a staging area at the end of three miles of winding , unpaved road off Arizona 88 .
Authorities think it has been there for days , possibly longer ; family members last heard from the trio July 6 .
Up to five helicopters , 20 law enforcement personnel and 100 volunteers , some on horseback or with canines , have aided in the search and rescue mission .
A search coordinator said rescue workers have covered more than 100 miles on foot , both from the trailhead and from helicopter drop - off points .
The search area extends to nearly the horizon , one official said .
No one knows where or how far the men planned to go .
Taped onto a board outside the command center were photos of the missing and physical descriptions .
It also said that authorities did n't know what type or color of clothing the men were wearing or whether they had provisions .
Officials think the men may not have had enough food or water , considering they planned to stay in a hotel and hike the area by day .
Sgt. Jesse Spurgin of the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office , which is leading the effort , said rescuers are " still under the assumption these gentleman are alive and still hoping to find them in at least fairly good health . "
Mesa Mounted Posse volunteer David Salerno does n't share his optimism .
Salerno and his horse , Geronimo , searched an area where footprints were located on Monday but found no sign of the hikers .
" There 's only a couple of places with water out here .
You 've got to be prepared , " he said .
" If they knew where they were going , if they had a plan , nobody knew about it . "
It might not have the Iroquois , but the World Lacrosse Championship does have the sneaky Japanese ... What do you mean , ' racial stereotype ? '
It 's the hidden ball trick !
That 's sneaky !

Legendary goalkeeper Dominik Hasek signed a one year deal in the KHL with Spartak Moscow .
“ I ’m happy to be in Moscow .
I think that the both sides will benefit from this agreement , ” said Hasek to Rossiya - 2 .
His salary is reported to be around $ 600,000 .
“ I know what Hasek is capable of .
We did not sign a jersey with his name , we signed Hasek himself , ” said Spartak ’s head coach Milos Riha to Rossiya - 2 .
Hasek , 45 , has recently won the Czech Extraliga champions title with Pardubice .
The Dominator , who has two Stanley Cups and six Vezina Trophies under his belt , will soon join Spartak in order to prepare for the 2010 - 11 season .
PAINTERS ARE at significantly increased risk of developing bladder cancer and the danger increases the longer a person works in the trade , a new study has found .
The research , published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine , is based on almost 3,000 cases of the disease in professional painters reported in 41 separate studies .
The study found that plasterers , glaziers , wallpaper hangers , artists and decorators were exposed to the same risk .
Author of the study , Dr Neela Guha , said the risk arises not solely from exposure to paint but to factors that can occur in the environment in which painters work , such as the stripping of old paintwork , sanding or exposure to asbestos .
The study also found that those who had worked in such roles for more than 10 years were more likely to develop bladder cancer than those who had been doing so for less than that time .
The International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) has estimated that bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer worldwide and accounts for 130,000 deaths annually .
While smoking is a key risk , the authors of the study found that after taking tobacco use into account , painters were still 30 per cent more likely to develop bladder cancer than the general population .
The findings are the result of bladder cancer studies carried out from the 1950s to the 1990s .
Dr Guha said that while harmful chemicals like benzene and lead had been reduced or removed from paints in developed countries , it was too soon to say whether new , “ greener ” paints would reduce the risk of bladder cancer as the disease takes between 10 and 50 years to develop .
Dr Guha advised those working in high - risk environments to wear gloves and keep skin covered , to wear a mask or respirator , not to eat in the area and to ensure the buildings were well ventilated .

Rabindranath Tagore " A mind all logic is like a knife all blade : it makes the hand bleed that wields it . "
A Straw Vulcan is a straw man that is used to show that emotion is better than logic .
It starts by having characters who think " logically " try to solve a problem - and they can't .
Either they can't find any answer , or they 're caught in some kind of standoff , or every answer they can think of has some tradeoff that 's unacceptable to the other characters , or they 're even stuck in a Logic Bomb - type loop .
Once this is established , someone who uses good old human emotion comes up with a solution that the logical thinker can't .
This provides An Aesop that emotion is superior and that the logical thinker should n't trust logic so much .

Fiction often gets the concept of logic wrong in a number of ways .
The most common mistake is to assume that logic and emotion are somehow naturally opposed and that employing one means you can't have the other note
For some more information , see Somatic marker hypothesis .
While there are criticisms , the hypothesis makes the case of emotion being a bigger foundation of rational decision making that one may think .
Excluding emotion does n't make your reasoning logical , however , and it certainly does n't cause your answer to be automatically true .
Likewise , an emotional response does n't preclude logical thinking — although it may prevent you from thinking in the first place — and if a plan someone defended for emotional reasons is successful , that does n't make logic somehow wrong .
The word " emotion " is often used here in places where " intuition " or " instinct " might be more accurate : i.e. , instances where the subconscious mind reaches a correct answer faster than the conscious mind can perform a step - by - step reasoned analysis ( such as , " Run ! " or " Shoot ! " or " I get a trustworthy vibe from this stranger , " ) ; or feats of lateral thinking that involve bypassing the sort of rigid categorization systems that western philosophy traditionally favors .
This sort of thing is a perfectly legitimate dichotomy , but the issue is rarely described this way , instead calling it " logic vs. emotion , " which is probably less accurate .

Because the writers are more concerned with setting up their straw man than in handling logic correctly , they will often misuse and distort the concept to create contrived examples where what they 're calling " logic " does n't work .
Common situations include :
Note that the application of some of these does not inherently make a character a Straw Vulcan .
If a logical thinker finds it difficult to predict the actions of irrational people , and it is portrayed as a character flaw or limitation , then it is not this trope .
It is only this trope if this is treated as a problem of logical thinking itself , rather than as a character specific problem .
This trope was explored ( and TV Tropes namechecked ) in a speech by Julia Galef at Skepticon 4 in 2011 .
See Dumb Is Good , Logical Fallacies , Giving Up on Logic , Simpleminded Wisdom , Do n't Think , Feel , and Measuring the Marigolds .

The existence of this character means that the writer falls on the Romanticist side of Romanticism Versus Enlightenment .
Contrast to Emotions vs. Stoicism .
Opposite trope to Strawman Emotional .

Anime & Manga
Comedy
On The Album of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the Film of Monty Python and the Holy Grail , a logician starts out pointing out incongruities in the witch - burning scene before he goes off on a tangent about his sexually unsatisfied wife .
He finishes with the unproven conclusion that sex is more fun than logic .
Comic Books
In Logicomix , Ferge is totally honest and devoted to truth & logic .
Sadly , this devotion combined with Ignorant of Their Own Ignorance leads to Black and White Insanity in the form of a Straw Vulcan despise for women and jews .
On the whole , this make him a Troubled Sympathetic Bigot who is desperately trying to do the right thing .
One of Brainiac 5's roles in the Legion of Super - Heroes is to be a Straw Vulcan for the more emotional superheroes , like Dream Girl and Bouncing Boy .
Transformers : Oddly enough , averted in the comics with regard to Shockwave .
Shockwave is a cold , calculating Decepticon warrior who embraces pure logic ... but his definition of logic is , in fact correct - " the course of action with the highest possibility of victory . "
In the old Marvel Transformers comics , he once ceded leadership of the Decepticons to Megatron , convinced that Megatron 's logic was superior .
In IDW 's early comics , the trope is played with when he 's confronted with the raw , animal fury of the Dynobots ( known in most other continuities as the Dinobots ) ; his usual cold , calculating strategy was unable to stand up against their savage assault , and he decides to think like the enemy ... and goes berserk simply to match their brutality pound - for - pound , allowing an emotion to become a factor in his logic .
That emotion was rage , and it served Shockwave well , winning him the fight .
An unforeseen weapon on the Dynobots ' ship incapacitated him by causing a volcanic eruption once he'd switched off his anger program , but note that he gave in to emotion simply because it was logical to leave cold reasoning behind and embrace fury .
Prowl plays the trope in a more straight - forward way .
He is logical to a fault .
This is presented like something good , since he is one of the best Autobot tacticians ... and like something bad , since Prowl is downright unable to stand illogical things or let himself deal with their existence .
He is capable of staying paralyzed in the heat of a battle as he tries making sense out of whatever has got him perplexed .
The Autobot 's first bout against the Decepticons in the Marvel comics is a good example of it .
As the Decepticons were shooting at them and its squad was scrambling around , Prowl remained still as he tried to understand why the nearby cars ( they were in a parking ) were not running away .
The Guardians of the Universe have been made into Straw Vulcans more and more with each writer .
They did always have a stoic and cold sense to them , but recent story arcs put great emphasis on their hatred of all emotion , even from those within their own Corps , all while they become less competent and trustworthy .
In the Blackest Night Crisis Crossover one of the Guardians , when asked why his people chose to defend the cosmos , replied " I do n't remember , " in spite of their motivations having been well - established for some time .
The conclusion to the very first Dan Dare story was based on this trope .
The logical Treens of North Venus had long ago destroyed their beasts of burden which they regarded as useless in a mechanical age .
Then they ended up at war with the equally advanced Therons of the South , and each side rendered all the other 's weapons useless .
Stalemate .
Then Dan realised that the Earth habit of enjoying things just for their own sake , such as archery , horse riding , canoeing and glider flying meant that Earth had exactly what was needed to break the deadlock .
A volley of arrows followed by a thunderous cavalry charge won the decisive battle .
Tom Strong : Averted by Quetzalcoatl - 9 , a supercomputer created by parallel - universe Aztecs .
He states straight - up that he is trusting Tom because it 's the logical thing to do ; they 're in a textbook Prisoner 's Dilemma , and trust , on average , yields slightly better results .

Averted in classic Spock fashion by T'Var in The Wrong Reflection .
She calmly decides that achieving the mission objective to get the USS Bajor into the Mirror Universe is more important than her life , and so uses her ship to block a ramming attack against the Bajor .
The other screening vessels were out of position and both ships ' weapons were damaged , so it was really the only option .
Film
Not even Robot Monster could calculate love ...
I , Robot :
An example that may or may not be an aversion :
Part of the backstory of the protagonist is that earlier in his life , a robot was faced with a choice of saving him or a young girl .
He had a 45 % chance of survival , and she had a 11 % percent chance of survival , so the robot chose to save him .
His complaint is that the wrong kind of logic was applied ; he viewed her life as being worth more than his , so , to him , she should have been saved .
This became the main reason for the protagonist 's hatred of robots .
In the commentary , the director said that the robot who saved Smith did the right thing , and that Smith was bothered by that knowledge .
V.I.K.I.'s motivations are entirely rooted in logical thought .
Sonny even comments that he can understand the logic behind the plan perfectly , " but it just seems too ... heartless . "
V.I.K.I. 's motivations are logical for her premise , it 's her premise / goal that is wrong .
She is looking to save lives at all costs , but one could argue there was a much better way to go about the coup that would n't set up an us -vs - them mentality that would encourage humans to fight to the death .
The problem is that humans want more than just personal survival .
We would rather accept small risk if it means enjoyment or a meaning in life , and would be inadvertently encouraged to die for freedom when it's an And I Must Scream world dictated by robots .
If she had started out with the premise of " I must preserve human happiness " instead of " I must preserve human life " things would have been far different .
Of course , life , unlike happiness , can be quantified , and even logic based on preserving and maximizing happiness can become something horrific when pushed to its logical conclusions .
Star Trek : Used in Star Trek ( 2009 ) ( probably as an intentional Shout - Out ) when Spock seeks to regroup with the rest of the surviving fleet , yet the seemingly invincible Narada is headed to destroy Earth ; Kirk takes the opposing emotional side , notes the Earth will be doomed while the fleet rallies , and opts to face the Narada in a head on , likely suicidal confrontation .
This time , however , Spock is captain , and outranks Kirk .
Later Kirk shows that Spock is emotionally compromised and takes command .
In both instances we are talking about the young Spock from the alternate timeline created by the Narada at the beginning of the film .
Both subverted and played out straight in Star Trek VI .
At one point Spock answers an appeal to logic from his protege Valeris by saying , " Logic , logic , logic .
Logic is the beginning of wisdom , Valeris , not the end . "
During the remainder of the film , Spock is often telling outright lies or asking crewmembers to do so ( acts that certainly go against what Vulcans traditionally consider logical ) and describing the lies as " a miscommunication " and other euphemisms ... anything but " a lie . "
But in the end , we find that for reasons she considers " logical , " Valeris has conspired to assassinate Klingon Chancellor Gorkon and frame Kirk for his murder .
When she says she does n't recall the names of her fellow conspirators , Spock asks , " A lie ? "
She replies , " A choice . "
Averted in Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , where Spock sacrifices himself by exposing himself to lethal doses of radiation to save the Enterprise , and justifies his actions on the basis of logic .
While McCoy and Kirk both hate Spock 's actions on emotional grounds , Spock 's cold logic saves the ship and is held up as one of the most awesome and heroic moments in the entire franchise .
His plan is logical , but is poorly explained .
He states " The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few , or the one " .
Considering that he was going to die anyway if he * did n't * try his plan , it 's absolutely logical for him to do so .
Note also that this quote is a basic philosophical tenet of Utilitarianism , and is * not* considered an uncontroversial , absolute truth .
Those who follow more Deontological philosophies would heartily disagree .
In the same film , Spock argues that Kirk accepting promotion is illogical ( " a waste of material " ) because he makes a better starship captain than an admiral .
In most scenarios , choosing to do what one loves over accepting a higher rank is presented as the " emotional " response .
The computer in WarGames is supposed to have mastered all sorts of game theory , without ever having realized that there could possibly be a game in which neither player could win ( until , of course at the end , they introduce it to tic - tac - toe , and have it play against itself ) .
The message is n't so much that you can't win a nuclear war , but that the correct move is not to " play the game " at all .
At least that seems to be the Aesop .
In any case , WOPPER's " logic " is sound and subverts the notion that one can rationally plan a nuclear war , so this may count as a subversion of the trope .
There IS a flaw in the use of Tic - Tac - Toe as an example : as a " solved " game there actually is a correct move for every board state , and since the first move is what directs the flow of the game the message is more like " go first and hope your opponent makes a mistake " .
.
The message is n't so much that you can't win a nuclear war , but that the correct move is not to " play the game " at all .
At least that seems to be the Aesop .

Dr. Ellie Arroway in Contact is a SETI researcher who argues that Occam's Razor makes it more likely that humans invented the idea of God rather than God creating the world without a shred of proof pointing to his existence .
During the hearing in which Ellie claimed she had a trip through the Stargate and encountered an alien ( when all the witnesses and recorded data indicates the Stargate was a complete failure and nothing happened ) , Occam 's Razor is flung back in her face : is it more likely that she hallucinated the journey or that the aliens sent her through the Stargate without leaving a shred of proof ?
Ellie concedes this but refuses to withdraw her position because her experience was too monumental for humanity 's future to dismiss on logic alone .
The kicker : the Christian philosopher whose personal religious awakening she ( politely ) dismissed as a psychological phenomenon is the first person to believe her : not because If Jesus , Then Aliens but because they 're both committed to the truth .
She ultimately continues her SETI research in hopes of finding more signs of extra- terrestrial life , proving that ( at least where aliens are concerned ) faith and logic can coexist .

Scarlett in GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra : ( " Emotions are not based in science .

The Phantom Menace : Qui -Gon 's actions on Tatooine .
Supposedly , the mystical and mysterious Force leads him to bet everything on the performance of an unknown boy in a dangerous pod race — a convoluted gambit that only a fellow Jedi can understand .
The truth is much simpler : the situation is so dire ( marooned on a remote planet with no comm , no FTL drive , no money to repair it , no ability to use a Jedi Mind Trick on the one person who has a replacement drive , a moral code that wo n't let him steal it , and a high degree of urgency ) that the strange bet is the best available option .
Fridge Logic : Qui-Gon would rather pretend that he 's being guided by the ineffable , infallible Force than admit to Queen Amidala that he 's making a desperate gamble because he 's run out of alternatives .
He also neglects the obvious path of trading the disabled ship for a smaller working one , or just finding someone willing to do a currency exchange .
Delacourt from Elysium , though she 's a crafty enough operator that she has no problem invoking emotion to make a point .
But the slightly - robotic way she does it ( and everything else , for that matter ) indicates that she probably does n't actually feel it , but is simply just that bigoted .
The Mist : Norton and his group of skeptics who leave the store because they do n't believe there are any monsters in the mist .
Lets back up a step .
If the skeptics are right about the mist being natural and stay in the store then the weather will blow over in a few hours to a day or someone will come by looking for the grocery store and update them on the situation .
They are on their way after a short delay , at most a major inconvenience , or loss of jobs or other personal commitments .
If the other groups are right about the mist and there are monsters outside the best bet for survival is not to go outside to be picked off by monsters .
The risk analysis of the situation , however low the probability of lethal monsters , would point to staying in the well stocked grocery store and not wandering off .
So of course they choose the ' rational choice ' after concluding there are no monsters and immediately decide to leave .
Norton tells
David right before he leaves that if he 's wrong the joke will be on him .
Poor decision or not , he is at least willing to admit that much .
In the novella , David thinks that Norton is , at some level , committing deliberate suicide .
It 's worth noting other characters also choose to enter the mist early and end up surviving , and better - of than those who chose to to remain .

Morrigan from Dragon Age : Origins has this role in your party .
The most striking example being her objection to help out with the situation in Redcliffe , because it presents a huge delay in your quest to stop the Darkspawn , despite the fact that helping them would get the Grey Wardens some crucial allies for their fight against the Darkspawn .
It turns out later that she was deliberately conditioned to not want to help people while growing up , and her arguments are rationalizations .
Racter from Shadowrun : Hong Kong firmly believes that humanity can only reach true transcendence via complete cyberization .
This is in the face of the fact that cybernetics in the Shadowrun universe are known to literally eat your soul and have in the past turned people who put a bit too many cybernetics into themselves into crazed , emotionless psychopaths , but Racter actually believes that emotions are what is holding humanity back from transcendence anyways .
Racter himself is half cybernetic , but he does n't experience the side effects ( or so he says ) because he was already diagnosed with sociopathy as a young child .
Thus , his belief is that the one thing that prevents humanity from reaching its true potential is its capacity for emotions .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- BP on Thursday stemmed the flow of its tumbling share price if not the flow of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , after saying it could n't explain why its share price plunged by 16 % in the last session of New York trade .
The oil giant BP , - 1.18 % ( BP ) , which has failed to stop a massive Gulf spill that began more than six weeks ago , got slammed in U.S. action following fresh criticism by President Barack Obama , who said he would have fired Tony Hayward by now if the BP CEO instead worked in his administration .
The plunge , taking the market capitalization reduction to $ 90 billion since the Deepwater Horizon sank , also came as several U.S. politicians called on BP to halt payment of its dividend .
See related story .
BP , making the first defense of its share price , on Thursday said it 's facing the crisis " as a strong company , " noting that until the spill , cash inflows and outflows were balanced with oil prices at $ 60 a barrel .
Oil has been trading around $ 75 a barrel of late , meaning the company 's " generating significant additional cash flow . "
Its gearing -- the ratio of net debt to equity -- also is below the bottom of BP management 's targeted range .
Plus , it has more than 18 billion barrels of proved reserves and 63 billion barrels of resources as of the end of 2009 , BP said .
" All of the above gives us significant capacity and flexibility in dealing with the cost of responding to the incident , the environmental remediation and the payment of legitimate claims , " the company said .
Its pleas did make an impact .
BP 's London - listed ( BP ) shares dropped 7 % , a fall not nearly as severe as that was seen in New York .
In opening U.S. trades on Thursday , BP shares rallied 9 % .
Sell - side analysts have largely agreed with the company that the plunge in BP 's share price has been excessive .
Two - thirds of the analysts who cover BP have buy or overweight ratings , with an average target price of $ 56.97 , according to data compiled by FactSet Research .
For the long term , " we still believe BP is undervalued and that the market is now discounting the worst case rather than most likely outcome .
We would buy the stock , realizing that near term , BP will continue to be buffeted by negative speculation , at least until it can be more informative about costs , " said analysts at Citigroup .
However , S&P Equity Research lowered BP to hold from buy , citing uncertainties swirling around the Gulf accident , political sensitivities regarding BP keeping its 2010 dividend , the costs of cleaning up , upcoming civil charges and potential U.S. government resolutions .
The overall cost of the response to date is $ 1.43 billion , BP said , a figure that includes the containment , relief well drilling , grants to the Gulf Coast states , claims paid , and federal costs .
This also includes the first $ 60 million in funds earmarked for the Louisiana barrier islands construction project .
The lower marine riser package containment cap collected 15,000 barrels of oil and 29.4 million cubic feet of natural gas on Tuesday , and in the first 12 hours of Wednesday , collected 7,920 barrels and 15.7 million cubic feet of natural gas .
Bye - bye , indeed , Miss American Pie .
If General Motors has its way , you wo n't be driving your Chevy to the levee ever again .
GM sent a memo this week to Chevrolet employees at its Detroit headquarters , promoting the importance of " consistency " for the brand , which was the nation 's best - selling line of cars and trucks for more than half a century after World War II .
And one way to present a consistent brand message , the memo suggested , is to stop saying " Chevy , " though the word is one of the world 's best - known , longest - lived product nicknames .
" We 'd ask that whether you 're talking to a dealer , reviewing dealer advertising , or speaking with friends and family , that you communicate our brand as Chevrolet moving forward , " said the memo , which was signed by Alan Batey , vice president for Chevrolet sales and service , and Jim Campbell , the GM division 's vice president for marketing .
" When you look at the most recognized brands throughout the world , such as Coke or Apple for instance , one of the things they all focus on is the consistency of their branding , " the memo said .
" Why is this consistency so important ?
The more consistent a brand becomes , the more prominent and recognizable it is with the consumer . "
Although the memo cites Coke , it does not note that Coke is shorthand for Coca - Cola -- or that Apple is not commonly used in reference to its products , which are known simply as iPads , iPhones , and MacBooks .
One expert on branding said GM 's effort ran counter to a trend in which corporate names had become more casual .
The consultant , Paul Worthington , head of strategy for Wolff Olins , a brand consulting company , noted that FedEx had replaced Federal Express , KFC had supplanted Kentucky Fried Chicken and " even RadioShack has evolved into the Shack . "
Regardless , if Chevrolet plans to puts the Chevy genie back in the bottle , the task could prove harder than climbing out of bankruptcy .
As of Wednesday night , the word Chevy appeared dozens of times on Chevrolet 's Web site , Chevrolet.com , including a banner on the home page that said , " Over 1,000 people a day switch to Chevy . "
One of the dropdown menus was " Experience Chevy . "
On Facebook , brand pages include Chevy Camaro , Chevy Silverado , and Team Chevy .
If taken to its logical conclusion , Chevrolet would presumably need to ask Jeff Gordon , the four - time Nascar Sprint Cup champion who currently races a Chevrolet Impala , to change the Web site address -- Jeffgordonchevy.com -- for his dealership in Wilmington , N.C .

And what about rolling back the popular culture references to Chevy ?
Elton John , Bob Seger , Mötley Crüe and the Beastie Boys have all sung about Chevy , and hip - hop artists rap about " Chevy Ridin ' High " or " Ridin ' in My Chevy . "
" It 's a ' Vette , it 's a Caddy , it 's a Chevy , " said Dick Guldstrand , a long - time racer who has been inducted into the Corvette Hall of Fame .
He noted that the brand was named for Louis Chevrolet , a race driver of the early 20th century .
" Once it became an American icon , America took it away from GM , " said Guldstrand , 83 .
" They made it a Chevy .
You 're doing a disservice to all the people by telling them not to call it a Chevy . "
In 2006 , Chevrolet updated a series of popular commercials with the tagline " Baseball , hot dogs , apple pie and Chevrolet , " which noted how the brand was woven into the fabric of American culture .
The commercial juxtaposed imagery of past baseball greats with modern ones .
And at the end , the narrator says , " Apparently , baseball 's changed a little over the years , but not America 's love of the game - - or love for Chevy . "
So why make the change now ?
GM was n't saying , but the memo came after several major marketing moves .
The memo was provided to The Times by the disbelieving recipient of a copy .
In April , Chevrolet dismissed its long - time ad agency , Campbell - Ewald .
The account went to Publicis USA , but only for a month before it was switched again , this time to Goodby , Silverstein & Partners .
Klaus - Peter Martin , a GM spokesman , confirmed the memo .
" We 're going to use Chevrolet instead of Chevy going forward in our communications , " he said in a telephone interview , and linked the change to the move to Goodby .
Worthington , the branding expert , said Chevrolet seemed unclear what the brand stood for .
But ultimately , he said , consumers " will call you whatever they want to call you . "
But not Chevrolet staff members .
A postscript to the memo says a sort of cuss jar - - a plastic " Chevy " can -- has been situated in the hallway .
" Every time someone uses ' Chevy ' rather than Chevrolet , " the note said , the employee is expected to put a quarter in the can .

WITHOUT PRECEDENT — EXCEPT FOR ALL THE OTHER TIMES ….
Monday is , of course , Memorial Day , and President Obama will honor the day at the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery outside Chicago , while Vice President Biden appears at Arlington National Cemetery .
This , apparently , has caused a stir in some circles .
Glenn
Beck told his minions this week that that the president “ has decided not to honor our troops on Memorial Day , ” which is n’t even close to true .
The deranged media personality , apparently referring to Obama ’s decision not to be at Arlington , added , “ Maybe this has happened before .
I do n’t recall it . ”
In reality , this is n’t especially unusual .
Obama is not the first president to miss the Arlington ceremony .
Ronald Reagan spoke at West Point one year , and went to his California ranch another year .
George H.W. Bush , a war veteran , did not go at all .
Bill Clinton , who did not serve in Vietnam and had a rocky time with the military , went to Arlington all eight years , and George W. Bush , who also avoided combat service in Vietnam , attended from 2003 onward .
Obama ’s plans , in other words , are generating some criticism , but there ’s really not much new here .
The president ’s Memorial Day schedule is a “ story , ” despite being fairly routine .
Which , as it turns out , one of the defining trends of the political discourse over the last 16 months .
Several months ago , Atrios noted , “ When Dems are president , perfectly normally ways of doing things are rebranded as somehow odd . ”
Ai n’t that the truth .
* Teleprompters :
This trend of characterizing routine developments as controversial started very early in the Obama presidency .
Every modern president has used teleprompters , but Republicans and the media thought it was hilarious and wildly important when Obama did the same thing .
* Bowing : Several presidents have been photographed bowing to foreign heads of state , but Republicans and the media thought it was absolutely scandalous when Obama did the same thing when meeting leaders where bowing is customary .
* Talking to school kids : Presidents Reagan and H.W. Bush spoke to school children in national addresses , even taking a little time to push their political agendas .
When Obama delivered a speech encouraging kids to do well in school , Republicans freaked out ; Fox News compared the president to Saddam Hussein ; and the New York Times literally ran a front - page story about it .
* Czars :
For a half - century , presidents have relied on so - called “ czars ” for various policy areas .
By one count , George W. Bush had 36 czar positions filled by 46 people during his two terms .
No one cared .
Obama ’s use of czars became the subject of months of media scrutiny , and even congressional hearings in response to Republican apoplexy .
* Oval Office attire : Several modern presidents have been seen in the Oval Office without wearing a suit jacket .
When Obama did it , Republicans ran to the press to complain , and the media actually published pieces on the subject .
* Criticizing partisan media : White House complaints about unfair media coverage are as old as the republic .
When the Obama White House noted what is plainly true about Fox News — it ’s a Republican outlet — the media went a little berserk , with the Washington Post and NPR characterizing the administration ’s criticism as “ Nixonian . ”
* Reconciliation : Republican policymakers have relied on reconciliation to get around filibusters for decades .
When Obama recommended the same tactic for health care , the GOP pretended it was an outrageous assault on the political process , and the media pretended Republicans ’ cries were legitimate .
* Industry bailouts : Government bailouts of struggling American industries and major companies have been common for decades .
When Obama rescued GM , it was used as an example of his purported desire to a communist dictator .
* Campaign intervention : Every president has had a hand in campaign activities , with several presidents offering jobs to candidates to get them out of various races .
When the Obama White House intervened in Pennsylvania ’s Democratic Senate primary — offering a House member an unpaid advisory gig — the media found it fascinating and Republicans called for the FBI and a special prosecutor to intervene .
* Memorial Day : Many presidents have not appeared at Arlington on Memorial Day .
When Obama does it , there ’s a “ controversy . ”
I ’m all in favor of holding presidents to high standards .
They have enormous power and leadership responsibilities , and it stands to reason that much will be expected of them .
I enthusiastically endorse demanding the most of our leaders .
But for a year and a half , the political world seems to have created whole new rules for Obama , which are n’t applied to others — and have n’t even been applied to other presidents .
This week ’s flaps over Sestak and Memorial Day plans only reinforce how truly ridiculous the phenomenon has become .
Nearly 50 members of Congress warn State Deptartment against rubberstamping 2,000 - mile tar sands pipeline as Obama insider John Podesta says fuel source " cannot be our energy future "
Members of Congress yesterday implored the State Department to scrutinize the " significant " environmental impacts of a proposed massive pipeline that would carry Canadian tar sands oil 2,000 miles — from northern Alberta , across U.S. states to refineries in Texas and tankers off the Gulf coast .
In a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , nearly 50 members of the House of Representatives said the agency " must determine whether the project is in the national interest " in terms of " clean energy and climate change priorities " before rubberstamping it .
Tar sands mining emits three times more greenhouse gas pollution than traditional oil , the letter stated .
Rep. Steve Cohen ( D - Tenn . ) , one of the lead signatories , further said the pipeline , which is slated to pass over the nation 's largest underground aquifer , would leave " irreparable " environmental scars in its wake .
" This poses a direct threat to America 's heartland , " Cohen told reporters .
" It cuts through sensitive ecosystems , crosses rivers , invades ranches and farms and could scar this land forever . "
TransCanada , the country 's biggest power company , has been pressing for presidential approval of its $ 12 billion Keystone XL Pipeline , which would import up to 900,000 barrels a day and double U.S. consumption of the controversial fuel source .
Two other pipelines have already been okayed by the State Department — Keystone 1 , which will eventually carry crude into Cushing , Okla . , and the Alberta Clipper that will run from Canada to Superior , Wis .
If all three get built , tar sands would make up 15 percent of U.S. fuel supply , up from four percent today .
Turning tar sands into usable oil involves mining bitumen , a tar - like petroleum that 's buried beneath the boreal forests in Alberta .
Extraction requires substantial energy and water and creates sprawling tailing ponds that some analysts estimate are leaking three million gallons of contaminated waste into the ground each day , endangering wildlife and perhaps public health .
In the case of Keystone XL , refining the sticky crude would happen in Houston , in a process that would spew higher levels of dangerous pollutants than conventional oil production , including sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , particulates and heavy metals , the House members said .
Because of that , the letter calls on Secretary Clinton to demand from the Environmental Protection Agency a " full lifecycle assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions " involved in the project from Alberta to the Texas coast .
For Now , State Department Delays
The State Department must greenlight the pipeline because it crosses an international border .
The sole criteria for approval is whether the project offers value to the national interest .
Even opponents concede that tar sands oil may have national security advantages over importing oil from Middle Eastern regimes .
And not too long ago the pipeline was seen as a done deal .
But last week , in a small sign of uncertainty , the State Department added two weeks to the public comment period on its draft environmental impact statement , pushing it from June 16 to July 2 .
The move delays approval of the project by at least two weeks .
Observers suggest the calamitous BP oil spill was likely the culprit .
In response to the delay , however , TransCanada said it is confident the project will get the go - ahead this year , allowing construction to begin in 2011 .
Still , some members of Congress are hoping the hold - up turns into cancellation .
" Endorsing tar sands pipelines is a step in the wrong direction , " Cohen said .
" It 's counter to what President Obama has stood for ... in getting us away from oil . "
Indeed , in a speech to the nation on June 15 amid the oil gusher , President Obama said " as we look to the Gulf , we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude . "
He called it " the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now . "
And while the State Department declares that tar sands pipelines advance a number of strategic interests , some influential White House insiders clearly see things differently .
Podesta a Skunk at Canadian Event
John Podesta , president of the Center for American Progress who headed the Obama transition team and is considered part of the president 's inner circle on energy , surprised an audience of tar sands supporters this week when he denounced the fuel source as " inherently dirty , " saying it " cannot be our energy future . "
In a keynote speech at an event sponsored by Canada 2020 that was designed to shore up support for " greening " the oil source , Podesta admitted he was " skeptical about the ' green ' vision for the tar sands . "
" If the ' greening ' in the title of this morning 's program was conjured up to evoke a garden party in the oil sands , I 'll try not to play the part of the skunk , " Podesta said .
However , he added bluntly : " Oil extraction from tar sands is polluting , destructive , expensive and energy - intensive .
These things are facts .
I think suggesting this process can come close to approximating being ' greened ' is largely misleading , or far too optimistic , or perhaps both .
It stands alongside clean coal and error - free deepwater drilling as more PR than reality . "
Podesta further questioned " the hurry with which the State Department has chosen to decide whether or not to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline . "
As the Gulf spill reminds us , he said , " rushing to complete oil projects invites disaster . "
Another BP Disaster Waiting to Happen
In their letter , members of Congress called the pipeline another BP oil crisis waiting to happen due to poor safety protocols that TransCanada is proposing in the design .
Most worryingly , the company has applied for a safety waiver from the Department of Transportation to use thinner steel and higher pressure in the pipeline than standard operating procedure .
Critics say this makes the line vulnerable to leaks , given the mass amounts of gooey crude that would pump through it each day .
They also claim the pipeline would not be properly monitored due to a lack of federal agency inspectors .
" That 's a scary proposition , " said Cohen .
" Just like the Deepwater situation where BP cut corners on safety , so is the situation with this XL Pipeline . "
He continued , " As oil continues to pour into the Gulf , we should take a step back and reconsider the wisdom of trusting these oil companies out to make a profit and with no thoughts about anything but oil , oil , oil . "
Making the economic case for cleaner fuels , Rep. Peter Welch ( D - Vt. ) , another signatory , said investing in clean energy and not relying on the " dirty fuels of the 19th century " is necessary to build a stronger economy .
" It 's where the jobs of the future reside , " he said .
In building the pipeline , Welch added , the State Department would be " embracing the past . "
Earlier this month , 250 members of Environmental Entrepreneurs ( E2 ) , a group of environmentally conscious business leaders that collectively manages $ 82 billion in venture capital and private equity , made a similar plea .
In a letter to Secretary Clinton , the coalition called on the State Department to suspend the permitting process for Keystone XL and rethink its long - term commitment to tar sands .
Citing a study by Goldman Sachs , the group said tar sands projects require long - term oil prices greater than $ 80 per barrel just to break even .
" Given the costs and liabilities of tar sands oil , we question whether it is in the national economic interest to diverge off the path toward clean energy by committing massive resources to a project that will prolong America 's oil dependence and greatly increase our carbon emissions , " the letter said .
In recent years , slowing tar sands oil development has climbed up the agenda in government policy discussions and in boardrooms , as carbon - intensive activities become the prime target in the fight against global warming .
In particular , the shareholder season this past spring saw an increasing number of investor revolts , including motions against oil giants BP , Shell and ExxonMobil .
While some efforts sought to get energy firms to scrap their tar sands ties completely , others aimed merely to shine a light on the financial costs of the environmental damage caused by oil sands extraction .
With pressure mounting against conventional fuels , it 's up to the U.S. government to " send the right signals " to the industry " at this point in time , " Podesta said .

The economic crisis has ushered in the end of a generation long bull market .
Most average investors ignore the fact that heavy market volatility is a sign of an unhealthy stock market .
The stock market since the lows reached in 2009 has been on an unstoppable bull run .
Yet the real economy where most Americans work and spend money has not reflected any of this irrational exuberance .
The S&P 500 has rallied 53 percent from the lows reached in early 2009 and that is including the current retracement back .
On Tuesday the stock market pulled back on data showing consumer confidence plunging from what analysts had expected .
Outside of Wall Street the economy is walking on eggshells .
If we look at S&P 500 data we find that we have entered into a new era :
The above chart highlights milestones for the S&P 500 dating back to 1968 .
For the S&P 500 to double from 100 to 200 , it took a slow 17 years .
From 200 to 400 it took 6 years , an incredibly quick jump .
Another 6 years after that and the S&P 500 was riding high at 800 .
From 1997 to 2007 the S&P 500 went from 800 to 1,576 in the intraday high that is now far in the past .
It almost doubled yet again in a 10 year horizon .
Yet that trend has been broken .
The S&P 500 is now back to 1,041 and has pulled back to levels seen in 1998 .
Does anyone really see the S&P 500 going to 2,000 any time soon ?
“ The stock market needs to reflect the underlying health and productivity of the overall economy and not simply the gambling penchant of Wall Street banks . ”
Most of America is dealing with the new austerity that is being thrust on them from an unforgiving economy and a government that seems to be preoccupied with helping out the financial industry before setting things right with the average worker .
In other words , the middle class is being thrown to the wolves in this crisis .
The government is serving the interest of big money at the detriment of the middle class .
If we look at the volatility of the S&P 500 over the past 22 years we ’ll notice two different stories .
From 1988 to 2000 , the stock market enjoyed a once in a lifetime bull run .
There were virtually no negative years and some incredible year over year gains .
Keep in mind that we are looking at a 12 year timeframe on a tiny chart but this is over a decade of mental conditioning here .
If we look from 2000 to our present day , the massive amount of volatility has sent the S&P 500 to levels seen in 1998 :
2008 was the worst stock market year since the Great Depression .
That is how bad that one year turned out for investors .
This large amount of volatility simply reflects a weak real economy and the recent stock market run to the peak of the mountain was super charged by taxpayer money going into large investment banks who in return went into the stock market and gambled your hard earned money .
Clearly it has n’t done much for consumer confidence , aiding in the foreclosure crisis , or bringing jobs back .
What then did all this money really accomplish ?
If we look at the VIX which looks at option trading volume and is a good sign of volatility we also see this recent stock market reshuffling :
What we can gather from all this volatility is a new paradigm has arrived .
Most popular financial books that hype compound interest always focus on a convenient 7 to 10 percent annualized gain in the stock market .
That may have been the case from 1968 to 2000 but that is n’t the case anymore .
What are you going to invest in when U.S. Treasuries are barely offering any interest and bank accounts are offering rates of 0.01 percent on savings accounts ?
Your mattress would rival some of these rates .
The stock market right now is one large casino .
No real reform has taken place and that is why we see no real changes in the economy yet trillions of dollars funneled into a financial abyss .
Someone got this money but clearly it was n’t the middle class .
The public was told that money was going to go to shore up the housing market ( did n’t happen ) and to keep lending to the public going ( did n’t happen ) .
So what did happen was that big investment banks used taxpayer money and gambled to bolster their own profits .
That was basically the smoke and mirrors campaign that we have gone through .
The middle class is largely a casualty of this all .
9 out of the top 10 jobs in this country are in low paying service sector work .
We hear this rhetoric about a double dip but the middle and working class never got out of the first dip to begin with .
Who is this double dip for ?
Wall Street gamblers who have funneled taxpayer money into the casino ?
Must be nice for their 53 percent rally but sadly none of that is reflected in the real economy .
If we want to be happy about gambling why not talk about the person who just won the lottery last night .
Wall Street certainly won the lottery here at the expense of the taxpayers .
The collapse of consumer confidence is merely a reflection of what most of us already know .
The real economy has never recovered .
This is the end of a generational bull run just like the 1920s came crashing down with the Great Depression .
Unlike that time , we have allowed the banks and Wall Street to continue to pollute our real economy with their gambling schemes .
Can you believe that no real reform has taken place ?
No wonder why average Americans are displeased with both political parties and are furious at Wall Street .

How Long to Take the EC Stack
Question : Hello !
I have purchased your RFL handbook about 6 months ago .
And have also been taking the ECA stack for about 5 months now .
I really just want to know how long is safe to run an ECA stack !??
I have only taken two doses a day instead of the suggested three .
this is what it looks like : 25 mg Ephedrine HCI , 200mg Caffeine , 162mg Aspirin once in the morning and another in the afternoon .
Answer : Since I appear to be officially out of ideas for things to write about ( cut me some slack , I ’ve got 500 posts on the site ) , I ’m doing another Q&A this week .
For those unfamiliar with the acronyms , RFL is my own Rapid Fat Loss Handbook and ECA is a combination of Ephedrine Caffeine and Aspirin .
I do n’t recall offhand when it really came into use but it was at least in the 90’s when it was found that the combination of ephedrine and caffeine were thermogenics ( meaning that they increase energy expenditure ) , suppressed appetite , mobilized fat and had many other potential benefits for fat loss on a diet ( other thermogenics such as green tea , capsaicin and nicotine were also studied ) .
Aspirin was sometimes added as well ( for once I ’ll spare you the mechanisms involved here ) but , outside of the obese , did n’t really have any benefit .
It was also never clear if low - dose aspirin ( 81 mg ) would have the same benefit as the full 300 mg used in the studies and honestly , if someone is going to use EC ( often just called the stack ) , I do n’t recommend the aspirin .
In any case , back to the question , how long should EC be used ?
And the answer sort of depends on your perspective .
One thing worth mentioning is this : EC is unusual ( and possibly unique ) among fat loss compounds in that chronic use actually makes it work more effectively .
I do mean that this is unusual in that most drugs lose , or at least appear to lose , their effect over time ( it ’s a little more complicated than this but I ’ll save my explanation of this statement for next week or something ) .
Ephedrine becomes more effective over time ( and the idea that it must be cycled to avoid a loss of effect is not only wrong but exactly backwards ) .
The thing is , nobody is quite sure how this might happen .
Early ideas revolved around Brown Adipose Tissue ( BAT ) and the idea that ephedrine might increase it .
But humans do n’t actually have much BAT ( we have beige / brite fat and I discussed this , along with how to impact and increase it in my Stubborn Fat Solution 1.1 Patch ) .
But the only study I ’m aware of in humans shows that , if anything , EC decreases the amounts of BAT .
So , honestly , I have no idea why EC becomes more effective with regular use .
But it does and that would tend to suggest chronic use is better .
But that still does n’t answer how long .
In addition , the side effects of the EC stack , which include things like increased heart rate , blood pressure and general stimulation decrease with regular use .
EC gets more effective and safer over time .
In that sense , it could conceivably be used forever .
On the one hand , EC is really a dieting / fat loss supplement .
It ’s effects are small but do add up and it has been shown to have the benefits I listed above during a diet as well as others .
By increasing the use of fat , it can spare the loss of skeletal muscle / LBM , for example .
As well , although it ’s overall metabolic effects are moderate ( increasing energy expenditure by 5 - 10 % ) , this helps to offset the normal diet related decreases in energy expenditure .
And in that sense , only using it until the diet period ends is sort of a logical conclusion .
It ’s a diet compound , use it while dieting .
It ’s fairly logical although we might quibble over how long a diet should actually be before taking a break .
But there ’s also another way of looking at this issue .
At the end of a diet , a host of adaptations have occurred in an attempt to facilitate fat regain .
Appetite and hunger are both up ( and people show more attention to high - calorie , high - sugar , high - fat foods ) and various components of energy expenditure are decreased along with the body being utterly primed to store fat at an accelerated rate .
There are a huge number of factors that go into this .
Leptin is down , ghrelin is up , the other hunger hormones such as CCK , PYY , etc. are decreased and this all adds up to an integrated signal to the hypothalamus that decreases thyroid output ( this is along with a decrease in conversion of inactive to active thyroid in the liver ) and decreased nervous system output .
And it ’s that last one that is relevant here .
Getting off - topic slightly , early ideas suggested that obese individuals became obese due to low sympathetic activity .
This was called the MONA LISA hypothesis which stood for Most Obesities kNown Are Low In Sympathetic Activity .
Ha ha .
But other work clearly shows that there is elevated sympathetic activity in the obese .
What may be happening is that low sympathetic activity predisposes people towards obesity and then this normalizes and then overcompensates when a person becomes obese .
Regardless .
My point being that at the end of a diet , this same type of low sympathetic nervous system activity is present .
And ephedrine and caffeine helps to offset this even after the diet is over .
That is to say that continuing to use EC past the actual duration of the diet may help weight long - term weight maintenance as it helps to offset the normal diet / fat loss generated reduction in energy expenditure ( at least through this one mechanism ) that occurs .
This assumes that it is well tolerated and effectively this is saying that EC would be a permanent part of someone ’s daily intake .
And I imagine this might concern some readers ( and I ’m not exactly suggesting this , just commenting that it is possible ) .
Clearly long - term weight maintenance is the big issue when it comes to fat loss ; everybody can lose some amount of fat .
It ’s keeping it off that is the issue ( though the often cited value of 90 - 95 % failure is completely incorrect , just for the record ) .
The post - obese body is in a state of lowered energy expenditure and increased potential fat storage ; combined with the modern environment where endless food cues promote eating , this is a real problem .
And there is increasing interest in the idea that obesity should be treated as a chronic relapsing disease .
And if long - term medication is required to prevent relapse … .
Continuous use of the EC stack at least ameliorates some of the decrease in energy expenditure .
Other compounds have also been tested here including green tea ( and caffeine ) and capsaican ( and caffeine , because caffeine makes everything better ) and it would certainly be possible to switch out EC for potentially less , what ’s a good word here , let ’s say controversial compounds .
Doses for green tea or capsaican can be found here .
As well , there are other approaches , such as increasing activity levels that can effectively accomplish the same thing .
We ’ve known for a while that exercise has its largest effect on weight maintenance ( rather than increasing total weight loss per se ) although it takes quite a bit .
And a big part of this is that by increasing exercise related energy expenditure , the other aspects of metabolic rate decrease can be offset .
This allows more food to be eaten ( critical for long - term hunger control ) without fat being gained .
Which is all a very long way of saying what I could have written in three sentences which is
Ephedrine works better with long - term use and there is no need to cycle it at a fundamental level
In one sense , ephedrine is a dieting aid and should be used during the active dieting phase Except that continuing to use ephedrine after the diet is over might help to offset some of the adaptations that occur in response to fat loss that tend to promote fat regain .
This can be accomplished through other methods such as increased activity .
Which probably does n’t really answer the original question that directly but maybe answers something ?
Cold Exposure and Calorie Burning
Question : Hello Lyle , I have came across a suggestion that if you spend most time of your day in a cold room , your body expends more energy as heat because it tries to keep a stable body temperature .
It makes a sense to me .
I would like to ask you whether is that true and if its , how big is the difference ?
It could be very small or maybe 100 - 200 kcals a day .
Thanks you for your help .
Answer :
The short answer is yes - ish but there are a few caveats ; as usual I ’ll trudge ( hopefully briefly ) through some of the physiology .
The basic idea is that , by being exposed to cold , the body has to burn calories to generate heat .
And there is truth to that .
Some of this is due to shivering but there is also the whole brown / beige / brite adipose tissue thing that may be at play here .
Many readers may remember a lot of interest in brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) a bunch of years ago .
BAT was found in animals originally and exists , roughly , to burn energy to make heat .
In contrast to normal white adipose tissue which is predominantly stored triglyceride with very few mitochondria ( the powerhouse of the cell ) , BAT had a lot of mitochondria but not a lot of stored fat .
It existed to burn fat , generating heat .
BAT and Beta - 3 Agonists
There was a huge amount of interest , drugs called beta - 3 agonists ( which worked amazingly in rats and mice ) were developed and almost immediately crapped out .
They had minimal effect in humans and any effect was short - lived .
So they were abandoned by pharmaceutical companies .
Remember this when you see some supplement company is pushing a beta - 3 agonist ; if a multi-billion dollar pharm company can’t figure this out , neither can the supplement pushers .
Obesity treatment is worth billions and pharm companies stop researching dead end drugs .
And it looked like the reason had to do with the fact that adult humans did n’t have much BAT .
Babies ( who thermoregulate poorly ) had it , a certain type of tumor ( a pheochromacytoma ) had it and folks exposed to chronic cold ( Oh I ’m a lumberjack and I ’m ok ) had more of it .
But most adult humans did n’t and researchers sort of gave up on it .
Then a few years ago , there was a huge amount of renewed interest in BAT .
Researchers looking at something else with a PET scanner and saw something they could n’t explain .
And when they looked further , it looked like BAT .
Why had n’t they seen it before ?
Because they were measuring under thermoneutral conditions originally .
In the newer research they were measuring during cold exposure .
And that ’s a big part of what turns on BAT : cold exposure .
there are others , a variety of compounds including ephedrine / caffeine , capsaican and others may activate BAT .
But as they dug deeper , something else came to light which is that this type of fat in humans may not be the same as the BAT found in animals ( explaining why the attempts to activate it did n’t work ) .
Rather , it ’s been identified as a similar but distinct type of fat that is variously called beige or brite fat
Beige and Brite Fat
Beige / brite fat is similar in function to BAT but it ’s not quite the same .
There is currently huge interest in the “ browning ” of white fat , turning normal white fat cells into this type of thermogenic fat with the hopes that it can help stave off of obesity ( and I wrote about this in some detail in my little Stubborn Fat Solution Patch 1.1 along with some pharmaceutical approaches to at least increasing the amount of beige / brite fat ) .
It ’s still questionable how much of an impact this will actually have , though .
One recent study compared either ephedrine / caffeine or a day ’s worth of cold exposure ; ephedrine increased daily energy expenditure by 140 calories / day with ephedrine and 80 calories / day with cold .
The cold did n’t cause shivering and it was thought that the effect was through beige / brite fat activation ( the titles uses brown fat but all research groups do n’t seem to be aware of the distinction between true BAT and beige / brite fat ) .
There is also the issue that not everyone has the same amount or activity of beige / brite fat .
Women seem to have more than men ( which is odd given their difficulty with fat loss and fat gain ) and the obese have less total or less active amounts than the lean ( which is not surprising ) .
Trained endurance athletes actually have low activity of this type of fat and this also seems contradictory since trained endurance athletes are generally lean .
But , as above , it ’s unclear what real world effect this has since the caloric expenditure is very small and without drugs , it ’s unlikely we ’ll get full activation any time soon .
Cold and Thermal Neutral Zone
But the bigger issue with all of this is that most in the modern world live in what is called the thermal neutral zone ( TNZ ) .
This has been suggested as one of many non-food / activity related contributors to obesity .
This zone is defined as the range where human metabolism is not impacted and ranges from 25 - 30 °C ( 77 - 86° real American F units ) .
Outside of that , both higher and lower there is a shift in energy metabolism .
But there can also be a change in appetite .
This is thought to contribute to obesity in that , with heat , air condition and clothing , the modern human can make sure that they avoid what most perceive as uncomfortable temperatures ; we live within the TNZ most of the time .
Heat , increasing the core temperature , can increase energy expenditure ( every degree increase in core temperature increases metabolic rate by ~ 10 % ) and tends to blunt appetite for various reasons .
Cold can do the same , increasing energy expenditure but often stimulates hunger .
Since the question was about cold , the numbers found in studies are anywhere from a 25 calorie per day difference up to about 185 calories / day less burned in the thermal neutral zone compared to a colder environment .
The reason this is probably different than the cold exposure study above is due to shivering , the 50 cal / day study did n’t induce shivering but these studies probably did .
So how cold was cold ?
The experiments typically compared 16 °C ( 60 °F ) to 24 °C ( 75 °F ) .
So pretty cold .
If anything between those two has been tested , I do n’t know about it ( researchers often use extremes to make sure they get a measurable response ) .
Would 21 °C ( 70 °F ) have a smaller effect ?
I do n’t know .
At the end of the day , I ’m not sure it matters .
Unless they really like the cold , I ’m not convinced that most people would be willing to be that cold all day to burn an extra 150 calories / day .
It can certainly be acclimated to , usually the suggestion is to bring the thermostat down by a degree every few weeks , sleep with progressively less clothing and blankets , etc .
Or you could do 15 - 20 minutes of moderate intensity cardio and not be cold , miserable and have to overdrive your AC ( unless you do this in the winter ) .
There is also the question of increased hunger ; if food intake goes up in response to the cold , that could easily overwhelm this small effect ( exercise , in general tends to decrease hunger ) .
Sure , if you can maintain food intake without change and if you can handle being that cold all the time , you might get some extra caloric expenditure and that might be useful .
But I doubt that , in practice , most will be able to do it .
And before anyone asks about it in the comments : no I do not think that these silly - assed cold vests that are being claimed to “ activate brown fat ” will do much .
Recall that the study above only found a 50 cal / day increase with cold exposure based beige / brite fat activation .
Wearing one of these things for a short period wo n’t do squat .
So the answer is yes -ish .
There is an effect that could add up over time ( i.e. 150 cal / day extra done every day is 4,500 calories / month )
I ’m not convinced that practically most can do anything with it due to the hassle and uncomfortableness of what ’s required .
Combining Tension and Metabolic Work
Question : Lyle , I ’ve been reading up on your articles covering the pathways of muscle growth while dieting to gain mass , as well as , when dieting to lose fat .
With that being said I have some questions on what to do during dieting for fat loss .
In some of your articles you ’ve said that the tension pathway is the best for gaining or maintaining strength with a rep range between 30 - 60 reps per muscle group .
Also in another article over training while dieting to lose you talked about using the metabolic pathway in order to deplete glycogen and increase metabolic rate , but that it is not the best for maintaining mass .
You also talked about combining the two pathways on different days of the week or different body parts on the same day ( 1 muscle tension / other muscle metabolic ) .
SO my question is can you do heavy tension training and metabolic training of the same muscle group on the same day ?
Also is the rep range for the metabolic pathway the same 30 - 60 rep range per muscle group ?
Or is there an increas e rep range ?
Sorry if I ’m asking a question that you have already answered , if so then please direct me to the article .
Thanks
Answer :
Ok , the above is a little bit all over the place so let me see if I can de-all over the place it .
The question is sort of jumping from mass gains and dieting which are n’t the same .
Let me get dieting out of the way .
In a previous article I looked at metabolic and tension training , roughly heavy work in the 6 - 12 repetition range vs. high reps in terms of what should be done on a diet .
Basically I was addressing a very old ( and mainly steroid - driven ) idea that switching exclusively to high reps and short rests on a diet is not optimal for a natural lifter .
Take away the tension stimulus and muscles go bye - bye unless you have steroids to protect against it .
The only exception being beginners for whom most gains are neural , there is no increased muscle mass to lose and glycogen depletion may be beneficial to enhance whole - body fat burning during dieting .
Which is n’t to say that depletion work does n’t have it ’s place in addition to tension work on a diet .
But the goal is less fatigue and more
Glycogen Depletion
A Hormonal Response to Mobilize Fat ( increased SNS output )
Probably Something Else I Mentioned in the Articles but Forget
But this is also generally combined with a reduction in total tension training .
Volume and frequency can be reduced fairly significantly without losing muscle .
But only so long as intensity ( defined here as weight on the bar ) does n’t go down .
Depletion work can be done in a variety of ways .
In my Ultimate Diet 2.0 , it ’s done at the start of the week as either two full - body workouts to set up maximal fat loss before rebounding into an anabolic state with tension and power training .
But that is a very specific setup and there are many other ways to do it .
One would be to cut heavy , tension type weight training on a diet to two - full body workouts and do two full - body depletion workouts on the other days .
Another would be to follow any specific weight work with the appropriate depletion work .
So do lower body depletion after lower , or chest / delts / tri depletion after that workout .
See the chart
Option Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 1 Depletion Full Body Off Depletion Full - Body Off Off 2 Upper +
Upper D Lower +
Lower D Off Upper +
Upper D Lower +
Lower D Off Off 3 Push +
Push D Legs / Abs + Legs / Abs D Back / Bis + Back / Bis D
Or whatever , the specific split does n’t matter , the above are just examples .
Cardio after the depletion work burns off the mobilized fatty acids and it ’s semi- like my Stubborn Fat Solution protocols .
But again that ’s really a dieting application .
What about for mass gains , can metabolic ( which I would here call fatigue work ) and tension training be combined ?
And the answer is yes .
We know that growth of muscle depends on a lot of things , a tension stimulus ( provided by heavy weight ) and a fatigue stimulus ( provided by higher reps / shorter rest ) .
An eccentric contraction may be required although DOMS per se probably means nothing .
Early on it looked like metabolic accumulation was involved and it may still be .
The hormonal response to training probably is n’t very important at all .
And while I cannot claim to have delved into the molecular pathways ( involving things like mTOR , AKT and a bunch of other stuff ) different types of training may activate them differentially and , while unstudied they may overlap and / or synergize with one another .
Certainly over the decades a variety of approaches using heavy work ( sets of 5 - 8 ) and lighter work ( sets of 10 - 12 or 12 - 15 ) have been used for growth .
And this appears in my own Generic Bulking Routine ( GBR )
And I do still keep the total volume per muscle group to 40 - 60 repetitions although getting both types of training into the same workout usually means being at the high end of this .
So a bodypart workout might be something like
Heavy Compound ( bench , row , squat , etc ) : 4 sets of 6 -8/3 ′ rest
Which means 4 sets of 6 - 8 repetitions on a 3 ′ rest .
The goal here is to use the heaviest weights which means long rest intervals .
Isolation exercise : 2 - 3 sets of 12-15/60-90 ″ rest
This is a fatigue stimulus .
So you might do
Squat : 4X6 - 8 ( or even 5X5 ) with a 3 ′ rest followed by leg extensions and leg curls for 2 - 3X12 - 15 with 60 - 90 ″ rest .
Perhaps a better leg workout would be
Squat : 4X6 - 8/3 ′ rest
RDL : 4X6 -8/3′
Leg extension : 3X12-15/60-90 ″ rest
Leg curl : 312-15/60-90 ″ rest
Here I recommend doing the heavy work first since quads are involved in the RDL to keep the knees straight .
Any other bodypart workout would be the same : bench / chest - flye , row / shrugback , pulldown / pullover , etc , etc .
Now , the above is great but once people get a lot stronger , perhaps into year 3 as an intermediate trainee ( about year 4 of training if they do it right ) , two heavy workouts in the above fashion can be too much .
At this point , I think it ’s better to split up the tension and fatigue work but to keep both in the same week .
It ’s just a basic heavy / light since medium work does n’t fit anywhere .
This looks very much like the PHaT system .
So a week might look like this .
Day Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Lower H Upper H Off Lower L Upper L Off Off
Where H means heavy compounds for 40 - 60 total reps per muscle group .
Squat : 4X6 - 8/3 ′ rest
RDL : 4X6 -8/3′ rest
Leg Press : 4X6-8/3′ restLeg Curl : 4X6 - 8/3 ′ rest
And L is more isolation work for 40 - 60 total reps
Leg press or leg extension : 4X12-15/60-90 ″ rest
Leg curl : 4X12-15/6-90 ″ rest
Or whatever .
Hope that answers the question .
Size of Calorie Deficit and Muscle Loss
Question : Hello Lyle , as you know in Bodybuilding there are two phases to build muscle ( off - season ) and to strip off excess fat .
When you want to get rid of excess fat there are different ways to plan the deficit .
You can use a low , medium or high deficit .
The question to me is , what is the best way to keep muscle during that period ( steroid free ) .
You need to have a deficit and therefore you also will lose muscle .
Let ’s say , you are at the end of your bulking phase with 20 % body fat and start dieting from there until you get to your 10 % mark .
Is there a difference in terms of muscle loss ( catabolism ) when you do it slowly with up to 500 kcal deficit or more aggressively with a deficit of 1000 kcal ??
Both scenarios end when you hit the 10 % mark !
Do you have research on that ?
Answer :
Ok , first let me start with a big assumption in the above which is that you must lose muscle on a diet .
This has been taken as fact for years and I ’ll be honest that I used to repeat it many years ago .
But it ’s not really true .
A lot of early dieting practices , much of which came out of the drug fuelled 80’s ( and which did n’t work for naturals ) do allow muscle loss .
But it does n’t have to happen if you do things correctly .
Correct here means at least three things
Proper weight training for fat loss Adequate Protein Refeeds and Diet Breaks
For example , people using my Ultimate Diet 2.0 ( which alternates a very large caloric deficit for about 4 days with 3 days high calories ) has gotten people very lean while gaining muscle .
My Rapid Fat Loss Handbook creates a very large deficit but since protein intake is high ( up to 2 g/ lb for leaner individuals ) and mandates proper heavy weight training , muscle loss is minimal in most people .
The problem early on was that dieters tried to do what drug users were doing .
They dropped heavy weight training for high - rep / short - rest training ; that causes muscle loss .
They tried to maintain the same lower protein ( and naturals need much more protein to spare LBM ) .
In his review Eric Helms recommends up to 2.3-3.1 g/kg ( 1.1 - 1.4 g/lb ) which is exactly what I recommended in the Protein Book in 2007 .
With that said , let me answer the rest of the question .
Yes , early research did suggest that there was a relationship between the size of deficit and muscle catabolism but there are some problems I see with that conclusion .
Many of those studies gave like 320-400 calories / day and maybe half of that was protein .
That means that the dieters got like 50 grams of protein per day which is way below what even the obese need ( 1.5 g/kg protein or about 0.7 g/lb ) .
That ’s what caused the muscle loss ; too little protein .
And of course no resistance training .
Insufficient protein causes muscle loss .
Beyond that , there have been some recent studies looking at this .
The first put obese men on either a very low calorie diet for 3 weeks or a low calorie ( both of which contained a stupid 50 g / day of protein which is still too low given that the dieters were about 107 kg ; they needed 150 g / day or so ) diet for 6 weeks to generate the same total fat loss .
The low calorie diet ( with more calories ) actually lost MORE lean body mass probably related to the length of the diet ( and the stupid low protein ) but they also lost more fat .
Another study , this time in elite athletes , aimed for either slow or fast weight loss ( once again , the fast weight loss athletes were done in half the time ) with the slow group getting 1900 calories ( a 450 cal / day deficit ) and 1.6 g/kg of protein ( closer but still too low ) or 1700 calories ( an 800 cal / day deficit ) and 1.6 g/kg of protein .
The fast weight loss group lost a tiny amount of LBM ( about 1 lb ) while the slow weight loss group actually gained a bit of muscle .
But this is kind of misleading , the athletes were training their upper bodies for the first time and the muscle gain was a newbie effect .
The fast weight loss group also lost a bit more fat .
But I ’d make a big point , a faster diet , in addition to probably not causing more LBM if you do it right , is over faster .
If your diet is done in 3 weeks versus 6 weeks , you can get back to real training on maintenance or slightly higher calories sooner .
So if you ’re diet is over in 3 weeks ( compared to 6 ) you can spend the next 3 weeks training more efficiently .
I bet those 3 weeks of real training put any small amount of muscle lost back on and let you gain more muscle too .
Now , I ’m not recommending that all dieters follow fast fat loss diets .
But it ’s pretty clear that given sufficient protein and training , any LBM loss is minimal overall .
And it ’s not much greater with fast fat loss .
So most of these old ideas floating around are actually wrong .
You do n’t have to lose muscle and if you get sufficient protein , heavy training and do n’t go nuts on cardio , you wo n’t lose more with a faster fat loss than with a slower fat loss .
And you can get back to non-dieting training sooner .
How Much Protein While Dieting ?
Question :
You refer to “ adequate protein intake ” as important , but what do you consider adequate ?
In my case — calorie restriction of ~750 - 1000 kcals below BMR coupled with regular strength training ?
Is there a percentage of intake you consider ideal , and is it higher while dieting versus maintenance ( to prevent muscle loss during times of restriction ) ?
Answer :
The above question actually came through in the comments section of Exercise and Weight / Fat Loss : Part 2 and I thought it was important enough to address explicitly since it ’s a place where I still see many mainstream diets and dieters making mistakes .
It ’s worth noting that bodybuilders and other strength athletes have been promoting higher protein intakes while dieting for decades and this is yet another place where modern science has ended up validating those beliefs many years after the fact .
The question of adequate protein under different conditions is one that has a long history of debate , the issue of maintenance requirements as well as protein intakes for athletes is still highly debated with science on both sides of the story ( for details you can refer to The Protein Book ) .
With regards dieting specifically , this was a topic of much study in the 60’s and 70’s as researchers started looking past the simple issue of weight loss and into that of changes in body composition ; the goal moved from weight loss per se to that of generating fat loss while minimizing lean body mass and muscle mass loss .
After much toing and froing and research had been done it was eventually found that a protein intake of about 1.5 g/kg of lean body mass ( LBM ; note that researchers actually used Ideal Body Weight but this is a rough proxy for LBM ) was necessary to spare LBM losses in a non-training obese individual consuming low calories .
This is about double the DRI for protein ( at 0.8 g/kg ) at maintenance calories .
So for an overweight individual at say 200 pounds and 30 % body fat ( this would give them an LBM of 140 lbs or 63 kg ) , that would be a protein intake of 95 grams of protein per day .
Please note that this value is simply a minimum and dieters may still find that higher protein intakes are beneficial from a hunger blunting effect or what have you ( see below ) .
I ’d mention that at least one of the studies I referred to that found no benefit of resistance training gave something like 40 grams of protein to the subjects far less than necessary or adequate .
So it ’s no surprise that no protein sparing effect of exercise was seen ; the diet was inadequate in the first place .
It ’s worth noting that more recent research supports further benefits of increased protein intakes while dieting , beyond simple lean body mass maintenance .
Protein is the most filling nutrient ( meaning that higher protein intakes tend to control hunger better ) .
Studies have found that higher protein intakes can help to stabilize blood sugar levels while dieting which has benefits from both an energy level and appetite standpoint .
Protein high in the amino acid leucine ( with the dairy proteins whey and casein being the two proteins highest in leucine ) seem to have extra benefit in this regard .
Now , as individuals get leaner , protein requirement tend to go up further for reasons discussed in other articles on this site .
As well , regular training tends to further increase protein requirements .
So lean athletes trying to lose fat while sparing lean body mass loss need even higher protein intakes than this .
And we ’ve known for decades now that caloric intake per se tends to impact on protein requirements ; as caloric intake goes down , protein requirements go up .
And vice versa .
While less data on this group is available , bodybuilders and athletes have long used a protein intake of 2.2 g/kg ( 1 g/lb ) lean body mass as a generalized intake level and as folks get very lean , intakes of 3.3 g/kg ( 1.5 g/lb ) of lean body mass may be required to stave off muscle loss while dieting .
In some very extreme cases , such as the near protein only diet approach of my own Rapid Fat Loss Handbook even higher protein intakes may be required for very lean individuals .
So basically we have an intake continuum ranging from about 1.5 g/kg ( 0.68 g/lb ) as a minimum for the obese non-training individual up to a high of around 3.3 g/kg ( 1.5 g/lb ) of protein per pound of lean body mass for very lean heavily training athletes or bodybuilders with middle ground values being found in between those two extremes .
You ’ll note that I did n’t put any of those values in terms of percentages .
So that ’s what I mean by “ adequate protein on a diet ” when I use that phrase .
It ’s context dependent with the primary variables being body fat percentage ( as this goes up , protein requirements go down ) , caloric intake ( as caloric intake goes down , protein requirements go up and vice versa ) , and activity ( with regular activity generally increasing protein requirements ) .

( CNN ) --
Two alleged suicide bombers were responsible for a pair of explosions in the southeastern Iranian city of Zahedan that left at least 20 dead and scores wounded , Iran 's state news agency IRNA reported Thursday .
The first blast occurred at 9:20 p.m. ( 12:40 p.m. ET ) in front of the city 's Grand Mosque , and the second explosion followed within minutes , IRNA said .
The news agency reported that at least 20 people were killed and 100 were wounded .
Iran 's state - run Arabic channel , Al - Alam , reported that at least 30 were killed and more than 50 wounded .
" It is not yet possible to announce the exact number of those killed and injured in the incident , " a police official said , according to IRNA .
Zahedan is the capital of Sistan - Baluchestan province , which borders Pakistan .
Iranian Deputy Interior Minister Ali Abdollahi labeled the incident a terrorist act , the semi-official Fars news agency said .
" Terrorist operations in Zahedan have left several dead and injured , " Abdollahi said , according to Fars .
" More information will be given when our investigations are completed , " he told Fars .
In Washington , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the attacks .
" The United States extends its sympathy to the families and loved ones of those injured and killed , " she said in a statement .
" We also call for the perpetrators of this horrific attack to be held accountable for their actions . "
A lawmaker in Zahedan told IRNA that " the two explosions were the result of suicide bombings .
First , someone in a woman 's clothing tried to enter the Jam-e Mosque in Zahedan but was prevented from entering . "
It was not immediately known whether that person was a man or a woman , said Hosseili Shariari , a Zahedan member of parliament .
Three or four people died in the first explosion , and while people were trying to help those victims , the second suicide bomber detonated his explosives , he told IRNA .
Shariari blamed the followers of two extremist groups , the Wahhabis , followers of an extremist Saudi Arabian sect , and the Jundallah , followers of Abdolmalek Rigi , who was responsible for suicide bombings in the past .
" These explosions were quite predictable , " Shariari said , according to Fars .
" I have said many times at press conferences that the remaining agents of the Wahhabis and the Rigi group are determined to conduct this kind of operation to prove that they still exist . "
Last October , in the same province , a suicide bomber blew himself up as participants headed to a conference between Shia and Sunni groups in the city of Sarbaz .
At least 29 were killed in that bombing , including five senior officers of Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps .
The terrorist group Jundallah -- also known as the People 's Resistance Movement of Iran -- claimed responsibility for that attack .
In the past , the predominantly Shiite central government in Tehran has accused Jundallah of fomenting unrest in the province .
Iran has alleged that the United States and Saudi Arabia are funding the group .
Jundallah says that it is fighting for the rights of Sunni Muslims in the country .

The summer is officially here and this is the time of year when Icethetics - related news really kicks into high gear .
Yesterday we got our first look at the logos for the Winter and Heritage Classics .
But there 's still so much more going on this week .
New Islanders jersey seen in video
Islanders new road jersey
It's not like it was a big secret anyway , but the New York Islanders have tipped their hand by posting a video online which clearly displays their new white road jersey .
In interviews with alumni and current team employees , the new sweater is part of a string of historic Isles threads in the backdrop .
It 's exactly what 's been rumored .
But I wo n't call it official until Friday when it 's unveiled at the draft party .
The video , which in and of itself is worth a mention on this blog , delves into the history of Islanders jerseys and logos — including that all too hard to forget Fishsticks Phase from the '90s .
I 'd embed it , but some people have had problems loading Icethetics when I do that .

New details on Kings throwback
Kings set to wear throwbacks
The Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver Canucks will open the 2010 - 11 season just as they did exactly 40 years before .
And they 'll do so in a purple throwback jersey from the 1970s !
LA Kings Insider blogger Rich Hammond has once again said that the Kings will contribute to the Canucks ' 40th anniversary celebration by donning vintage threads from their early years .
He believes it will look like one worn between 1972 and 1980 ( right ) .
He also says it could be worn another three or four times throughout the season , but does n't specify whether it would be worn against only the Canucks or other opponents too .
Retail sources have also claimed that the Canucks will have a white throwback jersey next season .
If so , expect to see it debut on Oct. 9 for the season opener against L.A .
Sharks unveil multiple 20th year logos
The San Jose Sharks , never one to short us on logo options , will have five different 20th anniversary logos for use next season .
The new marks were posted on the team 's Facebook page yesterday .
The sleeve patch version was first posted on Icethetics a few weeks ago .
A description of how it will be used on the uniforms was included in the press release :
All season long , the team will wear a 20th Anniversary San Jose Sharks patch on their sweater that will be placed on the left sleeve underneath the player ’s number and above the stripe .
The patch , which is 5 ¼ ” x 1 ¾ ” , combines the modern Shark with a powerful “ double - XX ” design , using the Roman numeral for the number “ 20 ” celebrating the team ’s anniversary .
This patch will also be placed on each player ’s helmet .
I 'm assuming they mean a sticker will be placed on the helmet , and that they 're not actually going to sew a patch onto it .
And as for the sleeve , it 's unusual placement .
Typically , you 'd find an anniversary patch on the chest , but the players ' numbers are in the way .
Not sure why they do n't just swap it out with one of the shark logos on the shoulders .
Hopefully this does n't clutter up the jersey too terribly .
In any event , if you were wondering what the other four logos will be used for , the Sharks '
Facebook album describes them as ( left to right , image above ) primary crest , anniversary shield , classic fin and leaping shark .
They 're all well - designed and fit within the brand .
Blue Jackets unveil 10th anniversary logo
Blue Jackets ' 10th anniversary patchThe Columbus Blue Jackets officially unveiled their 10th anniversary logo yesterday .
It was first featured here on the blog a few weeks back .
Now the logo can be seen in patch form ( right ) .
And the team even has a whole press release about it on their website .
Here 's how it 's described :
The logo features a representation of the state flag of Ohio flying on a silver flag pole above the stylized number " 10 " with a red and blue ribbon at the bottom featuring the team 's official logo between the years 2000 and 2010 .
The mark utilizes the team 's primary colors of Union Blue , representing the color worn by the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War ; Goal Red , in reference to the most exciting moment in hockey ; and Capital Silver , signifying Columbus as the state capital of Ohio .
The release also points out the patch wo n't be worn on the sweaters until after the NHL Premiere games against San Jose in Stockholm .
They 'll have a special patch for that too , of course .
The Jackets ' social media crew was n't shy about sharing some pictures and video either .
Enjoy these links to an image gallery and a neat video that reveals the logo .
AHL celebrates 75 seasons
Obviously there 's a lot going on in the NHL these days , but I did n't want to leave out the AHL .
It 's the league 's 75th season and it also marks the first time that every team has had its own NHL affililate .
The AHL revealed its plans to celebrate the milestone along with a special logo ( left ) which will be used throughout the season .
It was designed by Derek Abraham of Maple Leafs Sports & Entertainment .
2011 AHL All - Star Classic logoCelebration plans include all teams wearing a special jersey patch along with a handful of teams opening the 2010 - 11 season in throwback uniforms .
The 2011 AHL All - Star Classic will be hosted by the Hershey Bears and will feature players in vintage uniforms as well .
I 'm including the logo in this post because I somehow overlooked its unveiling back on April 3 .
The AHL All - Star Classic will take place January 30 - 31 , 2011 .
The game itself returns to an East - West format .
With the recent addition of the Oklahoma City Barons , there are now 30 AHL teams all with individual affiliations .
I know it has nothing to do with the blog , but this might make for an interesting logo tournament : NHL logos vs AHL logos .
At TED , Microsoft showed off its " virtual human " technology , named Milo , designed for the company 's hands - free Xbox 360 motion controller called Kinect at TED Global in Oxford .
Milo is built to react to people 's emotions , body movements , and voice , allowing players to interact with the virtual character .
Milo was first demoed at the E3 expo in 2009 .
It was built using artificial intelligence developed by Lionhead studios , along with undisclosed technology from Microsoft .
UK games designer Peter Molyneux said the game exploits psychological techniques to make a person feel that Milo is real .
Each Milo character will be unique because every player 's interaction with the virtual character will sculpt the type of virtual person Milo will evolve to become .
The demonstration showed the initial stages of the game , where players learn to interact with Milo .
Molyneux said that the later stages of the game allowed a player to explore the landscape with Milo more freely .
He also said the technology is still in development and Microsoft has no plans to release it , but hinted that the game was designed to be used for millions of people and therefore could one day become a commercial product .

Some years ago I visited Krasnogruda , the restored manor house of Czeslaw Milosz , close by the Polish–Lithuanian frontier .
I was the guest of Krzysztof Czyzewski , director of the Borderland Foundation , dedicated to acknowledging the conflicted memory of this region and reconciling the local populations .
It was deep midwinter and there were snow - covered fields as far as the eye could see , with just the occasional clump of ice - bound trees and posts marking the national frontiers .
My host waxed lyrical over the cultural exchanges planned for Milosz ’s ancestral home .
I was absorbed in my own thoughts : some seventy miles north , in Pilviskiai ( Lithuania ) , the Avigail side of my father ’s family had lived and died ( some at the hands of the Nazis ) .
Our cousin Meyer London had emigrated in 1891 to New York from a nearby village ; there he was elected in 1914 as the second Socialist congressman before being ousted by an ignominious alliance of wealthy New York Jews disturbed by his socialism and American Zionists aghast at his well - publicized suspicion of their project .
For Milosz , Krasnogruda — “ red soil ” — was his “ native realm ” ( Rodzinna Europa in the original Polish , better translated as European Fatherland or European Family ) .
But for me , staring over this stark white landscape , it stood for Jedwabne , Katyn , and Babi Yar — all within easy reach — not to mention dark memories closer to home .
My host certainly knew all this : indeed , he was personally responsible for the controversial Polish publication of Jan Gross ’s account of the massacre at Jedwabne .
But the presence of Poland ’s greatest twentieth - century poet transcended the tragedy that stalks the region .
Milosz was born in 1911 in what was then Russian Lithuania .
Indeed , like many great Polish literary figures , he was not strictly “ Polish ” by geographical measure .
Adam Zagajewski , one of the country ’s most important living poets , was born in Ukraine ; Jerzy Giedroyc — a major figure in the twentieth - century literary exile — was born in Belarus , like Adam Mickiewicz , the nineteenth - century icon of the Polish literary revival .
Lithuanian Vilna in particular was a cosmopolitan blend of Poles , Lithuanians , Germans , Russians , and Jews , among others ( Isaiah Berlin , like the Harvard political philosopher Judith Shklar , was born in nearby Riga ) .
Raised in the interwar Polish republic , Milosz survived the occupation and was already a poet of some standing when he was sent to Paris as the cultural attaché of the new People ’s Republic .
But in 1951 he defected to the West and two years later he published his most influential work , The Captive Mind .
Never out of print , it is by far the most insightful and enduring account of the attraction of intellectuals to Stalinism and , more generally , of the appeal of authority and authoritarianism to the intelligentsia .
Milosz studies four of his contemporaries and the self - delusions to which they fell prey on their journey from autonomy to obedience , emphasizing what he calls the intellectuals ’ need for “ a feeling of belonging . ”
Two of his subjects — Jerzy Andrzejewski and Tadeusz Borowski —may be familiar to English readers , Andrzejewski as the author of Ashes and Diamonds ( adapted for the cinema by Andrzej Wajda ) and Borowski as the author of a searing memoir of Auschwitz , This Way for the Gas , Ladies and Gentlemen .
But the book is most memorable for two images .
One is the “ Pill of Murti - Bing . ”
Milosz came across this in an obscure novel by Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz , Insatiability ( 1927 ) .
In this story , Central Europeans facing the prospect of being overrun by unidentified Asiatic hordes pop a little pill , which relieves them of fear and anxiety ; buoyed by its effects , they not only accept their new rulers but are positively happy to receive them .
The second image is that of “ Ketman , ” borrowed from Arthur de Gobineau ’s Religions and Philosophies of Central Asia , in which the French traveler reports the Persian phenomenon of elective identities .
Those who have internalized the way of being called “ Ketman ” can live with the contradictions of saying one thing and believing another , adapting freely to each new requirement of their rulers while believing that they have preserved somewhere within themselves the autonomy of a free thinker — or at any rate a thinker who has freely chosen to subordinate himself to the ideas and dictates of others .
Ketman , in Milosz ’s words , “ brings comfort , fostering dreams of what might be , and even the enclosing fence affords the solace of reverie . ”
Writing for the desk drawer becomes a sign of inner liberty .
At least his audience would take him seriously if only they could read him :
Fear of the indifference with which the economic system of the West treats its artists and scholars is widespread among Eastern intellectuals .
They say it is better to deal with an intelligent devil than with a good - natured idiot .
Between Ketman and the Pill of Murti-Bing , Milosz brilliantly dissects the state of mind of the fellow traveler , the deluded idealist , and the cynical time server .
His essay is more subtle than Arthur Koestler ’s Darkness at Noon and less relentlessly logical than Raymond Aron ’s Opium of the Intellectuals .
I used to teach it in what was for many years my favorite course , a survey of essays and novels from Central and Eastern Europe that included the writings of Milan Kundera , Vaclav Havel , Ivo Andric ’ , Heda Kovaly , Paul Goma , and others .
But I began to notice that whereas the novels of Kundera and Andric ’ , or the memoirs of Kovaly or Yevgenia Ginsburg , remain accessible to American students notwithstanding the alien material , The Captive Mind often encountered incomprehension .
Milosz takes for granted his readers ’ intuitive grasp of the believer ’s state of mind : the man or woman who has identified with History and enthusiastically aligned themselves with a system that denies them freedom of expression .
In 1951 he could reasonably assume that this phenomenon — whether associated with communism , fascism , or indeed any other form of political repression — would be familiar .
And indeed , when I first taught the book in the 1970s , I spent most of my time explaining to would - be radical students just why a “ captive mind ” was not a good thing .
Thirty years on , my young audience is simply mystified : why would someone sell his soul to any idea , much less a repressive one ?
By the turn of the twenty - first century , few of my North American students had ever met a Marxist .
A self - abnegating commitment to a secular faith was beyond their imaginative reach .
When I started out my challenge was to explain why people became disillusioned with Marxism ; today , the insuperable hurdle one faces is explaining the illusion itself .
Contemporary students do not see the point of the book : the whole exercise seems futile .
Repression , suffering , irony , and even religious belief : these they can grasp .
But ideological self - delusion ?
Milosz ’s posthumous readers thus resemble the Westerners and emigres whose incomprehension he describes so well : “ They do not know how one pays — those abroad do not know .
They do not know what one buys , and at what price . ”
Perhaps so .
But there is more than one kind of captivity .
Recall the Ketman - like trance of those intellectuals swept up in George W. Bush ’s hysterical drive to war just a few years ago .
Few of them would have admitted to admiring the President , much less sharing his worldview .
So they typically aligned themselves behind him while doubtless maintaining private reservations .
Later , when it was clear they had made a mistake , they blamed it upon the administration ’s incompetence .
With Ketman - like qualifications they proudly assert , in effect , “ we were right to be wrong ” — a revealing if unconscious echo of the plaidoyer of the French fellow travelers , “ better to have been wrong with Sartre than right with Aron . ”
Today , we can still hear sputtering echoes of the attempt to reignite the cold war around a crusade against “ Islamo - fascism . ”
But the true mental captivity of our time lies elsewhere .
Our contemporary faith in “ the market ” rigorously tracks its radical nineteenth - century doppelgaenger — the unquestioning belief in necessity , progress , and History .
Just as the hapless British Labour chancellor in 1929 – 1931 , Philip Snowden , threw up his hands in the face of the Depression and declared that there was no point opposing the ineluctable laws of capitalism , so Europe ’s leaders today scuttle into budgetary austerity to appease “ the markets . ”
But “ the market ” — like “ dialectical materialism ” — is just an abstraction : at once ultra-rational ( its argument trumps all ) and the acme of unreason ( it is not open to question ) .
It has its true believers — mediocre thinkers by contrast with the founding fathers , but influential withal ; its fellow travelers — who may privately doubt the claims of the dogma but see no alternative to preaching it ; and its victims , many of whom in the US especially have dutifully swallowed their pill and proudly proclaim the virtues of a doctrine whose benefits they will never see .
Above all , the thrall in which an ideology holds a people is best measured by their collective inability to imagine alternatives .
We know perfectly well that untrammeled faith in unregulated markets kills : the rigid application of what was until recently the “ Washington consensus ” in vulnerable developing countries — with its emphasis on tight fiscal policy , privatization , low tariffs , and deregulation — has destroyed millions of livelihoods .
Meanwhile , the stringent “ commercial terms ” on which vital pharmaceuticals are made available has drastically reduced life expectancy in many places .
But in Margaret
Thatcher ’s deathless phrase , “ there is no alternative . ”
It was in just such terms that communism was presented to its beneficiaries following World War II ; and it was because History afforded no apparent alternative to a Communist future that so many of Stalin ’s foreign admirers were swept into intellectual captivity .
But when Milosz published The Captive Mind , Western intellectuals were still debating among genuinely competitive social models — whether social democratic , social market , or regulated market variants of liberal capitalism .
Today , despite the odd Keynesian protest from below the salt , a consensus reigns .
For Milosz , “ the man of the East cannot take Americans seriously because they have never undergone the experiences that teach men how relative their judgments and thinking habits are . ”
This is doubtless so and explains the continuing skepticism of the East European in the face of Western innocence .
But there is nothing innocent about Western ( and Eastern ) commentators ’ voluntary servitude before the new pan-orthodoxy .
Many of them , Ketman - like , know better but prefer not to raise their heads above the parapet .
In this sense at least , they have something truly in common with the intellectuals of the Communist age .
One hundred years after his birth , fifty - seven years after the publication of his seminal essay , Milosz ’s indictment of the servile intellectual rings truer than ever : “ his chief characteristic is his fear of thinking for himself . ”
Tuli Kupferberg , a poet and singer who went from being a noted Beat to becoming , in his words , “ the world ’s oldest rock star ” when he helped found the Fugs , the bawdy and politically pugnacious rock group , died on Monday in Manhattan .
He was 86 and lived in Manhattan .
He had been in poor health since suffering two strokes last year , said Ed Sanders , his friend and fellow Fug .
The Fugs were , in the view of the longtime Village Voice critic Robert Christgau , “ the Lower East Side ’s first true underground band . ”
They were also perhaps the most puerile and yet the most literary rock group of the 1960s , with songs suitable for the locker room as well as the graduate seminar ( “ Ah , Sunflower , Weary of Time , ” based on a poem by William Blake ) ; all were played with a ramshackle glee that anticipated punk rock .
With songs like “ Kill for Peace , ” the Fugs also established themselves as aggressively antiwar , with a touch of absurdist theater .
The band became “ the U.S.O. of the left , ” Mr. Kupferberg once said , and it played innumerable peace rallies , including the “ exorcism ” of the Pentagon in 1967 that Norman Mailer chronicled in his book “ The Armies of the Night . ”
( The band took its name from a usage in Mailer ’s “ Naked and the Dead . ” )
DANIEL :
This is my first attempt at making a trade as an Armchair GM .
Please keep in mind that much like contracts , my ideas are a starting point for negotiations .
While handing out contracts is interesting , this first attempt at a trade is , I think , much more fun to create .
So , enjoy my first attempt at upgrading our roster through acquiring a player already under contract .
I felt it would have been inappropriate to write this post while the Blackhawk's were still in the playoffs , so I saved it for now .
Ultimately , this trade comes down to two key factors : according to capgeek.com the Blackhawks have about $ 57.5 million committed to 14 players next year , and the Ducks have struggled to find that perfect fit for the Getzlaf - Perry combination ever since they lost Penner .
This deal , I believe , solves both those problems .
Before getting into my reasons for this trade , here is the full text of the deal
DUCKS get :
Dustin Byfuglien
BLACKHAWKS get :
Peter Holland
2010 second round pick - 42nd overall
Why it works for the Hawks :
Chicago needs cap relief .
There is n't even a fancy simile for it ; that 's how bad they need it .
This deal allows them to shake $ 3 million without taking any salary in return .
The Ottawa Sun claims that Sharp and Versteeg are likely candidates to be moved .
I agree regarding Versteeg , but Sharp , Hossa , Toews , and Kane are probably the best top 4 forward combination in the league .
It 's a perfect combination of centers and wingers .
Not to mention Sharp 's versatility as a center and winger gives the Hawks the option of letting him center a second line or combining him with the others to compound the scoring threat .
If you want to talk about keeping your core together , these guys are it .
Since Sharp seems a less likely choice to move , it 's got to be someone else .
I think the right package can pry Buff away from the Hawks , and I think this is that deal .
Byfuglien is a fan favorite and has been a game changer .
His ability to play the blueline and camp in front of the net is an extraordinary combination .
Still , Bolland had the same amount of points in this post season as Buff despite not playing the San Jose series with Toews and Kane .
In the grand scheme of things , Buff is little more than an energy player with a higher skill set and phenomenal understanding of his role .
Will the Hawks miss him ?
Of course .
Is he irreplaceable ?
In a way .
Can they move on without him and still play at a high , playoff level ?
Definitely .
The answer to the final question makes trading him a little less painful .
Let 's face it , someone has to go , and it 's probably better to lose Big Buff than one of the 4 core players I mentioned .
Bolland , Ladd and Kopecky have all demonstrated an ability to get in front of the net , and to be agitators .
They 'll just have to step up and do more of it so the team can save some money .
Peter Holland is a great prospect for the Hawks .
He went 30+50=80 , - 7 , 40 PIM in 59 games for the Guelph Storm this year , and added 3+5=8 , -1 , 12 PIM in 5 playoff games .
The offensive numbers are up after a slow start .
Hockey 's future says he has top scorer potential .
If he develops properly , he might make parting with Patrick Sharp a little easier , thus saving you more money in the second or third year after this deal happens .
Holland has size and hands .
He might not be the most physical guy around the net , but there 's still time for that to develop .
Even if he never gains that trait , he will still be an NHL player who will put up quality numbers .
The second round pick is a bonus in what is supposed to be a deep draft .
Byfuglien had a great postseason , but the salary has to be moved from somewhere .
Losing him does a minimal amount of damage to the core while netting you very valuable assets that wo n't hurt your cap for at least 3 years .
Why it works for the Ducks :
I think the key problem for the Ducks early on last year were the struggles of the top line .
Bobby Ryan had 4 points in his first 10 games .
Getzlaf had 8 , and Perry had 11 .
That 's a solid start for Getzy and Perry , not so much for Bobby .
I remember Arthur commenting on one of the threads that it was important for Bobby to decide how he wanted to play , as a power forward or as a sniper , because playing the hybrid was causing problems ( I'm paraphrasing ) .
If you go back to the 2006 - 2007 season , the one that put Getzlaf and Perry on the NHL map , the man who really helped the line gel was Dustin Penner .
Penner camped in front of the net and forced someone to cover him .
He had fantastic hands and put away rebounds like Homer Simpson puts away doughnuts .
The point is , Penner did two things and two things only in the offensive zone : grind along the boards and go to the net .
Byfuglien would provide a similar presence for Getzlaf and Perry at a cheaper price than reacquiring Penner .
Penner put up 29 goals on the PPG line ; I imagine a confident and focused Byfuglien could do similarly well .
He 'd free up creative space for that duo and make life even worse for opposing goalies when combined with an already pesky Perry .
More importantly , Buff does n't need the puck in order to be effective .
Instead , he takes the puck in order to allow his line mates to find their ideal level of space .
The more Bobby Ryan emerges as a force , the more of a problem sharing the puck with Getzlaf will be .
Adding a player like Byfuglien to the top line solves this problem by letting Bobby Ryan control the fate of a different line .
The final feather in Big Buff 's cap comes in his ability to be a physical force on a line that needs it .
By constantly being physical and energetic , Byfuglien will raise the energy and physicality of his line mates .
He 'll also force opposing teams to be more physical with Getzlaf and Perry , which I think we 've all come to believe only makes Getzlaf and Perry better .
Having Buff on his left side will mean more Hulk and less Getzlaf , a wonderful thing for the Ducks .
Peter Holland is not NHL ready .
He had a great year in the OHL , but has to climb a pretty impressive center depth chart that includes , Getzlaf , Nick Bonino , Nicolas Deschamps , Ryan Carter , and probably Saku Koivu and Kyle Chipchura .
The Ducks will be able to acquire and develop another center of Holland 's caliber while Deschamps , Bonino , and Getzlaf flourish .
I was n't a fan of Holland 's inability to go to the net during camp .
For a larger player , I felt he spent too much time on the perimeter when he should have been attacking .
That 's a problem for us , but Chicago might be able to get better use out of him by turning him loose .
Holland will still have to defend big bodies in the Central division , but their primary rival , Detroit , does n't focus on playing a physical game .
Our system would n't let us hide a player like Holland , and we have to give something to get something .
Losing a second round pick might hurt in a draft this deep , especially since we do n't have a third round pick anymore .
Still , we pick twice in the top 30 .
Losing a second rounder is n't ideal , but hurts less knowing we pick twice in the first round .
The truth is , Byfuglien 's stock has never been higher .
He can play up front or on the blueline , he almost single - handedly dispatched the Vancouver Canucks , and he was clutch in a tide - turning game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals .
A lot of teams will be interested in taking Byfuglien off the Blackhawk 's hands and we 'll have to pay a hefty price to convince Chicago to let him stay in the Conference .
Next year Buff goes RFA .
If he does n't work out , we can still get something for him .
I do n't really see that happening , but he 's only got one year left on his deal , which means our long - term commitment is minimal with an option to keep Byfuglien at a potentially better cap hit .
Ultimately , Dustin Byfuglien 's energy and ability to stay focused on his role will bring a security to the top line that was missing all year .
Bobby Ryan will be allowed to explore his own offensive freedom , which is important considering how good he was away from Getzlaf and Perry this year .
Acquiring Buff means that either Blake or Lupul HAS to be moved in order to make space for a defenseman and Selanne , but that might not be too difficult .
Chicago is probably going to have to move one of Byfuglien , Versteeg , and Sharp , or maybe even two of them .
The Ducks should get in on this and mark Big Buff as the guy they want to acquire .
He 'll only help us in the long run .
What is the force at the heart of life ?
What is the engine that drives it forward ?
That links all living things from the smallest to the largest , that links families through generations , looks , personality , health , and in sickness ?
Scientists have searched for the answer for hundreds of years , until 1953 when two young men ran into a British pub shouting that they 've discovered the secret of life .
The secret was DNA , a microscopic strand of only four chemicals but capable of such infinite variety that it carries the blueprint and directs the growth of every living thing on earth .
The genetic revolution was about to begin .
This is a documentary about genetics and ethics .

HUNTSVILLE , AL --
" The objective of the Transformer ( TX ) program is to demonstrate a four ( 4 ) person flyable / roadable vehicle that provides the warfighter terrain - independent mobility .
This presents unprecedented capability to avoid traditional and asymmetrical threats while avoiding road obstructions .
TX will enable enhanced company operations of future missions with applicable use in strike and raid , intervention , interdiction , insurgency / counterinsurgency , reconnaissance , medical evacuation and logistical supply .
The TX vehicle will have Vertical Takeoff and Landing ( VTOL ) capability with a minimum combat range of 250nm on a single tank of fuel . "
With those instructions from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , Macro Industries is on a mission to design a flying car for the Army .
But it 's not the first time someone from the Huntsville company will have designed a flying car .
In fact , Macro is basing its design on a concept company co-owner / president Norris Luce came up with as a 16 - year - old - SkyRider .
" Norris always wanted to build a flying car , " said company co-owner / vice president Marcia Elkins .
" Unfortunately , we never had any money to build one . "
Well , if Macro wins the DARPA competition , Luce will finally get the money to build a flying car .
The program will award the eventual winner nearly $ 43 million over three phases .
Elkins said Macro is incorporating a lot of the civilian SkyRider 's elements into its military version - the Mohawk Strider .
" The designer based it on a military vehicle - like a Humvee - and our own flying car , " she said .
" We have a lot of military vehicle experience . "
Here are some of DARPA 's design requests :
The vehicle can be manually driven like an SUV .
It rapidly configures between ground and flight configuration .
It has Vertical Takeoff and Landing ( VTOL ) capability , automated takeoff / landing flight control and has a cruise speed equivalent to a light aircraft .
Elkins said Macro 's design meets and / or exceeds those requirements as well as offering a 250 nautical mile range on one tank of fuel ; ability to fly at 10,000 feet altitude ; speeds of 130 mph on the road , 30 mph in rough terrain and 120 mph in the air ; and conversion from road to flight mode in 60 seconds .
And , Elkins said , citing Macro 's main business , " ours is armored . "
While the company 's goal " is to produce civilian transportation systems of the future , " Macro 's business is selling armor products to the military , everything from helmets and body armor to aircraft armor to impact - resistant structures for vehicles .
" Our customers are helicopters now , " Elkins said .
She said the company has grown from seven employees a year ago to 18 today .
With the growth , comes the need for more room .
So Macro is moving from its longtime home on Putman Drive to Cummings Research Park .
" We 're continuing to grow , " she said .
" We recently purchased the former National Scale Technology and Measurement Specialists buildings .
" We 've have two fantastic years . "

BRIDGEPORT -- Lt. Steven Velasquez and Firefighter Michel Baik were on the third - floor of the wood - frame home at 41 Elmwood Ave. , checking for hot spots and making sure there were no people in the smoldering blaze .
Then trouble hit .
The two sent mayday signals back to dispatch .
Within minutes , the fire department 's rapid intervention team found the pair on the floor , unconscious , and gave them CPR .
The two men could not be revived .
Hours later , a somber and distraught Mayor Bill Finch at a news conference talked about the two , both family men with young children .
Velasquez was Finch 's neighbor , and the mayor recalled pinning his badge on him when he was promoted to lieutenant in February .
Baik , he said , was a rookie with two years on the job .
Fire officials were too upset to attend the press conference , Finch said , adding Chief Brian Rooney , who was out of state when the fire hit , sped back to Bridgeport to be with his men .
" They 're just too emotional to talk about it , " Finch said .
Finch seemed close to tears when talking about how Velasquez 's widow held the couple 's newborn when he delivered the news of her husband 's death .
" It was not easy , " he said .
" They were both dedicated to their families .
We 're really going to miss them . "
Velasquez had received the Medal of Merit , the department 's third - highest award , in 2000 .

The last time the department lost a member was in 1999 , when Walter Flyntz died in a fire on Fairfield Avenue .
The initial report of the fire at the multi-family wood structure was called in to officials at 3:53 p.m. , and all of the building 's occupants were safely evacuated , according to Finch .
Deputy Fire Chief Robert Petrucelli said he arrived on the scene 15 minutes into the fire and found heavy smoke coming from the second and third floors .
" Firefighters were making progress on the fire , " Finch said , " knocking down the flames . "
He said Velasquez and Baik were the furthest inside the house , doing search and rescue and ventilating the house .
There 's no immediate word on what caused the fire , and Finch said the State Fire Marshal 's Office will be investigating not only the cause of the blaze , but also looking at the equipment used by the deceased firefighters .
Officials believe , however , that the fire started in the second - floor apartment .
Finch said that Velasquez and Baik were found " in a matter of minutes " after the mayday calls , adding more information " will come out in the investigation . "
Three other firefighters were taken to the hospital , Finch said .
One had a broken ankle -- an eyewitness said he saw a firefighter fall out of a third floor window -- and the other two were treated for heat exhaustion .
Finch said he visited the three injured firefighters at Bridgeport Hospital .
" They were very somber and subdued , " he said .
" They knew we 'd lost Steve and Mich . "
Even at 9 p.m. , long after the fire was extinguished , Finch said some Bridgeport firefighters remained at the scene .
" They 're very emotional , it 's a close - knit fire department , " Finch said .
" It 's very hard when they lose a member .
Almost " half the department " was at the fire , the mayor said , and the first truck -- Engine 3 -- was actually on its way to an elevator rescue when firefighters spotted the smoke and diverted to the fire .
Firefighters from Milford and Fairfield provided mutual aid during the fire , and Fairfield firefighters , their equipment and their chief , Richard Felner , stayed to fill in for the Bridgeport crews .
At the Congress Street headquarters , Felner said , the Bridgeport firefighters were being debriefed and receiving any help they might need .
" We 'll stay here as long as they want us ; we 're here for them .
It 's a bad , bad scene , especially for the crew that was working with them . "
Bridgeport apparatus responding to the fire were Engines 1 , 3 , 4 and 7 , Ladders 5 and 11 and Rescue 5 .
Finch said he was grateful for the assistance from other communities .
" Our firefighters need to go home , " he said .
While Fairfield firefighters filled in Bridgeport , crews from Norwalk and Westport were covering in Fairfield , he said .

Image caption Scientists are carrying out further tests on the mushroom
A tiny mushroom , little known to scientists , is behind some 400 sudden deaths in China , experts say .
For 30 years , during the rainy season , scores of villagers in Yunnan province have died suddenly of cardiac arrest .
Following a five - year investigation , researchers from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Beijing say they have the culprit .
The mushroom , know as Little White , belongs to the Trogia genus and has three toxic amino acids , experts say .
Researchers found that the deaths , known as Yunnan Sudden Death Syndrome , occurred almost always during rainy season ( from June to August ) , and at an altitude of 1800 - 2400 m ( 5900 - 7900ft ) .
Warning
" We heard amazing stories about how people would drop dead in the middle of a conversation , " Zhang Shu , a cardiologist who took part in the CDC study , told Science magazine .
" About two - thirds of victims , in the hours before death experienced symptoms such as heart palpitations , nausea , dizziness , seizures and fatigue , " he said .
What we have here is a toxin that is picking off vulnerable people Robert Fontaine , US epidemiologist ( CDC )
The investigation was initially hampered by language barriers , and the remote locations of the Yunnan villages .
However , in 2008 , the scientists noted that the Little White mushroom was often found in the homes where people had died .
Yunnan province is well - known for its wild mushrooms , many of which are exported at high prices .
Families , who make their living by collecting and selling the fungi , eat the Little White as it has no commercial value - it is too small and turns brown shortly after being picked .
A campaign to warn people against eating the tiny mushrooms has dramatically reduced the number of deaths .
There have been no reported deaths so far this year .
However , the scientists are carrying out further tests to find out why the mushroom is so lethal , as testing found the mushroom contained toxins , though not enough to be deadly .
" What 's happening in Yunnan is n't expected from any other mushroom toxin , " said Robert Fontaine , a US epidemiologist who took part in the investigation .
" What we have here is a toxin that is picking off vulnerable people , " he told Science .
He suggested that the toxins could be acting together with high concentrations of barium , a heavy metal , in the local water supply .

Cool , new podcast :D
Alright , let 's give this a shot .
@Question --
What effect is the ultra change going to have ?
It seems kind of insignificant :S
Also , do you think the infested terran reversion is okay where it is now , or does the spell ( or its caster ) need some more changes ?
@TLO --
When can we expect to see a grudge match between you and artosis ?
:D :3

@ Question
What do you feel about the removal of statis field , dark swarm and the lack in general of AoE spells in SC2 .
Do you feel that the skill cap in the game is high enough to be played truly competitively .

@ Question - What is the biggest hurdle currently to incorporating FE 's into top - tier Terran 's play in the various match - ups ?
Why is aggressively FEing not seen as often ( yes the Morrow build , but not much else ) , despite ' free ' bunkers , and the nice defender 's advantage of Tanks ?

( Love all the work you do , JP , just to say )
Perhaps a question more for Tasteless , as he's more involved with the Korean scene .
It might just be because I do n't see as much of it , but one thing I 've noticed is that the west seems to have jumped onto Starcraft 2 with both hands .
Groups like MLG seem to be eagerly awaiting its release to bring it on board and the popularity of it is really thrilling .
In the East , they seem much more cautious .
There seems to be less SC2 - related stuff going on that we can see , as opposed to the huge amount of European and American tournaments .
@ Question -
Do you think we 'll see an East / West divide emerge where the East stays with Brood War and the West moves to Starcraft 2 ?
Or is the East just moving more cautiously as it has so much history with Brood War .
Or do I just have this totally wrong :D
I for one would love to see a worldwide scene , the EU vs US rivalry is something really exciting , and the EU vs Asia showmatches showed that although Asia still seems to be on top , there 's an enjoyable contest to be made of it .

Now this is the announcement I 've been waiting for !
Great choices for guests , can't wait to download , thanks JP !
@ Question
As we can see they still have not removed the Infested Terran from the game , and have in fact brought it back to the Infestor .
Do you think this switch back will effect how it is used , or will it continue to be minimally used ?
Any other thoughts on the spell , aka tossing it , improvements , etc would be appreciated .
Thanks guys !

Do you feel like the ideal way to allow zerg to handle mech is to simply to make roaches cost 150 / 50 , be 3 supply , and spawn two at a time ?

These are all two pronged questions .
These are all related so please ask all of them or none ! :D
These are all related to the recent patch .
my name is pronounced faze .
Like Phaser without the R at the end ( Its not FAZEEE )
@ Question
What does TLO , and Tasteless ( The players who play zerg albeit randomly ) think about the recent ultralisk buff , and do they think this will change the ZvT dynamic much ?
With their experiences with Ultralisks do they feel this buff was necessary , or just another gimmick and why do you guys feel this way ?
@Question in comparison would an Ultralisk range addition or other suitable buff that would increase the chance of the ultralisk getting into melee range be more effective in promoting the ultralisk to do damage ?
and are there any specific changes you could think of that would accomplish this feat better than the stun resistance buff ?
@Question Continuing on my Ultralisk questions ,
What do you feel the Ultralisk is being designed to accomplish in Starcraft 2 , and what are your thoughts on how blizzards plans for the ultralisk will affect the game in the near future ?
and randomly , a bad question , you can skip this last one below if you like ^^ ;
@Question And also , WHENS THE BETA COMING UP , Does any of the guests on the show have any insider information ?
I Love SOTG , Keep on doing it !

Do you think the rally point change will have a negative effect on the lower level players .
While I love the change , I can't help but think lower level players , a part of the player base that Blizzard is paying specific attention to , will be hurt by this .
@Question Warp Prisms -
They 're obviously fucking awesome .
So why are n't we seeing more players use them ?
Things like drops could really help the Protoss play not to mention the added mobility it could bring too an army or defense when in the non-transport mode .
Why are n't we seeing more awesome Warp Prism play ?
Life is Good .

There have n't been much high level play around defensive burrowed banelings ,
Do you think using banelings defensively , somewhat like how spider mines were in starcraft1 will play a big roll in sc2 in the future ?
What are your views on it ?

As Beta went down the community was questioning if the defensive strength of tanks was insurmountable , and a protoss who did n't early expand to match the zerg opponent was dead in the water .
Has the strategy of SC2 Beta evolved faster or slower than you expected at the top level as well as the general community ?

@ Question - Map balance seems to be one of the main factors holding the game back .
Do you feel the matchups are solid enough to begin focusing on map balance ?
@ Question - Have any of you tried the 3v3 or 4v4 playlists ?
I personally found it useful in improving my apm because there is so much happening .
Do you feel any of the team playlists could ever appear in tournaments ?
Is there anything that could be done to help it , or is it impossible to balance ?

This week , Marvel 's Agents of " Atlas " get a spin - off as Gorilla Man takes center stage courtesy of " Atlas " co-creator Jeff Parker and Giancarlo Caracuzzo .
Considering that the character has n't had a solo story in about 54 years , this is a pretty momentous occasion , which is why today , I not only sat down with Parker for an interview , but managed to wrangle an exclusive with the Gorilla Man himself , Ken Hale !
This week , Marvel 's Agents of " Atlas " get a spin - off astakes center stage courtesy of " Atlas " co-creator Jeff Parker and Giancarlo Caracuzzo .
Considering that the character has n't had a solo story in about 54 years , this is a pretty momentous occasion , which is why today , I not only sat down with Parker for an interview , but managed to wrangle an exclusive with the Gorilla Man himself , ComicsAlliance :
First off , Ken , thanks for taking the time to do the interview .
I know you 've got your hands full these days .
And your feet , too .
Ken Hale : I got the skillz , Chris .
I make it look easy .
CA : Now for our readers who might not be familiar with your career , you 're not the Gorilla - Man who fought the Defenders with the Headmen , right ?
KH : No , but in our " Classic Gorilla Man " back ups , you 'll see the origin story of Arthur Nagan , ie ; that weirdo with a human head on a gorilla body .
Yuck .
CA : I 'm a little surprised that a human head on a gorilla body would gross you out that much .
You used to be human yourself , after all .
KH :
Hey , human head on human body ?
NICE .
Gorilla head on human body -- BOO .
Same the other way .
I 'm all about consistency , either way .
CA : I have similar feelings towards centaurs .
KH :
They 're okay I guess .
They can rock out with Flying V guitars and rear up on hind legs at the same time , that 's pretty rad .
CA : Speaking of gorilla bodies , though , yours is looking pretty good , considering that you 're , what , pushing eighty ?
KH : Bro , immortality has its privileges .
See , I 'm always going to be the number one Silverback ( without even the grey hair ) as long as I can stay breathing .
That 's what the Gorilla - Man curse does for you .
Of course , being a big ol ' Western Lowland ape does n't mean you 're necessarily good at all the weapons and gear and flying and suchlike , most of that came from my early human days .
Which this sweet series details .
CA : Does it focus more on regular Ken Hale , or is it a mix of your pre- and post - gorilla curse exploits ( Also , thank you for allowing me to use the phrase " post - gorilla curse exploits " )
KH : Sure .
It 's me going on a mission that has personal interest for me , because it connects all the way back to how I went from being a scrappy li'l Missouri farmboy to sophisticated world traveler .
So you get to see how I got to the point of being a Soldier of Fortune , and ultimately , a big hairy player .
CA : So is the entire story a flashback , or does it tie in with what 's going on now with your work with Atlas ?
KH :
It 's a flashback that connects to a present day story .
And it is part of my work with ATLAS .
Jimmy
Woo knows all of us are pretty awesome on our own , so he sends us out more and more like that so we can cover more ground , trying to shut down some of the more heinous operations that Atlas had going since before he started running the show .
CA : Yeah , you guys have had a pretty rough time shutting down Atlas 's more ... well , genocidal branches .
KH :
The tough ones are when you get there and find out - man , that one was making good money .
But hey , gotta go .
The big fathead dragon is still betting on Jimmy to get corrupted and start letting some of those jobs slide , but do n't count on it .
Woo is as good as a Summer day is long .
CA : What do you think about your other Atlas teammates ?
It 's a pretty eclectic group :
You , a killer robot , a super - spy , a siren and a mermaid princess .
KH : They 're all aces .
I do n't get why some yokels out there think they 're weird .
I mean , have you heard that ?
CA : As opposed to the teams that have a Norse god , a Canadian samurai , a guy in robot pants and an 88 year - old soldier who never made it past private ?
KH : He made it to CAPTAIN , junior .
But yeah , my point as well .
A robot with a Death Ray and a talking gorilla - we 're silly , but a blind guy dressed as the Underwood Ham Devil , now THAT'S straight - up serious business .
CA : You guys should try dying and coming back , or getting one guy to leave the team forever and then come back .
It totally builds street cred .
So is there anything else we can look forward to in your solo title ?
KH : I meet a new pal , find an old enemy , roll through the Congo , and talk to other apes who unlike me , keep it real and do n't wear clothes .
CA : Are these talking apes , or is talking to regular apes another benefit of the curse ?
KH : I tried living with them for a while , when I did n't think I 'd fit in anywhere else .
I just picked it up - they 're not big talkers anyway , gorillas .
I always felt like such a blabbermouth around them .
CA : Nice .
Any parting words for your fans ?
KH : Hey -- you Ken Hale boosters are the best , and I appreciate it .
I will always dopeslap Wolverine for you people .
Feel free to lobby to get me on another team , now that it 's becoming cool to be on two teams at once !
That 's more G - Man to go around .
After wrapping things up with Gorilla Man , I also got to talk to writer Jeff Parker , who told me he had an announcement to make .
Jeff Parker :
Why hello , Chris !
CA : How 's it going , Jeff ?
Thanks for taking a minute to chat between writing your ... what is it , 28 monthly titles now ?
JP : Oh please , it 's just 26 .
About to be 25 .
CA : Uh oh .
I do n't like the sound of that .
JP : Me neither , so I might as well rip the bandaid off now .
I 'm killing " Atlas " at issue 5 .
CA : Oh no !
JP : Yeah .
So there , haters who predicted we'd go down - you win !
Do n't you feel great and wise ?
But at least it was me who went out back and shot Lenny while he looked for bunnies , not Marvel .
CA : So what brought this on ?
JP : Well first , maybe we should embed an audio file for mood .
I 'd suggest " Parting of the Sensory " by Modest Mouse .
Anyway , our orders for ATLAS 1 started off in the low 20ks , which is n't surprising because a lot of things are coming in low right now , and we 've always been on the fringe .
Atlas has actually always sold better than a lot of books that get to go on much longer - a good bit of DC 's line .
But the Marvel danger zone is 20 k more or less , and since books tend to trend downward , that always sets off alarms .
I know some people think I try to cram them in everywhere , but that 's really more editors suggesting it , and me usually agreeing .
I brought up at least four different characters for " Deadpool Team Up " that were shot down before I finally said " uh ... Gorilla Man ? " and got greenlit .
And that issue has ordered really well , so that makes me think Gorilla Man is probably a character who will have some legs after Atlas .
Namora too .
CA : So this is the end ?
JP : Yeah .
I could have kept it going , but the options offered were to tie the book into another crossover mini-event , I just was n't feeling it .
I did it a couple of times already and feel we got some good stuff out of it , but I 'm just not interested in doing it again , introducing the team again , all that .
This 3 - D Man story really turned out to be pretty great , it 's going to be a definite highwater mark .
And I do n't want to follow it with something that would probably be less inspired .
Because the whole reason for doing the book is to do the kinds of stories I set the book up for , and if we 're not going to do that , there 's not much point .
CA : I know you know this better than anybody , but man , it sucks that it 's got to end , even if it goes out on a high note .
It was really a book that led the way in shining a light onto more obscure corners of the Marvel Universe where there 's so much untapped potential , much like " Hercules " or even " Nextwave , " although the approaches there are obviously different .
JP : Thanks !
It 's really hard to get people to buy a Marvel or DC comic that does n't focus on a character or team they grew up with , right now .
Which is too bad , because I 'd like to see Marvel doing horror , sci - fi , mysteries - all the stuff I was wanting to use Atlas as an outlet for .
But I 'm still going to try to get that across in my other work .
The agenda will not fade .
It 's kind of interesting how the book became more a rallying point for other creators - no doubt because we have excellent artists .
Everyone from Leonard Kirk to Gabriel Hardman has gotten really invested in the book and really shown off what they can do .
In the end , I think we 've helped influence some other cartoonists if nothing else .
We 're like the Velvet Underground of comics .
Maybe though we 'll be able to do a yearly special or something .
The regular readers of Atlas are pretty hardcore in their love of the book , and I 'd like to do something once in a while they can look towards .
CA : It 'd be nice if it could keep going in some form or another , whether it 's just the characters having their own miniseries or a persistent presence in the background .
If nothing else , Atlas and its various subsidiaries are a great plot device .
JP : Exactly .
CA : Is there anywhere we can watch for the characters ?
Obviously we know where Gorilla - Man 's appearing next , but what about Jimmy Woo ?
JP : The next big appearance will be Venus as a part of Hercules ' new God Squad !
And you know , I am a little happy that for now , I get to write the end of the series , knowing it 's the end - which makes a difference .
We really go all out with the Return of the Three Dimensional Man story , as will become clear in issue 3 .
And there 's a lot of fun stuff to look for throughout - like go back to issue one and see how many times
Threes follow Del Garrett around .
He 's been a great character to write .
But at least I get to work with the team supreme of Gabe Hardman and Elizabeth Breitweiser again !
We wanted to work together still .
CA : And you 've got other books too , like " Thunderbolts . "
JP : And you know what Thunderbolts has , Chris ?
CA : Man-Thing ?
JP : MAN - THING .
( high five ! )
Sad news indeed , but maybe this 'll help take the sting out of it :
Five exclusive preview pages from Gorilla Man # 1 with art by Giancarlo Caracuzzo !
" Gorilla Man " # 1 is out this Wednesday from Marvel Comics with a cover price of $ 3.99 !
El gobierno mexicano reitera que no la entregará ; le garantiza un trato justo
[ email protected ] MADRID . —
Nicolas Sarkozy , presidente de Francia , solicitó a su homólogo mexicano Felipe Calderón que la ciudadana francesa Florence Cassez sea entregada a ese país para que allá cumpla la pena impuesta por delitos cometidos en México .
Calderón ratificó la postura del gobierno mexicano de no entregar a Cassez a Francia .
Al término de la Sexta Cumbre de Jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de América Latina y el Caribe - Unión Europea , ambos presidentes sostuvieron una reunión .
En un comunicado emitido por la Presidencia de la República se informó que el presidente Sarkozy se refirió al caso de su conciudadana , “ y refrendó su interés de que se aplique la Convención de Estrasburgo para que ésta ( Florence Cassez ) sea trasladada a su país ” .
FCH sustenta rechazo
Por su parte , el presidente Calderón subrayó la importancia de que Cassez cumpla en su totalidad “ la sentencia que le impusieron los tribunales mexicanos ” .
Calderón recordó a Sarkozy las diferencias entre los sistemas jurídicos de ambas naciones que impiden garantizar el cumplimiento de la pena en Francia , y en consecuencia la imposibilidad de México de otorgar su consentimiento para que Cassez purgue su condena en su país .
Finalmente , los mandatarios coincidieron en que la defensa de Florence Cassez pueda agotar las instancias jurídicas a las que tiene derecho , incluyendo la figura del amparo constitucional .
Calderón “ recordó una vez más la plena independencia del Poder Judicial mexicano y expresó que su gobierno dará seguimiento al proceso y que la Constitución mexicana le garantiza un juicio justo y objetivo ” .
Los presidentes además hablaron de impulsar acciones para la Cumbre sobre el Cambio Climático , que será en diciembre .
Last week , my colleagues at G2 turned communist for a day – then wrote up the results in a special issue .
Not that they described it as such , those white - collar professionals with their artfully chosen casualwear and impressively - nuanced views on Cath Kidston .
No , the term they used for this socio-political experiment was camping .
Yet camping and communism share more than similar Scrabble tiles – all those low - scoring Cs and Is and Ms. Consider what happens when you swap your wage - slavery for a rucksack : adult hierarchy is flattened , utensils and resources are pooled .
Tasks are performed as a unit : you may lay on the food , but your friend is a better cook , and her boyfriend will clean the dishes .
There is no question of people being paid differently for different tasks .
Nor , on the G2 outing , did Tim Dowling claim a seven - figure " banjo bonus " for providing a highly - valued service enjoyed by less - talented souls : evidently , he needs some lessons from the nice men at Goldman Sachs .
The connections between the Great Outdoors and political utopia are memorably drawn by G A Cohen in Why Not Socialism ?
At one point in the book , the philosopher lists various objections that could be made to the sharing of resources .
An expert fisherman on the trip might demand more perch than anyone else , for instance , or someone stumbling across an apple tree could ask for more room in the tent before she shows it to the others .
In each case , Cohen argues , the answer from the other campers would be the same : " For heaven 's sake , do n't be such a schmuck . "
People might otherwise live in vastly unequal societies where they are rewarded very differently for their abilities , choices and backgrounds – but deep down everyone recognises the " moral shabbiness " of such regimes .
As a fellow at All Souls college , Oxford , the late Jerry Cohen ( he died last summer , just before his essay was published ) was neither expert on guy - ropes nor particularly enthusiastic about them .
He was a central - heating socialist , really , who preferred his political debate indoors rather than out by the factory gates .
A more outdoorsy philosopher might have acknowledged that someone will always turn up on a camping trip without all the kit , while someone else will always skive off .
Yet they would still wind up at Cohen 's big question : if people choose to live like this for a few weeks each year , what 's to stop them doing so all the time ?
After all , it 's not as if camping is the only situation where the normal rules of pay - as - you - go market exchange are suspended .
Libraries are also commonly funded , which means that the fan of cheap Mills & Boon novels is subsidising the student who consults an expensive encyclopedia .
And others such as Richard Titmuss have written about how blood and organ donors give away these priceless possessions to people whose names they will never know .
Perhaps the attraction of these activities and institutions is that they offer a refuge from the normal capitalist grind .
Certainly , the history of modern camping is the history of people who want to live differently and perhaps more dangerously than they can in big cities .
The American pioneers of camping who set off into the Adirondack wilderness were usually inspired by American Indians and came back with names such as Nessmuk or Black Wolf .
And as the camping writer Matthew De Abaitua points out , British socialists took to camping in the late 19th century because they needed time and space outside the usual limits of working life to discuss politics .
Indeed , the first British holiday camp was expressly socialist .
Founded by John Fletcher Dodd in 1906 , Caister offered communal cold showers and a wake - up call in the early hours that went : " Good morning , comrades ! "
It is precisely that refuge mentality that irritated George Orwell , who thought the left should spend more time winning power and less time on what he saw as quackery .
In The Road to Wigan Pier , Orwell describes a bus ride through Letchworth where two old socialists boarded : " They were dressed in pistachio - coloured shirts and khaki shorts into which their huge bottoms were crammed so tightly you could study every dimple . "
It 's fair to assume they were campers .
But if anything , Cohen 's argument about the communality of camping is more powerful now than it would have been in the 30s .
Why Not Socialism ?
does n't advance an argument for a big interventionist state , but for a society of common bonds .
" Mass engagement , a broad culture of responsibility , mutuality and obligation " .
Jerry Cohen did n't say that ; David Cameron did , in last year 's Hugo Young lecture – and what is on offer in the Marxist philosopher 's book is almost a leftwing riposte to the Tories ' Big Society spiel .
Call it Big Socialism .
The greatest achievement of this little book , though , is that it flips the argument against socialism .
Where the case against organising society differently often rests on its implausibility , Cohen points out that different structures and ways of dealing with each other crop up all the time .
The argument then becomes not whether to have socialism but how to have it .
Or so you might feel if your own summer camping trip ends without torrential rain or glowering acrimony .
Meantime , The North Face can adopt a new advertising slogan : Camping wear for the discerning vanguardiste .
As park - lovers , it ’s our responsibility to dispose of all our garbage correctly .
Here ’s how …
NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Want to lose weight and keep it off ?
The best way to do it is to drop the pounds quickly , not slowly , according to new research .
Scientists at the University of Florida , who studied the link between the rate of initial weight loss and overall success long - term , said shedding weight quickly is the best way to achieve lasting results .
“ Women who lost at a faster rate , greater than 1.5 pounds a week , had lost more and maintained a greater loss in the long run than women who lost at a slower rate of half a pound a week or less , ” said researcher Lisa Nackers , whose findings are published online by the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine .
The women who lost weight faster also kept better food records and ate fewer calories than the other women .
“ It shows if you get off to a quick start ... it pays off more in the long run than making smaller behavioral changes , ” Nackers added in an interview .
About two - thirds of U.S. adults and nearly one in three children are overweight or obese .
Research results have been mixed on whether dropping pounds at a slow or quicker pace is best for overall weight loss in the long term .
Nackers said the jury is still out on which is the best method but her findings support the quick approach .
“ What we concluded in this study is that the results show that perhaps losing at a faster rate is more reinforcing in terms of the learning period of behavior , ” she added .
Nackers suggests that physical appearance , body image , increased energy and better mobility may be improved more by shedding weight quickly which can be encouraging to meet goals .
She and her team studied data on 262 middle - aged women who took part in an obesity treatment trial .
All the women were encouraged to cut calories and do more exercise .
They split the women into three groups , fast , moderate and slow , according to how much weight they lost in the first month .
They also studied how much weight the women had dropped at six and 18 months .
Nackers reported that women in the fast group were five times more likely to achieve a 10 percent loss of their body weight at 18 months than those in the slow group .
Women in the moderate group were nearly three times more likely to reach that milestone than the slow group .
Acting Amsterdam mayor Lodewijk Asscher is considering using police offcers posing as Jews in an attempt to stamp out anti-semitic violence , the Parool reports on Monday .
A spokesman said the suggestion , made last week by Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch , fits in with Asscher ’s decision to take unorthodox measures to try to reduce verbal and physical attacks on Jews in the capital .
Secret tv recordings by the Jewish broadcasting company Joodse Omroep broadcast on Sunday showed young men shouting and making Nazi salutes at a rabbi when he visited different areas of the city .
The city ’s police already use people posing as pensioners and gay men in an effort to catch muggers and gay - bashers .

Drift : A Richly Thoughtful Exploration of a Homeless Man’s Plight
Drift is an intensely thoughtful short film directed by the Australian filmmaker Matthew Chang .
The film follows the discussion of two friends in a restaurant as they watch a homeless man outside on the street and reflect on their own experiences and choices in life .
The friends have widely divergent views about the plight of the homeless man , but the film gives each character ’s perspective a fair hearing .
One ca n’t help but to feel quite surprised by the unexpected twist at the end of the film , which evolves into a keenly observed morality tale that can evoke considerable reflection upon the impact of past events in our own lives .

Oooooooooooooooooooklahoma , where .. huh ... what do we know about Oklahoma ?
I posed that question to six Oilers ' prospects - " what do you know about Oklahoma City ? "
The answer was resounding and unanimous - " Nothing . "
Teemu Hartikainen was caught off - guard when I asked him about about Oklahoma , he said " Actually I do n't know anything about Oklahoma .
I looked at the map and I think the weather must be quite hot all year .
I must find out more about Oklahoma City ! "
Phil Cornet was in the same boat as Hartikainen .
I mentioned the reputation of being home to terrible thunderstorms , tornadoes and ice storms and that clued him in : " I knew about the storms ! " Cornet said .
Other than that , the answer " I do n't know much about the city , " was a familiar refrain from all of the future Barons that talked about the city .
The closest high - level hockey has ever been to Oklahoma City is 190 miles away in Dallas , The closest that any Major Junior player would have come to Oklahoma City is the 890 miles from Plymouth , MI to Oklahoma City , so it 's not shocking that these Oiler prospects would have little knowledge of this heartland haven .
Scott looked at the unbalanced schedule the AHL has put together this season , and given that AHL teams play the vast majority of their games on the weekend , Hartikainen , Cornet and the rest of the young Barons are going to have plenty of time to explore and learn about Oklahoma City .
When I spoke with Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett , he mentioned that downtown Oklahoma City " ... has a lot of vitality to it , " and talked about his city as a tourist destination : " We 're fairly new to being a great city to visit .
We 've always been a good place to live and a great place to raise a family .
But it was n't until this decade that we 've become a good place to visit .... "
Okay , but what mayor does n't say something like that about his city ?
In this case , Mayor Cornett was n't just blowing smoke .
The mayor 's statements have been backed up by the city 's rankings over the last few years .
In 2008 , Forbes named Oklahoma City America 's most recession - proof city , citing " falling unemployment , one of the country 's strongest housing markets , and solid growth in agriculture , energy and manufacturing ... " as reasons the region should shine during the current downturn .
In 2009 , CNN ranked Oklahoma City as the best place to launch a small business startup , citing the low rents , diverse economy and deep - pocketed local investors .
Earlier this spring , Portfolio.com ranked Oklahoma City as the sixth - best city in the country for young adults , saying " The unemployment rate for young adults is lower here than anywhere but Salt Lake City and Tulsa .
Oklahoma City also enjoys the nation ’s third - best pace for annual income growth , a rapid 7.2 percent . "
Those young adults are attracted to the city by the low rents and the available jobs , and they stay in the city because of places like Bricktown , the former railroad warehouse district , recently transformed into the center of the city 's entertainment scene .
The Barons ' home arena , The Cox Center lies directly in the heart of Bricktown ( Why Bricktown ?
It had to be Bricktown ! ) .
It 's that thriving business climate , the location of the arena and all of those young adults that Prodigal Hockey is counting on when it comes to filling the Cox Center for at least forty nights during the 2010 - 11 AHL season .
The Oklahoma City Blazers of the Central Hockey League drew 8,000 fans per game , 1,800 of them corporate ticket holders .
That was more than 27 of the 29 AHL teams averaged last season .
Though the Barons are now playing second fiddle to the Oklahoma City Thunder , if Prodigal Hockey can convert the fan and corporate support for the lower - level CHL Blazers into support for the Barons , the real possibility exists that Oklahoma be among the league leaders in attendance .
Though the weather remains the largest downside ( does the Cox Center have a tornado - proof room for the Barons like the Thunder have at their facility ? ) , if the Barons can avoid the heat waves , the tornadoes , the hail storms , the thunderstorms , the floods , the ice storms and the freak blizzards , Oklahoma City should be a welcoming home .
NAACP vs. Tea Party : Racism Debate Heats Up as Sarah Palin Joins the Fray NAACP president says tea party leaders need to take responsibility .
July 13 , 2010  --
The NAACP 's resolution condemning what it calls racist elements within the Tea Party is drawing fire from top Tea Party supporters , including Sarah Palin , as the civil rights group 's president insists the party needs to " expel racists from the ranks . "
" For more than a year we 've watched as Tea Party members have called congressmen the N - word , have called congressmen the F - word .
We see them carry racist signs and whenever it happens , the membership tries to shirk responsibility , " NAACP President Ben Jealous said in an interview with ABC News .
" If the Tea Party wants to be respected and wants to be part of the mainstream in this country , they have to take responsibility . "
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People this evening unanimously passed a resolution that calls on Tea Party members to repudiate what Jealous says are " ultra - nationalist and racist factions within the organization . "
The resolution said the Tea Party members have used " racial epithets , " have verbally abused black members of Congress and threatened them , and protestors have engaged in " explicitly racist behavior " and " displayed signs and posters intended to degrade people of color generally and President Barack Obama specifically . "
Jealous specifically pointed to signs at rallies portraying President Obama as a witch doctor , and to claims made by Rep. John Lewis , D - Ga. , and Rep. Emanuel Cleaver , D - Mo. , that Tea Party protestors opposing health care reform hurled racial slurs at them .
" They need to be unequivocal and they need to be responsible and get the bigots out of their organization .
It 's that simple , " Jealous added .
Tea Party supporters have denied allegations of racism and argue that there is no proof to support the NAACP 's claims .
Conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart even offered $ 100,000 to anyone who could produce an audio recording or video footage of the " N - word " being hurled at Rep. Lewis and other members of Congress .
The St. Louis Tea Party coalition on Monday evening passed a resolution of its own condemning the NAACP for " hypocritically engaging in the very conduct it purports to oppose . "
The resolution calls on the NAACP to withdraw its resolution .
It even urges the IRS to reconsider its tax - exempt status of the NAACP because of what the Tea Party coalition dubbed the organization 's " habitual partisan political behavior . "
Former Alaska Gov. Palin , a vocal advocate of the Tea Party movement , jumped into the heated race debate Monday night , assailing the NAACP resolution as an example of " typical divisive politics that is so absolutely unnecessary . "
" The Tea Party movement is a beautiful movement , full of diverse people , diverse backgrounds , " Palin said on Fox News ' " Hannity . "
" It 's very unfortunate that they are taking this tactic because it's a false accusation that Tea Party Americans are racist .
Any good American hates racism .
We do n't stand for it .
It is unacceptable . "
Palin in turn called on President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama to " repudiate " the resolution and " set the record straight . "
The former GOP vice presidential candidate tweeted her support for the Tea Party again today : " I 'm busy today so notify me asap when NAACP renders verdict : are liberty - loving , equality - respecting patriots racist ?
Bated breath , waiting ... "
Other Tea Party loyalists charge the NAACP 's charges are driven solely by political motivations and are misguided .
" Those ideas that Tea Party people are racist and that we 're trying to instigate a racist climate in this country , that 's simply a lie .
That 's out and out falsehood , " said Rev. C.L. Bryant , a former president of NAACP 's Garland , Texas , chapter who is now a leading Tea Party activist .
" I have not heard one racial slur that came out of that march , " said Bryant , referring to the Tea Party protest on Capitol Hill where members of Congress alleged racist comments .
" Those were simply Americans who were protesting . "
NAACP Vs. Tea Party
Even as Tea Party leaders and supporters fight back against charges of racism , the NAACP is explicitly calling on leaders like Palin , Kentucky GOP Senate hopeful Rand Paul and FreedomWorks chairman Dick Armey to take responsibility .
" Sarah Palin needs to have the courage to call out the racists amongst her supporters and let them know that she will not tolerate them , " Jealous said .
" What 's divisive is calling a rally , having a whole bunch of bigots show up and welcoming them .
...
The Tea Party needs to clean its own house as all responsible organizations do . "
On Monday , in a fiery speech at the convention in Kansas City , Mo. , Jealous challenged Paul to a debate on civil rights .
Paul , another high profile supporter of the Tea Party , came under fire in May for criticizing the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
" If we want to harbor in on private businesses and their policies , then you have to have the discussion about , ' Do you want to abridge the First Amendment as well , ' " Paul said on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow show .
" If you decide that restaurants are publicly owned and not privately owned , then do you say that you should have the right to bring your gun into the restaurant , even though the owner of the restaurant says , well , no , we do n't want to have guns in here . "
Paul later said he supports the Act and opposes discrimination , but stood by his belief that the government does n't have a right to tell private restaurant owners who they can and cannot serve .
The NAACP is demanding more answers .
" If you want to debate civil rights , and the Civil Rights Act , Rand Paul , my message to you is this : show the backbone and answer my challenge , set a date and I and the NAACP will be there , " Jealous said Monday .
Support for the Tea Party movement among Americans remains divided .
Twenty - seven percent of Americans support the movement , according to a May ABC News / Washington Post poll , but nearly as many Americans oppose it .
The poll also found that 57 percent of people who opposed the Tea Party suspected its members of racial prejudice specifically against Obama .
Only 10 percent of Tea Party supporters expressed such a sentiment .
NAACP leaders have taken on the Tea Party individually in the past , but the organization has stepped up its efforts against the movement .
In addition to jobs and the economy , much of this year 's convention was dedicated to building momentum against the Tea Party .
The NAACP , in coordination with 170 other groups , including labor unions , is planning a protest march in Washington , D.C. , Oct. 2 as the next step in building momentum against the Tea Party .
The " One Nation " march is designed as an antithesis to the Tea Party , and it's about " pulling America together and back to work , " said NAACP spokeswoman Leila McDowell .

I ’m not writing to offer an apologia , but I have to say , life in the oilfield was wonderful .
How much of that wonder was due to my youth — as well as the specific joy of youthfulness in the 1980s — and how much of the wonder was due to the nature of the work — the joy of the hunt — I can not be sure .
I think it must have been mostly the joy of the hunt , for there were old guys ( there were almost never any women ) who pursued the oil and gas with just as much fervor as the younger geologists .
We never called it crude , or black gold , or Texas tea .
There were no clever nicknames , there was only the pure thing itself — oil if in the liquid state , or gas , if gaseous — that , and our pure and steady fever , our burning .
If we ever referred to it as anything other than oil or gas , we called it pay .
Four feet of pay , twenty feet of pay , thirty feet of pay .
Sixty feet of pay was a lot , enough to change your life .
I worked for a small independent oil and gas company , which was owned by a wealthy individual who drilled his wells with the aid of a group of a dozen or so investors , rich people who believed in him and in us , but who were also entirely willing to stop believing if we one day ceased to be successful .
Speaking only for myself , I did n’t ever worry about that .
I never mapped a prospect , never drilled a well that I did n’t believe was going to find pay .
Success rates were somewhere in the neighborhood of baseball batting averages — between ten and thirty percent — but the baseball metaphor does not carry much further than that , other than perhaps the ability to salvage a game — or a career — with one certain swing , a key strike at the most critical time .
It was n’t like baseball at all .
It was n’t like anything .
The closest thing was maybe hunting — pursuing , with blind instinct and whetted desire and only a handful of clues , the hint of one ’s quarry far into the wonderful wilderness of the unknown .
Lands no man or woman ever saw , or ever will see , ten thousand feet below the ground .
Beaches that received sunlight and warm winds hundreds of millions of years before the strange , momentary experiment of mankind arrived , cold and shivering and with neither fire nor fur .
Beaches that were then buried over , still hundreds of millions of years before we first stirred , so anomalous and far from the spine of the main and older tree of life .
* * *
You were haunted by dry holes .
The nature of the work — the rarity of the treasure — dictates that you ’re wrong more often than you ’re right .
This rarity is what makes the pay - off so spectacular .
But despite knowing this , after each dry hole , you could n’t sleep .
You could n’t believe your maps were wrong .
The earth was wrong , you told yourself .
You must have just missed the pay by a few inches .
Not by miles , but by inches .
I believe the word for such behavior is denial , a noun commonly associated with its closest cousin , addiction .
We were addicted to the intensity of our hunger — the almost limitless depths of it — and to the certitude that we were needed , that we were vital .
Such a feeling is not quite as wonderful as the condition of being loved , but it is similar , with its dependencies , and far more reliable .
Something that ’s not being reported in the press is how deep the blowing - out formation is , or if BP even knows from what formation the hydrocarbons are spewing , or how thick the formation is .
Typically , the larger reservoirs are deeper , but the fact that this one is blowing black oil ( deeper horizons generally contain oil that is greenish in color and , at even greater depths , exist as natural gas rather than oil , due to the pressure at those depths ) suggests the resevoir might be a shallower formation than BP was prepared for .
Shallower , and yet larger : maybe the biggest in the world .
Maybe they punctured , and tapped into , a thinly buried transoceanic pipeline .
Is anyone missing a few million barrels of oil — half a day ’s worth or so ?
Why is this formation , this reservoir , behaving so monstrously , with enormous and apparently increasing flow rates ?
Is an immense salt dome — plumes of salt , ten thousand feet thick — swelling and bulging , flowing like a gel and squeezing this reservoir ?
Is this reservoir belching its gas in erratic hiccups and burps ?
What makes us so sure , with all the geologic intestinal pressure , that the relief wells wo n’t blow out ?
Highly experienced oil rig operators from Norway , the Netherlands , and elsewhere are offering their assistance .
So far , it seems , we have n’t accepted much more than oil - skimming booms and other bits of equipment .
Why are n’t we accepting more help ?
National pride ?
Strange maritime laws ?
Film crews , photographers , and reporters are also apparently restricted from entering public air space near the Deepwater rig , and some journalists say they ’ve been denied access to oil - stained beaches by Coast Guard and BP officials .
Who benefits from this secrecy — other than BP ?
Has anyone thought about the fact that hurricanes in the northern hemisphere rotate counterclockwise ?
When — not if — one strikes , this will likely drive the oil up onto the Texas coast .
I ’m sure Texas governor Rick Perry has the oil booms and the National Guard already mobilized , right ?
We ’ll see how firmly he ’ll hold on to his Tea Party secessionist dreams at that point .
My guess ?
He ’ll be crying for the feds ’ billions faster than you can say , “ Bobby Jindal . ”
* * *
It ’s not enough to distrust BP , or any large corporation .
These days , you have to know how they work , the ins and outs of each industry , and the secret heart , secret ethos that governs the spiritless movement of each through our stressed history .
I ’m here to tell you , BP does n’t intend to just walk away from this beast , this monster , empty - handed .
They will be lured back to it again and again .
What I am wondering is why BP has n’t tried to cap the well yet , now that they have a housing over it — to insert a one - inch tube into the pipestring , the slender mile - long straw they currently have attached to the makeshift cap , and pump concrete down that tube .
While BP has tried the so - called “ top kill ” maneuver — an unsuccessful attempt to push heavier - than - water drilling fluids down into the well to eventually stop the jet of oil — to my knowledge they have n’t yet tried pumping heavier - than - everything concrete .
If oil can go up that pipestring , as is currently happening — tens of thousands of barrels a day — then concrete can probably be pumped down .
This seems to me to be BP ’s best chance to deliver a knockout punch and cap it and kill it before the hurricane season really gets going .
Apparently no one has thought to ask this .
The BP folks are sitting on this , and so many other things , like a secret .
Their inside knowledge of a not - so - terribly complex technology is their power .
Unlike the formulas for the secret recipes of benzene and toluene that Halliburton pumps downhole into these same wells — their “ frac ” ( short for fracture ) fluids that are potent enough to dissolve the interstitial cement of the aeons , allowing a little more gas to seep up the wellbore — this knowledge is not a trade secret .
If oil can come up the makeshift string , concrete can go down it .
I have n’t heard one person ask about this .
We ’re just standing by the side , vesting our power and authority to the people who least should have it .
We ’re all indignant — we , who with every mile driven , every mouthful of food eaten ( organic or otherwise ) , are complicit — but ours is not a righteous indignation , and we know it .
Instead , we feel the grief and depression wrought by extreme self - loathing ; and there is much to loathe , these days .
It ’s extremely hard to imagine a path to rehabilitation .
We need a model for changing identity and renouncing addiction , and yet there is none .
No wonder we ’re frightened and angry .
I used to live down on the Gulf and I feel guilty that I am not more depressed — more devastated — by this toxic gush into the heart of the Gulf , or what remains of the Gulf , riddled already as it is with massive dead zones and floating islands of plastic three miles long — islands large enough to colonize and build resorts upon .
To possess an ecological awareness , wrote the American ecologist Aldo Leopold seventy years ago , is to understand that we live in a world of wounds .
The shrimp were on their way toward extinction in the Gulf anyway , due to our channelization of the Mississippi River , the great source of their nutrients .
Our flood control of that vast living system is robbing billions of tons of sediment that would otherwise keep building the Louisiana delta and marshes that the shrimp nurseries depend upon , and which serve as a buffer against hurricanes .
South Louisiana is sinking fast without this sediment .
As this happens , the shrimp populations will blaze out with one final pulse of productivity ( toxic productivity now , for as the marshes sink and disintegrate beneath the storms , they will release one last burst of nutrients themselves ) — but there is no more capital ; the marshes are living on the debt of the past .
That does n’t make what BP did right .
* * *
The corporation of BP — possessing now , due to a rightwing Supreme Court , the constitutional rights of an individual , but none of the responsibilities — is buying up ad space on the internet under the phrase “ oil spill . ”
They are contributing billions to Congresspeople who grovel before them .
The oil companies tell us we ca n’t afford to combat global warming , and that we ca n’t afford to not drill in sensitive areas .
Such bans will make the cost of oil go up , cry the watchers of Fox News .
But what we are not acknowledging in our addiction is that oil and gas are as heavily subsidized as any other American industry .
Many of the corporations ’ costs are externalized to the consumer , so that our energy consumption , energy addiction , is dependent upon such sleight - of - hand accountings as those that attend to any of the other socialized price supports that right - wingers pretend to find so terrifying .
The multinational oil and gas corporations — the biggest companies in the world , which in no way care whether America lives or dies , is free or captive , healthy or poisoned — have long succeeded in manipulating the US Congress to assume many of the costs of production , transport , health care issues , global warming , the clean - up of toxic spills , etc .
Part of the secret of “ cheap oil , ” as we are finding out , is that it is not so cheap .
Instead , we are paying our giddy debt forward with ferocious momentum .
Even when they drill on US - held properties — public land and government leases owned by the government — they refuse to let the government know what ’s going on : even when the government is a partner in the drilling , via farm - out and override royalty interests , the oil companies refuse to let the government see certain papers and equations , such as the formulas of the fracture fluid the oil companies inject into the well bores and into those public lands , where the fluids make their way into public drinking supplies .
It ’s a trade secret , the oil companies say .
They could patent the toxic brew , the earth - killing concoction , and protect their trade secret that way .
Maybe they do n’t because they know it ’s so toxic it would be illegal .
But it ’s illegal to not share it .
Our government just lies down , intimidated by the myth of science , and by the power of big oil .
Even today , big British oil is telling the media that they ’ll be around in the Gulf for the long haul .
What cheekiness !
Is n’t it we - the - people who should be telling them that it ’s actually we who will be the ones deciding how long they ’ll be around ?
The $ 20 billion “ trust fund ” Obama negotiated is a drop in the bucket .
This brings us to the matter of the so - called relief wells that BP keeps promising to drill .
In more manageable environments , a relief well is slant - hole drilled , with the new well bore trying to angle in and intercept the existing wellbore of the blown - out well , so that heavy mud or concrete can be pumped into the reservoir , tamping down and ultimately extinguishing the well .
New technologies make it easier than it used to be , but still it seems a long - shot proposition — imagine the odds of intercepting the same slender bore hole ( ten-inch diameter ) from a thousand or more feet away and maybe ten thousand feet above — trying to aim two miles of flexible pipe toward such a miniscule target while drilling through ancient stone .
Sometimes it works ; other times the pipe gets stuck or breaks .
The truth is that nothing has worked so far .
My fear — my belief — is that we ’ve gone way too far out into the deep end , to a place where not only are the old - school inland physics of the oilfield profession irrelevant or misleading , but to a place where the pressure of deep - horizon reservoirs and their behavior is largely unknown .
We ’re drilling on theory , but in the meantime the earth is blowing out its spume in reality .
Sometimes — sometimes — a well blowing out with tremendous vehemence will eventually collapse on itself .
The formation will begin to cave in around the borehole , without pipe being set , sealing off the formation like a boulder , or boulders , being rolled in front of a cave .
We might eventually get lucky — too little , too late , of course , and despite BP ’s secrecy and ineptitude .
Is this the best we can hope for ?
But even if it does collapse on itself and we are saved from our own dumbness by dumb luck , then what ?
The disparity between what we do n’t know and the depth of our hunger is a gulf of terrifying size and immediacy .
What ’s going on in these deepwater prospects is reminiscent of gold mining in the 1880s , where crews would turn giant hydraulic hoses on entire mountains and sluice the whole mountain away , washing it downstream , bathing the spoils in acid in order to gather the scant nuggets within .
Barbaric , we say of those miners and those times , primitive .
But it was all they knew .
Their technology was not commensurate with their appetites .
Nor will it ever be .
Call it the inverse of Moore ’s Law ; human appetites have always been expanding at a rate greater than the rate of technological advance ; this disparity is what helps fuel technological advance .
If the first well blew out despite the heavy drilling mud , why on earth does anyone who knows anything about this think the second and third well wo n’t blow , too ?
No one knows the size and nature of this reservoir that ’s been discovered — no one .
The only way to drill with heavier mud would be to use concrete , which is what you use to plug a well , not a producer , so why bother ?
What I suspect the BP executives are thinking is this :
We ’ll try and get some other boreholes into this reservoir and produce it before the government shuts us down .
Yes , it ’s a risk , but maybe we ’ll get lucky , maybe we can manage to keep the monster in check next time .
Maybe it ’s not as big and strong as we fear it is , and yet as we hope it is .
It ’s worth the risk , they must be thinking .
If the relief wells blow out too , what ’s more oil on top of oil ?
They ca n’t help but be doing the math .
Sixty thousand barrels a day from two wells multiplied by 365 days a year at eighty dollars a barrel with a thirty - year reservoir must be starting to look like real money .
Why , that ’s over $ 100 billion , from just two wells ?
It makes the $ 20 billion relief fund seem but a drop in the bucket .
A profit .
* * *
In every industry , in every country , our old economic models are falling apart like wet cardboard .
The old models hold up for a while , but they are not holding up anymore , and hurricane season is upon us .
BP needs to try to put a thinner tube down through their well housing as fast as they can , pump concrete into the formation , and then walk away .
They will never walk away .
Maybe it sounds hypocritical , my nostalgia and support of the small independent oil and gas producers who work not in fragile public wildlands , but in old inland basins in the south and east , where the wilderness has long fled .
And maybe I am something of a hypocrite .
I have solar panels on my home , I drive an old Subaru — but still , my footprint is huge , and my appetite is huge .
Every time we blink , we are using oil ; the food distribution systems that give us our calories to blink , to speak , to laugh and love , to rail against the government , come from petroleum , we are choking and drowning on oil , our affluence is short - lived and unsustainable , and now , with the same sudden panic known perhaps to the brown pelicans whose oil - soaked wings will no longer keep them aloft or afloat on the shining gulf waters that were their home for the last 40 million years , we are sinking , overburdened , going under .
People are scrambling , trying to rescue us , and we are trying to rescue each other , but we are all going under .
The true price of oil in my estimation is currently somewhere around $ 300 a barrel .
Too expensive !
you cry , even as we are shelling out $ 325 for it right now .
Carrying BP ’s water .
Carrying their buckets of oilsoaked sand .
Carrying the trillions of dollars of productivity being lost due to global warming .
Like children , or adolescents , we ignore the consequences of our choices , day after day , and the full and extended costs .
There may not be an industry or a corporation we do n’t carry on our backs , whether health care or automakers , banking or real estate speculation or home mortgages or mining or logging or farming .
It is all imperfectly accounted for , we have all been living too high , hiding the true costs of things .
When I remember my days in the oilfield , there ’s one image that comes to me most often .
I was in my late twenties , working eighty - hour weeks : burning the candle at both ends .
We were drilling a deep well down in the swamps of south Louisiana , in a location so far beyond the end of the road that we had had to construct our own floating road of lashed - together boards — broad planks of cypress — to go out into the swamp another mile or two , extending our reach .
It was a big project .
It was dark and I was driving through the swamp and through the forest in the darkness in a heavy rain , going a little too fast .
The floating road was slightly underwater in places , so that often I was bluffing , aiming the company vehicle from point A to point C , trusting my route would get me there , and that I would stay on the floating road .
As if my will or desire alone was enough to make it so .
I drifted off , however , and the car nosed down into the swamp .
I can barely recall the strength and nonchalance of the young man I was — the hunger I had for the world .
It did n’t bother me at all that water was now gushing into the car .
It was n’t my car , it was the company ’s .
I was on a mission .
I picked up the well logs , put them in my briefcase , climbed out through the window , and continued down the slick board road , ankle - deep in swamp .
I walked for a long time .
Finally I saw a faint lone light in the woods , an old shack with one lantern .
If the light had not been burning I would never have believed anyone inhabited the leaning shanty .
I hated to do it , but I needed to see if they had a phone .
I paused , then rapped on the door .
I had assumed the inhabitants were sleeping soundly — my approach had been soundless — but so instantaneous came the reply to my knock that the two events , my knock and the dweller ’s subsequent inquiry , seemed simultaneous .
The voice of an old black woman rang like a shot — “ State yo’ name ! ” — and was shouted with such authority that I did n’t hesitate in the least , but answered her right back , “ Rick Bass ! ” — as if the name of a twenty - five year - old white boy from Hinds County meant anything .
Miraculously — as if I had uttered the one correct phrase that would gain entrance — she opened the door , and like a witch , she welcomed me in .
For whatever reason .
She did n’t have a phone .
I could n’t tell if it was a question of access , or if she simply scorned them .
I visited a while , then went on up the muddy road , toward the tiny backwoods village several miles distant , and the cinder block hotel where I could rent an old beater car from the night clerk , a sled that would get me back to Jackson before daylight , so that the glowing lit world , the world of myth — the world we did not yet know enough not to believe in — could continue .
Looking back , everything about my answer amazes me : the unapologetic cheeriness of it , neither arrogant nor insouciant .
I knew it explained nothing , but that no explanation was needed .
I was on a mission : not quite a hero , but a messenger from the gods .
If she wanted to have my name — if that was what was most important — she could have it .
The night was young and I would get out of this just fine .
I had made it out to the rig all right — the glow of the tower , isolated in that dark forest , looked like the glow that might come from the landing of an extraterrestrial spacecraft , and steam rose from the pipe that was being pulled from the hole , the drillstring steaming and smoking like something being born , the roar of diesel engines like that from an army , if not a civilization , a town .
I had been there , gathered the treasure , and was headed back .
I had the treasure in hand , and was driving the logs back to Jackson , several hours north .
It seems impossible that not so long ago there were no cell phones or scanners , no computers or even faxes .
We had a crude portable instrument called a telecopier that we carried in a briefcase , like a portable nuclear bomb , but its transmission of the logs was blurry and stuttery ; the preferred method was for me to just ferry them to the bosses , as if by Pony Express , pulling up in front of their mansions at three , four in the morning , knocking on the door .
They answered in their bathrobes .
We would spread the paper logs out on the table like Biblical documents .
The light seemed different , back then , and at that hour , in the kitchen — a gold light — while we studied the logs , and saw for the first time , the fruit of our labors , the degree of our wealth , with exhaustion limning the edges of our vision .
Who would not want to live such a life ?
We kept the world going .
We carried the world on our backs while the world slept , and we kept it going ; for as long as we kept going forward , the world kept going forward .
I remember those days so well : the power and heady feeling of being needed , of possessing a valuable and honored — and honorable — skill .
Finding oil is an honorable skill .
The independents — who are fast going out of business , like the independents in any industry — still know this .
The giant corporations we have entrusted blindly with world - power care nothing for words like honor .
* * *
This is the dangerous truth .
The hungers in the men and women who are working the crane lift - gear levers of those blind husks and blind souls of corporations are every bit as hungry as you or I .
They are good at what they do and are on fire with their hunger and they will track the oil down to the ends of the earth .
But they — unlike the independents — have no limits on their powers .
They will find it , and will drill into it , no matter what the depth , no matter what the pressure .
If we continue drilling at such absurd depths , this will not be the first such blow - out .
It will instead only be the first one , the one that disturbed our blithe innocence .
President Obama says that as a nation we have to grow up now , have to put away childish things , and that our moment is now .
We ’ll see .
Good week this week .
Work has been going well , I ’ve been able to justifiably spend my time watching lame 90s slasher films , there ’s been good news over at the Labs ( more on that in a minute ) , and I ’ve been able to order my new phone .
My trusty purple one ( I ’m a tech whiz , I know ) has lasted me two years and I ’m going to miss it but it is half - dead so it ’s time for a change .
So I ’m getting … a blue one !
Apparently it can do internet and email and stuff which is exciting .
Who knows , maybe this time next week I ’ll be writing my newsletter on my phone ?
Either that or I ’ll be curled up in a corner , crying and demanding the return of my old brick phone !
I ’m also considering getting a new tattoo .
I ’ve already got a Chinese symbol meaning “ star ” on my back but I ’m thinking of consolidating my geekiness by getting something Doctor Who or horror themed .
Just something little and preferably somewhere my mum ca n’t see it !
Any suggestions ?
( As to the what , not the where ! )
So , what have I got in store for you this week ?
Well , there has been some incredibly awesome news regarding the Arrow release of Inferno which I will get on to shortly .
I ’ve also got some of the best bits from the Cult Labs forum and all the usual bits and bobs .
Enjoy …

CULT LABS MEMBERS IN HISTORIC BBFC VICTORY
When the BBFC passed Dario Argento ’s Inferno with cuts to a scene showing a cat eating a mouse , Cult Labs members were understandably annoyed to say the least .
Many saw it as ridiculous that something as natural as a cat eating a mouse could be considered unsuitable for consumption .
Others were concerned that the BBFC was inhibiting UK distributors on the world stage by impeding sales .
Many members emailed the BBFC to question this cut and on Monday , Almar was able to announce that , against all expectations , the BBFC had waived all proposed cuts and had passed Inferno to be released on DVD and Blu-ray uncut with an 18 certificate .
Needless to say , this news has been met with delight by pretty much everyone concerned , not least those who are responsible for releasing Inferno in the UK .
“ The initial BBFC cut of 5 seconds from Inferno was made because it was n’t clear whether the filmmakers deliberately caused suffering to an animal or not , ” says Alex of Arrow Films .
“ Thankfully , the BBFC have come to their senses and the cut has been waived .
This reversal of decision is absolutely the correct one .
I can say that , without doubt , the campaign brought about by the Cult Labs members to waive these cuts through their articulacy and logical reasoning effected this reversal from the BBFC .
As a distributor , to be able to release this work of art as it was supposed to be seen means we can release the film without the stress of an incomplete version and all that that entails , hanging over our heads .
So thank you to all those who lent their voice to this cause . ”
Cult Labs head honcho , Almar , had this to add : “ It ’s not the done thing to question cuts but when the members of Cult Labs starting writing carefully crafted , well argued and undeniably persuasive e-mails to the BBFC , it helped spur Arrow to try again and , combined , it seemed to do the trick .
I think this has served as a powerful reminder that unless you make the effort to question authority when you think it is wrong then you have no right to complain about it .
Well reasoned thoughts were submitted for the consideration of the BBFC and to their credit they seem to have listened and made the right decision which is to be applauded and I ’m quite moved by the efforts of the members of Cult Labs – it ’s been a positive and energising experience and means we get a valuable piece of horror motion picture art now presented in full in the UK for the first time as it should be .
Cult Labs members have made history . ”
So , fellow Cult Labbers , please give yourselves a big pat on the back .
As Almar so deftly puts it , you have made history and have shown that intelligent and reasoned protest from those passionate enough to make it can win out .
To discuss this and other Inferno - related topics , head on over to the dedicated Inferno forum .
Well done , and thank you .
THERE’S SOMETHING GOING ON AT THE LABORATORY
Starting to get super - excited about my new phone .
Planning tomorrow around staying in and waiting for the courier .
I ’ve never had a blue phone before – how pretty !
Apparently I can also use Twitter on it which means I can follow all the updates from @cultlabs which , quite frankly , will just make my day !
So while I ’m double checking I wo n’t need to pop out for anything tomorrow , why do n’t I catch you up on what ’s going on over at the Labs ?
A Lizard in a Woman ’s Skin UK DVD
Out this week is A Lizard in a Woman ’s Skin , released on DVD by Optimum .
This Fulci favourite has instigated some hot debate and interest over on the forums .
This is the longest , most complete version of the film ever released , with a gorgeously restored print overseen by Marc Morris .
Almar thinks we need to “ prepare to fall in love all over again , ” while stevoj says “ I ’ve never seen it but I ’m buying it purely because of the artwork and Florinda Bolkan . ”
Meanwhile , g053584398 reckons
” The framing of the Optimum version looks superior to the others , the image looks stronger and the colours look more natural too . ”
What do you think ?
Will you be buying Lizard ?
If you ’ve bought it already , what do you think ?
Let us know here !
Love Goddess of the Cannibals ( SHAM022 )
More and more excitement is growing for this D’amato sleaze - fest now .
The BBFC has passed it uncut , complete with cockfighting scene and the Shameless print will include some restoration to short sequences previously removed due to negative damage .
The forums have been reflecting a positive reception for the film , with The Reaper Man describing it as a “ cracking result for Shameless , ” and Nosferatu saying , “ Another welcome release from Shameless of a film that I have n’t seen , let alone heard of !
The artwork , as usual , looks great and , from what I ’ve read , appropriately sleazy ! ”
What are your thoughts on Love Goddess ?
Are you as excited as the rest of us ?
Let us know what you think !
Merantau Warrior
Another film causing a lot of excitement ( and out this week ) is Merantau Warrior , an adrenaline - charged martial arts action film that will no doubt leave you gagging for more .
Philleh describes it as a “ damn fine beat ‘ em up , ” while Arrrrrrrach calls it “ an awesome film . ”
On this Damage Depot thread , Sam has been good enough to post links to his Merantau blog along with trailers and videos so pop along and check them out .
And if you ’ve seen the film , why not let us know what you think ?
THE BEST OF THE REST

We 've just uploaded to SourceForge our first ever Debian - based virtual appliance : a beta of TurnKey Core on the rock stable Lenny release .
It has about the same features as the Ubuntu 10.04 based Core beta we released a couple of weeks ago with a few minor exceptions ( e.g. , grub instead of grub - pc , byobu not included ) .
Ubuntu - Debian chimeras considered harmful
Most users probably do n't realize it but a handful of our current crop of " Ubuntu based " appliances are actually Ubuntu - Debian chimeras .
The package management system ( APT ) is technically capable of mixing packages from different distributions .
We took advantage of that to configure some TurnKey appliances to get security updates directly from Debian for certain packages which were not supported on Ubuntu .
Unfortunately it 's a relatively complicated hack that relies on poorly documented , rarely used , and consequently buggy APT functionality .
It has n't back - fired yet , but we 'd rather not wait for that to happen .
TurnKey appliances are configured to auto - update security fixes by default so safety and robustness is a key concern .
We do n't want to risk breaking anything in the future .
Better safe than sorry !
So from now on , no more chimeras .
The upcoming Ubuntu Lucid based appliances will be 100 % Ubuntu , even if that means some packages do n't get security updates .
Are Debian based appliances worth the trouble ?
This brings us to our dilemma .
Guaranteed security updates for all packages are a big deal , at least for us .
And only Debian provides that .
Which got us thinking .
How much extra work would it take to also build a Debian - based TurnKey Core ?
And would the interest from the community justify the effort ?
Bottom line : it was a bit harder than we anticipated but we made it happen and now we need the community 's help in figuring out if it matters .
Though we have n't committed to it yet , we are seriously considering Debian - based builds of all TurnKey Linux appliances .
But that depends on the feedback we get from you and the level of interest in this .
Frankly , we do n't have the resources to thoroughly test both Debian and Ubuntu based builds of all TurnKey appliances .
That means to pull this off we 'll need all the help we can get testing Betas , providing feedback on issues that come up , filing and triaging bug reports , etc .
If you care about TurnKey on Debian , we 'll need you to step up to the plate and help us make it happen .
Ubuntu vs. Debian : the story so far ...
So far TurnKey has been known as an Ubuntu based open source project so this move towards Debian may come as a surprise to some , but those of you who have been following closely know that Debian support has actually been in our sights since TurnKey 's conception .
One of our first polls asked : would you prefer virtual appliances based on Ubuntu or Debian ?
Results so far ( based on 763 votes ) :
62 % : Ubuntu for both client and sever roles
23 % : Debian for server roles , Ubuntu for client roles
15 % : Debian for both client and server roles
Despite a clear preference for Ubuntu ( which is better known due to its popularity on the desktop ) , a significant 38 % still prefer Debian for server roles .
This resonates with us because when TurnKey was still on the drawing board a couple of years ago we debated Ubuntu vs. Debian extensively .
In the end Ubuntu won by a slim margin but it was a tough call !
I 'll talk a little bit about the thought process behind that because despite a couple of years going by the big picture has n't really changed .
Back then we were mainly using Ubuntu on our desktops and Debian on our servers and frankly Debian seemed like a more natural choice for a server - oriented virtual appliance library .
The " main " problem with Ubuntu is that only a subset of packages in the " main " component are officially supported with security updates .
By contrast , Debian supported all 25,000 packages with carefully backported , well tested security fixes that could be safely applied to a production system .
Debian is also rock solid in terms of stability , which is something you usually want in a server operating system , even when it comes at the expense of having the latest package versions .
On the other hand Ubuntu 8.04 ( Hardy ) , a Long Term Support version had just been released and Debian Lenny was still a work in progress .
Stability comes at a price , and it's one of the main reasons for Debian 's notoriously slow release cycle .
But we did n't want to wait who knew how long or start a new project on an old distribution ...
Plus , we shared Ubuntu 's values regarding making open source accessible to everyone , not just savvy experts .
That meant encouraging a community atmosphere in which everyone was welcome and treated with respect .
Which is why we adopted the Ubuntu Code of Conduct .
Unfortunately , the Debian community had a reputation for being more withdrawn and elitist .
Ubuntu 's popular appeal was also a factor .
Let 's face it , today Ubuntu has far better name recognition than Debian , though I think that 's mostly due to superior marketing and more effective leadership .
Having a wealthy benevolent dictator that can bankroll the operation definitely has a few advantages ( and disadvantages ! ) .
But keep in mind that though Ubuntu and Debian do inevitably compete for users in some areas , they are n't really in direct opposition .
In fact , every 6 months a new version of Ubuntu begins its life from a snapshot of the unstable Debian version in development .
Certainly Ubuntu deserves credit for pushing the envelope in areas like usability , but it 's Debian 's self - governed volunteer workforce of over 1600 developers that do much of the unglamorous heavy lifting .
Long story short , try the beta and tell us what you think .
Obviously we have immense respect for both distributions and we'd like to hear your views on where we should take it from here .
The national debt will reach 62 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) by the end of this year , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) said Wednesday .
The budget office said the debt will reach its highest percentage of GDP since the end of World War II .
The jump is driven by lower tax revenues and higher federal spending in the recent recession .

And while the national debt would stabilize at 67 percent of GDP over the next decade if current law were maintained , extending tax cuts enacted during the administration of President George W. Bush and keeping growth in appropriations in line with inflation would mean that the debt would reach almost 90 percent of GDP by 2020 .
By contrast , GDP has averaged " a little above " 36 percent per year over the past 40 years .
The report comes as President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE 's fiscal commission meets again on Wednesday to work on crafting solutions to reining in deficits and the debt over time .
Obama got somewhat of a chilly reception from world leaders at the G - 20 summit over the past weekend when he pressed them to continue with spending to bolster the global economy .
Many nations in Europe and elsewhere have had to grapple with their own debt crises , and have been forced to enact tough austerity measures .
Republicans have been hammering away at the president and Democrats in Congress for their spending over the past year and a half , arguing that the stimulus act , healthcare reform law and other measures have done little more than exacerbate the nation 's fiscal situation .
But the bigger long - term problem , according to CBO , remains Medicare .
CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in a blog post explaining the new report that under current laws , " federal spending on major mandatory healthcare programs will grow from roughly 5 percent of GDP today to about 10 percent in 2035 and will continue to increase thereafter . "
Keeping current policies in place would almost certainly force lawmakers to make steep spending cuts and raise taxes , Elmendorf argued , unless changes to address the problems were made sooner rather than later .

Alicia Lewis , victim of the Sarah Palin Attack Machine Speaks Out : Inside a young student ’s experience with a powerful political personality and leader of the Tea Party , who labels those who do n’t agree with her as personal enemies and political operatives .
When Alicia Lewis attempted to hold CSU fiscally accountable , she found herself on the wrong end of Palin ’s attack machine .
Advertisements
An exclusive interview with Alicia Lewis , who found herself the unwitting victim of the Sarah Palin attack machine during the Palin Stanislaus speech shakedown .
Sen. Leland Yee ( D - SF ) and others were wondering , among many other questions regarding the university ’s transparency and financial dealings , why Palin ’s speaking fees for her June 25 engagement were not being disclosed per the state ’s public records law .
In the course of following a lead about documents which were being disposed of suspiciously , Ms. Lewis stumbled into the middle of another Palin drama and found herself being labeled a “ dumpster diver and “ political operative ” by Sarah Palin during Palin ’s nationally streamed speech last weekend .
Sarah Jones :
Give me a little background info — your major , where you grew up , etc .
I believe your major is poly - sci , which is interesting .
Has this experience impacted your ideas about politics or decision to go into that field ?
Alicia Lewis : I just received my BA in Political Science and will be entering into the Masters of Public Administration this Fall .
I grew up in both Stanislaus and Merced County .
I have always been interested in politics and involved within my local community .
However , this experience has shown me the large amount of time and energy necessary to fully participate in this field .
Not to mention it has demonstrated the dark under belly of politics such as the hate mail and public scrutiny .
This entire experience while discouraging and frustrating at first has actually strengthened my commitment to enter into the political world .
I have seen firsthand how the actions of a few college students can turn into an international talking point and that it is possible to get your message out .
Sarah Jones :
How did you get involved in finding Palin ’s contract ?
Alicia Lewis : A little background explanation :
After it was publicized that our school had invited Sarah Palin to speak at our 50th anniversary gala there was a California Public Records Request for any information regarding expenditures related to the event .
Our school denied having any documents citing the schools Foundation was separate from the University itself and not subject to disclosure laws .
Several emails surfaced demonstrating that the school was not being truthful .
Fast forward to dumpster issue :
Ashli Briggs ( other student who went public ) received a tip that documents were being destroyed from a reliable source .
It was said that documents were being destroyed in the administration building .
This was a red flag to those of us Ashli informed because we knew the college was supposed to be closed that day .
Myself and several other students went down to the campus and noticed that only the admin parking lot had cars and there seemed to be activity taking place in the locked / closed building .
We waited and watched for a while , noting that garbage was being taken out to the different dumpsters .
Out of intuition / curiosity / boredom we opened the bins .
One was filled with whole intact documents and a bag of shredded paperwork .
We saw the headers were all from the University financial services and thought it was odd they were cleaning out offices on a closed campus day so we took the documents .
Not knowing what we would end up finding .
After looking through the stacks of paperwork we found pages 4 - 9 of what appeared to be the Palin contract .
It was mixed with all University paperwork and in our opinion demonstrated that our school did violate the CA Public Records Request .
Sarah Jones : Sarah Palin accused you of being a “ political operative ” during her Stanislaus speech .
Can you talk about what your intentions were when you found the shredded contracts and what your reaction was when you heard Palin ’s spin on your intentions ?
Palin seems to be saying that you could not have had a motive other than political differences .
Do you agree with her characterization ?
Alicia Lewis :
At the time we found the documents our intention was to find out what the heck was going on a closed campus day .
All we knew was that our campus administration has been under constant criticism for decisions and actions it has made in recent years plus we had a tip from an alarmed source making us even more concerned that something fishy was taking place .
We did not know it would lead us in the direction of anything concerning Sarah Palin .
When I heard what Palin said about those that found the documents I was immediately furious .
I know both myself and Ashli Briggs have consistently stated that this was an issue about transparency and have advocated that changes be made in the CSU system regarding how donor money is handled .
I always made a point to not make a criticism about Palin because I knew it would undermine the argument we were making and would only add to the political divide already taking place in our community .
So to hear Palin making such a bold statement was a demonstration that her only goal is to create a wide political divide .
She took the situation and made it solely about her instead of focusing on the REAL issue .
It seems to be part of her gimmick , show how “ the left ” is attacking her from all sides and she is the victim ( do n’t forget to add in the catchy phrases ! ) .
All the while she ignores the real issues and topics being discussed …. wait never mind I ’m sure she has an out of context quote to use to help her seem knowledgeable .
Considering that she presents everything as black or white ( American or un- American ) I am not surprised that she said it ’s all about political differences because that ’s all she knows .
I disagree with her characterization about me entirely , she obviously did not look into or comprehend what was being said and should maybe try thinking before speaking .
Sarah Jones : I ’ve read and talked with many people who have had similar encounters with Sarah Palin .
She is often described as a “ rabid ” “ vindictive ” person .
What did you know about Palin before this entire episode and how has your notion of her changed since you have had personal experience with her ?
How would you characterize her now ?
Would you vote for her now ?
How do you feel about the idea of her being President — how do you think she would handle that sort of power ?
Alicia Lewis : Prior to this debacle I was fairly familiar with Sarah Palin ( due to her VP run ) and had read about the various accusations regarding misconduct and abuse of power while governor of Alaska .
I had seen her interviews and heard her speeches so my view of her was already very low .
I already felt that she was doing a disservice to not only women but also to the American people that believe her banter .
After this experience I dislike her even more , she has shown herself to be self serving and completely dependent on using cute ( I use that term loosely ) phrases in a condescending tone in order to convince people that what she ’s saying is right .
You asked if I would vote for her ?
Absolutely not .
The idea of her being President is terrifying .
She is narrow minded and has emphasized the agenda that ( she ) wishes to push on the country as a whole .
I think she would handle presidential power poorly because she has already shown a disdain for higher learning belittling the experts that tend to advise presidents .
Whom would she be relying on for knowledge on specific issues ?
Todd ?
Sarah Jones :
Do you consider what Palin said about you irresponsible ?
Were there consequences for you , in terms of challenges or obstacles you had to overcome due to her decision to point fingers at you during a national speech ?
Alicia Lewis : I consider most of what Palin says to be irresponsible .
She has a strong influence over so many people that it ’s scary knowing that she is going around labeling those who disagree with her as un-American or not part of “ Real America ” .
Since this entire situation has taken place there has been the negative outpouring from her supporters it seemed to slow down until her speech which only reignited their desire to send hate filled messages to college students .
Sarah Jones :
Talk a bit about how this experience has changed you .
Are you more or less engaged in politics now ?
Do you see our political landscape differently than you did before ?
Alicia Lewis : I am more engaged now with politics since this situation took place because it allowed me to meet some wonderful people in my community .
I am more cynical now because I have seen how opportunistic people can be and that I need to be aware of what other people ’s intentions are .
I was already skeptical about our political landscape but now I have seen how divided we have made ourselves and I believe very unnecessarily .
When talking with people about the transparency issue I saw that with good conversation and explanation those from all over the political spectrum can agree on issues .
We just have to get past the political mouthpieces that are going around the country spewing misinformation .
Sarah Jones :
Have you spoken with Senator
Yee about this situation ?
He was threatened by Palin fans after he attempted to get to the bottom of the transparency issue , is this something you are concerned about now ?
Alicia Lewis : I have spoken with the Senator and he has shown such kindness regarding this whole situation .
All of us are still on the same page regarding the senate bill ( SB 330 ) that we want to see passed in California in order to prevent mishandling of funds in our CSU / UC system .
I am always going to be slightly concerned that some crazed supporter of Palin will say or do something however , I ca n’t let that stop me from advocating for the school system which I am a part of .
Sarah Jones :
Talk about what you most wish people knew about this situation — the thing you feel people most misunderstand who were not a part of it .
Alicia Lewis : I wish that people understood that this was never about Palin , that we as students have legitimate concerns about how our school system operates in California and are completely determined to make changes .
We have had academic programs and budgets cut , our tuition increased , and faculty being laid off .
Constantly being told that we all need to be fiscally responsible yet the college Foundations which are responsible for 1 billion dollars of donor money throughout the state are not given any oversight and have had scandals leak out of blatant financial waste and irresponsibility .
While our intention was not to go after Palin it did show a side of her that I think people should recognize as unhealthy for our country and ignoring this insight would be irresponsible .
We need to stop with dividing ourselves over every issue ; there is a lot that we can agree on .
We have allowed political mouthpieces to speak and think for us and this has left much of the country dependent on their favorite TV personality to formulate their opinion .
It would be naïve for me to argue that we can all get along and have consensus on our most divisive issues but it does not have to be as bad as we make it .
If we stop with the tag lines and sound bites we might be able to have a legitimate conversation .
Until then we will be stuck having people like Palin determining the opinion and political course our country takes .
Alameda is set for a bitter breakup today with the Orange County developer that hoped to build a 12,000 - resident community at the former Naval Air Station .
The city manager has recommended that the City Council end its ties with SunCal , the company that has been working on the project for four years .
If the council agrees , SunCal will be the second master developer to have failed to build at the 1,500 - acre former base , which has largely languished since the Navy left in 1996 .
" We think this plan creates a lot of risks for the city , and there was a lack of commitment on behalf of the developer , " Deputy City Manager Jennifer
Ott said .
" Of course we 're disappointed , but we would have liked a really detailed , substantial analysis , which they never provided . "
SunCal has spent about $ 12 million on research and public outreach for the plan , which calls for 4,800 homes , a 60 - acre sports complex , 140 acres of parks , a ferry terminal and about 4 million square feet of commercial space .
The city manager 's recommendation is unfair , SunCal officials said Monday .
" We 've been wronged , " said SunCal vice president of operations Pat Keliher .
" We 've done everything they 've asked us to do .
If this does not go through , we will not walk away quietly . "
Relations between Alameda and SunCal have n't always been this strained .
The city chose SunCal in 2007 to build a mix of housing , parks , industry , offices and shops at the base , which is a 15 - minute ferry ride from San Francisco and offers spectacular views of the bay and East Bay hills .
After dozens of community meetings , SunCal presented a plan by renowned urban planner Peter Calthorpe that , at first , the City Council and many city residents seemed to support .
The hitch was that it included multiunit housing , which violated a 1973 law banning anything larger than a duplex on the island city .
As SunCal prepared to let the voters decide , relations with the city staff members and council began to dissolve over some of the details , such as the amount of affordable housing and the cost of the proposed schools , fire station , library and other amenities .
Mayor Beverly Johnson and Councilman Frank Matarrese both withdrew their support in the months leading up to the February election .
SunCal 's ballot measure lost by 85 percent .
In the current economy , no development at the base is financially viable without multiunit housing , SunCal officials said .
So SunCal is now seeking the city 's permission to use state affordable housing incentives to circumvent Alameda 's multiunit housing ban .
That request is on the council 's agenda for today .
" This deal is worth billions of dollars , but it 's our future .
It 's the biggest issue we 'll face , " Matarrese said .
" We need to do what we can to keep the city solvent , safe and functional . "
Any development at Alameda Point needs to focus on job creation , not housing , Matarrese and others said .
SunCal should have been more aggressive in finding tenants and analyzing the businesses that could relocate there , Matarrese said .
Some in Alameda said SunCal 's plan is the city 's best chance at securing a mixed - use development for the former base , which has slipped into disrepair since the Navy left and needs $ 600 million in infrastructure improvements .
" We 've got to get out of the Dark Ages , " said Ron Matthews , head of the Alameda Little League and Alameda High School Boosters .
" We desperately need parks and playfields for our kids , and this gives us that .
I think this would be absolutely great for Alameda . "

People do not typically ingest gum , so they pay very little attention to its ingredients .
The assumption is that if the gum is not swallowed , then the ingredients should not be a concern .
However , the ingredients in gum travel into the bloodstream faster and in higher concentrations than food ingredients , because they absorb directly through the walls of the mouth , and these ingredients do not undergo the normal filtration process of digestion .
Gum is typically the most toxic product in supermarkets that is intended for internal use , and it is likely to kill any pet that eats it .
Commercial gum products contain roughly the same list of toxic ingredients , with differing labeling , which is virtually always designed to mislead .
Common Ingredients of Gum
After looking at several different brands of chewing gum , we found that these were the most common ingredients :
Sorbitol
Gum base
Maltitol
Mannitol
Xylitol
Artificial and natural flavors
Acacia Acesulfame potassium
Aspartame
BHT
Calcium casein peptone - calcium phosphate
Candelilla wax
Sodium stearate
Titanium dioxide
Titanium dioxide is so cancerous that external skin contact is enough to cause cancer .
Be reminded that all of these ingredients absorb directly into the bloodstream through the walls of the mouth .
Some of these ingredients are explained in - depth , because it is prudent to correct the myth that chewing gum is harmless and even good for you ( e.g. " it strengthens the teeth " ) .
The " Sugar - Free " Sugar Alcohols
Sorbitol , maltitol , and mannitol are sugar alcohols .
These are usually made from sugar , and they frequently increase the blood sugar just as much as eating sugar .
However , manufacturers make deceptive " sugar - free " claims about sugar alcohols , since these ingredients are not pure sugar anymore .
While such sugar derivatives are technically " sugar free " when the manipulative word games are employed , they nonetheless remain dangerous for diabetics , who are the very audience that these gums are marketed to .
Let us not forget that the sugar alcohol containing gums are also marketed to improve our dental health .
The sugar alcohols are even more chemically processed than white sugar is ; and thus much more foreign to the body by virtue of its artificial nature , so we have reason to believe that these forms of chemical - industry sugars will stimulate even more weight gain and inflammation than regular sugar .
All of the evidence points in this direction .
These chemically - extracted sugar alcohols are documented to cause abdominal pains and diarrhea , whilst aggravating various health conditions , such as irritable bowel syndrome .
Therefore , the immune system takes a huge hit from exposure to them .
This immune suppression will in turn cause greater yeast development in the body , which will lead to cavities and allergies .
Gum Base
Instead of telling customers what they are really chewing , the phrase " gum base " is used to generalize a list of ingredients that is never actually published .
As the name implies , it is the foundation agent of chewing gum .
We have tried exhaustively to find exactly what modern " gum base " is made from .
We found the following babble repeatedly regurgitated by all of the major gum companies and it was obviously meant to derail serious research .
" Gum base is produced through a blend of raw materials which can be categorized in five classes : Elastomers , act as the key ingredient and provide elasticy Resins act as binders and softeners Plasticizers render the elastomer soft to ensure thorough blending of the gum base Fillers contribute to the overall texture Anti-oxidants prevent oxidation of the gum base and flavors during shelf life "
Since this was repeated identically at all websites that we looked at , we can only assume that all of these companies are actually owned by the same people , or at least they are working together as a cartel to cover - up an honest disclosure of what is in gum .
We eventually confirmed that the ingredients of gum base are commercial trade secrets .
None of the websites told us the full ingredients .
For instance , exactly what plasticizer is used ?
Are people chewing on super - toxic PVC ?
The plasticizing agents could contain dioxins , and quite frankly , they probably do .
After much more research , we found one Chinese company representative who told us about their ingredients .
Wuxi Yueda Gum Base Manufacture Co. , Ltd. said :
" It is made of several food grade raw materials , which are rubber ( food grade ) , glycerol ester of rosin , paraffin waxes , polyvinyl acetates , talc powder and calcium carbonate . "
Glycerol ester of rosin is often made from the stumps of pine trees .
It is used industrially to create fast - drying varnishes .
The Internet is riddled with stories of people who had severe allergic reactions to it , usually causing a swollen throat that led to difficulty breathing .
Glycerol ester of rosin is now being added to soft drinks , though federal limits ensure that its quantity remains under 100 P.P.M .
This safety limitation does not apply to chewing gum .
Talc has been linked to lung cancer , ovarian cancer , and fibrotic pneumoconiosis with just transdermal exposure .
It is very rarely put into products that are to be consumed .
The only other consumable products that we have seen containing talc are diet aids ( most are extremely toxic ) .
Talcum powder was once used on small children , but it has now been replaced with cornstarch , due to safety concerns .
It is too dangerous to touch the skin , but absorbing it straight into the bloodstream is apparently acceptable .
Polyvinyl acetate is not quite PVC .
It is PVA .
PVA is frequently referred to as " carpenter 's glue " or simply " white glue " .
Remember that this is not being used as an industrial product , but as something that children are frequently given to chew upon ( gum base is in bubble gum too ) .
This ingredient compliments the paraffin wax , which is derived from refined petroleum .
Aspartame is one of the most controversial additives of all time , and it sits alongside MSG and saccharin in terms of both consumer distrust and poor safety .
Its presence in foods has nothing to do with safety , but everything to do with politics and money .
Aspartame has been linked to just about every health condition known , from seizures to brain tumors .
Some epileptic patients have recovered from their condition simply by eliminating this toxin from their diets .
It is found in diet foods , diet drinks , and sugar - free products as an alternative to sugar .
Aspartame is a solution that remains worse than the problem .
Aspartame is an excitotoxin , which means that it over - excites the neurons in the brain , until they burn out , causing lowered intelligence and a host of neurological problems .
Aspartame causes diabetes , fibromyalgia , lowered I.Q. , obesity , multiple sclerosis , asthma , insomnia , muscle spasms , and a total of 92 known symptoms .
Acesulfame potassium ( acesulfame K ) has similar properties to aspartame , and it is believed to be a carcinogen .
The Center for Science in the Public Interest petitioned the F.D.A. for a stay of approval , due to the lack of testing done on this substance .
Studies on animals have shown a correlation between acesulfame potassium and various tumors .
While we would love to be able to provide information about calcium casein peptone ( calcium phosphate ) , we cannot .
We simply do not know .
Its only appearance is in Trident gum ( the worst brand ) , and we were unable to find studies or any other information about it .
It might be a whitening agent .
It is important to note that casein is a milk extract that was linked to the Chinese baby formula poisonings .
Trust this ingredient at your own risk , but we would never encourage the use of something that has its research censored from the public .
That tends to be a bad sign .
BHT ( butylated hydroxytoluene ) is a preservative that has been linked to cancer .
It was banned in the United Kingdom and Japan .
It is unbelievably sold as a " dietary supplement " , and some people believe that it has anti-viral effects .
So do gasoline and rat poison .
We do not recommend it , because of the safety implications .
It causes kidney and liver damage .
Benjamin Feingold ( creator of the Feingold Diet ) linked it to hyperactivity in children in the 1970's , as a large component of A.D.H.D .
For the sake of brevity , we shall discontinue examining the ingredients in chewing gum .
Chewing gum is easily one of the most toxic products available , and it is difficult to ever know exactly what it contains , due to vague terms such as " gum base " and " artificial flavors " .
These reflect trade secrets , and the ingredients are probably made from hundreds of chemicals that they are unwilling to disclose .
Manufacturers maintain that customers have no right to know .
Natural gum is available , which is made from chicle , a tree that is native to Central America .
There was a time when all chewing gum was made from it , but using it incurs more manufacturing expense .
Natural gum can be purchased online or from health food stores .

Why Dieting Actually Makes People Fat and How To Do It Right
One of Britain 's most senior judges said yesterday that libel courts must not become places where religious and doctrinal differences are hammered out .
Mr Justice Eady made his comments while summing up his reasons for suspending a defamation case brought by an Indian " holy man " against a British journalist .
The dispute centred around an article published by Hardeep Singh in the Sikh Times in August 2007 entitled : " Cult divides Sikh congregation in High Wycombe " .
Mr Singh , a freelance journalist and a practicing Sikh , was investigating the links between a North Indian religious organisation and three gurdwaras ( Sikh temples ) in Britain .
At the time the article was published , followers of the Nirmala Kutia Johal , a Sikh sect based in the Punjab , were divided over the accession of Sant Baba Jeet Singh , who had become their leader in 2002 following the death of the group 's previous guru .
Mr Singh 's article described Nirmala Kutia Johal as a " cult " and said that disagreements over the accession of the group 's new guru had spilled out into the open among supporters in High Wycombe .
Baba Jeet Singh , an Indian national who has never travelled to the UK , issued libel proceedings in the British courts against both Mr Singh and the Sikh Times , which later went bust .
Baba Jeet Singh claimed that Hardeep Singh 's article defamed his character by describing him as a leader of a cult and an impostor who had disturbed the peace in the Sikh community of High Wycombe , and had promoted blasphemy and the sexual exploitation and abuse of women .
Mr Singh , who lives in Slough , Berkshire , denied libel , pleading justification , fair comment and qualified privilege .
His counsel , Mark Hill QC , asked Mr Justice Eady to suspend – or " stay " – the case because the allegations centred around the " doctrine , tradition and practice of the Sikh religion " which were a subject , he argued , that Britain 's secular courts could not rule with authority on .
Mr Justice Eady agreed and decided to stay the case with no right of appeal .
His decision is significant because it reinforces the notion that Britain 's courts are primarily secular and therefore cannot get involved in complicated theological or doctrinal libel arguments which rely on faith – rather than fact .
Citing an example of where the libel courts could intervene , Mr Justice Eady said that if someone accused a religious leader of having " their hands in a till " , judges could decide whether that accusation was correct and whether defamation had taken place .
But , in this case , he said " The issue of whether this claimant is fairly described as an impostor cannot be decided without examining the doctrines of the Sikh faith . "
Dan Tench , a litigation partner at the firm Olswang , said the judgement revealed how libel courts try to avoid certain issues .
" Courts are not always fearful of treading on issues surrounding doctrinal or religious belief , " Mr Tench said .
" But libel courts often act differently .
When it comes to accusations of defamation , the courts have become increasingly reluctant to get involved in matters of legitimate and expert debate . "
Speaking outside the High Court yesterday , Hardeep Singh said he was " delighted and relieved " with the verdict .
But he also called for a reform of Britain 's libel laws .
" This exhausting battle to clear my name has cost me in excess of £ 90,000 and yet it took Justice Eady only three hours to throw out the case , " he said .
" It seems [ Baba ] Jeet Singh hoped I would be forced to back out of the case as the costs mounted , which begs the question : should freedom of speech in this country only be available to the rich who have means to defend themselves in court ?
Ultimately , our libel laws need urgent reform , not only to protect British journalists but also to prevent our laws being abused by foreign nationals . "
Court battles
Daily Mail v The Unification Church
The Moonies ' took the paper to court in 1981 over a two - page spread the paper ran under the headline : " The Church That Breaks Up Families " .
The paper interviewed two former members of the Unification Church who accused it of brainwashing them .
The case continued for five months .
The Unification Church were eventually ordered to pay £ 1 m in costs and the Inland Revenue was advised to investigate its tax free status .
Daily Mail v Jonathan Blakely
and why you probably wo n’t need them
I was thinking it would be nice to have a type of structure that would know in what index each of its parameters is stored .
Why might this be useful ?
Because then you do n’t need to know the name of the type to access its data .
It is simple enough to make a wrapper around defstruct .
First define a constant that stores a map of parameter name to index , and then keep a reference to that constant at a fixed position in the structure .
( defmacro defstruct * ( struct - name &rest params ) ( let ( ( constant ( intern ( format " % s-- params " struct - name ) ) ) ) `( progn ( defconst , constant ( _params - indices - map 2 , @params ) ) ( defstruct , struct - name ( param - indices , ( list ' quote constant ) ) , @params ) ) ) )
For the map , we ’re going to use an association list , and something like a b c should expand to ( ( a .
2 ) ( b . 3 ) ( c . 4 ) ) .
As the first two slots in the vector are taken up by the structure name and the map itself , indices start at 2 .
( defmacro _params - indices - map ( counter &rest params ) ( if params `( cons ( cons , ( list ' quote ( car forms ) ) , counter ) ( _params - indices - map ( 1+ , counter ) , @( cdr params ) ) ) nil ) )
But we did n’t really need a recursive macro here at all .
And they are painful to debug .
( macroexpand '( _params- indices - map 2 a b c ) ) ;; expands to ( cons ( cons ( quote a ) 2 ) ( _params- indices - map ( 1+ 2 ) b c ) )
We could have used a function much more easily .
( defun _params - indices - map ( params ) ( let ( ( counter 2 ) retval ) ( dolist ( var params ) ( push ( cons var counter ) retval ) ( setq counter ( 1+ counter ) ) ) retval ) )
defstruct * needs to be fixed up slightly .
We no longer need to pass the counter in to _params - indices - map .
( defmacro defstruct * ( struct - name &rest params ) ( let ( ( constant ( intern ( format " % s-- params " struct - name ) ) ) ) `( progn ( defconst , constant ( _params- indices - map '( , @params ) ) ) ( defstruct , struct - name ( param - indices , ( list ' quote constant ) ) , @params ) ) ) )
( defstruct * struct a b c ) ( cdr ( assoc ' a struct -- params ) ) ;; --> 2 ( make - struct ) ;; -->
[ cl - struct - struct struct -- params nil nil nil ]
Now of course , this wo n’t work correctly for more complex structures that initialise their parameters .
Fixing that is left as an exercise for the reader 🙂
Visualization of the three knockout - phase matches of the Spanish team .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
As a young boy growing up in Portugal , Luis Amaral loved playing , watching and talking soccer .
Amaral and his friends passionately debated about which players were " the best . "
But , it was just a matter of opinion .
Unlike baseball and basketball , there is n't a lot of statistical information detailing how each soccer player contributes to a match .
Amaral , now a professor at Northwestern University , combined his love of soccer with his research team 's computational skills to measure and rank the success of soccer players based on an objective measure of performance instead of opinion .
The results of the study will be published June 16 , 2010 PLoS ONE , a journal published by the Public Library of Science .
Though their analysis , Amaral and his team were able to objectively rank the performances of all the players in the 2008 European Cup tournament .
Their results closely matched the general consensus of sports reporters who covered the matches as well as the team of experts , coaches and managers that subjectively chose players for the " best of " tournament teams .
" In soccer there are relatively few big things that can be counted , " said Amaral , professor of chemical and biological engineering with the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and senior author of the paper .
" You can count how many goals someone scores , but if a player scores two goals in a match , that 's amazing .
You can really only divide two or three goals or two or three assists among , potentially , eleven players .
Most of the players will have nothing to quantify their performance at the end of the match . "
To find a quantitative way to rank players , co-author and Northwestern graduate student Josh Waitzman first wrote software to pull play - by - play statistical information from the 2008 Euro Cup website .
This type of extensive statistical information is usually only gathered for important matches , Amaral said .
Amaral and Jordi Duch , the paper 's first author and an assistant professor of applied math and computer science at Universitat Rovira I Virgili in Spain , used the data to quantify the performance of players by generalizing methods from social network analysis .
" You can define a network in which the elements of the network are your players , " Amaral said .
" Then you have connections between the players if they make passes from one to another .
Also , because their goal is to score , you can include another element in this network , which is the goal . "
Amaral 's team mapped out the flow of the soccer ball between players in the network as well as shooting information and analyzed the results .
" We looked at the way in which the ball can travel and finish on a shot , " said Amaral , who also is a member of the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems ( NICO ) and an Early Career Scientist with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
" The more ways a team has for a ball to travel and finish on a shot , the better that team is .
And , the more times the ball goes through a given player to finish in a shot , the better that player performed . "
" It would never happen by chance that we would get such striking agreement with the consensus opinion of so many experts if our measure was n't good , " Amaral said .
He says this kind of analysis can be used outside of the soccer world , too .
Companies could use the method to rank and evaluate the performance of employees working together on a team project , for example .

Run for your lives , dear readers , for it is time to unveil my Top 5 Film Villains –
1 ) Henry Fonda – Once Upon a Time in the West
It is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of western cinema : an entire family is gunned down in cold blood and the camera slowly pans over to the culprit , the agonizing close - up revealing the beloved blue eyes of good old Henry Fonda .
I can see people in the audience gasping and physically recoiling in theaters when this picture debuted in 1968 .
It must have shocked some of the audience members to their very core , and that ’s precisely what Sergio Leone had in mind .
It is unique to see the wholesome star in such a role , but his Frank is as complex and believable as any villain could possibly be , and western fans spanning the globe are thankful Fonda signed up for the ride .
As Frank ’s story unfolds in this sensational Leone epic , we are witness to an impeccable performance , and the film rewards Fonda ’s dedication and realism with a gripping role in a robust opera complete several overlapping storylines and a bevy of good guys and bad guys , some armed with wealth while others sport six - shooters .
This is an epic film ripe with intrigue and drama , a tale told with admirable patience , and a star vehicle brimming with familiar faces offering up great performances of their own , but Frank serves as the dark undercurrent for everything that transpires .
His presence in the film taints even the most peaceful scenes , and his steadfast resolve and his gruesome march toward his destiny drive the final act .
Fonda is fine actor who is revered for his considerable ability , and his efforts as Frank serve as a testament to his remarkable talent .
Despite this role being quite a departure from the good men he was known for playing , Fonda does n’t flinch , playing the haunted killer who preys on everyone at his disposal in this thrilling voyage with deliberation and pride .
The climactic showdown with Fonda and Charlie Bronson ( simply billed as The Man ) is riveting and perhaps even a bit tragic ; Frank does n’t like the hand he is dealt , but he plays it with the same relentless determination that defines this ruthless gunslinger .
2 ) Jack Nicholson – The Shining
This is the role that Jack Nicholson will always be remembered most fondly for , and given his incredible legacy , that is a bold statement indeed .
Yet I have to believe that no role was more unmistakably his , and I maintain that perhaps no villainous role was better suited for the man who inherited it .
Steven Weber was quite compelling in the televised adaptation of the Stephen King novel , but there is no comparison for Jack ’s devilish grin and his manic intensity as he turns the snowy Overlook Hotel into a living hell for his unfortunate wife ( played by the equally unfortunate Shelley Duvall , who was practically tortured on set by director Stanley Kubrick ) and his young son , Danny .
Jack is so formidable and imposing that he dominates the film , looming over the plot and the other performers in a gripping account of delirium and despair that eventually gives way to a violent madness .
Nicholson invests so much of himself in the part , baring so much of himself to the audience , that I think you could probably watch this film with the volume turned all the way down and you would know what was going on in his character ’s mind every step of the way .
The part itself grants him a terrific opportunity to wreak absolute havoc , and Kubrick got such ferocity out of Jack in 1980 that everyone else seems to shrivel a bit when he ’s on screen .
Seriously , who better for the role of a struggling writer and a driven father who wants what is best for his family , but loses a struggle with his darkest demons and descends into a psychopathic rage ?
I honestly believe that no one else could have truly embraced such a dark and disturbing part and brought it to life in such vibrant detail , underscoring the horror and depravity with a gleeful lunacy that is at once cartoonish and utterly horrifying .
Jack Nicholson ’s portrayal of Jack Torrance in The Shining is one of the most riveting performances in motion picture history , so its place on this list should come as no surprise .
3 ) Patrick Swayze – Point Break
Bodhi could be the most intriguing character ever given life in a picture of this nature , a rollercoaster ride of the highest caliber , the 1991 Kathryn Bigelow extravaganza that packs a mean punch .
Bodhi does n’t just rob banks with his gang “ The Ex- Presidents ” ( all of whom wear tuxes and latex president masks , Bodhi being Reagan ) and jump out of airplanes when he is n’t surfing killer waves , he also turns young FBI agents to the dark side .
Keanu Reeves gives Swayze a perfect foil as Johnny Utah , a swell guy who just happens to fall under the coolest psycho ever ’s spell when he should be arresting Bodhi for robbing banks .
Swayze gives the performance of his life in yet another iconic role for the heartthrob , and his talent shines through in this grim spiritual journey ripe with frantic chases and shootouts .
Bodhi is a zealot who does n’t see the cost of his actions , only the thrill of the next big ride , the rush of adrenaline and the spirit of adventure .
He does n’t care about anything else , and as warm and inviting as he seems , he is an albatross for all those who know and love him .
Along the way Swayze brands the character with a certain sense of abandon paired with unmistakable charisma , elevating the material above the action genre and providing us with a real gem that should be hailed as a classic action flick , but is more frequently referred to as a guilty pleasure .
My wife argued that I should n’t include Bodhi here because he was so likable and he was n’t really malicious , but I think he deserves this spot .
In truth , the character is very likable , and he is n’t malicious , she was right on both counts .
However , he is so selfish in his pursuit of the next big thrill that he does n’t particularly care when the people around him start to die .
That ’s what makes him a villain .
It ’s just like Johnny told him , “ You crossed the line .
People trusted you and they died .
You gotta ’ go down . ”
Bodhi is one of the most seductive villains of all time , a guy people will kill for if it maintains their spot in his inner circle and a man who sacrifices everyone around him in a heartless quest for personal satisfaction .
As Bodhi , Swayze gives us a great performance in one hell of a movie , and I will always consider this his finest hour .
4 ) Brian Dennehy – First Blood
Few performances get me so angry or involved as Brian Dennehy ’s flawless portrayal of Sheriff Will Teasle , the country cop who unwittingly incites a war between his police department and a crazed green beret in First Blood .
To Teasle ’s credit , the former green beret is now a long - haired vagrant , but the policeman allows his temper to get the better of him when he deals with the young veteran , and things soon spiral out of control with astounding quickness .
Teasle is so easy to hate and so steadfast in his belligerence that he makes it easy for the audience to root for John Rambo , who is essentially a trained killer who has flipped his lid in the wooded hills of a small town called Hope .
Dennehy does n’t do anything bold or eccentric here , and the part does n’t require it .
His unerring determination coupled with an arrogant streak that wo n’t allow him to back down even after he realizes the magnitude of his mistake is all it takes to ground this truly first - rate thriller , an action film of the highest order .
Sylvester Stallone is the star of the show , and he has never been better , but the whole thing works because Brian Dennehy offered up a performance that is unwavering in its sincerity and understanding .
Teasle is a perfect villain , a character who makes a mistake and refuses to admit it , allowing that mistake to become his legacy .
Dennehy embraces this notion and excels in a role that is guaranteed to elicit a strong emotional response from the viewer , a staple of an iconic villain if ever there was one .
5 ) Christoph Waltz – Inglorious Basterds
What more can be said of Waltz and the amazing spectacle he provides as Hans Landa in Quentin Tarantino ’s WWII epic Inglorious Basterds ?
This role earned him the 2010 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor , and it was n’t a close race .
Like many , I had never seen Waltz before watching Inglorious Basterds , and like most I was absolutely blown away by his amazing presence .
As the opening scene clearly dictates , Landa is a cold - hearted son of a bitch who masks his brutality with a charming demeanor and an inviting smile , yet few villains light up the screen like this one does .
Every scene he is featured in benefits from the sheer magnetism Waltz offers up as Landa by virtue of a potent mix of ruthless cunning and sublime grace .
Essentially , we ’re watching a man put on a show within a show , as there can be no doubt that Landa is a performer of considerable prowess .
It ’s almost as if this puzzling character needs to feel as though he is liked by the very people he preys upon , and this bizarre penchant for trying to endear himself to his quarry is a big part of what makes the infamous “ Jew Hunter ” so diabolical .
I found the movie itself to be totally engrossing , and I do n’t think I could overstate how important Christoph and his thoroughly entertaining performance as Landa is to my perception of the piece .
This is a villain on a grand scale , a cruel madman who is to be feared , yet within the context of a motion picture experience this madman is simply irresistible .
The screen seems to come alive every time he graces the scene , and whether he ’s eating dessert or strangling a woman , both his mesmerizing charisma and underlying menace are paramount .
Well , that ’s my list , and I have to admit that this was a lot tougher than I thought .
So many wonderful stars in powerful roles were left out that I can’t help but second - guess myself .
Stay tuned for my forthcoming Top 5 Film Heroes , and in closing , take a look at the other villains I considered when composing this list .
Robert DeNiro – Heat
Gary Oldman – Leon : The Professional
Marcia Gay Harden – The Mist
Angus Scrimm – Phantasm
Anthony Perkins – Psycho
Arnold Schwarzenegger – The Terminator
Heath Ledger – The Dark Knight
Louise Fletcher – One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest
Ralph Fiennes – Schindler ’s List
Anthony Hopkins – The Silence of the Lambs
Wes Studi – The Last of the Mohicans
James Earl Jones – Conan the Barbarian
Lee Van Cleef – The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly
And one last bit of nonsense : I did n’t know whether or not I should consider Darth Vader or the Great White in Jaws , so I did n’t , but surely they would warrant careful consideration if you find their inclusion on such a list agreeable .
Please chime in with your thoughts and feel free to suggest topics for future Top 5 columns .

Here is a personal summary of some of the most prominent spaces I rescued from the more than 800 photographs I received .
You can find all in Flickr .
All the pictures have been taken between 20.30 and 23.00 of July 11 .
I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in this project .
Thanks for your quick answer , the volume of volunteers have been huge and that made possible generating and discovering extraordinary photographs .
On July 11 , during the World Cup ’s final match among Spain and Netherlands an army of spanish photographers went out to take pictures of the empty streets that more than 18 millions TV - viewers left .
More than 200 volunteers from every place in Spain took advantage of the absence and portraited a desert country .
This is the result .

ROSELLE PARK —
With temperatures rising into the 90s , Christine Curia was n't surprised the young man standing on the side of the bridge in Roselle was bathed in sweat .
But that did n’t explain his vacant stare , or why he was standing on the very edge of the Gordon Street bridge , about 20 feet over the NJ Transit train tracks along the Roselle - Roselle Park border .
Curia rolled down her car window .
" Are you okay ? " the Kenilworth resident asked .
The man turned to her , put his hands up and said , " Ma’am , I ’m okay . "
But then Curia noticed the orange extension cord .
One end was tied around the man ’s neck , the other was tied to the bridge .
She knew the man was n’t okay .
Roselle police Lt. James
Loprete said the man was one step from taking his own life , but for the intervention of Curia and two others the morning of July 15 .
" She saw it , and she helped and assisted in preventing him from doing anything , " Loprete said .

Curia jumped out of her car , blocking traffic on the narrow , two - lane bridge .
As she walked toward the man , she asked another driver , Kamal Wedlock of Roselle , for help .
As Curia stepped over a metal guardrail and approached the man on the edge , Wedlock spotted a Union County sheriff ’s cruiser and ran for help .
In the meantime , Curia kept talking to the man , telling him that God loved him .
She grabbed his wrist and held him .
As she talked to him , she said , she began to cry .
" It ’s okay .
It ’s okay .
It ca n’t be that bad , " she said she told him as she untied the extension cord from around his neck .
The man , who Curia said appeared to be in his early 20s , never said a word , she recalled .
In the meantime , Wedlock had made it back to the bridge with Capt .
Nancy Diesel of the Union County Sheriff ’s Office .
Together , the three pulled the man to safety .
" They put the kid in the back of the cop car , " Curia recalled .
" The sad part is , this kid is my son ’s age .
What could be so bad that he wanted to do this ? "
Loprete said the man was taken to Trinitas Hospital in Elizabeth for evaluation .
" I knew I had someone else there with me , " Curia said of Wedlock .
" I ’m glad he was there for my backup . "
Wedlock said he was glad they were able to make a difference .
" It was a good thing that we were able to be there to help this kid out , " Wedlock said .
" Because nobody else was stopping . "
Phil Laak is widely known as being one of the most entertaining poker pros around due to his ridiculous antics and high energy levels both at the poker table and away from it .
From doing push ups at the table , to standing behind the dealer to peak at the cards as they are dealt , to hiding under his hooded sweatshirt , he always supplies entertainment and laughs to an industry that takes itself far too seriously far too often .
Laak ’s most recent ‘ achievement ’ was breaking the record for poker endurance .
You can read more about Laak ’s record - setting performance here ; cliff ’s notes are that he did n’t just break the record , he outright smashed it by playing for over 100 hours straight at the Bellagio , and managed to scoop a $ 6 k profit , all of which went to charity .
Here are our Top 5 Funniest Laak Moments :
1. Phil Laak gets an oil rubdown from a strange man
On I Bet You , in what can only be described as a sick bet , Laak and Antonio decide to flip a coin and the loser has to get a random guy on the beach to rub suntan oil on their back .
Laak picks tails and the coin lands heads , and he has to head on down the beach to ask a dude to rub him down .
The 1st victim quickly , and rightfully , says no .
Surprisingly , the 2nd guy that he asks somehow willingly agrees to rub Laak down .
Awkward and unbelievable .
Skip to 3:30 in to view .
2 . The Unabomber does push ups at the final table
The WPT win that put Phil Laak on the map saw him perform just about ever antic imaginable at the poker table .
When his Ace came on the river he would roll around on the ground in celebration as the crowd chanted “ Bomber ! Bomber !
Bomber ! ” followed up by a series of push ups .
The Unabomber is always energized to the max and push ups do little to slow him down .
3 . Phil performs a dance routine
This display is so painful to watch that it is hilarious .
The bet between Phil and Antonio is for $ 5,000 on who is the better dancer .
Phil ’s dance routine is painfully funny .
4. More of a Man
Another I Bet You classic .
Phil Laak and Antonio get their sperm tested to see who the bigger man is .
One line from the Unabomber says it all “ I am crazy with my sperm !
My sperm are insanely powerful ! ”
5. Laak “ I lived in NY too long , I ’m too paranoid ”
On Poker After Dark , Laak is counting out the chips in the pot for the dealer when she asks him “ Do n’t you trust the dealer ? ”
His response “ I lived in NY too long , I ’m too paranoid ”
Phil Laak has earned himself a reputation as poker ’s funny man .
His antics never disappoint and you can bank on him providing entertainment every time he shows up on TV .

BP ’s calamitous behavior in the Gulf of Mexico is the big oil story of the moment .
But for many years , indigenous people from a formerly pristine region of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador have been trying to get relief from an American company , Texaco ( which later merged with Chevron ) , for what has been described as the largest oil - related environmental catastrophe ever .
“ As horrible as the gulf spill has been , what happened in the Amazon was worse , ” said Jonathan Abady , a New York lawyer who is part of the legal team that is suing Chevron on behalf of the rainforest inhabitants .
It has been a long and ugly legal fight and the outcome is uncertain .
But what has happened in the rainforest is heartbreaking , although it has not gotten nearly the coverage that the BP spill has .
What ’s not in dispute is that Texaco operated more than 300 oil wells for the better part of three decades in a vast swath of Ecuador ’s northern Amazon region , just south of the border with Colombia .
Much of that area has been horribly polluted .
The lives and culture of the local inhabitants , who fished in the intricate waterways and cultivated the land as their ancestors had done for generations , have been upended in ways that have led to widespread misery .
A villager displays his hand coated in crude oil during cleanup efforts almost a week after a pipeline , owned by China Nation Petroleum Corp. , exploded in Nanhaitun , Weitang Bay , China .
China National Petroleum Corp. said Thursday the vital pipeline has resumed operations after an explosion caused the country 's largest reported oil spill .
Cleanup efforts , marred by the drowning death of a worker , continued over a 165 - square - mile stretch of water blanketed in thick , dark oil Thursday , after an official warned the spill posed a severe threat to sea life and water quality .
There 's a movement afoot to frame science / religion discussions in such a way that those of who believe that the two are incompatible are labeled as extremists who can be safely excluded from grownup discussions about the issue .
It 's somewhat insulting -- to be told that people like you are incapable of conducting thoughtful , productive conversations with others -- and certainly blatantly false as an empirical matter -- I 've both participated in and witnessed numerous such conversations that were extremely substantive and well - received .
It 's also a bit worrisome , since whether a certain view is " true " or " false " seems to take a back seat to whether it is " moderate " or " extreme . "
But people are welcome to engage or not with whatever views they choose .
What troubles me is how much our cultural conversation is being impoverished by a reluctance to face up to reality .
In many ways the situation is parallel to the discussion about global climate change .
In the real world , our climate is being affected in dramatic ways by things that human beings are doing .
We really need to be talking about serious approaches to this problem ; there are many factors to be taken into consideration , and the right course of action is far from obvious .
Instead , it 's impossible to broach the subject in a public forum without being forced to deal with people who simply refuse to accept the data , and cling desperately to the idea that the Earth 's atmosphere is n't getting any warmer , or it 's just sunspots , or warmth is a good thing , or whatever .
Of course , the real questions are being addressed by some people ; but in the public domain the discussion is blatantly distorted by the necessity of dealing with the deniers .
As a result , the interested but non-expert public receives a wildly inaccurate impression of what the real issues are .
Over the last four hundred or so years , human beings have achieved something truly amazing : we understand the basic rules governing the operation of the world around us .
Everything we see in our everyday lives is simply a combination of three particles -- protons , neutrons , and electrons -- interacting through three forces -- gravity , electromagnetism , and the strong nuclear force .
That is it ; there are no other forms of matter needed to describe what we see , and no other forces that affect how they interact in any noticeable way .
And we know what those interactions are , and how they work .
Of course there are plenty of things we do n't know -- there are additional elementary particles , dark matter and dark energy , mysteries of quantum gravity , and so on .
But none of those is relevant to our everyday lives ( unless you happen to be a professional physicist ) .
As far as our immediate world is concerned , we know what the rules are .
A staggeringly impressive accomplishment , that somehow remains uncommunicated to the overwhelming majority of educated human beings .
That does n't mean that all the interesting questions have been answered ; quite the opposite .
Knowing the particles and forces that make up our world is completely useless when it comes to curing cancer , buying a new car , or writing a sonnet .
( Unless your sonnet is about the laws of physics . )
But there 's no question that this knowledge has crucial implications for how we think about our lives .
Astrology does not work ; there is no such thing as telekinesis ; quantum mechanics does not tell you that you can change reality just by thinking about it .
There is no life after death ; there 's no spiritual essence that can preserve a human consciousness outside its physical body .
Life is a chemical reaction ; there is no moment at conception or otherwise when a soul is implanted in a body .
We evolved as a result of natural processes over the history of the Earth ; there is no supernatural intelligence that created us and maintains an interest in our behavior .
There is no Natural Law that specifies how human beings should live , including who they should marry .
There is no strong conception of free will , in the sense that we are laws unto ourselves over and above the laws of nature .
The world follows rules , and we are part of the world .
How great would it be if we could actually have serious , productive public conversations about the implications of these discoveries ?
For all that we have learned , there 's a tremendous amount yet to be figured out .
We know the rules by which the world works , but there 's a lot we have yet to know about how to live within it ; it 's the difference between knowing the rules of chess and playing like a grandmaster .
What is " life , " anyway ?
What is consciousness ?
How should we define who is a human being , and who is n't ?
How should we live together in a just and well - ordered society ?
What are appropriate limits of medicine and biological manipulation ?
How can we create meaning and purpose in a world where they are n't handed to us from on high ?
How should we think about love and friendship , right and wrong , life and death ?
These are real questions , hard questions , and we have the tools in front of us to have meaningful discussions about them .
And , as with climate change , some people are having such discussions ; but the public discourse is so badly distorted that it has little relationship to the real issues .
Instead of taking the natural world seriously , we have discussions about " Faith . "
We pretend that questions of meaning and purpose and value must be the domain of religion .
We are saddled with bizarre , antiquated attitudes toward sex and love , which have terrible consequences for real human beings .
I understand the reluctance to let go of religion as the lens through which we view questions of meaning and morality .
For thousands of years it was the best we could do ; it provided social structures and a framework for thinking about our place in the world .
But that framework turns out not to be right , and it 's time to move on .
Rather than opening our eyes and having the courage and clarity to accept the world as it is , and to tackle some of the real challenges it presents , as a society we insist on clinging to ideas that were once perfectly reasonable , but have long since outlived their usefulness .
Nature obeys laws , we are part of nature , and our job is to understand our lives in the context of reality as it really is .
Once that attitude goes from being " extremist " to being mainstream , we might start seeing some real progress .
Apple declined to carry a comic - book adaptation of James Joyce 's Ulysses for the iPad because one panel showed a man 's penis : " While the first chapter of the book , the one now at iTunes , does n't contain ' offensive language ' our comic does have frank nudity .
Something we figured we might have to pixelate or cover with ' fig leaves ' .
But Apple 's policy prohibits even that .
So we were forced to either scrap the idea of moving to the tablet with Apple or re-design our pages . "

The US Supreme Court ruled last week that giving support to groups listed as terrorist is illegal , even if that support is designed to end violence .
The upshot is that work to end the world 's ongoing armed conflicts through peaceful means - mediation support , or training in how to peacefully resolve disputes - comes with a risk of 15 years in prison .

The US favours talking to the Taliban , but NGOs could be penalised The US government and its allies have been calling for inclusive and political solutions to the world 's most intractable conflicts - this sometimes means talking to ' terrorists '
Andy Carl
The quiet diplomacy with IRA and loyalist paramilitaries which helped bring about the Good Friday agreement - meetings , training seminars and facilitated dialogues - would now be deemed a terrorist offence .
Those who engaged with the Sunni Awakening Councils in Iraq may , it turns out , have been breaking the law .
And those who are currently supporting the Afghan or Somali governments ' policies of engagement with their sworn enemies could be at risk of prosecution .
This clarification of a law first adopted in 1996 and adjusted in the 2001 Patriot Act , is a big setback for American organisations well known for their work in mediation , such as the Carter Center , the American Friends Service Committee or the Conflict Management Group .
The long arm of US justice means that it extends to all of its residents and citizens ( including those living abroad , like myself ) and those organisations that receive US government funding .
Perverse logic
The UK , unfortunately , has similar laws .
Image caption
It 's still legal to talk to some militants in the Philippines - but not to others
The Terrorism Act 2000 makes it illegal to hold meetings not considered " genuinely benign " ( a worryingly vague phrase ) with terrorist - listed organisations .
The UK Charity Commission , meanwhile , has issued guidelines to encourage whistle - blowing if any NGOs are suspected of operating outside this law .
The EU also keeps a list of groups categorised as terrorist .
It 's not always clear why some armed groups are on these lists , and others are not .
The Sudan Peoples ' Liberation Army , the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) or the Free Aceh Movement , for example , are not , allowing governments and NGOs such as my own , to legally provide advice in supporting their engagement in peace processes .
A recent example is our involvement in the International Contact Group in support of the negotiations in the Southern Philippines .
Our role is to help the parties themselves to draw lessons from other peace processes .
Although these laws have a counter - insurgency logic ( denying aid and training to militants ) they are also having perverse consequences - beginning with creating a disincentive for mediation and compromise in conflict zones .
Swiss freedom
Image caption Persuading armed groups to give up land mines is now in many cases illegal
Not surprisingly , US and British NGOs and government agencies have introduced a degree of self - censure , taking themselves out of the job of facilitating peace talks , and instead leaving the jobs to governments and NGOs in countries without similar legislation or the EU 's terrorist lists .
It is no accident that the avant - garde of peace mediation can be found in Norway and Switzerland .
The humanitarian logic is clear .
If civilians are to be protected from organised armed conflict then there will have to be engagement with armed groups .
If NGOs like Geneva Call were based in almost any country other than Switzerland , they simply would n't be able to do their essential work of attempting to get the commitment of armed groups to ban the use of land mines .
What we have seen in our own work with armed groups and in documenting peace processes is that these peaceful forms of engagement tend to strengthen the pro-dialogue elements within a group , while their absence tends to strengthen hardliners by removing viable alternatives to violence .
It is essential that our policy makers develop more nuanced legal instruments , which condemn and discourage violence but keep the door open for peace talks .
Closing options
The UN itself has similar policies and lists which led to the infamous resignation in 2007 , of UN Special Co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process , Alvaro de Soto .
He complained that his inability to meet with Hamas had meant that it was no longer possible for the Secretary General 's office to play its neutral mediation role in the Middle East .
The US government and its allies have been calling for inclusive and political solutions to the world 's most intractable conflicts .
TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS
US
State Department lists 45 organisations , from al - Qaeda to the Real IRA
The EU lists 59 individuals and 47 organisations
The UK lists 56 organisations
Only 10 organisations feature an all three ( US , UK , and EU ) lists
To achieve this , it sometimes means talking to " terrorists " and certainly supporting policies whereby armed groups join the political process and abide by the rule of law .
So , in pursuit of legitimate concerns to curb the use of violence and terror , why make human rights and mediation a casualty ?
Closing off such options can have the reverse and perverse effect of encouraging extremism and belligerence .
Peacebuilding work , already dangerous to do and difficult to fund just got harder .
Conciliation Resources is an independent charity working internationally to prevent violent conflict , promote justice and build lasting peace in war - torn societies .

* FTP and STP are ofted intermixed , sometimes S / UTP is also thrown in .
In general it means the cable is shielded in one place .
* S/FTP ans S / STP are of course often intermixed , both should get you a double shielded cable .
* Unshielded twisted pair cable will do just fine if there are not too much electromagnic interferences ( EMI ) , that 's what the twisting is for .
* Shielded cable will protect your signal better from interference .
Though there are no guarantees of course , if the interference source is too strong it'll still influence things .
Things like big electro motors ( an elevator engine ) , powerfull speaker systems ( festival rig ) , strong light installations ( that same festival rig ) or a nearby high - power cable are some examples of interference sources .
* Evidently unshielded cable is typically more flexible then shielded cable . * I have no idea what the practical difference between FTP and STP cable would be , but it might have something to do with the flexibility rather then with the shielding effectiveness .

We continue our week - long tribute to Steven Wells , who died last year , with another previously unseen blog from 2008 .
This time Swells lays into Coldplay , who have become the new Phil Collins
First Phil Collins quits .
Then Coldplay fill the yawning cultural chasm with a new album that some critics shockingly think does not suck utterly .
Now the gibbering hipster chimp cognoscenti are falling over themselves to write blogs claiming that it no longer rocks to mock the ' Play .
Is this a coincidence ?
Are Coldplay the new Phil Collins ?
Is an affection for their music still a sure - fire and universally recognised benchmark of rotten taste , social incompetence and terminal uncoolness ?
No .
It 's way too late for that .
Try and keep up .
Flashback : I 'm on a packed train from London to Manchester , engaged in a slightly stilted conversation with my suit - and - tie wearing travelling companions , all of whom are strangers .
When the conversation wanes , one of the suits reaches into his briefcase and pulls out the latest Jeffrey Archer .
" Are you reading that for a bet ? " I quip .
He stares at me .
His companions stare at me .
The whole carriage stares at me .
Middle England – sick to the bloody back teeth of being mocked and caricatured by coke - snorting , sexually promiscuous , strangely trousered Private Eye and NME - reading Soho sophisticates – turns and stares at me .
Oh my God .
I have fallen among Tories .
So softened have I become by my decades - long marination in the hip consensus that a ) Jeffrey Archer is shit b) Phil Collins is the root of all evil and c ) Margaret
Thatcher is the worst thing to have happened to Britain since the Norman conquest that – finding myself among barbarians – I am defenseless , helpless , and completely unequipped to explain to these rough - hewn thickies exactly why it is their every opinion and cultural choice marks them as beyond the civilised pale .
I turn and look out of the window .
I make myself small .
And I shudder .
Archer and Collins have long been thought of by us groovy types as benchmarks of shitness .
So universal was this opinion that no discussion was necessary .
One simply never met people who did n't think they were both utter rubbish .
And so – like the origin of some ancient blood feud – the passion that fuelled the original hatred had decayed and fossilised into lazy habit and petty cliche .
Soon to even mention these hoary old bugbears was considered déclassé – the mark of a lazy or inexperienced writer in search of an easy target .
Other Aunt Sallies have been hoisted up as potential replacements .
For many years NME regularly gave Northside , the Inspiral Carpets and the Beautiful South brutal kickings on the assumption that they were loathed by people of taste .
They were , of course , wrong .
" Who buys this rubbish ? " NME asked of a Beautiful South album .
People who actually like good pop music , rather than the tired Manc indie crap you peddle , came the reply .
On those music websites consumed for the most part by mildly autistic and women - hating white males ( which is to say all music websites ) there has been a concerted attempt to turn Jet and Lily Allen into red- headed step - children to be beaten and abused and locked in the cellar .
But this has failed because a ) both Jet and Allen rock and b ) a groin - clutching fear of sexuality is no way to build a consensus within a medium that prides itself on its liberalism and licentiousness .
Just ask any fascist and / or born - again Christian rock band .
And then – just as the hip establishment despaired of ever again having a target as good as old uncle Phil – along came Coldplay and , at last , the cool massive had an Aunt Sally worthy of its scorn .
Coldplay sorted the square sheep from the groovy goats .
If you hated Coldplay , you were OK .
If you liked them you probably also liked leather sofas , sweet German wines , T.G.I.
Friday's , golf , the royal family , Top Gear and Terry Wogan .
In short , you were Alan Partridge .
But this year – as the rumbling hype about the new Coldplay album annoyed the alphas and made the epsilons drool in anticipation – all the signs that Coldplay had reached Phil Collins - esque , so - synonymous - with - shit - that - they 're - simply - not - worth - slagging status were there .
Journalists who wrote Coldplay - are - rubbish articles were howled down for being lazy and obvious .
Two usually stroppy writers of my acquaintance wrote tongue - in - cheek articles defending Coldplay ( always sign a band are no longer worth kicking ) .
" How could anyone hate a band this bland ? " agreed one hip punter .
" They are audio gruel . "
And , sniffing the air , those of us who scrape a living by firing rocket - propelled grenades at safely tethered sacred cows , backed off .
Coldplay are now officially too easy , too obvious and therefore out of bounds .
Chris Martin and his cardigan - rock - purveying colleagues are in that great flogged - to - death horsey - filled paddock in the sky – endlessly eating and regurgitating their own fetid dung , alongside all those other rubbish musos who we once hated with a passion but now can't be bothered to even think about .
Hi , Sting .
I come not to slag Coldplay , but to bury them .
And then dig them up , suck the marrow out of their bones and then bury them again .
Alas , poor aural porridge , I fear we shall not hear their like again .

Shirley Sherrod : Racist or scapegoat ?
Were the administration and the NAACP too hasty in their reactions to Shirley Sherrod , the Department of Agriculture employee who resigned ( i.e. , was fired ) for allegedly racist comments ?
A video clip posted online Monday shows Sherrod delivering a speech at a March NAACP banquet , where she talks about her failure to help a white farmer who was in danger of losing his farm .
Her suggestion :
If he ’d been black , she would have moved heaven and earth to help him .
“ There is zero tolerance for discrimination at USDA , and I strongly condemn any act of discrimination against any person , " said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , in accepting Sherrod ’s resignation .
The NAACP , which last week accused the Tea Party of racism , rushed out a searing condemnation of Sherrod : “ We are appalled by her actions , just as we are with abuses of power against farmers of color and female farmers , " said NAACP president Benjamin Jealous .
But I ’m not so sure that this apparently quick and sharp rush to judgment was fair .
The incident Sherrod recounts occurred more than 20 years ago , before she was employed by the federal government and while she worked for a Georgia organization that assisted farmers .
One of the online snippets shows her all but saying she was wrong and explaining that the episode helped her to understand that race should not have played a role in the matter .
Sherrod has since told CNN and the Atlanta Journal - Constitution that she worked for some two years to help the white man save his farm and that she and the man ’s family ultimately became friends .
Eloise Spooner , the wife of the white farmer , has confirmed Sherrod ’s version of events .
Did the Ag Department fully vet this matter before ordering Sherrod ’s removal ?
Did the White House or its political operatives have a hand in this personnel decision ?
Was Sherrod allowed to fully tell her side of the story before being axed ?
I ’d like some answers .
Update , 6:05 p.m. :
An earlier version of this post incorrectly reported that the white farmer is deceased .

New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know , from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb .
How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach , how we teach it , and how we assess what our children learn .
The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in - depth learning .
This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system .
Topics include :
How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain .
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn .
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach .
The amazing learning potential of infants .
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace .
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers .
A realistic look at the role of technology in education .
If education is to help students make sense of their surroundings and ready them for the challenges of the technology - driven , internationally competitive world , then it must be based on what we know about learning from science .
In that light , this book will be of significant professional interest to teachers , education policymakers and administrators , and curriculum developers .
Day 2
Good morning ... or as they say in - in that certain rich hippie way .
The first night of the four day drunk fest is over and I 'm not feeling too bad considering how much I drank last night .
The dinner was fine .
Who knew moose would work so well in a stew ?
The flan was also not too bad .
I was seated betweenand ( Mogul ?
Really ? ) .
Thatguy was fine butwas a pain in my ass .
I tried to change seats but no one would do it .
It seemswas pissed off that some blogger in my enormous company made some crack that " Facebook Is Worthless " .
I have thousands of employees .
I can't be bothered about one freakin ' blogger .
What a punk ass dope !
The drinking went well into the night .
Rupert Murdoch Terry Semel and I held court innear the .
As I said yesterday , bartendermakes the best freakin ' dirty martinis I 've ever had .
I suck 'em down like water .
Unfortunately , the night had to end and this morning began at 5:00 a.m. with the ridiculouschoral arrangement / wake up call ( written by Michael Eisner years ago ) played over loud speakers to urge us all to :
This annoying , horrible song repeats and repeats until we all gather out in the (a name that seriously needs to be changed .
We are far from " common " .
I have suggested " or ) .
After we assembled for calisthenics led by Bob Iger ( a non-starter for me and almost all of the ) , fanfare is played while theflag is raised up the flagpole .
We then recite ( which I will not repeat - but involves words like " integrity " , " philanthropy " and " quality " ) .
All bullshit if you ask me .
But there were a few guys ( Jeffrey Katzenberg and Harvey Weinstein to name a couple ) who were reciting it as though they were brainwashed North Korean school children .
They were in tears as they pledged to be the best mogul they could be .
After an awkward group embrace , we were sent our own way byfor bike riding , tennis or our own private " thinking time " by theWe then gathered in the " Great Hall of the Moguls " for a breakfast of waffles and our choice of sausage made from wild game that was recently shot on a local hunting farm .
Antelope seems to be favorite among media moguls .
The tech moguls go right for the bacon made from wild boar .
So that 's been my morning .
I passed on going to several little panel groups and am about to have my first cocktail .
Jeff Zucker and Peter Chernin are sneaking out of thepanel and joining me to watch the Spain / Germany World Cup match Hopefully , something interesting is planned for tonight .
I 'm so unbelievably bored .
James Longworth is an enigma ( of sorts ) .
That does n't make him a secret - just a tad difficult to descibe .

Breaking News – Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan says that Hamas is not a terror organization .
Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said in a speech to thousands of people in the Turkish city of Konya during a rally that he “ does not see Hamas as a terror organization ” .
How Israel , the United States and other European countries will react to this speech is unknown but it is sure to further deteriorate relations between Israel and Turkey .
Tensions had been in almost breaking point after an Aid Flotilla lead by the Turkish ship Blue Marmara was raided by Commandos belonging to the Israeli Defense Forces in which nine demonstrators were killed .
The Turkish Prime Minister who cut short his trip in Latin America to return to Turkey to deal with the issue condemned Israel ’s actions and described it as a “ bloody massacre ” .
Israel , Japan , Canada , the United States and the governments of the European Union , identify Hamas as a terrorist organization .
The speech by the Turkish Prime Minister comes a day after eight of the dead from the Flotilla raid , all of Turkish origin were buried .
The coffins which were covered with Palestinian and Turkish flags were carried above shoulders with thousands of protesters chanting anti Israeli slogans in the victims cities of residents in Turkey .
Update – The Prime Minister also criticized the newspaper and news website columnists which compared the PKK ( Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ) , which is listed as a terror organization in many countries around the world , with Hamas .

Firm scrambles to patch vBulletin software flaw By Jonathan Fildes
Technology reporter , BBC News Published duration 22 July 2010
image caption
The flaw could allow a hacker to access forum user 's personal data
A serious flaw in software widely used to power online discussion sites could allow hackers to harvest reams of personal data , the BBC has learned .
The flaw in a specific version of the vBulletin software allows anyone to easily access the main administrator username and password for a site .
This would also allow hackers to access data , such as e-mail addresses , and edit the site at will .
The owner of the program - Internet Brands - released a fix on 21 July .
However , at time of writing , many sites remain vulnerable .
The BBC was alerted to the problem by Stuart Wright of audio visual reviews site AV forums , which uses the software for its discussion boards , before the patch was released .
" It is very worrying that they are releasing a product which has such a horrendous flaw , " Mr Wright told BBC News .
" I 'm really not happy - we rely on this software for our business . "
AV Forums has around 300,000 members .
It was not using the version with the flaw .
Internet Brands has not responded to requests for comment on the problem .
Simple hack
vBulletin is software that is used to power a large proportion of internet forums and discussion boards on the web .
It was originally developed by Jelsoft and vBulletin Solutions , but was sold to Internet Brands in 2007 .
The flaw affects version 3.8.6 of the software , which was released on 13 July .
The simple hack , which the BBC has confirmed , allows even unskilled people to access many websites .
With a few key strokes the person can obtain the administrator 's username and password for the website .
This can be used to log in to the site and modify and delete elements at will .
David Ross , founder of Hexus.net , a technology news and reviews website , said the flaw was a " potential nightmare " .
" It could allow someone to access all of the user accounts for the site , " he said .
This would be useful to a hacker , he said , because it was " good quality information " that had already been verified .
Hexus.net , which has 75,000 registered users , updated their site as soon as they were made aware of the flaw .
Net aware
Internet Brands announced a patch for the problem at 1900 BST on 21 July on its website .
It also sent e-mails to its customers and sent out a message that appeared on the main control panels of individual customers ' software .
However , hours before the official announcement , third party firms that provide services to vBulletin were already warning of a problem .
" It has come to our attention that a vulnerability on vBulletin 3.8.6 has been discovered , " read one from vBSEO .
" The exploit allows a malicious user to retrieve a forum 's database credentials . "
It then offered advice on how to fix the problem .
Kier Darby , the former lead developer of vBulletin also issued an alert via Twitter .
However , nearly 24 hours later , many websites are still vulnerable .
Graham Cluley of security firm Sophos said that this could be because firms were testing the new patch .
" If this is a piece of software running on your company website then it is good practice to test it before it goes live to make sure you 're not introducing more problems , " he told BBC News .
However , he said , firms should plug the flaw as soon as possible .
" If the provider of the software says there is a issue with it , they have flagged it up to the entire internet , " he said .
As the summer progressed , I felt like I needed to improve my initial design .
Luckily enough the science department had just thrown away an old freeze drying machine which had a perfect radiator .
A few minutes crouched by the dumpster with some hand tools , some minor adjustments , and the Black Beauty was born .
Here ’s the overall view of the unit .
A high speed fan pushes the air through the perfectly sized radiator , and water flow rate is controlled by a small hand valve .
The radiator itself was horribly filthy when I first took it off , but a quick soak in some warm water and light detergent took care of it .
The copper tubing inside the radiator is the exact same diameter as the copper tubing I used when I first built my original homemade air conditioner , so no need to change up the vinyl tubing .
I placed the fan fairly close to the radiator itself , and it works great .
I typically put the fan on the medium or low setting , as I notice little benefit from the high speed setting other than increased noise .
The radiator was almost perfect , it only needed to be raised by a centimeter or so to align with the fan .
Turns out old original Nintendo cartridges do the trick just fine .
( For the record , that ’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Marble Madness .
Do n’t worry , I have other copies . )
Cold water is supplied from an outside garden hose .
More detail can be found in the water supply section .
To calibrate the valves , the small hand valve inside is first opened wide and the garden hose opened or closed to find an appropriate upper flowrate .
Then the hand valve may be used to vary the water flow or turn it off entirely .
The nice thing about this new setup is that all control is now done from inside the room .
Starting and stopping the unit is far more convenient , which leads to more efficient water usage .
The performance of the unit is drastically improved over the old design .
Less water is needed , and the room cools quicker .
Mr Ventham said he felt the project was a good example of community empowerment as proposed by the Prime Minister in his Big Society .
" I am not sure if he is expressly thinking about Shitterton signposts , but I think he is talking about people getting off their backsides and doing things , rather than expecting them to be done for you , " he added .
Not all are happy that the name is now set in stone , however .
A few in the hamlet , on the outskirts of Bere Regis , prefer the more genteel Sitterton .
'' We know people are dying and getting diseases in Lithgow at a rate much higher than elsewhere and it is a legitimate question to ask if the coal industry is contributing to that , '' local doctor Richard Stiles said .
The SWAHS 2005 - 10 Healthcare Services plan showed Lithgow 's cancer rate to be 20 per cent greater than the state average .
But 2008 figures show a drop .
A spokeswoman for the health service explained : '' Over time , rates of some individual cancers have been higher in some years but the number of cases in the small Lithgow population means that rates vary from year to year . ''
The earlier figures also showed the rate of heart attacks at almost 50 per cent greater than the rest of NSW .
Dr Stiles said : '' What the community needs is an independent health inquiry to see if this environmental pollution , both air - and water - borne , is having an adverse impact on the health of the people living here . ''
The figures also show a greater number of smokers and overweight people in the area , but Dr Stiles said : '' It does n't stack up that these problems are just down to poor lifestyle .
From a local doctor 's perspective this is a major issue that should not be swept under the carpet . ''
He was among a group of doctors who raised questions last year about decontaminated mine discharge water from the Clarence colliery being added to the drinking supply to try to drought - proof the town .
Conservationists also raised the alarm about the nearby coal - fired Wallerawang power plant releasing toxic metals and pollutants such as arsenic into the Coxs River , which feeds into Sydney 's water supply .
There are plans to extend another coal - fired plant at Mount Piper .
The area health service recommended it become gas - fired to cut air pollution .
'' The location of the peak air pollution impact is on two of the most disadvantaged suburbs in SWAHS , potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities , '' it warned .
People living near the power station , at Blackmans Flat and Wallerawang , were regularly exposed to high levels of sulphur dioxide , which the report said was linked to greater levels of respiratory and cardiac disease .
Residents regularly complain about talcum - powder - like ash from mines dusting their homes .
Asthma Foundation NSW chief Greg Smith called on the state government to improve air monitoring : " [ We are ] aware of long - standing concerns about the very high rates of asthma in Lithgow and of the anecdotal evidence that coal dust and pollution from heavy machinery used in mining and the transport of coal may be either causing or exacerbating asthma . ''
A spokeswoman for the area health service said : '' Lithgow residents also have higher rates of admission to hospital for asthma than the NSW average .
Increased rates of asthma can be caused by a number of factors , especially exposure to tobacco smoke , pollens , dust mite , mould and other types of indoor and outdoor air pollution . ''
Kirsty Ruddock , principal solicitor with the Environmental Defenders Office , said the law needed to be reformed to provide greater protection to residents in areas around coal - fired power stations and coal mining .
She pointed to American research that found long - term exposure to fine dust particles increased the risk of heart disease and lung cancer .
Greens MP
Lee Rhiannon has entered a motion in Parliament calling for a health study into mining and power station emissions in the Hunter be extended to Lithgow .
And she called for an Environment Protection Agency office to be opened in Lithgow after research showed 22 mines in the area breached their pollution licences 1267 times between 2000 and 2008 ( a third of the total incidents reported across NSW ) .
Many of the breaches were a failure to report results of their own monitoring .
There are no EPA staff in the area to provide independent checks .
" Coal companies are making huge windfall profits yet the NSW government is failing to enforce the environmental conditions of mine approval , '' Ms Rhiannon said .
" Coal companies barely get a slap on the wrist for pollution breaches , so they continue to reoffend .
The Springvale colliery in Lidsdale , the state 's worst offender , continues to breach its licence every year .
'' Communities do not want to breathe coal dust , nor do they want arsenic , nickel , zinc and copper entering the water catchment . ''
Bob Miller , from Springvale Colliery 's owner Centennial Coal , said the EPL breaches were the result of a broken water monitor .
'' This was a minor onsite issue which posed a zero threat to the environment and in actual fact is an environmentally responsible disposal of onsite water …
'' However , for each day the equipment was not working and despite continued manual monitoring another individual breach was calculated , '' Mr Miller said .
A spokeswoman for Environment Minister Frank Sartor said the department did not consider Springvale discharges had caused significant water pollution issues over the past 10 years
And she said there was no need for a new EPA office : '' There is an EPA office located in the Bathurst region - approximately 40 minutes from Lithgow . ''
Lithgow mayor Neville Castle said air quality in Lithgow was fine : '' I think people should get their facts straight before they start raising things in Parliament . ''
He said the greater mortality rates in Lithgow were similar to those in Holroyd .
Loading '' I do n't see a lot of power stations there . ''
No hay recetas mágicas .
No es una cuestión de inteligencia ni de predisposición genética .
Que las chicas saquen mejores notas que sus compañeros de pupitre , que sean menos propensas a repetir cursos y que desde hace más de una década las mujeres sean mayoría en las universidades españolas se debe , básicamente , a que estudian más .
Es decir , pasan más horas frente a los libros hincando los codos .
Por el momento , esta es la única fórmula demostrada y efectiva para superar un examen .
Un estudio realizado por la Unidad de Psicología Preventiva de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid y dirigido por María José Díaz - Aguado ayuda a explicar las diferencias que suelen observarse en resultados y titulaciones .
Sólo el 11,6 % de las chicas dedica menos de una hora diaria a estudiar , mientras que en dicha situación se encuentra el 31 % de los chicos .
En el polo opuesto , el 49,6 % de las adolescentes reconoce que estudia más de dos horas diarias , frente al 24,4 % de sus compañeros varones .
En cuanto al tiempo dedicado a lecturas que no son propiamente de estudios , el informe muestra , de nuevo , un mayor interés de las chicas : mientras el 47,6 % de los chicos no dedica ni un minuto al día a leer ( 27,4 % en el caso de las chicas ) , el 26,3 % de las féminas pasa más de dos horas frente a un libro ( el 14,5 % de los varones ) .
Por el contrario , las chicas están sobrerrepresentadas entre quienes afirman no dedicar nada de tiempo al deporte ( el 33,2 % ) o menos de una hora al día ( 32,25 % ) , mientras que la gran mayoría de sus compañeros masculinos dedica más de una hora diaria a hacer ejercicio .
Estos son algunos de los resultados de un trabajo que tiene como principal fin diagnosticar la situación de los adolescentes para prevenir la violencia sexista .
En dicho estudio han participado 335 centros educativos , 2.727 profesores y 11.020 estudiantes de 3.º y 4 . º de ESO , bachillerato y formación profesional .
La necesidad de saber a qué dedican su tiempo los adolescentes y cuáles son los papeles que cada sexo reproduce explica la inclusión en un estudio sobre violencia machista estas cuestiones relativas al estudio .
Y es que , según los expertos , la clave está en la meta que cada género se marca desde la adolescencia .
Un trabajo realizado por la Universidad de Santiago de Compostela y publicado en el Spanish Journal of Psychology pone claramente de manifiesto que las chicas conceden una gran importancia a los logros académicos como paso imprescindible para la emancipación y la independencia , mientras que los varones difuminan sus objetivos y se marcan más logros deportivos y metas antisociales , entendiendo como tales participar en comportamientos a veces exentos de cierta ética que les permiten obtener un reconocimiento social .
 Ser un malote en el instituto da puntos ; aunque ni siquiera en el fondo quieran llevar la contraria o saltarse las normas , muchos lo hacen porque consideran que eso les hace ser populares , señala Belén Cid , tutora de un grupo 3 . º de ESO de un instituto .
Todo ello tiene mucho que ver con que ellas destaquen por sus buenos expedientes académicos en cualquier etapa educativa .
Además , en comparación con los chicos , repiten menos y alcanzan en mayor proporción los estudios superiores .
Y no desde hace un año , sino desde hace muchos años .
Atrás quedan aquellas campañas informativas de los años ochenta para promover la permanencia de la mujer en el sistema educativo dirigidas a las familias :
 No limites su educación , es una mujer del siglo XXI .
El estudio dirigido por Díaz - Aguado profundiza en la imagen que los profesores tienen de los alumnos y las alumnas .
Llama la atención que , en los puntos que tienen que ver con estudiar y rendir más y asistir con frecuencia a clase , el profesorado destaca el papel de las chicas , así como en todo aquello que tiene que ver con la comunicación , el debate , la empatía , el respeto y la ayuda a la resolución de conflictos .
Por el contrario , conductas relacionadas con el uso de la violencia , el incumplimiento de las normas y comportamientos disruptivos en el aula se observan más en chicos , junto con las dificultades de comunicación interpersonal .
Los expertos constatan que las mujeres superan a los hombres en todos los indicadores educativos : repetición , permanencia , promoción ...
Sin embargo , las explicaciones profundas de esta superioridad académica femenina son todo menos unánimes y unidireccionales .
Algunos de los expertos la vinculan a un ritmo de maduración más rápido por parte de las estudiantes ; otros , a una mayor aptitud para la expresión verbal , a una capacidad más notoria de trabajo o a una actitud más acorde con la norma .
También hay investigadores que la atribuyen a una mayor identificación con la escuela e incluso como una forma para obtener ventaja en el difícil mercado laboral .
El reciente informe de la Fundació La Caixa Fracaso y abandono escolar en España señala con preocupación el retroceso de los hombres , al aparecer más desapegados de las exigencias de los estudios y más atraídos por el mercado de trabajo .
Sin embargo , apunta esta investigación dirigida por el sociólogo Mariano Fernández Enguita , nada permite saber si se trata de una causa , de un efecto o de ambas cosas .
¿ Cree que las buenas notas de las mujeres aseguran un mejor puesto de trabajo ?
1. Introduction to Distributed Generation
1.1 What is Distributed Generation ?
Distributed generation is an approach that employs small - scale technologies to produce electricity close to the end users of power .
DG technologies often consist of modular ( and sometimes renewable - energy ) generators , and they offer a number of potential benefits .
In many cases , distributed generators can provide lower - cost electricity and higher power reliability and security with fewer environmental consequences than can traditional power generators .
In contrast to the use of a few large - scale generating stations located far from load centers -- the approach used in the traditional electric power paradigm -- DG systems employ numerous , but small plants and can provide power onsite with little reliance on the distribution and transmission grid .
DG technologies yield power in capacities that range from a fraction of a kilowatt [ kW ] to about 100 megawatts [ MW ] .
Utility - scale generation units generate power in capacities that often reach beyond 1,000 MW .
Classic Electricity Paradigm -- Central Power Station Model
The current model for electricity generation and distribution in the United States is dominated by centralized power plants .
The power at these plants is typically combustion ( coal , oil , and natural ) or nuclear generated .
Centralized power models , like this , require distribution from the center to outlying consumers .
Current substations can be anywhere from 10s to 100s of miles away from the actual users of the power generated .
This requires transmission across the distance .
This system of centralized power plants has many disadvantages .
In addition to the transmission distance issues , these systems contribute to greenhouse gas emission , the production of nuclear waste , inefficiencies and power loss over the lengthy transmission lines , environmental distribution where the power lines are constructed , and security related issues .
Many of these issues can be mediated through distributed energies .
By locating , the source near or at the end - user location the transmission line issues are rendered obsolete .
Distributed generation ( DG ) is often produced by small modular energy conversion units like solar panels .
As has been demonstrated by solar panel use in the United States , these units can be stand - alone or integrated into the existing energy grid .
Frequently , consumers who have installed solar panels will contribute more to the grid than they take out resulting in a win - win situation for both the power grid and the end -user .

Distributed Generation ( DG ) Electricity Paradigm
( This figure has been taken from the European Commission Energy Research website : http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/nn/nn_rt/nn_rt_dg/article_1158_en.htm)
What are Some Examples of Distributed Generation Technologies ?
Distributed generation takes place on two - levels : the local level and the end - point level .
Local level power generation plants often include renewable energy technologies that are site specific , such as wind turbines , geothermal energy production , solar systems ( photovoltaic and combustion ) , and some hydro - thermal plants .
These plants tend to be smaller and less centralized than the traditional model plants .
They also are frequently more energy and cost efficient and more reliable .
Since these local level DG producers often take into account the local context , the usually produce less environmentally damaging or disrupting energy than the larger central model plants .
Wind Turbines at Buffalo Mountain , TN
Photovoltaic ( Solar ) Panels help Power this Elementary School in Fairbanks , Alaska
A 300 kW Capstone Microturbine at a Demonstration Project at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge , TN
Phosphorus fuel cells also provide an alternative route to a DG technology .
These are not as environmentally reliant as the previously mentioned technologies .
These fuel cells are able to provide electricity through a chemical process rather than a combustion process .
This process produces little particulate waste .
At the end - point level the individual energy consumer can apply many of these same technologies with similar effects .
One DG technology frequently employed by end - point users is the modular internal combustion engine .
For example , some departments here at Virginia
Tech use these power generators as a backup to the normal power grid .
These modular internal combustion engines can also be used to backup RVs and homes .
As many of these familiar examples show DG technologies can operate as isolated " islands " of electric energy production or they can serve as small contributors to the power grid .

As many people have warned us , hedge funds are going to take over the global food supplies .
Now a hedge fund manager named Anthony Ward has pretty much cornered the world market on cocoa and from what he says in this video , will be going after food and water , too :
Now , traders here are buzzing that Mr. Ward has placed an audacious $ 1 billion bet in the London market for cocoa futures .
This month , he bought 241,100 metric tons of beans , they say .
His play has some people up in arms .
While some see it as a simple bet that cocoa prices will rise on falling supply , others say Mr. Ward has created a shortage of cocoa simply to drive up the price himself .
The German Cocoa Trade Association and others wrote an angry letter to the London exchange on which cocoa is traded , demanding that it take action against what the association characterized as a “ manipulation . ”
The British news media has christened Mr. Ward “ Chocolate Finger , ” a nod to the Bond villain Auric Goldfinger .
And on Facebook , someone has created a “ Choc Finger ” page featuring Mr. Ward ’s face superimposed on a pig that is bellying up to the trough .
The fear is that Mr. Ward will become the go - to source until the annual cocoa harvest , which starts in October .
With candy makers starting to stock up for the holiday season , they may be forced to pay him ever - higher prices — and cocoa has already jumped 150 percent since 2008 .
“ The squeeze was really timed perfectly , ” said Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt .
Mr. Ward and his firm , which has not acknowledged buying the cocoa contracts , declined to comment for this article .
If you rent a car from Hertz , Avis , Budget , or Advantage , you might want to avoid running any red lights .
If you do , and you get caught on camera , your credit card will get charged .
The rental companies give your data to a company called American Traffic Solutions .
This company runs red - light cameras in some areas , and it uses the data to make sure the right driver is charged and fined when one of the cars is caught running a red light .
It 's not clear if ATS is accessing the data at all times or only when a driver is caught running a red light on camera .
The catch is that ATS automatically bills the accused customer 's credit card , tacking a $ 30 processing fee on top .
This makes it very difficult for customers to appeal the ticket , and even when customers do successfully appeal , they still have to fight the $ 30 fee .
This speaks to a larger problem , especially with Congress mandating that future cars be equipped with black boxes that can record accident data .
With so much data being recorded about our personal lives , how do we know who 's watching ?
We 've already heard of GPS systems being used to stalk lost loves , and while black - box data might be useful in cases such as the recent Toyota unintended acceleration flap , there is a concern that if data falls into the wrong hands , it can be misused .
In the rental car case , the problem is n't that the technology is busting violators , but that ATS can make determinations without due process , and that it can be difficult for those erroneously charged to get their money refunded .
In some cases , ATS is the camera operator , which means they are both billing customers and issuing the tickets .
Thanks in part to Toyota 's recall problems , black boxes are coming to all cars someday soon .
But there are questions that need to be answered .
There 's no doubt that technology such as GPS , video , and data recorders , can help make cars safer .
But at what point does it become too much ?
At what point will consumers no longer accept a trade of privacy for security ?
How much data should be shared after an accident ?
Who should see such data ?
How can private information be kept out of the wrong hands ?
What do you think ?

Housing : Mortgage Applications Plummet
Housing prices , already under pressure because of unemployment and the number of defaults , are likely to continue their drop .
There are fewer and fewer buyers in the market .
And , the federal government ’s tax credits expired at the end of the month .
The Mortgage Bankers Association presented fresh evidence that the number of people purchasing houses is continuing to fall off .
In its weekly mortgage report , the MBA writes
“ Purchase applications plummeted 27 percent last week and have declined almost 20 percent over the past month , despite relatively low interest rates .
The data continue to suggest that the tax credit pulled sales into April at the expense of the remainder of the spring buying season .
In fact , this drop occurred even as rates on 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages continued to fall , and at 4.83 percent are at their lowest level since November 2009 , ” said Michael Fratantoni , MBA ’s Vice President of Research and Economics
The numbers are unprecedented , at last for period that goes back over a decade :
The seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreased 27.1 percent from one week earlier .
This is the lowest Purchase Index observed in the survey since May of 1997 .
The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 27.0 percent compared with the previous week and was 24.1 percent lower than the same week one year ago .
A Treasury Department report released early this week showed that HAMP was failing to modify any meaningful number of mortgages , despite its goal of giving permanent relief to three to four million troubled home owners .
The April report on the program said 230,801 trial plan modifications through HAMP have been converted to permanent status .
Recent RealyTrac figures show that foreclosures are on a pace to hit a record high this year .
Under the circumstances , it is a wonder that the Administration did not renew the home buyer tax credit .
It appeared to be the only incentive that brought a significant flow of buyers into the market .

PHOENIX  A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the most controversial parts of Arizona ’s immigration enforcement law from going into effect , a ruling that at least temporarily squashed a state policy that had inflamed the national debate over immigration .
Judge Susan Bolton of Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction against sections of the law , scheduled to take effect on Thursday , that called for police officers to check a person ’s immigration status while enforcing other laws and required immigrants to prove that they were authorized to be in the country or risk state charges .
She issued the injunction in response to a legal challenge brought against the law by the Obama administration .
A spokesman for Gov. Jan Brewer , a Republican who signed the law and has campaigned on it for election to a full term , said Wednesday that the governor would appeal the injunction on Thursday and ask for a speedy review .
Legal experts predicted that the case could end up before the Supreme Court .
The law , designed to seek and deport illegal immigrants in a state that is the principal gateway for illegal border crossers , had provoked intense debate from coast to coast , drawing support in several polls but generating boycotts of the state by major civil rights groups and several cities and towns .
Steve Wiebe , the protagonist of the documentary The King of Kong , famous for his pursuit of Donkey Kong 's all - time record , will be enshrined alongside the game 's creator with the first class inducted by the International Video Games Hall of Fame .

Wiebe , an algebra teacher in Kirkland , Wash . , is currently the holder of the No. 3 points record for Donkey Kong and is No. 2 all - time for Donkey Kong Jr. , having held the No. 1 position for that game twice .
He will be honored along with Nolan Bushnell , the creator of Pong , famed Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto , and adversary Billy Mitchell , when the Hall of Fame inducts its first class at a gala celebration this August in Ottumwa , Iowa .

Wiebe 's induction is notable considering not only his rivalry with Mitchell , but also his relationship with Twin Galaxies , the international high - score certification authority , which began as an arcade in the city 's downtown back in the 1980s .
That history is key to Ottumwa 's claim as the " Video Games Capital of the World . "
In The King of Kong , a dispute over the legitimacy of videotaped high score attempts ends with Twin Galaxies proclaiming Mitchell still the all - time Donkey Kong high score holder , though Wiebe would go on to later set the game 's world record , with Twin Galaxies ' blessing .
The mark is now held by another man , Hank Chien of New York .
The inaugural celebration of the International Video Games Hall of Fame will be held Aug. 5 to Aug. 8 in Ottumwa , Iowa , and will include induction ceremonies , LAN gaming , tournaments , historical displays and guest speakers .
Steve Wiebe To Be Honored By Video Game Hall Of Fame
Real Liberal Christian Church
" The vile person shall be no more called liberal , nor the churl said to be bountiful . " — Isaiah 32:5
There are two surefire ways to start a fight in America : you can call someone a socialist or you can call someone a liar .
Al Lewis , known to millions of television viewers as Grandpa Munster , was both .
Had Al Lewis ever written an autobiography , it most certainly would have been marketed as a Choose - Your - Own - Adventure book .
Lewis was an outspoken progressive , a chronic cigar smoker and a life - long social activist .
He was also an expletive - laced teller of tall tales , embellishing every facet of his life with a steady stream of ludicrous proclamations .
He was an actor onstage and off , constantly amplifying his own legend .
He would always strive to be larger - than - life and generally achieved the objective .
" Charles Manson babysat my kids , " he once bragged .
" He did n't chop no heads off .
He was very nice with me . "
LEWIS THE MAN - LEWIS THE MYTH
Al Lewis dropped out of school when he was sixteen and hit the road .
" He would disappear for months on end , " remembers his brother .
" Later on I found out he had gone to work in a circus . "
Al Lewis spoke about this period of his life with a typical mix of honesty and deceit .
" I worked every single entertainment medium , including some that do n't exist ... I was about twelve years old ...
I worked the circus , the carnival , I had my own medicine show ... I made it in a bathtub .
[ Good for ] whatever ailed you .
I probably kept your grandfather alive .
That 's why you 're here ... [ the medicine was called ]
The Professor [ at other times ]
Little Alfie ...
Made it in the bathtub the night before , bottled it , put a label on it and sold it the following day in town - all through the South ... I worked in various circuses .
Cole Brothers , Clyde Beatty , Barnum and Bailey .
I started out as a roustabout , cleaning up ... then I worked myself up into a clown and did a trick unicycle act . "
Grandpa had a series of stock jokes he used during interviews .
One described his circus job .
" Elephants are vegetarians and leave a lot to be desired .
I was the guy who was shoveling the ' lot to be desired . "
Lewis liked to say he worked on the defense committee of Italian anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti .
If there were any semblance of truth to this , it would have occurred when he was no more than five years old .
Lewis said it was his mother 's influence that made him an unabashed socialist .
" My mother was an immigrant woman , a peasant woman , struggled all her life , worked in the garment center .
[ She ] understood what the struggle was about .
My mother could n't read or write , but she had more sense than many a graduate from Harvard ...
You become aware .
It hits you in the stomach and then a cop hits you on the head .
You become aware ... I remember my mother used to [ march ] for the Scottsboro boys ... we struggled to free them .
I remember participating in demonstrations [ for ]
Tom Mooney and Warren K. Billings , the so - called bombing of the Preparedness Day Parade .
And then during the depression , people were getting evicted ...
We used to come along and break the lock and put the furniture back in again .
We would storm the Home Relief Centers [ on behalf of people who ] did n't get a check for eight dollars or something and get hit on the head . "
He said the National Maritime Union sent him to Fayette , North Carolina to organize the Food , Agricultural and Tobacco Workers Union .
" You [ had your work cut out for you ] organizing in the South , " he said .
" Even John L. Lewis , who organized the United Mine Workers .
He did n't get very many Southern mine workers ...
You 'd get shot at ... the poor people there who had no jobs .
They were hired by the boss .
They 'd hand them a gun .
' You see this son of a bitch ?
Blow his head off . '
You know who [ John L. Lewis ] 's organizers were ?
Communists from the North ...
Many of them got blown away .
Just step off the train , they blow your head off .
You do n't know what fear is . "
From there , he explained , he entered the world of radio , furnishing uncredited bit parts on various programs .
His nineteen forties radio work has never surfaced .
Asked what shows he worked on he answered , " All kinds .
You name it .
WGN ...
Went to WFW ... came to New York did about eighteen years of radio . "
He once made the specious claim that he had been a member of Orson Welles ' Mercury Theater .
Al also placed himself in Italy when he told a Syracuse newspaper " I lived in Rome and did n't speak the language .
I was there for the heyday of realism : Fellini , Rosellini , the biggies .
When their films became successful and popular they were shipped here .
I did what they call dubbing .
The most tedious work [ was ] having to match lip movements .
Richard Basehart was there , Anthony Quinn was there . "
Basehart and Quinn were there but Al Lewis was not .
Neither was he in Washington , as he claimed , the night the American communists Julius and Ethel Rosenberg , sentenced to death for treason , were executed .
Grandpa stumbled through a series of falsehoods in an interview with Democracy Now for reasons known only to him .
Amy Goodman : [ Car 54 Where Are You ] was after the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg .
Lewis : Uhhhhh....well .... ahhhhhh ...
Goodman : I think you were on Car 54 Where Are You [ in ] 1960 - 61 .
Lewis :
Oh , uh , sixty to sixty - two .
Oh yeah !
That was after , that was after .
The night ... I was very active in that ... as were many others .
Y'know , I mean you live !
You gotta move forward .
The night they were executed which uh ... uh , I was in DC , uh , marching around the White House .
And , uh , the two kids were there .
Manny Block was there ...
Goodman : Robbie and Michael .
Lewis : Huh ?
Goodman : Robbie and Michael ... the two sons of ...
Lewis : Yeah , they were there .
And uh , Manuel Block and the lady who assisted him ... and some people were resisting ...
Goodman :
Why were you in Washington ?
Lewis : People would walk by ... use all kinds of ... attempting to start a fight .
Police would come in and bust heads .
Someone had a radio .
And that is a moment that has never left me .
Goodman :
We 're talking to Al Lewis and we 're going to come back with him and find out how he rode shotgun in W.E.B. Dubois ' car in the funeral procession for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg ...
His actual political involvement during the late forties and early fifties is vague and contradictory .
Despite this , there is no doubt he held the same political beliefs as the giants he claimed to know intimately .
Lewis was often combative with journalists that dared press him for details .
Once he was well known as Grandpa Munster , he uniformly added an extra thirteen years to his age in order to live - up to the persona .
Lewis : I 'm not a politician .
I 've been a performer all my life .
But I 'm a very political person and have been that way fifty , sixty years .
[ I was involved with ] topical events of the day like the attempt to stop the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti , the imprisonment of Tom Mooney and Warren K. Billings , the trial and imprisonment of the Scottsboro Boys ...
Craig Seeman :
What role did you play ?
You were pretty young at that time .
Were you simply ...
Lewis : Was I pretty young ?
You were pretty young !
I 'm not responsible for that !
Nobody encouraged your father to ( laughs ) .
Seeman :
Your role , you must have been a fairly young man , right ?
Late teens early twenties ?
Lewis :
Well , I was born in 1910 .
So , if you have problem with that ...
Seeman : No , that 's ...
Lewis :
In the thirties I was , uh , you know , in my twenties .
LEWIS THE ACTOR - LEWIS THE SITCOM STAR
Lewis ' legitimate showbiz career started in the mid-fifties .
He attended the Paul Mann Actor 's Workshop where he met classmate Sidney Poitier .
He found work in a handful of Broadway productions 1 and had television cameos on The Phil Silvers Show , Decoy and The United States Steel Hour .
Nat Hiken was the talented comedy scribe who created The Phil Silvers Show .
When the series ended in 1959 , Phil Silvers returned to Broadway and starred in a musical called Do Re Mi.
Hiken attended one evening only to discover that Al Lewis was also in the play .
Lewis showcased a range that Hiken had not previously known about .
He immediately wanted to use him in a new sitcom he had conceived called Car 54 Where Are You .
Hiken had lined up corrosive nightclub comic Joe E. Ross to star in the show with Harvard Lampoon editor Fred Gwynne .
" Nat [ Hiken ] was the creator of Sgt Bilko , Car 54 , The Colgate Comedy Hour , The Martha Raye Show , just one after another and he was a genius .
A comic genius in writing , " praised Lewis .
Car 54 Where Are
You revolved around a bumbling , often mundane , New York police precinct that percolated with inflamed passions , bruised egos and crippling insecurities .
At home , the police officers bickered with their horrid wives .
Lewis initially played incidental characters until Hiken wrote him a permanent role as Officer Leo Schnauser .
Wrestler turned comedian Hank Garrett played Officer Nicholson on the show .
He fondly remembers a smoke break .
" When I was doing Car 54 , Where Are You , Al Lewis and I were on location in the Bronx .
We were sitting in front of a building , smoking , when a large black Chrysler came to a screeching stop .
The driver flew out of the car , came charging at us screaming , ' Are you two cops out of your minds ?
I 've got a deputy chief inspector in my car and he 's going to hang you guys !'
Al replied , ' Tell him he 's a pain in the ass and stop bothering cops on break . "
Garrett had the time of his life working with Al each day .
" People wrote thousands of letters , " he remembers .
" They loved him .
He was so popular ...
He was fun , fun , fun .
A fun guy to be with .
His stories were amazing .
Most of them were n't true . "
The popularity of Schnauser brought Lewis adoration from real New York police officers .
He was often paid to entertain at law enforcement events and remained beloved by the NYPD for decades .
Lewis came to believe the police were the enemy during the Great Depression , but softened his stance once he was taken into their fold .
He would often remind his fellow progressives that many police officers were working stiffs .
Then again , he never lost an underlining distrust for cops that he had held since his youth .
" The police are here to protect property , " he once said .
" They 're not here to protect the public !
So , what the fuck ?
If they could get away with it , they 'd beat the shit out of you . "
He championed the police department when they fought a bitter labor dispute with the mayor of Manhattan years later .
" New York City has forty thousand police officers ... ninety - five percent ... they 're working [ stiffs ] ...
It 's a job ... they 're getting screwed by the mayor with the rotten contract ... now ninety - five percent of them are square working Joes who do their job .
You and I may not agree , but that 's their job .
If five percent of them [ run errant ] ... you know what five percent of forty thousand is ?
Two thousand !
That means there are two thousand maniacs running around !
Same thing in a prison , not every guard is [ bad ] .
But there are those sadistic people .
This is a concern ... [ The NYPD ] have been screwed by that piece of crap mayor .
I call him Benito Giuliani .
The only thing he has n't done is build a balcony . "
Lewis could n't really remember how he got into television .
" I do n't know .
Somebody called me .
You go from one [ gig ] to the other ...
I 'm a hustler , you know what I mean ?
People uptown they know me .
I 'm a hustler ! "
Nat Hiken 's final project was a motion picture called The Love God in which Don Knotts played a dapper pornographer .
The original germination as Hiken had conceived it had Al Lewis in the Knotts role .
Lewis was going to play a homely garment manufacturer , struggling to keep tabs on his hot wife played by Sophia Loren .
For whatever reason , it morphed into the very different Knotts film .
Comedian and activist Randy Credico said of his good friend 's acting ability , " Al was not a baggy pants comic .
[ He was ] a great actor .
One take ...
He 's one of those guys .
You give him the script , he does it .
They used to call him one - take Al ...
The guy had an incredible memory . "
At the conclusion of Car 54 Lewis would do guest shots on The Naked City and Route 66 , before taking on his perennial role as Grandpa Munster on a sitcom he never bothered to watch .
" I never thought about [ The Munsters ] , " he said .
" I never saw the show ...
It was a corny family show . "
Fred Gwynne who portrayed Herman Munster once said , " The Munsters is really [ just ] The Donna Reed Show with monsters . "
The role of Grandpa Munster was originally offered to vaudevillian Bert Lahr .2
Lahr declined the offer , as did John Carradine who had been offered the part of Herman .
Neither Al Lewis nor Fred Gwynne were pleased with the casting of Yvonne DeCarlo as the female lead .
Series writer / producer Joe Connelly dealt with what he felt was incessant and obnoxious complaining .
" We had to put up with a lot of shit from those two . "
Gwynne and Lewis felt that they had to " put up with a lot of shit " from family matriarch Lily Munster .
" Yvonne played better - than - thou for a while , " said Gwynne .
" She stayed in her wagon while we were outside ... waiting for her . "
In his book about The Munsters , Stephen Cox wrote " DeCarlo was holding up production with her constant adjustments to make - up , hair , and nails ...
She began dictating which scenes would be shot , all from the vantage of her convenience .
Gwynne and Lewis became enraged as production would halt at times and the crew would be waiting .
Finally Al Lewis had taken enough and pulled aside the beauty queen and confronted her about her demanding attitude . "
The late Abe Haberman was DeCarlo 's make - up man .
" Yvonne was a little difficult for other people , " he said .
" She fired five hairdressers .
She hated the green make - up and wanted more beautifying make - up , but the network refused . "
Pat Priest who played Marilyn Munster avoided the on - set drama and simply engaged in the fun .
" I remember Fred and Al joking with me constantly .
It got to where I could n't believe anything they said ...
They lied to me always ...
As a matter of fact , they lied about their ages ... just recently ... I found out the truth . "
Stephen Cox adds , " Al Lewis - supposed to be Lily 's father - was a year younger than DeCarlo . "
Initially the make - up department had Lewis fitted with a nose extension .
Make - up artist Karl Silvera said , " I 'll never forget it as long as I live ... [ Hunt Stromberg ] from the front office told me we were n't going to use the nose anymore because ' He looks too Jewish . '
I could n't believe they were serious . "
Al Lewis embraced the role at the time , but retained bitterness when it led to typecasting .
Fred Gwynne on the other hand seemed to hold the gig in contempt from the start .
He resented the amount of time it took for his make - up to be applied and he did not like dealing with the droves of children that adored him .
November 1964 , Fred and Al were roped into riding in the " Munster Koach " during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade .
Silvera was there .
" Oh , God , the Macy 's parade .
I was in the Koach handling the loudspeaker and radio system that was playing the Munster [ theme ] song .
Fred had brought along a bottle with him , wrapped in a paper bag , and he got [ hammered ] ...
Al was mad at him .
Fred was cussing at people .
I just kept the music up [ loud ] so nobody could hear him .
We turned the corner there at Macy 's and there was the media box with , I think it was Betty White and Lorne Greene up there describing the parade .
Fred looks up at the camera and yells ' Fuck you ! '
I thought Betty White and Lorne Greene were gonna fall off the platform ... "
The Munsters was an incredibly popular sitcom , yet it was canceled after only two seasons .
Nobody understood the reason for its termination at the time .
Series producer Joe Connelly later explained the reason for the show 's end .
" The actors were a pain in the ass .
Fred and Al objected to anything .
Fred hated the make - up and caused a lot of trouble about it on the set .
We could not stand Fred Gwynne .
The sponsor had it and we had it .
Bob [ Mosher ] and I had just had it . "
The end of the series did not upset Lewis .
He felt it had a good run and it had paid him well .
Rather than spend his money on a series of luxury items , Lewis put it toward a variety of charity causes .
" In California in [ the late sixties ] the estimate was that there were at least half a million runaways from the age of eight on , drifting to California .
Every Friday
I used to have about fifty [ to ] sixty kids who would wait for me on Sunset Boulevard and I 'd take them all to dinner .
All runaways .
That 's how I met Charlie Manson .
He wanted to be in the music business .
He babysat my three kids ... I met him in front of the Whiskey - A - Go - Go on Sunset Boulevard .
He sat for four or five hours , he amused the kids , he brought the guitar and he played , no big deal , no sweat . "
Lewis embraced the pervasive counterculture of the late nineteen sixties .
" In the sixties , there was a thousand underground papers , " Lewis remembered .
" I read them all .
I used to have them all sent to me in California ... I went to all the Love-ins .
I took my kids .
I enjoyed myself . "
Lewis cautioned those on the left to be realistic not idealistic .
" Everybody in this society wants the quick fix ...
So do the radicals , whatever you want to call them .
[ It 's ] a bumper sticker ... ' I 'm a radical ' ' I 'm a leftist ' ' I 'm a progressive ' ' I 'm left of center . '
It 's all bullshit ... very few people understand ... the ruling class is smarter than you , and they 're more creative .
And if you forget that lesson , you go down the drain .
Because if they were n't , they would n't be around as long as they have been and as strong as they have been .
It 's not an accident ...
Never underestimate your opponent ...
Their fucking machine works twenty - four hours a day , man . "
LEWIS THE BLACK PANTHER ADVOCATE - LEWIS THE BASKETBALL SCOUT
" I first met Al Lewis in person in New Haven in 1971 , at a demonstration in support of the jailed Black Panthers , " remembered Green Party member Mitchel Cohen .
" [ It was ] at the Free Bobby Seale and Erica Huggins protests .
Bobby and Erica , leaders of the Black Panther Party , were on trial for their lives and twenty thousand demonstrators waged a ... rally and , at night , pitched battle against the police and the unsheathed bayonets of the National Guard .
I was twenty - one ...
We were writing up our three national demands when I saw Al in the doorway ...
He was n't a speaker there , just one of the crowd .
Al winked as he walked past .
[ I saw ]
Al at many ... Black Panther support demos .
Free Mumia Abu - Jamal demos .
Anti-war marches .
Always just one of us peons .
Just there .
Putting his body where his mouth was . "
The fight for racial equality was one of Lewis ' champion causes .
" We had meetings in our house , " says Al 's son , David .
" People would come by : Stokely Carmichael , Dick Gregory , Ron Kovic .
"
Dave 's sibling concurred .
" I remember being on a march [ at ] Griffith Park .
A Black Panther Rally [ with ] some police involvement and ... having to get out of there rather quickly .
Running . "
Randy Credico recalls another event .
" I remember I was up in Harlem and Al spoke up there .
[ Al ] Sharpton [ was ] there , not sure who he was working for - Giuliani or the other side - but keeping everyone at bay ( in Al Sharpton voice ) ' Do n't worry about it , I 'll keep everyone under control .
This is a bad thing .
This is a horrible thing but keep it cool , keep it cool . '
And Al Lewis would get up there [ and say ] , ' We need to have armed militias !
The black community should have armed militias ! "
Lewis crowed about his capacity as a basketball scout , another layer to the Lewis mystique few people knew about .
" I do n't recruit .
I bird - dog .
You can call Marty Blake , the chief scout for the NBA , he lives outside Atlanta , and ask him who is the most knowledgeable man of roundball you have ever met .
Without hesitation he will tell you Al Lewis . "
WFMU called Marty Blake .
The eighty - three year old is credited with discovering Karl Malone , Scottie Pippin and a gaggle of other basketball notables .
Asked about Al Lewis , Blake remarks ( without hesitation ) , " Al Lewis ?
The self - proclaimed best scout in basketball ! "
Blake started as a coach at the famous Tamiment Catskill resort in the early forties .
That 's where he would rub shoulders with aspiring showbiz names like Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca .
Surrounded by tummlers and kibitzers , it 's no wonder Marty eventually found an affinity for a ham like Lewis .
" I met him a couple of times .
I did n't have much of a chance to say much .
It 's funny .
He knew everything there was to know about basketball from the tips of your toes to the top of your head .
I do n't know if he did it for a living at one time , but I certainly would have hired him ...
One time I heard him say , ' Marty says I 'm the best darn judge of talent in basketball . '
We had never met ! "
Blake met Lewis years later in East Rutherford , New Jersey at the 1996 NCAA tournament .
By that point Lewis had been observing basketball for decades .
" I have bird - dogged high - school basketball since 1934 , " said Grandpa .
" I have seen more high - school games than [ basketball coaches ] Dean Smith and Lou Carnesecca combined ... I first started for Honey Russell , one of the original Celtics , then coach of Seton Hall .
Today I have fifty to sixty ' division one ' coaches call me .
I know what they need .
I tell them I do n't recruit . "
He told the Chicago Sun Times that he'd been scouting since the mid-thirties , which means he started around the age of eleven .
" I love the challenge of trying to predict what a kid can be three years down the road .
I 'm a genius at that ...
When I go to a game , I rarely sit ... high school [ basketball ] they allow you to stand underneath the basket .
And then I look at the guy in the eye .
I can tell you about his desire ...
That 's what I look for - the guy who plays hungry , with passion and pride ...
Professional basketball is not basketball .
It 's entertainment .
They break every rule in [ NBA ] basketball .
They travel on 70 percent of the shots . "
He preferred to watch amateur ball , but he did n't hold the NBA in contempt .
He could often be seen enjoying the New York Knicks .
" He called me up and he said , ' Listen , I 'm going to the Knicks game tonight ... got courtside tickets , " remembers Green Party activist John McDonagh .
" So we go there ... and we 're walking through [ Madison Square ] Garden and you [ forget ] what a pop icon he is .
The whole Garden starts cheering , ' Grandpa ! Grandpa ! '
I 'm sitting there , you got Spike Lee , you got all these people sitting around [ us ] ... everyone 's running to [ Lewis ] .
Grandpa gets up and he says , ' I 'm gonna go over and talk to The Knicks . '
I said , ' Grandpa , [ they 've ] got all this security here . '
He said , ' Fuck the security ! '
So he walks across the thing , nobody stops him and normally guys are being tackled .
He 's shaking their hands and some of the Knicks are saying , ' Yeah , I listened to [ your WBAI radio show ] on Saturday . '
It was mind boggling . "
Lewis had plenty of time to watch basketball once The Munsters came to an end .
He had a variety of acting roles but , like Fred Gwynne , was often ignored due to his association with the sitcom .
Grandpa 's notable film roles throughout the period included They Shoot Horses Don't They ?
( 1969 ) , The Boatniks ( 1970 ) , They Might Be Giants ( 1971 ) and Death Wish ( 1974 ) .
Television guest shots on Lost in Space , Gomer Pyle , Green Acres , Night Gallery and Taxi balanced his time .
Without a regular series , however , Al 's finances dwindled .
By the mid-seventies he started working , his brother confirms , as a mortgage broker .
Dejected , he reluctantly put on a vampire 's cape and started doing personal appearances .
He decided that , financially , he had no option but to embrace typecasting .
Slowly he started to relish in the enthusiasm of the still fervent Munsters fan base .
Stephen Cox was an overzealous fanboy at the time .
" Al Lewis was actually listed in the phone book ...
One of my dreams came true when [ as a pre-teen ] I got Grandpa on the telephone .
My mouth turned dry , I could n't believe it .
I remember Al being patient with this inquisitive little fan , answering my inane questions . "
Making peace with the Grandpa role , he soon exploited it every chance he got .
He plastered his name on a pair of comedy clubs and a restaurant .
Al Lewis ran Grampa 's Bella Gente3 from 1987 through 1993 at 252 Bleecker Street .
It served Italian food and spun off a line of Grandpa brand pastas for the grocery world .
The cover of the menu featured a caricature of Grandpa Munster drawn by Fred Gwynne .
Lewis also opened a Staten Island comedy club in September 1989 called , of course , Grandpa's .
The man Lewis hired to manage also owned a pork plant .
A stand - up comedian named Bobby Collins remembers an attempt to pay him off in meat .
" I said , ' Excuse me ? '
He said , ' I own a pork company . '
I said , ' No . I like cash . "
Lewis helped run another short - lived comedy club in Yonkers called Shooting Stars , where he would MC on Friday and Saturday nights .
Once the restaurant shut down and the nineteen eighties comedy club boom collapsed , Lewis devoted his life to politics , personal appearances and his own weekly radio show .
LEWIS THE RADIO HOST - LEWIS THE POLITICIAN
Al Lewis held court every Saturday at noon on WBAI , covering current events .
The call - in show gave Grandpa a platform to take on New York 's mayor and governor , two men he despised .
" Four more years of Benito Giuliani ... He 'll win big .
No question .
We 'll get four more years of this shit and it'll get worse ...
H.L. Mencken said , ' Looking for an honest politician is like looking for an ethical burglar . '
I understand politics better than the politicians ; I know them for what they are .
He 's a lame - duck mayor .
Where does he go from here ?
He and George Potato Head Pataki are jockeying to see who can be the running mate of Scrub Bush ...
That family of thieves ! "
Amy Goodman of WBAI - based Democracy Now loved being around Al Lewis .
" Sometimes I would go to WBAI on Saturdays when Al did his show .
You could n't go to his show without him taking everyone out for lunch afterward .
Not to have a conversation - but [ so that he could ] lecture us ... it was worth every minute . "
If he were alive today , Lewis would be a vocal advocate for health care reform .
During a 1998 radio broadcast he yelled in his trademark shout , " We 're the only industrialized country that does n't have universal medical care !
But I got news for you !
You know who does ?
Every senator !
Every congressman !
Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki !
And you know who 's paying for this ?
Me and you !
And they get the best .
John Hopkins ... free .
But they vote against us getting it .
This is crazy . "
Randy Credico spoke at a wake for Grandpa shortly after his death .
He performed a hilarious vocal impression of Lewis for an appreciative group of onlookers .
" I was born 95 years ago !
Yeah !
Yeah !
Yeah !
THINK I'M LYING !?
Get over here , ya piece of crap !'
That was his favorite catch phrase ... [ He would say of ] people that he hated like Giuliani , ' He 's a vicious piece of crap ! '
He understood racism in this country .
I think his number one cause was racism , domestically .
He was against the US government .
A student of history ...
Al would say , ' John Brown was the only religious man in this country .
John Brown !
That 's it !
Shut up !
Shut up !
You 're wrong !
John Brown ! Giuliani ! Ghouliani ! Mussolini !
Piece of shit !! "
Having become a well - known political voice thanks to WBAI , Lewis was enlisted by The Green Party to run for Governor of New York .
They felt that Al 's bombastic politics and explosive , well - known personality would be the right combination to represent the party .
" He was running for governor , he campaigned around the state , " remembered John McDonagh .
" Grandpa Al is in Buffalo and he 's giving a press conference , ' Unemployment in western New York is unbelievable .
If elected I 'm going to bring factories here ... any questions from the press ? '
First guy raises his hand .
' Grandpa Al Lewis .
I want you to comment on what 's going on down in Washington between Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton . '
He looks around .
' I do n't fucking believe this .
I come all this way and you 're asking me about a blowjob in Washington ?
That 's it .
Press conference over . "
During a protest march in which Lewis was speaking out against a Governor Pataki initiative that would have made it difficult for prisoners to receive parole , a regional newsman asked Lewis , " What do you say to the woman that 's being raped ... " before being cut off .
" No , what do you say ?
You know what I say ?
Call the police ! " screamed Lewis .
He ripped into the reporter .
" Do n't set me up !
I 'm not a straw man , fool ! "
" But you came here [ to the protest ] . "
" But I 'm not a fool !
I did n't fall off a turnip truck and I did n't come here on a green banana boat .
You may have , but I did n't .
You ai n't gonna paint me into no corner .
What do I say to a woman that 's being raped ?
Call the police or kick the rapist in the balls !
What the hell kind of a question is that ... what 's the matter with you ?
What the hell kind of a reporter are you ? "
Lewis fought in court to have his name appear on the ballot as " Grandpa Al Lewis . "
The motion was denied , a judge ruling that it would open the door for candidates to use fake names .
The Munsters child star , Butch Patrick , endorsed Al 's candidacy .
He rattled off three reasons why people should vote for Lewis .
" Al 's healthy , he 's educated and he 's Jewish ! "
The Chicago Tribune quoted Matthew Hiltzik from the Democratic Party who said , " The real issue is n't Grandpa Al Lewis , but rather Senator Al D'Amato .
While Al Lewis helps draw attention to many failures of the Patocki / D'Amato [ sic ] administration , we feel the Democratic nominee will be the most effective in addressing statewide issues . "
On the Republican side , spokesperson Terry O'Brian told the paper " He 's the product of a minor party trying to get on the ballot - and we 're sort of ignoring him . "
In the end , Al Lewis garnered a total of fifty - two thousand votes .
Shortly before the results were tabulated , George Pataki reportedly said , " Grandpa Munster worries me . "
During the campaign , no news outlet could confirm Grandpa 's actual age .
" People lie about their age and make themselves younger , " said Amy Goodman .
" He made himself thirteen years older .
I 'm still trying to figure that out .
I was at his ninetieth birthday party ... five years ago . "
At one point Lewis was called out for fudging his age on a voter registration form .
He had written his actual age on the legal document : seventy - five .
Elsewhere he stated he was eighty - eight .
Confronted about the discrepancy Lewis admitted there was a slight of pen , but qualified it by saying he had to write a younger age in order to " counter the rampant age discrimination in the entertainment business . "
Meanwhile , WBAI was stuck in a mire of political turmoil .
A convoluted series of internal conflicts climaxed with a locking out of all staff .
Amy Goodman remembers the period being especially difficult for Al Lewis .
" The hardest thing for him about the Pacifica troubles , when we were all pushed out , was that his mail was locked inside of WBAI .
That was mail from prisoners .
He always talked about how he answered every letter and he just could not abide that he could not get those letters to answer . "
Randy Credico knew more than anyone about Grandpa 's prison activism .
" I went to a lot of prisons with Al ... we went to Greenhaven , we went to Bedford Hills ... we got thrown out of [ Bedford ] because he 'd always [ say of ] the commissioner of corrections , Glen Gordon , " He 's a piece of shit .
You 're a piece of shit !
I know your type ! "
Amy remembers fondly , " For years he would call me after almost every Democracy Now ... to yell at me .
Did I read the latest editor and publisher ?
How could I call myself informed on any subject that I was covering if I had n't read this or talked to this person ...
At the end he would say , ' Love ya , ' and slam the phone down . "
MOBSTERS , PORN STARS AND SHOCK JOCKS
Nineteen fifties Broadway introduced Lewis to his fair share of Damon Runyon type characters .
Nat Hiken and his sitcoms showed an affinity for boxers , wrestlers , gamblers and assorted mugs .
Lewis would never lose his affection for misfits .
He befriended the notorious John Gotti , going so far as to act as a character witness when the mob boss was on trial .
" I come from Queens , very Italian neighborhood , " says John McDonagh .
" So , John Gotti died [ and Al Lewis ] told me , when he had the restaurant on Bleecker Street , [ Gotti ] used to order food from him .
So Al would bring it over and he got to meet John Gotti ...
Al went to the trial ...
He was there .
So John Gotti dies in jail and Al calls me , ' Listen , you gotta come pick me up .
We 're going to go to the funeral . '
I said , ' Al , no .
I 've been talking to guys in [ my Queens neighborhood ] .
The FBI are everywhere .
Photographing everyone , taking all the license plates ...
How 's it gonna look [ if I am ] going to the Gotti wake ? '
I 'm in enough trouble ...
So , Al goes there and I 'm waiting for the eleven o'clock news ... because I know Al is making the eleven o'clock news .
So , Al gets out of the cab and a reporter runs up to him .
' Grandpa Al Lewis .
Why are you here ?
Did you know that John Gotti is responsible for ten murders ? '
' Is that right ?
You seem to have a lot of information about John Gotti and who he murdered .
The FBI are right over there , I suggest you go over there and tell them about the murders . "
Grandpa loved colorful characters - the more nefarious the better .
Al Lewis appeared with smut icon Ron Jeremy in the picture South Beach Academy ( 1996 ) and participated in a ridiculous Ron Jeremy music video .
Lewis occasionally claimed to be Ron Jeremy 's uncle , at other times he was simply a friend .
Just as Grandpa made money visiting various nostalgia conventions , Jeremy subsidized his pornography with personal appearances .
One of his new ventures was " Ron Jeremy : Stand - up Comedian . "
Lewis hated it .
" That 's the worst act in show business ! " he condemned .
" He has no presentation !
He has no material !
He has no timing !
Forget it ! "
Grandpa opened up about his sex life on Al Goldstein 's trashy cable access program Midnight Blue .
" I first got laid in Dayton , Ohio , " Lewis told him .
" I think they put up a [ monument ] .
I coined the phrase CF .
A celebrity fucker .
Somebody became enamored over [ me as an ] actor . "
Lewis became a regular on Howard Stern 's radio show and pay - per - view specials .
In the fine tradition of a man who was adored by the NYPD and The Black Panthers , Grandpa was presumably the only man in the world that was a regular on Howard Stern and WBAI .
Clearly , he had wide appeal .
The Howard Stern Show granted Grandpa the opportunity to act even more outrageous than normal .
He appeared on Stern to promote " a gig at a nudist colony just outside of Chicago . "
While talking about Ron Jeremy , Stern asked Lewis whether he would ever participate in a pornographic film himself .
Grandpa replied , " If the price was right . "
When Howard Stern was stuck in an early nineties battle with the Federal Communications Commission , he held a large public rally outside the station .
" Grandpa Al Lewis comes out to our radio studio , " remembers Stern .
" We 're in front of about five thousand people .
Grandpa gets on stage to support us because the FCC was hassling us ...
So , Grandpa misses the fact we 're [ live ] on the radio . "
Footage of the rally shows Al Lewis taking to the microphone .
" First of all , I am so happy that we are all here together .
I mean , that is beautiful .
And we all know why we 're here ... we 're here because we all have a purpose , " said Grandpa calmly .
" And that purpose is to say fuck the FCC !
Fuck 'em !
Fuck 'em !
Fuck 'em ! "
Howard Stern was stunned .
" I really thought [ he 'd ] lost his mind , " says Howard .
" I figured , in my mind , as far as I was concerned , my career was over because we 're on the radio live .
The FCC was really on my ass and [ he ] had to yell the F - word on live radio . "
A variety of health issues brought about a complicated surgery and Grandpa Munster 's eventual death in 2006 .
One of his final performances was a 2003 fundraiser for Democracy Now .
He delivered an impassioned political speech .
Hammering his fist on the podium , he emphatically delivered a controversial screed to a large crowd .
" I may offend some people but Mrs. Lewis ' son does n't care !
Does n't care !
What happened on September 11th was inevitable .
Inevitable !
Inevitable !
It was horrific .
Approximately five thousand lives were lost .
Do n't get angry with me .
Just listen to the message .
Were those lives more valuable than those school children who died of shrapnel in an action that was directed , promoted and paid for by the US government ?
Were the lives on September 11th more valuable than the ... hundred thousand people who were killed in Guatemala ?
In Nicaragua ?
You want me to go down the list in killing ?
Was that horrific ?
Was that terror ?
And you want to talk about terror ?
Again , I do n't care if you are angry .
As we can now see , from the Freedom of Information acts - the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was an act of terror !
There was no military objective involved ...
One other thing .
September 11th happened .
The initial [ phrases ] , ' Let 's bomb them into the stone age . '
' Let 's wipe them out . '
' Let 's kill them . '
Americans suffer from short or long term memory [ loss ] ... Baruch Goldstein .
You know who he was ?
He was an Israeli captain who went in on a Friday in the mosque and machine gunned them with an automatic rifle and killed them .
Did any of you ... raise the human cry , ' Let 's bomb them into the stone age ? '
Were their lives less valuable than those at the World Trade Center ... if you go now - NOW - to Israel there is a memorial to Baruch Goldstein !
I want to ask you something .
There were nineteen people involved in [ the September 11th attacks ] ... that airplane was a bomb because of the high - octane gasoline .
It was a flying bomb .
Those nineteen men .
What would Americans do if some place in the Middle East they erected a monument to them ?
Who says that our lives are more valuable than his or hers ?
Where is it written ?
Where ?
Where is it written ? "

" Wenn man im Paradies lebt , will man ja nicht so schnell weg " Mathias Bröckers
Ein Gespräch mit Dr. Albert Hofmann , dem Entdecker des LSD , der heute 100 Jahre alt wird
" Ici Rittimatte , 629 m. " steht auf dem Schild neben einem Grenzstein aus der napoleonischen Zeit .
Die Grenze zu Frankreich verläuft direkt über diese Bergwiese in den Ausläufern des Schweizer Juras .
Hier steht das " Bänkli " mit weiter Aussicht über das Baseler Land und den Konturen der Vogesen und Schwarzwalds am Horizont , der Lieblingsplatz eines Mannes , der - sowohl was die Ausblicke , als auch was die Grenzen des Bewusstseins betrifft - Geschichte gemacht hat : Dr. Dr hc. mult .
Albert Hofmann , der Entdecker des LSD .
Heute wird Albert Hofmann 100 Jahre alt .
Doch auch wenn er seit einer Hüftoperation vor drei Jahren mit Stöcken gehen muss , lässt er es sich an diesem strahlenden Augusttag nicht nehmen , mit uns die 500 Meter von seinem
Haus hinauf zum " Bänkli " zu spazieren .
Albert Hofmann und Timothy Leary in Hamburg , 1993
Mit seinem Verleger und Freund Roger Liggenstorfer und zwei Dokumentarfilmern war ich am Morgen gekommen , um ein Gespräch zu führen - und auch jetzt , am Nachmittag und nach einigen Stunden Interview , zeigt unser Gastgeber keine Spur von Erschöpfung .
" Jetzt versteht ihr , warum ich diesen Platz hier als mein Paradies bezeichne " , sagt er , als wir auf der Bank sitzen und von der Weite des Himmels und der traumhaften Sommerlandschaft gebannt sind .
" Eigentlich ist die Rittmatte hier meine allergrößte Entdeckung . "
Nach seiner Pensionierung als Leiter der Naturstoffabteilung der " Sandoz AG " 1971 entdeckte er diesen Platz und baute sich mit seiner Frau Anita dort das Haus , in dem sie jetzt seit 35 Jahren leben .
Doch die Entdeckung , die ihn weltberühmt machte , fand am 18 .
April 1943 statt , als Albert Hofmann eigentlich auf der Suche nach einem Kreislaufmittel war .
In einer Frühstückspause bei einem Honigbrot und einem Glas Milch fiel ihm die Lysergsäure wieder ein , die er 1938 als Wirkstoff des Pilzes " Claviceps purpurea " identifiziert und in verschiedenen Verbindungen hergestellt hatte .
Der vor allem auf Getreide schmarotzende Pilz wird " Mutterkorn " genannt und wurde schon seit dem Altertum als blutstillendes , die Gebärmutter kontrahierendes Naturmittel in der Geburtshilfe eingesetzt .
Albert Hofmann und seine Kollegen hatten aus seinen Wirkstoffen das bis heute in allen Kreißsälen verwendete Standardpräparat " Methergin " gewonnen .
Sieben Jahre später , fasste Hofmann in einer " merkwürdigen Vorahnung " den Entschluss , eine dieser Verbindungen , das Lsyergsäure - Diäthylamid , noch einmal herzustellen .
Während der Arbeit spürte er mit einem
Mal ein merkwürdiges Unwohlsein und notierte in einem Protokoll :
... Ich musste mitten am Nachmittag meine Arbeit im Laboratorium unterbrechen und mich nach Hause begeben , da ich von einer merkwürdigen Unruhe , verbunden mit einem leichten Schwindelgefühl , befallen wurde .
Zu
Hause legte ich mich nieder und versank in einen nicht unangenehmen rauschartigen Zustand , der sich durch eine äußert rege Phantasie kennzeichnete .
Im Dämmerzustand bei geschlossenen Augen - das Tageslicht empfand ich als unangenehm grell - wirkten dagegen ununterbrochen phantastische Bilder von außerordentlicher Plastizität und mit intensivem , kaleidoskopartigem Farbenspiel auf mich ein .
Nach zwei Stunden verflüchtigte sich der Zustand .
Albert Hofmann
Als erfahrener Chemiker , der unter Laborbedingungen und stets kontrolliert arbeitete , konnte sich Hofmann anfangs kaum vorstellen , dass sein Zustand etwas mit den Substanzen zu tun haben könnte , mit denen er an diesem Tag gearbeitet hatte .
Er ging alle seine Arbeitsschritte dieses Morgens noch einmal durch und hatte zunächst ein chloroform - ähnliches Lösungsmittel in Verdacht .
An das LSD dachte er als Allerletztes , weil es ja schon fünf Jahre zuvor pharmakologisch untersucht worden war und er es an diesem Morgen nur kristallisiert hatte .
Heute sagt Albert Hofmann , dass er das LSD nicht entdeckt hat , sondern dass es zu ihm gekommen sei :
Das Lysergsäure - Diäthylamid hatte ich ja nur umkristallisiert und nichts davon eingenommen und du arbeitest doch absolut sauber , dachte ich mir .
Wenn es das gewesen sein sollte , müsste es ja geradezu saumäßig wirksam sein .
Als ich am Montag wieder im Labor war , nahm ich dann die kleinste Menge davon ein , die man sich überhaupt denken kann - und das war , wie sich später herausstellte , noch fünfmal zu viel und brachte mich dann auf einen Horrortrip .
Aber dieses erste Mal , mit diesen Träumen , dazu kann ich nur sagen : das LSD hat mich gerufen , ich habe es nicht gesucht .
Es ist zu mir gekommen , es hat sich gemeldet ...
Wenn sich das LSD nicht von sich aus gemeldet hätte , wäre die Substanz wieder in die Pharmakologie gekommen und die hätte wieder nichts gefunden , und damit fertig , Schluss ...
Aber es hat mich erwischt , irgendwie , es hat sich mir offenbart ...
Was Hofmann an diesem Apriltag des Jahres 1943 widerfuhr - die tiefenpsychologische Kraft pflanzlicher Alkaloide , die Pharmakologie der Bewusstseinsveränderung - , war erst wenige Jahre zuvor überhaupt in das Blickfeld der Wissenschaft geraten .
Der Berliner Pharmakologe Louis Lewin hatte mit seiner Untersuchung über " Phantastica " die ersten Forschungsberichte über die Wirkung halluzinogener Pflanzen vorgelegt .
In Heidelberg hatte Kurt Beringer Ende der 20er Jahre das Meskalin untersucht , den Wirkstoff des Peyote - Kaktus , der von den Indianern Südamerikas sakrale Droge verehrt wird .
Vor seinem Haus auf der Rittimatte , 1989
Mit der Entdeckung des LSD trat die Erforschung dieser Substanzen in eine neue Dimension .
Nicht nur , weil schon die Menge eines Staubkorns - 50 Mikrogram - eine wirksame Dosierung darstellte , sondern vor allem , weil diese Wirkung nicht nur medizinisch - therapeutisch , sondern auch für die wissenschaftliche Erforschung des Bewusstseins äußerst vielversprechend schien .
Von der Wunderdroge zum Sorgenkind
Die " Sandoz AG " begann mit der Erprobungsphase des neuen Medikaments .
Wie jedes Arzneimittel wurde auch " Delysid " , so der Markenname , zahlreichen Prüfungen und Tests unterzogen , man stellte es Wissenschaftlern und Ärzten zur Verfügung , die damit neue Behandlungsansätze in der Psychotherapie und Psychiatrie erprobten .
Es entstanden zahlreiche Studien , die äußerst vielversprechende Resultate zeigten - etwa bei Alkoholikern , die von ihrer Sucht loskamen , bei unheilbar Schwerkranken , deren psychischer Gesamtzustand sich stabilisierte , bei autistischen Patienten , die durch die LSD ansprechbar und therapierbar wurden .
Der tschechische Psychiater Stanislav
Grof bezeichnete LSD in diesem Zusammenhang als " Mikroskop und Teleskop der Psychiatrie " , da es verdrängte , sonst kaum zugängliche Seelenanteile , ans Licht brächte .
In den ersten zwei Jahrzehnten nach seiner Entdeckung erschienen über 1.000 Fachartikel , die solche ermutigenden Ergebnisse bei insgesamt über 40.000 Patienten beschrieben ( sehr viele Studien wurden von Erowid eingescannt und sind online abrufbar ) .
Mit dem DJ Goa Gill bei einer Techno - Party im Baseler Land , 2002
Da die Versuche stets in einem kontrollierten Setting stattfanden und die Klienten vorab in Kenntnis gesetzt worden waren , dass LSD außergewöhnliche Bewusstseinszustände auslöst , kam es bei diesen Anwendungen kaum zu negativen Auswirkungen .
LSD galt so für viele Wissenschaftler und Therapeuten bis Anfang der 60er Jahre als eine Art Wundermittel .
Namentlich Timothy Leary , Psychologie - Dozent der renommierten Harvard University , gab dann aber die Distanz zu seinem Forschungsobjekt auf und wurde völlig euphorisiert zu einer Art Missionar des LSD - Gebrauchs .
Wegen der Propagierung von LSD bei Jugendlichen sind Leary später von Albert Hofmann schwere Vorwürfe gemacht worden .
Das Verbot des LSD folgte bald .
Seit Mitte der 60er
Jahre zählt es zu den illegalen Betäubungsmitteln ; Herstellung , Besitz und Gebrauch sind seitdem weltweit verboten .
Diesen
Weg von der Wunderdroge zum verbotenen Betäubungsmittel hat Hofmann in seinem Buch " LSD - Mein Sorgenkind " ausführlich beschrieben - und wie kaum ein anderer vor dem unsachgemäßen Gebrauch der Substanz gewarnt .
" Wenn man im Paradies lebt , will man ja nicht so schnell weg ! "
Als wir uns für das Interview in seinem Wohnzimmer zusammensetzen , weist er darauf hin , dass er über all das , was er in seinen Büchern schon beschrieben hat , eigentlich nicht mehr reden will : " Das hab ich dort alles besser und ausführlicher gesagt , das müssen wir nicht mehr wiederholen . "
Okay , uns interessiert ja auch am Meisten , wie man es schafft , als 100 - Jähriger noch so erstaunlich vital und geistig rege zu bleiben .
Welche Methoden hat Albert Hofmann dafür angewendet ?
Albert Hofmann : Das hat sich so ergeben .
Das kann man nicht planen .
Ich hatte irgendwie immer wieder das Glück , Positives zu erleben .
Wenn etwas Negatives kam - dann kam , sozusagen wie vom Himmel ... wieder etwas Positives .
So hat sich das immer wieder ausgeglichen .
Ich glaube , dass ich die Gnade hatte , offene Sinne zu behalten - und unser Bewusstsein wird ja von den Sinnen genährt .
Ich habe bis heute keine Brille und keine Hörgeräte ... und ich habe wirklich das Gefühl , dass ich auf die Natur höre , auf das , was uns gegeben ist .
Deshalb bin ich auch so skeptisch gegenüber dieser technischen Kultur - weil : wir verpassen ja das Paradies !
Wir vermauern und verbrettern unsere Sinne mit dieser Technisierung .
Und ich bin noch zu Hause in der Natur , nicht in der technischen Welt .
Ich glaube , das ist einer der entscheidenden Fehler unserer heutigen
Welt :
Wir kommen immer mehr ab von dem , was da ist , von diesem großen Geschenk , wir nehmen es nicht einmal mehr wahr - und rackern uns ab mit technischen Problemen .
Wenn ich in der Stadt hätte leben müssen , wäre ich mit Sicherheit schon lange gestorben , schon lange tot .
Ich habe das Glück , dass ich hier auf der Rittimatte im Paradies lebe - und wenn man im Paradies lebt , will man ja nicht so schnell weg .
Hat auch das LSD dabei eine Rolle gespielt , dass Sie so lange geistig wach und jung geblieben sind ?
Albert Hofmann : Ich müsste zwei Leben haben , um das zu beantworten : eines mit und eines ohne LSD .
Dann könnte man das wissenschaftlich beurteilen .
So kann ich das ja nicht .
In meinem LSD - Buch ( " LSD - Mein Sorgenkind " ) steht ja am Anfang dieses mystische Naturerlebnis als Kind , das ja absolut einem LSD - Erlebnis glich , dieses Einssein mit der Natur .
Irgendwie , glaube ich , war mir das angeboren .
Sie waren 1943 Offizier in der Schweizer Armee und mussten neben der Arbeit im Labor monatlich zum Dienst bei der Grenzsicherung ...
Albert Hofmann : Ja , immer für drei Monate war ich weg , im Tessin , die Südgrenze bewachen , gegen Mussolini ....
...um zwischendurch auf dem Höhepunkt des Weltkriegs die Substanz zu entdecken , die als " geistige Atombombe " bezeichnet worden ist .
Würden
Sie die alte Hippie - Parole unterschreiben , dass dann , wenn alle Generäle einen erfolgreichen LSD - Trip unternehmen würden , mehr oder weniger automatisch der Weltfrieden eintritt ?
Albert Hofmann : Das kann ich auch nicht beantworten .
Man müsste es wissenschaftlich untersuchen .
Aber ich denke , es wäre einen Versuch wert .
In diesem Zusammenhang fällt mir eine Geschichte ein : Irgendwann kam einmal eine junge Frau in mein Laboratorium .
Ich fragte sie , wie sie hier in die Fabrik überhaupt hineingekommen sei , und sie antwortete in Englisch : " I can pass everywhere , I am an angel . "
Und sie sagte : " Sie müssen mir helfen , dass der amerikanische Präsident LSD bekommt . "
Sie hieß Johanna , wie die Heilige Johanna der Franzosen .
Ich wunderte mich immer noch , wie sie überhaupt in das Sandoz - Gebäude hineingekommen war .
Aber ich konnte ihr natürlich nichts geben . "
Die Tore der Wahrnehmung werden geöffnet und wir sehen plötzlich mehr von der Wahrheit
Sie haben das Bewusstsein in einem Sender - Empfänger - Modell beschrieben : der ganze Planet als Sender und jedes einzelne Bewusstsein als Empfänger ...
Albert Hofmann : Unsere Sinne sind die Antennen , darüber kommt alles herein , das Bewusstsein ist der Empfänger .
Alles was wir im Bewusstsein haben , ist irgendwann einmal durch die Sinne hineingekommen - bei Geburt ist es gleichsam ein leeres Bewusstsein und wird dann durch all das gefüllt .
Und ein paar Millionstel Gramm LSD verändern die Wahrnehmung dramatisch - es ist nicht nur einfach das bekannte Bild , ein bisschen verzerrter oder bunter , es ist ein völlig anderes Programm ...
Albert Hofmann :
Und das deshalb , weil LSD unsere Sinne verändert , man sieht besser , man hört besser , alles wird intensiviert .
Insofern hatte auch Timothy Leary recht , wenn er behauptet , es sei auch das größte Aphrodisiakum .
Der Mechanismus des LSD ist ganz einfach : Die Tore der Wahrnehmung werden geöffnet und wir sehen plötzlich mehr - von der Wahrheit ...
Und das ist manchmal sehr verwirrend ...
Albert Hofmann : Ja , man erschrickt .
Man hat ein völlig anderes Bild und das kann einen furchtbar erschrecken .
Deshalb sagen die Indianer ja : bevor ich den heiligen
Pilz nehme , muss ich fasten , muss ich beten , muss ich rein sein - dann bringt mich der Pilz dem Göttlichen näher .
Und wenn ich das nicht mache , tötet er mich oder macht mich wahnsinnig .
Das haben die Indianer , lange bevor LSD und Psylocibin entdeckt wurden , gesagt - und die amerikanische Jugendbewegung , die es ja gut meinte , hat sich daran nicht gehalten , sie haben es zu oberflächlich genommen , sie haben sich nicht vorbereitet ...
Albert Hofmann mit dem LSD - Molekül , ca. 1950
Dieses alte Wissen wurde anfangs nicht vermittelt , die meisten , die LSD nahmen , wussten nicht , was es ist , und kamen erst mit der Zeit dazu , damit richtig umzugehen ...
Albert Hofmann : Das ging alles zu schnell .
Es hätte sich entwickeln müssen , die Erkenntnis , dass es etwas Sakrales ist , das heißt , die Wiederentdeckung , denn eigentlich ist es schon seit mindestens 3.000 Jahren bekannt , dass es etwas Besonders ist .
So wie der " heilige Trank " im antiken Eleusis , den Sie und Gordon Wasson in dem Buch " Der Weg nach Eleusis " als LSD - ähnliche Substanz identifiziert haben .
Auch Tim Leary und seine Kollegen in Harvard , Ralph Metzner und Richard Alpert , haben ja immer auf die Wichtigkeit von " Set & Setting " hingewiesen und das alte Ritualwissen gewissermaßen in die Neuzeit transportiert - aber Leary hat LSD gleichzeitig auch , typisch amerikanisch , angepriesen wie ein Wanderprediger oder Handelsvertreter ...
Albert Hofmann :
Er hat es ja jedem geradezu aufgedrängt .
Das habe ich nie getan .
Dennoch bin ich überzeugt , dass die Menschheit lernen wird , damit umzugehen in Zukunft .
Und wenn man überlegt , wie so ein modernes Eleusis aussehen könnte , dann wäre das zuerst ein Ort , eine schöne natürliche Umgebung , in der man Meditationsferien macht , wo man fastet , ruht und betet ... sich vorbereitet .
Und wo dann solche Substanzen ihrem Sinn entsprechend angewendet werden .
Der Priester von Eleusis wusste , weil jeder einen Vorbereitungskurs machen musste , die richtige Dosierung für jeden einzelnen - und wir wissen ja heute eigentlich auch alles , um dafür zu sorgen , dass es nie einen schlechten Trip gibt ...
Naturwissenschaft und Mystik
Als wissenschaftlicher Pionier im " Weltraum der Seele " kam Albert Hofmann mit vielen Künstlern und Kreativen in Kontakt .
Mit dem Schriftsteller Ernst Jünger verband ihn eine über 50 - jährige Freundschaft , Jünger hat ihre gemeisamen LSD - Experimente in seinem Buch " Annäherungen - Drogen und Rausch " beschrieben .
Auch Aldous Huxley korrespondierte mit Hofmann und besuchte ihn in der Schweiz ; er ließ sich vor seinem Tod , zum Übergang in einen anderen Bewusstseinszustand , von seiner Frau LSD geben .
Huxley benutzte es .
Wie steht Albert Hofmann zu dieser
Art von LSD - Verwendung als Sterbebegleitung ?
Albert Hofmann : LSD wurde schon vor Jahrzehnten in dieser Richtung verwendet , bei sterbenden Krebskranken , wo selbst Morphine nicht mehr gegen die Schmerzen wirkten ...
Ich bin überzeugt , dass das künftig auch ein Thema werden wird , dass man mit LSD diesen Übergang erleichtern kann .
Irgendwann hat jemand Ernst Jünger gefragt : " Glauben Sie , dass das Leben nach dem Tod weitergeht ? " und er antwortete : " Nein , ich weiß es ! "
Und das kann man auch als Naturwissenschaftler verstehen : Nichts kann aus Nichts entstehen , und aus etwas was ist , kann nicht Nichts werden - es gibt nur Umwandlungen .
Wir können nicht sagen , woher wir kommen - dass irgendeine Supermaterie am Anfang stand und dann knallte und den Raum erzeugte ... das ist doch alles dummer Mist .
Darüber wissen wir nichts , das ist das große Wunder .
Aus unseren Erfahrungen können wir nur sagen :
Es gibt Nichts , das aus Nichts entsteht , und Nichts , das zu Nichts zerfällt .
Es gibt immer nur den Wandel .
Und wenn man die Naturwissenschaft und alle ihre Entdeckungen weiter denkt , stößt man immer wieder auf ein Geheimnis .
Ich habe unlängst eine CD mit den Vorträgen Einsteins gehört .
Dort spricht er auch darüber , und er sagt wörtlich , ich habe mir den Satz gut gemerkt : " Das Schönste und Tiefste , was ein Mensch erfahren kann , ist das Gefühl des Geheimnisvollen . "
Wenn man in das Tiefste der materiellen Wirklichkeit vorstößt , wie Einstein es getan hat , stößt man unweigerlich auf das Wunder , auf das Geheimnisvolle .
Weiter kommen wir nicht .
Hier stoßen wir auf dasselbe Mysterium , das auch schon die Menschen in Eleusis erfahren haben .
Ein Interview , das Sie der " Basler Zeitung " letztes Jahr gegeben haben , war mit dem Zitat überschrieben " Unsere Zeit braucht LSD " ...
Albert Hofmann : Das war ein Nebensatz , den haben sie zum Titel gemacht .
Vor zehn Jahren noch wäre das völlig unmöglich gewesen .
Also wenn das kein Fortschritt ist , wenn selbst eine brave , brave bürgerliche Zeitung so titelt .
In den ersten zehn Jahren nach seiner Entdeckung galt LSD als wahres Wundermittel , dann kam das Verbot , die Dämonisierung - und jetzt scheint das Pendel wieder zurück zu gehen , zu größerer Akzeptanz .
Selbst an der Harvard - Universität finden wieder LSD - Studien statt .
Albert Hofmann : Ja , das habe ich verfolgt .
Es ist sicher ein Wandel .
Vor allem weil man entdeckt hat , dass diese Pflanzen , in denen man schon vor 3.000 Jahren Stoffe wie LSD oder Psilocybin gekannt und benutzt hat , mit den Substanzen in unserem Gehirn , wie Serotonin , sehr eng verwandt sind .
Die Pflanzen geben uns Nahrung , sie geben uns Heilmittel und sie geben uns auch Medikamente für das Bewusstsein .
Die Pflanze produziert aus dem Sonnenlicht unsere Nahrung und unsere Atemluft .
Und unser Bewusstsein ist letztlich nichts anderes als die höchste Umwandlung dieser Sonnenenergie .
Wir sind Sonnenkinder !
Unser menschliche Energie ist Sonnenenergie - entstanden aus dem Atomreaktor , den der Herrgott genügend weit weg gesetzt hat , dass er uns nicht gefährlich werden kann .
Nur das Gute kommt von der Sonne , der Ballast , der Atommüll bleibt oben - nur der Mensch , dieser Idiot , glaubt , er müsste die Sonne auf die Erde holen und hier Atomkraftwerke bauen .
Es ist Prometheus , der den Menschen sagt , dass sie die Sonne nicht brauchen und er ihnen das Feuer vom Himmel holt - und für diesen Übermut wird er von Zeus bestraft und muss unendliche Schmerzen erleiden , weil er den Schöpfer beleidigt hat .
In diesem Mythos ist schon alles erzählt - die Griechen waren ein geniales Volk .
Albert Hofmann , 2003
Jetzt ist die Menschheit dabei , sich mit diesem Geschenk des Prometheus selbst zu eliminieren , mit dem Feuer aus Öl und Kohle das Klima und die globalen Kreisläufe zu ruinieren und mit Atomkraft Leben auf Jahrtausende zu vernichten ...
Albert Hofmann :
Als ich in einem Buch einmal über den " Atomreaktor Sonne " geschrieben habe und die naheliegenden Dinge , die wir hier besprochen haben , erhielt ich eine Einladung von Atomphysikern , darüber einen Vortrag zu halten .
Die wussten das ja alles schon , aber sie hatten dieses ganz Einfache aus dem Blick verloren , sie konnten es nicht formulieren :
Dass doch alles schon da ist , dass die Pflanzen und die Natur alles bieten , was wir brauchen , die Sonne genügend Energie liefert und dass nur die Menschen saudumm sind ...
Ernst Jünger hat ja dafür plädiert , das LSD nur Auserwählten zugänglich sein soll ...
Albert Hofmann : Ja , er wollte das irgendwie nur für die Elite ...
Während Huxley und später Leary sich für die kontrollierte Anwendung für jedermann einsetzten ...
Albert Hofmann : Huxley wollte ja so etwas wie eine neue Religion erreichen .
Das hatte Jünger nie im Sinn .
Er wollte die Eliten erreichen , beziehungsweise meinte , die kämen schon von selbst dazu , das breitet sich aus in ihren Kreisen und das genügt .
Arthur Koestler , ein Freund von Huxley , hat sich einmal kritisch geäußert und LSD mit einem Skilift verglichen ...
Albert Hofmann : Ja , die Geschichte mit dem Bergsteiger , der zu Fuß zum Gipfel aufsteigt , der den Berg erobert und dem anderen , der einfach mit dem Lift hinauffährt .
Nach Koestlers
Ansicht muss man alle Qualen auf sich nehmen , um das richtige Gipfelerlebnis zu haben - aber Huxley erwiderte , dass die Aussicht dieselbe sei .
Wie sehen Sie das ?
Albert Hofmann : Man muss schon wandern .
Man muss sich innerlich vorbereiten - und das allein ist oft schon schwer genug .
Viele Leute wissen ja gar nicht , was Meditation ist .
Aber jetzt sollten wir mal ums
Haus wandern , in die herrliche Sonne draußen - und die Stille anhören .
Die Interview - Zitate Albert Hofmanns stammen aus einem längeren Gespräch , das Mathias Bröckers und Roger Liggenstorfer für ihr Buch " Albert Hofmann und die Entdeckung des LSD - Auf dem Weg nach Eleusis " ( AT - Verlag , 2006 ) führten .
Diesem Band sind auch alle hier verwendeten Fotos entnommen .
Aus Anlass des 100 .
Geburtstags findet vom 13 .- 15 .
Januar 2006 in Basel das Symposium LSD - Sorgenkind und Wunderdroge .
( Mathias Bröckers )
