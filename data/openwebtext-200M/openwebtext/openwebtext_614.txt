This mini web server is slightly smaller than a business card .
There are a lot of tiny one - board servers out there , but this is probably the smallest you can etch and solder at home .
Unlike many embedded web servers , files are stored on a PC - readable SD card , not in a difficult - to - write EEPROM .
Read on for the web server design , or catch up on PIC 24 F basics in the previous article :
Web server on a business card ( part 1 ) .
Concept overview
The goal of this project is to build a web server on a business card that serves web pages and files from a FAT formatted SD card .
The server is based on a PIC 24 F that connects to a TCP / IP network using the ENC28J60 ethernet MAC / PHY .
Network layers and low - level services , such as DNS and DHCP , are handled by the Microchip TCP / IP stack .
A FAT 12/16/32 formatted SD card contains web pages and files .
A very simple HTTP server ties everything together by handling page requests on port 80 , searching the SD card for requested , and serving them with the correct content type .
Hardware
Microcontroller ( Microchip PIC 24FJ64GA002 )
The brain of the server is a 16 - bit PIC 24FJ64GA002 ( IC1 ) , a 28 pin microcontroller available in several hobbyist friendly packages .
Check out our PIC 24 F introduction for more about working with this chip .
PIC 24Fs operate between 2 and 3.8volts , which is perfect because the ethernet chip ( IC2 ) and SD card both run at 3.3 volts .
This chip has 8 K of RAM , plenty for the TCP / IP stack and a few K for working with a full FAT file system .
The 24FJ64 has two SPI modules , so the SD card and ethernet IC each get a dedicated data bus .
The PIC processor core operates at 2.5volts , and requires a 10 uF capacitor ( C2 ) for the on-chip voltage regulator .
The datasheet specifies a tantalum capacitor , but we used a low - ESR electrolytic in a prototype without incident .
Every power pin needs a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor ( C4,5 ) .
The internal 8MHz oscillator provides a 32MHz clock source with the 4x PLL multiplier enabled .
We ’re also using an external 32.768KHz crystal ( Q1 ) with 2 x 27 pF capacitors ( C17,18 ) to enable the real time clock calendar .
Programming connections are brought to a header ( SV1 ) .
We chose to use programming pin pair three ( PGx3 ) .
The master clear and reset ( MCLR ) function is enabled with a 2 K resistor ( R1 ) from V+ to the MCLR pin .
Optionally , add a button ( S1 ) from MCLR to ground for a manual reset switch .
Ethernet connection ( ENC28J60 )
An ENC28J60 ( IC2 ) handles the network physical connection ( PHY ) and MAC layer .
The ENC28J60 needs a number of support parts beyond the typical 0.1 uF decoupling capacitors ( C6,7,9,10 ) .
A 25MHz crystal ( Q2 ) and 2 x 27pf capacitors ( C15,16 ) provide a clock signal .
The internal core voltage regulator requires a 10 uF tantalum capacitor ( C1 ) , but an electrolytic capacitor also worked fine .
Two LEDs ( LED1,2 ) with 330 ohm resistors ( R2,3 ) display link and data status .
A bias resistor ( R12 ) is required ; the value will depend on the ENC28J60 version you ’re using .
Current chips should be B5 ( PDF ) or B7 ( PDF ) , and require a 2.32 K 1 % resistor .
The PHY I/O portion specifies 4 x 49.9ohm 1 % resistors ( R8 - 11 ) , and a ferrite bead ( L1 ) .
The most difficult - to - find part for the ENC28J60 is the correct RJ - 45 jack with integrated magnetics ( RJ1 ) .
We used a J1006F21 PulseJack from Pulse Engineering .
Be sure to check the pin configuration and connections if you use a different jack , they will probably be different than ours .
A Cadsoft Eagle part library for the JP1006F21 is included in the project archive .
This was a $ 4 part , but it ’s gone up to $ 7 .
If you know of other jacks that work we ’ll add them here .
microSD card
We used a microSD / transflash card in this design because SD cards waste a lot of board space under the holder .
microSD cards are smaller versions of SD cards with the same data interface , and most come with an adapter for use in standard SD card readers .
The card needs a holder ( SD1 ) and a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor ( C8 ) .
If you want to use a full - size SD card , take a look at our version one prototype in the project archive .
We used Alps SD card holder # SCDA1A0901 .
Unfortunately , this part is has been discontinued and we ’ve yet to find a suitable replacement .
Do n’t try # SCDA5A0201 , that ’s for sure .
If you have a favorite , we ’ll add it here .
Sparkfun has one , and a matching Cadsoft Eagle part library .
Power supply
An adjustable LM317 voltage regulator ( IC3 ) is set to 3.3 volts using a 390ohm ( R6 ) and 240ohm ( R7 ) resistor .
We considered several 3.3 volt regulators , but nothing was cheaper than a LM317 and two resistors .
There ’s a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor ( C13,14 ) and a 10uF capacitor ( C3,19 ) on both sides to help support the power hungry Ethernet transceiver .
The LM317 will output 3.3 volts from an input of 5 to 20 volts + , but it gets really hot with greater than 9volts supply .
The specified input capacitor is only rated 16 volts , so consider an upgrade if you plan to use a supply greater than about 9volts .
For the first time ever , we incorporated a power jack ( J1 ) into a design .
A jack with a 2.1 mm diameter internal pin seems to be the most common DC connector .
We used a cheap through - hole DC power jack , like SparkFun # PRT-00119 or Mouser # 163-7620 - E .
It mates with a plug like Mouser # 1710 - 0721 .
Circuit board
The PCB ( full size placement .png ) was designed in Cadsoft Eagle 5.0 .
Freeware versions are available for all major platforms .
Renderings were done with Eagle3D , beta version .
Schematic and board files are included in the project archive ( ZIP ) .
We designed the project with large SOIC chips and 0805 surface mount ( SMD ) parts , but haters can rest assured that chips are available in a through - hole package .
We prefer to use SMD parts because the resulting circuit boards are smaller , cheaper , and faster to produce .
0805 parts are dirt cheap , and easy to solder with a normal iron .
Do n’t expect this project to work on a breadboard , there ’s probably too much capacitance for this circuit .
We took full advantage of the PIC ’s programmable pin placement to get the simplest trace routings possible .
Just four jumper wires are needed on an otherwise single - sided board .
The traces are large and clean , DIY toner transfer boards should be easy .
We made our PCB using an inkjet printer transparency mask over an UV sensitive circuit board .
In addition to the final design , the project archive contains our v1 prototype design .
The prototype uses a full size SD card ( SCDA1A0901 ) and all electrolytic 10 uF capacitors .
We also put the RJ45 Ethernet jack on a daughterboard to better accommodate different pinouts .

Firmware
Three firmware examples are included in the project archive [ zip ] .
The examples compile with Microchip ’s demonstration C30 compiler .
Learn more about working with the PIC 24 F in our previous article : Web server on a business card ( part 1 ) .
MPLAB is n’t great about project portability , you may need to locate all the project files again if your path does n’t match the ‘ c:wsbc ’ format that we used .
FAT12/16/32 disk library
Our first step was to get the FAT library reading from a SD card .
FAT 12/16/32 are simple disk storage formats that work with PCs , MACs , digital cameras , music players , and other electronics .
Here ’s our favorite FAT tutorial / teardown ( PDF ) .
Microchip ’s FAT 12/16/32 library gives us simple functions for working with SD cards .
The included demo application creates some files and directories to demonstrate each function .
Here ’s how we configured it to work on our custom hardware , you can find these changes by searching for the tag ‘ HACKADAY ’ in the code :
HardwareProfile.h assigns actual PIC hardware to generic references in the code library .
For the SD card this is an SPI interface , and pins for chip select and card detect .
First , we deleted all the unused hardware profiles to make the code more manageable .
Next , we configured the FAT library to communicate with the SD card using an SPI module ( line 132 ) .
Finally , we defined the SPI pin assignments ( line 152 ) .
Pin setup is shown in the table below .
Pin Port Chip select B0 SD card detect A2 SPI clock B2 SPI MOSI B1 SPI MISO B3
Demonstration .c .
On line 48 we set a custom oscillator fuse configuration , as described in our PIC 24 F introduction .
This is also the logical place to configure pin assignments with peripheral pin select ( line 63 ) .
FSConfig.h .
This file enables various components of file system library , affecting the amount of memory and program space used .
A read - only library is very small , a full write configuration is bigger .
We did n’t have to make any changes for the demonstration , but this is an important file to note .
At first , the library failed to recognize our SD card .
It only supports disks with a master boot record ( MBR ) .
Windows XP formats SD cards as a DOS disk : a single partition with no MBR .
To verify this , open a Windows - formatted disk with a utility like HxD and inspect sector 0 of the physical disk .
Byte 446 should be the location of the first MBR partition entry , but instead it ’s the NTLDR executable code .
To format the disk in the ‘ correct ’ FAT format , use a digital camera ’s format function or a utility like Panasonic ’s SD card formatter .
We also considered using a different FAT library that reads DOS disks , like DOSFS , or adding similar features to the Microchip firmware .
TCP / IP stack
Microchip ’s free TCP / IP stack performs the convoluted configuration and networking functions needed to run a web server .
You can read all about the stack in various application notes and documentation .
Wikipedia is our favorite TCP / IP learning resource ; we wrote our first TCP / IP stack using only Wikipedia .
Microchip ’s TCP / IP stack used to be messy and confusing .
Now it ’s just confusing .
The last few versions of have improved considerably in code clarity and structure .
Here ’s what we did to to configure the base TCP / IP stack example for our hardware , you can find these changes by searching for the tag ‘ HACKADAY ’ in the code :
HardwareProfile.h assigns actual PIC hardware resources to generic references in the code library .
We added our custom oscillator configuration ( line 68 ) , and configured the server status LED to use the LED attached to PORTB7 ( line 83 ) .
We defined the SPI interface to the ENC28J60 as follows ( line 116 ) :
Pin Port Reset B8 Chip select B9 SPI clock B10 SPI MOSI B11 SPI MISO B12 Wake on lan B13 Interrupt B14
MainDemo.c .
We eliminated a bunch of unused code , and added the peripheral pin select configuration code to the InitializeBoard ( ) function ( line 332 ) .
TCPIPConfig.h defines the TCPIP stack components included in a compile .
We ’ve enabled DNS , DHCP , the IP announcer , and the ping server ( line 56 ) :
# define STACK_USE_DNS
// Domain Name Service Client #define STACK_USE_DHCP_CLIENT
//
Get DNS automagically #define STACK_USE_ANNOUNCE
// Microchip Ethernet Device Discoverer #define STACK_USE_ICMP_SERVER
//
Enable the PING server
After loading this firmware , we ’re ready to connect the server to a network for the first time .
During initialization , the TCP / IP stack negotiates with the network router for an IP address using DHCP .
We need to know this address to communicate with the device .
If the device had a screen we could display the IP address , but instead we use the MCHPDetect .
exe utility from Microchip .
When the TCP / IP stack finishes initializing , it broadcasts an announcement packet to port 30303 of all locally connected computers .
MCHPDetect extracts the IP address from these packets .
A new announce packet is sent on every PIC reset .
It ’s also possible to read the IP address directly from memory with a debugger .
The address is stored in the AppConfig .
MyIPAddr variable , the . byte form follows the standard x.x.x.x IP notation .
Once we have the IP address , we can ping the server and test its responsiveness .
If ping shows high latency or malformed packets , you can use Wireshark to inspect network traffic at the byte level .
Unless you ’re in Germany , because it might be criminal .
Building the custom HTTP server
The custom web server looks for requested files on the SD card , and sends them with the correct content type .
We used the Microchip HTTP example server v1 ( HTTP.c ) as a base for our FAT file server ( FATHTTP.c ) .
Microchip ’s HTTP server used a simple file system called MPFS to index web pages on an EEPROM chip .
We replaced calls to MPFS functions with calls to functions in the FAT library ( see the HTTPProcess and Sendfile functions in FATHTTP.c ) .
Our changes demonstrate the concept as simply as possible , without adding confusing pointers and other handy C obfuscations .
The code leaves a ton of room for improvements , have at it .
File writes are disabled in the default compilation , but there ’s enough program space to enable them if you want to write to the SD card ( see FSConfig.h ) .
It ’s necessary to registered our custom FATHTTP server with the rest of the TCP / IP stack .
We did a search and replace for the original HTTP server components , and added calls to our new FATHTTP server as needed .
That turned out to be these places :
TCPIPConfig.h .
First we inserted some definitions that enable the FATHTTP server ( line 70 ) , and added a TCP socket for the FATHTTP server ( line 248 ) .
TCPIP.h .
Next , we added FATHTTP to the list of services that require the TCP / IP stack ( line 170 ) and then included the necessary headers ( line 351 ) .
StackTSK .c.
We added the FATHTTP server initialization ( line 138 ) and processing ( line 340 ) functions to the list of TCP / IP stack tasks .
Helpers.c .
We also needed to include a few helper functions for working with URLs ( line 259 ) .
At long last , it ’s time to put some files on an SD card and test this thing .
Make sure your files follow the 8.3 file name format .
The project archive contains a sample website with a test image and zip file .
After grabbing the server ’s IP address with MCHPDetect , we pointed a browser at it .
The IP address entered alone will redirect the browser to index.htm , whether or not it exists .
Web pages and images stored on the SD card display in the browser , but unknown binary types trigger a download prompt .
Taking it further
We see a lot of potential projects using this tiny web platform .
Add hooks in the FATHTTP .c source for special URLs that trigger events or configure pins .
Build a remotely accessible data logger .
Use the extra pins to read sensors and log data to the SD card .
Logs are retrievable from a web browser , or directly from the FAT readable SD card .
Get remote access to an ancient serial terminal or BBS , optionally log the console output .
Use two external pins as a serial port , and forward commands from the Internet using Microchip ’s Telnet server and Ethernet - to - serial bridge examples .

Next time , we ’ll use the mini server to make an Internet connected , electronic indoor graffiti wall .
This will be an interactive project where everyone can contribute graffiti and animations on - line .

People who view pictures of someone they hate display activity in distinct areas of the brain that , together , may be thought of as a ‘ hate circuit ’ , according to new research by scientists at University College London .
The study , by Professor Semir Zeki and John Romaya of the Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology at UCL , examined the brain areas that correlate with the sentiment of hate and shows that the ‘ hate circuit ’ is distinct from those related to emotions such as fear , threat and danger – although it shares a part of the brain associated with aggression .
The circuit is also quite distinct from that associated with romantic love , though it shares at least two common structures with it .
Unlike romantic love , which is directed at one person , hate can be directed against entire individuals or groups , as is the case with racial , political , or gender hatred .
Professor Zeki said that these different varieties of hate will be the subject of future studies from his laboratory .
The results are an extension of previous studies on the brain mechanisms of romantic and maternal love from the same laboratory .
Explaining the idea behind the research , Professor Zeki said , “ Hate is often considered to be an evil passion that should , in a better world , be tamed , controlled , and eradicated .
Yet to the biologist , hate is a passion that is of equal interest to love .
Like love , it is often seemingly irrational and can lead individuals to heroic and evil deeds .
How can two opposite sentiments lead to the same behaviour ?
” To compare their present results with their previous ones on romantic love , Zeki and Romaya specifically studied hate directed against an individual .
Seventeen subjects , both female and male , had their brains scanned while viewing pictures of their hated person as well as that of neutral faces with which they were familiar .
Viewing a hated person showed activity in distinct areas of the brain that , together , may be thought of as a ‘ hate circuit ’ .
The ‘ hate circuit ’ includes structures in the cortex and in the sub-cortex and has components that are important in generating aggressive behaviour , and translating this into action through motor planning , as if the brain becomes mobilised to take some action .
It also involves a part of the frontal cortex that has been considered critical in predicting the actions of others , probably an important feature when one is confronted by a hated person .
The subcortical activity involves two distinct structures , the putamen and insula .
The former , which has been implicated in the perception of contempt and disgust , may also be part of the motor system that is mobilised to take action , since it is known to contain nerve cells that are active in phases preparatory to making a move .
Professor Zeki added : “ Significantly , the putamen and insula are also both activated by romantic love .
This is not surprising .
The putamen could also be involved in the preparation of aggressive acts in a romantic context , as in situations when a rival presents a danger .
Previous studies have suggested that the insula may be involved in responses to distressing stimuli , and the viewing of both a loved and a hated face may constitute such a distressing signal .
“ A marked difference in the cortical pattern produced by these two sentiments of love and hate is that , whereas with love large parts of the cerebral cortex associated with judgment and reasoning become de-activated , with hate only a small zone , located in the frontal cortex , becomes de-activated .
This may seem surprising since hate can also be an all - consuming passion , just like love .
But whereas in romantic love , the lover is often less critical and judgmental regarding the loved person , it is more likely that in the context of hate the hater may want to exercise judgment in calculating moves to harm , injure or otherwise extract revenge .
Clusters of activation for the contrast Hated face > Neutral faces .
The statistical threshold was set at p≤0.05 at the cluster level , corrected for multiple comparisons , with an underlying voxel - level threshold of p≤0.00025 , as displayed .
“ Interestingly , the activity in some of these structures in response to viewing a hated face is proportional in strength to the declared intensity of hate , thus allowing the subjective state of hate to be objectively quantified .
This finding may have legal implications in criminal cases , for example .

( Actually , this is n’t an April Fools ’ joke . 😉 )
When you think Microsoft , Linux and Mac is n’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind .
But , Microsoft does have test laboratories for open - source software as well as for their Mac products ( think MS Office for Mac ) .
Here is a little bit of insight into these “ outsiders ” inside Microsoft .
The MS Open Source Software Lab
Stephen Zarkos at the Microsoft OSS Lab recently posted an interesting and informative blog entry about what actually goes on at that place .
To some folks outside of Microsoft , the Open - Source Software Lab has been a sort of mysterious place .
A place where we study Linux and open - source software , cursing our enemies while brewing our malevolent plans to combat those nasty FOSS developers .
Oh , and we also have a death ray on the roof of building 17 .
It ’s Linux - powered , of course , just to add a little irony .
Wow , a death ray !
As you probably have guessed , the reality is that the OSS Lab is just a room full of servers , used by engineers who just love to work with technology .
Much of what we do is research , testing and of course there is an educational aspect as well .
We all love Linux and open - source , and I almost never take my death - ray to work .
Awww , no death ray …
But it ’s still pretty cool .
Here are some tidbits :
Seven racks of servers .
Big mix of hardware , from old Pentium III blade servers to the latest and hottest , including an IBM POWER6 .
Most are Linux systems , though there are BSD , AIX , Sun and Windows systems as well .
Check out the original post for more information and pictures .
And now it ’s time to have a look at the Mac Lab .
The MS Mac Lab
This is from a blog entry from David Weiss at Microsoft .
Though this information is a little bit dated by now ( from April 2006 ) , it ’s still interesting .
2,000 square feet filled with Mac computers .
( Upon hearing this , Pingdom ’s web designer , David , started drooling . 😉 )
All significant hardware configurations from Apple that run MS products ( mainly MS Office , we assume ) .
Several automated test rigs for MS Office .
One of them has 150 Mac Minis stacked side by side .
There ’s also an XServe RAID and XSAN , plus lots of print testing for MS Office :
And much more .
There are lots of more pictures in the original blog entry about Mac Labs .
We hope you found this interesting .
It ’s pretty cool that there are both Mac and Linux enthusiasts working with what they love inside Microsoft .
It ’s not all about Windows . 🙂
The New York Times website had a terrible feature that would open a new window every time you double clicked on any word in a story .
The window pointed to a definition of the word you just highligthed .
Apparently the Times had a pretty low opinion of its readers ' intelligence .
People absolutely hated this feature .
Now the terror is finally over !
Take a look at the new feature :
Instead of an annoying pop-up window , you get a little question mark icon that you can easily ignore .

Three Superpowers Why the US , Europe and China Need a ' G - 3 '
The current multipolar world resembles a three - legged stool with the United States , the European Union , and China being the dominant " imperial " powers .
But only when there exists a viable balance of power can the stool be stable -- and a new global order emerge .
Von Parag Khanna
The U.S. and Pakistan had better get their act together , said the Kabul Daily Afghanistan in an editorial .
The U.S. keeps trying to “ take unilateral action ” against the terrorist bases in the Pakistani tribal areas , while Pakistan insists that it wo n’t allow any foreign forces on its soil .
Already , we ’ve seen instances of Pakistani forces firing on American helicopters as they fly over .
Such unnecessary conflict “ merely helps terrorists to grow stronger on both sides of the border . ”
We need “ honest coordination ” among U.S. , Afghan , and Pakistani forces as allies together against a common enemy .
If we ’re being honest , said the Kabul Arman-e Melli , let ’s admit that Pakistan has never truly been an ally in the war on terror .
The U.S. was “ bewitched ” by Pakistani intelligence officials who knew so much about the Taliban .
It turns out that was because the Pakistanis armed and trained them .
At least now the Americans have “ reached the right conclusion and came to agree that terrorist nests should be destroyed on the other side ” of the border .
Pakistan is where the terrorists are ; let the Americans go fight them there .
We ’d certainly rather see the Americans bombing Pakistan than bombing Afghanistan , said the Kabul Rah-e Nejat .
The problem is that all too often , when the Americans drop bombs here , they do n’t hit the right targets .
U.S. forces simply flail at the enemy in an “ uncoordinated ” manner , inflicting more damage on the innocent than on the guilty .
The constant killing of Afghan civilians has led to justified “ public anger ” and even renewed support for the Taliban .
Afghans who once welcomed the Americans as liberators now view them as occupiers .
Then let ’s get them out of here , said the Kabul Weesa .
It ’s time to “ Afghanize ” the conflict .
“ Afghans understand the mind - sets of their people better than anyone else .
We can put an end to the ongoing violence . ”
If the U.S. wants a peaceful Afghanistan , it should “ strengthen the Afghan national army and police . ”
If , however , U.S. forces continue to rain death on Afghan villagers , “ there will be the possibility of incidents like the Sept. 11 attacks . ”

College textbooks come packed with one advantage — knowledge — but are burdened with a slew of less - desirable traits .
The thick books add pounds to overloaded packs , are easily outmoded with the release of a new edition , and can cost a fortune .
But selling facts on dead trees may soon be a thing of the past , and the University of Texas at Austin will dip its toes in the uncharted waters of electronic textbook distribution .
UT is certainly not the first to consider e-textbooks in lieu of bound paper .
Just over a week ago , the National Association of College Stores announced its foray into digital distribution .
College bookstores that belong to the trade group and textbook publishers alike are hoping to avoid being whipped by the transition to digital media à la the music recording industry .
Initially , the NACS plan will test digital distribution selling movies via DVD burning kiosks .
Textbooks will follow , but will still have to be purchased at the kiosk , failing to alleviate the rush for course materials at the start of the semester .
Students under UT 's plan , though , download digital textbooks to their hard drives .
About 1,000 students will participate in the trial in the next academic year , according to an article in the Austin American - Statesman .
For cash - strapped students , the benefits of digital textbooks are readily apparent .
Where many textbooks for math and science courses routinely top $ 100 , the e-textbooks UT will be testing cost between $ 25 and $ 40 .
Students enrolled in the pilot program will receive the texts for free , but do n’t expect that to last .
If the trial is a success , the university will begin passing the fee on to students and will broaden the courses for which e-textbooks are available .
Still , students could save a substantial amount of money with e-textbooks .
Currently , UT 's financial aid website says students should expect to shell out $ 409 a semester for books , meaning an all - digital textbook diet could slash that number by over 75 percent .
And since the expected cost for books is only an estimation , students enrolled in certain courses could stand to save even more .
Yet e-textbooks are not a perfect solution , as we 've pointed out in the past .
With digital files , there is no used book market , so one low - cost source of textbooks may vanish .
And while the American - Statesman article does n’t mention DRM , there will certainly be some method to prevent unfettered sharing .
DRM restrictions , such as limiting printing to 10 pages per session and texts that are no longer accessible after 180 days , are features we 've seen on other e-textbooks .
Though the files in UT ’s program do not expire , it is possible that future digital rights management implementations could impose a sunset date for certain materials .
If DRM , access , and pricing issues can be solved , e-textbooks could be the way of the future as more students carry laptops and e-book readers drop in price and increase in usability .
While traditional textbooks , like CDs , will still be sold for decades to come , their ubiquity may soon be a relic of the past .

In 1951 , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) received word from a military envoy that the Swiss drug company Sandoz Pharmaceuticals had 100 million doses of LSD , available to anyone who cared to purchase them .
This " anyone " included the Russians -- people who , in the minds of the U.S. military and intelligence communities , were " 10 - feet tall " shady , powerful and unscrupulous [ source : Grittenger ] .
In the hands of the Soviet Union , entire U.S. cities could be driven mad or made to revolt against the U.S. government from a water supply spiked with LSD .
The Russians , the CIA knew , were engaged in tests to find ways of undermining the behavior and personalities of regular people .
They wanted to create a truth serum or learn to program everyday individuals into unwitting and involuntary assassins .
So , too , did the Americans .

When the Sandoz supply became known , the United States moved to take it off the market .
It turned out Sandoz had manufactured only about 40,000 doses .
The United States bought them anyway .
And with the LSD in their possession , military researchers and the CIA began conducting their own experiments .
In 1975 , Congress held inquiries into the clandestine operation known as MKULTRA , the code name for an umbrella operation covering 149 subprojects .
Most of these were involved with exploring new methods of chemical and psychological warfare .
The Church Committee , the Senate group that held the inquiry , learned little about the details of the operations .
The CIA maintained its standard silence -- files had been destroyed , new directors had no knowledge of old projects .
Two years later , the skeleton that was MKULTRA in the CIA 's closet emerged entirely .
A Freedom of Information act request filed by a journalist turned up several boxes of materials that escaped destruction but were overlooked during the Church inquiry .
A second Congressional inquiry was held into MKULTRA in 1977 .
Information on 149 MKULTRA subprojects was unearthed -- from learning to deliver poisons using magicians ' sleight of hand to electroshock therapy as a means of making an unwilling subject talk [ source : Turner ] .
With the release of the newfound documents , dates , locations and names of unwitting participants in the CIA 's experiments came to light .
The names of some of the people who conducted these experiments were also revealed .
Dr. Sidney Gottlieb , a clubfooted stuttering scientist with a penchant for dancing , ran the technical division for the CIA .
George Hunter White , a former Army Office of Strategic Services ( the predecessor of the CIA ) officer who 'd reputedly killed a Chinese spy with his bare hands in Calcutta , directly oversaw the undercover acid tests for Gottlieb .
Ike Feldman , a narcotics agent who posed comfortably as a pimp and racketeer , did much of the leg work at White 's direction .
Separately , but especially together , these three men filled out every inch of the shady public image of CIA operatives .
They were the spooks of pulp fiction realized .
Most of the MKULTRA experiments were conducted under the scientific method with informed , willing test subjects at universities , CIA labs and independent research facilities .
Some of these tests fell outside of the bounds of acceptable protocol :
One study lured heroin addicts to participate as test subjects by paying them in heroin .
Another studied the effects of LSD on black inmates in a prison .
The experiments carried out by White and Feldman at Gottlieb 's behest were less scientific .
These resembled torture or a party , depending on how the subject reacted to the acid .

Bush 41 ’s biggest mistake was breaking his word on taxes and planting the seeds for the recession that led to the primary challenge by Pat Buchanan , the independent candidacy of H. Ross Perot and the election of Bill Clinton as the 42nd president .
“ W’s ” old man , though , did n’t do lasting damage to conservatism .
He had so little invested in the ideology , and the ideologues in him .
It was easy for the right to galvanize against him and part ways .
Despite his loss in 1992 , the GOP actually picked up seats in the House .
This President Bush , though , has played with fire .
Since the brilliant conservative theoretician Frank Meyer devised “ fusionism ” in the 1950s — which brought together the social right , the foreign policy right and the economic right under a philosophy opposed to oppressive government that later evolved into a political movement — a conservative one based on “ Freedom . ”
This culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 , and all sides understood their end of the bargain .
No side could tempt itself with the siren song of national government power as a means of placating their people or suckling for money .
They had to slug out their problems at the state level and forge ahead in the time honored “ do it yourself ” tradition of America .
The Republicans of late , however , decided to trade in the “ less government , more freedom ” model that had worked so well for Reagan and conservatives .
They deliberately and quite consciously made the social right and the economic right dependent upon Washington .
From the beginning , they tempted the social right with a seat at the table in forming policy , “ faith - based initiatives , ” federal interference in the Terry Schiavo case in Florida and a ludicrous amendment to the Constitution banning gay marriage .
After eight years of being told by Rove and this White House that all the social ills of America could be federalized , it will take a long time to put this toothpaste back in the tube .
In 1978 , state Sen. John Briggs offered Proposition 6 in California .
The “ Briggs Amendment ” would have prohibited gays from teaching in public schools .
Though the Christian right supported it , Reagan campaigned against it , seeing it as a violation of personal freedoms .
Voters there sent it down in flames and Briggs blamed Reagan ’s opposition for its defeat .
The economic right is in as bad a shape .
Bush and Co. never understood what tax cuts meant to Reagan and conservatives .
In essence , Reagan 's position was , “ OK , I ’m going to cut your taxes , but I am also going to cut spending .
Do n’t look to Washington to fix your problems or for a bailout .
Look to yourself . ”
Reagan and the conservatives believed giving individuals more of their money meant more opportunity to pursue dreams of entrepreneurship , more self - reliance and more self - worth , certainly ennobling to the human spirit .
Rove , Bush and the modern Republicans have treated Americans like crack addicts , giving them tax cuts but also federal boodle , so tax cuts look more like an appeal to downright greed .
When Bush signed the McCain - Feingold Act , limiting the personal freedoms of Americans ' involvement in politics , Rove was asked in confidence about the constitutionality of the legislation .
According to his questioner , Rove was singularly unconcerned and said he was only concerned about the favorable editorials Bush would get for signing the bill and that he , Rove , could live with the decilne in personal contributions to the 2004 Bush campaign .
Starting with No Child Left Behind and wending its way through eight years of Rove - inspired initiatives , Reagan ’s organizing philosophy of “ freedom ” has been replaced by Bush ’s “ security . ”
Bush has also put conservatives in an impossible position by trying to explain deregulation versus the out - and - out corruption of the financial industry and bailout of their friends on Wall Street and nationalize the mortgage and banking industries .
For the record , Reaganites oppose the bailout and federal involvement in anything other than throwing crooked brokers and bankers into jail block C .
Wehner said this election is not a referendum on conservatism , but he is only partially right .
Millions of Americans have come to erroneously see Bush as a conservative when nothing could be further from the truth .
This election will more accurately be a referendum on Bush ’s “ Big Government Republicanism , ” and not Reagan conservatism , not our conservatism .
Trouble is , few will know it , and we conservatives have our work cut out for us .
Tony Fabrizio is the president of Fabrizio - McLaughlin & Associates , a conservative polling firm .
Craig Shirley is the president of Shirley and Banister Public Affairs , a leading marketing firm of conservative thought .
He is also the author of two books on Ronald Reagan .
Both have worked in conservative politics for more than 30 years .

For a family - owned company , the new design is much more personable than the more rigid , angular logo from the 1990s .
“ When we looked back at some of our earliest logos , they conveyed the warmth and personal attention to detail that we hope reflect our brand .
The family culture in our company continues to grow .
It was time to go back to our roots and to a logo that is welcoming because it is more like a family signature . ”

Yael mentioned the recent logo trend of companies looking to their past for logo refinements and redesigns — like the Pentagram rebrand of the Saks logo .
The system we 're building at Kynetx includes a domain specific language that uses rules to create JavaScript programs that get sent down to the browser .
I 've documented our decision to use a domain specific langauge and our choice of Perl in other posts .
When I started this project , I was reading Mark Dominus ' book Higher Order Perl and started using his HOP parser to play around with .
One thing led to another an before you know it I had a full blown language parser in HOP without giving much thought as to whether or not I 'd made the right choice .
I found the HOP parser to be pretty flexible , but it has it 's quirks .
More importantly , I did n't like the BNF specification format and so I was constantly trying to keep the spec and the implementation in sync .
Better if I could just use the spec as the implementation ' ala Bison .
Do n't get me wrong , this is a great book with lots of wonderful ideas , but I wanted something else for the parser .
As I added more and more features to the language , it got to where I 'd dread making the parser changes .
Recently , I decided I had to significantly beef up the predicate expressions and thought it would be a good time to change out the parser as well .
A few months ago I picked up Christopher Frenz 's Pro Perl Parsing in anticipation of just this day .
Reading through it illuminated my choices and ultimately , I picked Damian Conway 's Parse : : RecDescent , a recursive descent parser over the other contender , Parse : : Yapp .
The reasons for my choice were partly esthetic and partly a trust in Damian .
The main thing I was after was a parse spec that I could read and compile and RecDescent seemed great in that regard .
The biggest downside of RecDescent is that there 's no associated Lexer .
For most things that 's not a big deal since terminals can be specified as regular expressions .
The place where it really bit me was comments .
Removing comments is trickier than you'd think because you do n't want to process " start of comment markers " inside any quotes .
With a lexer , that 's easy ; without one , it 's more problematic .
Writing the regexp to remove comments took me a while to get right .
I ended up using a modified version of the solution given in this FAQ .
The problem with most solutions , including Regexp : : Common , which has a language comment module , is that they do n't account for comment markers in quotes .
All in all , rewriting the parser was a good exercise and I 'm happy with the choice of RecDescent .
Here 's a sample production from my file :
decl : VAR '= ' VAR ':' VAR '(' expr(s? /,/) ' ) ' { $return = {'lhs ' => $ item [ 1 ] , ' type ' => ' data_source ' , ' source ' => $ item [ 3 ] , ' function ' => $ item [ 5 ] , ' args ' => $ item [ 7 ] } } | VAR '= ' ' counter ' '.' VAR {$return = {'lhs ' => $ item [ 1 ] , ' type ' => $ item [ 3 ] , ' name ' => $ item [ 5 ] } } | VAR '= ' HTML {$return = {'lhs ' => $ item [ 1 ] , ' type ' => ' here_doc ' , ' value ' => $ item [ 3 ] } } |
This production for decl has three alternates .
Each has a separate return value ( a hash ) that represents the portion of the abstract syntax tree created for that part of the input .
If you decide to give Parse : : RecDescent a try , here are some resources :
Reading the documentation and the FAQ thoroughly is highly recommended .
There 's lots of little tricks that can make your job easier .
My job , replacing an existing parser , was made easier by the fact that I 'd previously built a pretty thorough test suite in Perl for the parser and some related modules .
So once I got the language spec pretty much complete , I started running the tests and correcting errors as they cropped up .
In a few hours , I 'd solved all the problems and was confident my parser was ready to go .
Definitely the way to go .
At any rate , now I 've for a shiny new parser that I can go modify .
Fun !
Burning the Tide

But as oil wanes , he ’s convinced that clean energy will be — must be — the next big thing .
And so this inventor has poured his fortune into a challenge far greater than finding new oil deposits : extracting energy from the ocean
Time management is essential to getting things done efficiently , but not necessarily effectively .
That distinction might seem academic , but having seen just how deeply people treat time and output as synonymous , I want to take a closer look at the premise that more time spent on a task equals more productivity .
If only I had more time
At a GTD seminar , an inexperienced presenter was trying to illustrate the concept of converting a problem into a specific outcome and next action .
He asked someone in the audience to mention some big problem that was on his mind .
He mentioned putting his offline small business on the web .
“ So the project is , ‘ Create website for business , ’ the presenter noted , ” writing it on a whiteboard .
“ Now , what ’s the very next action you would take to move that project forward ? ”
The audience member shrugged and said , “ You know , there ’s so much to do , and I have so many people interrupting me all the time — that ’s the problem . ”
The presenter said , “ OK , but what ’s the very next thing you would need to do to get this one project started ? ”
The business owner thought about it , and said , “ I guess I need to get rid of the interruptions . ”
The presenter tried reframing the question to get a concrete next action out of him , but it only resulted in the gentleman rewording the same answer .
If I had nothing else to do
The assumption in the above exchange was that it was necessary to have uninterrupted time in order to decide what to do next .
And because there are always things to do and plenty of interruptions , no specific action is ever defined , so the task continually remains implicit .
In this case , the “ solution ” is to block out time to “ work on ” the project , but because the action is abstract , the time needed to complete a project is equally abstract .
In less time than it took for the business owner to determine that he needed more uninterrupted time to think about what to do next , he could have just thought about what to do next :
“ Call Dan : get recommendations for web designers . ”
What blocked him from considering this option was a bias toward thinking of time as the fundamental resource for moving a project forward .
To keep next actions from becoming abstract “ to do ” items , use three guidelines :
Assume that time is n’t a factor
Ensure that they ’re physical , visible actions
They have no dependencies
When defining a next action , it helps to precede it with , “ If I had nothing else to do , I would . . . ” This stops the knee - jerk reaction of focusing on current time commitments .
Once you ’ve precisely defined what to do , the perceived time it actually takes usually diminishes , because you ’ve reduced the task to something physical .
Getting rid of interruptions takes forever .
Calling Dan takes five minutes .
If the only information needed are names and phone numbers , the call might even be a two minute action that can be done immediately .
A next action should have no dependencies , meaning that if Dan ’s phone number is n’t available , the next action is to get Dan ’s phone number .
But that ’s not a next action , since “ Get Dan ’s phone number ” is n’t a physical , visible action .
How do you get Dan ’s phone number ?
In this hypothetical case , you happen to know that Laura has Dan ’s phone number , and you know that you have Laura ’s number .
So the next action would be , “ Call Laura : get Dan ’s phone number , ” which , per the Two Minute Rule , should be taken immediately ; it would take more time to write down , review and do later than to get it done at once .
This one action kick starts the project , “ Create website for business . ”
Taking immediate action creates momentum .
After calling Laura and getting Dan ’s number creates an immediate win , so the tendency is to follow it up with the next action without hesitation .
You call Dan and ask about the designers he mentioned when he first suggested that you put your business on the web .
He gives you their names , numbers and websites .
You could call these designers now , but decide that you ’d rather avoid wasting time calling bad designers .
So you put , “ Assess designers ’ sites ” on your @Computer list .
Once you ’ve eliminated the unimpressive candidates , you put each call for the remaining designers on your @Calls list for quotes .
Two things are noteworthy here .
At each step , you ’ve acted without complete information ; you simply removed the most immediate constraint .
Furthermore , you ’ve scheduled none of this .
If these actions had been put on a calendar , they probably would have taken half a day ( when you “ had time ” ) .
But everything mentioned could can be done in less than half an hour .
Unlike to - do items in calendar - based time management , next actions are designed to be done as soon as possible .
You do n’t draw out a next action to fill the time you ’ve allotted to it .
You just do it and move on to the next action , repeating the process until either an external commitment , like a meeting , requires your attendance , or you ’ve simply called it quits for the day .
At any point in time , you can only do one thing .
Once you ’ve defined a next action , either do it or do another one of higher priority , but unless you have a higher - priority task to work on at the moment , do n’t defer the next action you ’ve just defined by scheduling it — do it now .
Arbitrarily assigning a time to an action with no time dependency is procrastination in the name of time management .

NBC ’s Tina
Fey is now the enemy of the McCain crowds , too :
Usually it ’s only the mention of Barack Obama or the national media that get boos at McCain rallies , but today it was Tina Fey .
McCain mentioned that his running mate was appearing on “ Saturday Night Live ” tonight , and a hearty boo came up from the crowd when McCain mentioned the cast member that impersonates Sarah Palin : “ As you know she ’s going to be with Tina Fey , who I think is her twin sister , ” McCain said to boos from the crowd .
“ I think they were separated at birth , but anyway , I know she ’ll do a great job . ”
Those people are really scary .
Which leads us to an excellent point from Dan Savage :
Why did n’t NBC insist on Palin sitting down for a real , substantive interview — or , better still , calling a full press conference — as a condition of Palin appearing on SNL tonight ?
Candidates do n’t go on Letterman , Leno , SNL , The Daily Show , et al , to take a break from the campaign trail .
Comedy programs are stops on the campaign trail .
Palin is running from the press , refusing to answer any questions , lying her ass off on the stump , and attacking the people who could call her on those lies — reporters , news anchors , cable news networks — at her rallies .
So why the fuck should NBC allow Palin to reap the political rewards of an appearance on SNL if Palin is n’t willing ( or able ) to answer questions from NBC news reporters ?
Do n’t ever expect to see Palin on Meet the Press .
She did do interviews with Gibson from ABC and Couric from CBS .
I guess this counts as her NBC stop .
And , it ’s all NBC to us — we do n’t delineate between the divisions .
One last thing : Dan admits he is going to watch Palin tonight .
Let ’s not forget , he really wanted to be Palin ’s gay friend .

Apple and then Google .
Who could have been next ?
Most of you would have already figured it out .
For the rest , please do not question your general awareness ; after we all are human !
Yes it ’s Nokia .
The global telecommunications market leader Nokia has decided to launch its own Symbian mobile operating system which will happen to be open sourced .
The launch seems to be a desperate attempt by Nokia to maintain its market leader status quo and a proffer to increase its current software developer base .
The launch of Nokia ’s Symbian Mobile Operating system juxtaposes with the launch of Google ’s Android source code being made available to developers .
Remember the famous quote Strategy and Timing are the Himalayas of Marketing , Rest are just Catskills .
Sure , it scores more than Catskills , but it needs more than strategy and timing for a product to be successful in the market ( assuming that strategy and timing are correct ! ) .
Between , did anyone talk about the product ?
Guess , No .
Contribution to software development and betterment of a product on its functional parameters are the value propositions that Nokia is keen to tap in by making it an Open Source Project .
Nokia needs to be appreciated for its effort to mark a global presence of the software platform by making it an Open Source venture .
Theory in application – Consumer involvement , which might lead to a pre-purchase buzz being fashioned about the product .
The question about the product being able to satisfy people on both functional and emotional parameters is a dangerous one to comment at this stage .
The change in Nokia ’s strategy can be considered a promotional gimmick as the Symbian Operating system being an Open Source Project would lead to an eyes wide open attention from software developers across the globe .
An added effect of the above mentioned strategy could be a circumlocutory enticement to software developers across the world to help build a protected Operating System .
It will be a tough competition in the Open Source sphere between the advocates of Nokia ’s know - how of mobile phones vis-a - vis Google ’s pledge towards innovation , as the battle place is laid down to be the virtual world .
The Competitive strategies of all the four competitors viz .
Apple , Blackberry , Google and Nokia can be classified into two genres ; the platform for Apple and Blackberry are proprietary as compared to Google and Nokia ’s being Open Source .
The other beneficiaries of Nokia ’s Open Source operating system would be Sony Ericsson and Samsung , as Nokia shares its platform being the members of Symbian Foundation .
Is it worth the wait for all those people who want to upgrade to the next generation mobile phones to wait for the reviews of Nokia ’s Symbian Mobile Operating System ?
The betters can surely pour in their money , assuming the Fed has offered them financial support !
How Brazil has put an 'e ' in vote
Digital Planet
Sao Paulo Special
BBC World Service
Electronic voting has made life easier for people in Brazil This week the BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme is in Brazil .
Here the show takes a look at the country 's pioneering use of electronic voting and how it has changed the way officials are elected .
Brazilians have been voting electronically for more than a decade and with local elections scheduled for 5 October , thousands of voting machines are being deployed to schools and libraries around the country .
Voting is compulsory in Brazil and around 120 million people will be choosing their local governor and mayor in the elections .
Digital Planet producer Michelle Martin , accompanied by listener Gus Neto found out how the system worked .
" We introduced the digital ballot in 1996 and by the year 2000 , 100 % of our elections were conducted using this system , " said Antonio Esio from the Regional Electoral Office in Sao Paulo .
" Nowadays we have 450,000 digital ballot boxes in Brazil , " he said .
" We are making more each year because the number of voters is increasing around 6 % every election . "
Easy interface
The machine has made voting easy for Brazilians and , it is claimed , has reduced the number of errors that crop up when ballot papers are used .
To make the voting machines easy to use a numeric keyboard was chosen as the main interface - something familiar to anyone who has made a phone call .
" It 's quite easy to use because voters only need to type in a number for the candidates and they can also see the picture of the person they 're voting for , " said Mr Esio .
" So this system helps illiterate voters , because they can identify their candidate by a number , and that was a great advance , " he added .
Brazil 's mix of cultures has made e-voting a success , say Brazilians .
" You key in the number from your voting card and then make sure that the name that comes up matches my name , " said Gus Neto , a regular listener to Digital Planet and a native of Sao Paulo .
The machine displays a list of candidates with a picture and voters then choose who they want to vote for by typing in the relevant number and pressing the green " confirm " button on the machine .
" You then get a stub that confirms that you voted " , added Mr Neto .
The votes are recorded on two flash cards , similar to ones used in digital cameras and to make sure the system is secure , each card is coded so that it only works in one specific ballot box .
When voting has finished the cards are removed and the data is transmitted back to the Regional Electoral Office , where votes are counted in just six hours " We are always very careful at not having any relation between the voter and his vote , " said Mr Esio .
" I am not able to identify the vote . "
Pioneering machine Brazil 's first electronic ballot boxes were created by Carlos Rocha - an engineer called from electronics firm Samurai .
Inside the digital ballot box was a very simple computer , Mr Rocha explained .
Digital voting leads to fewer errors in counts , say its backers " The key requirements were that they had to be highly reliable , easy to use , low cost and run from batteries and have a 10 year life - span , " he said .
When the system was first launched , the government promoted them via prime time TV adverts .
It also puts machines in schools and other public areas so Brazilians could experiment with them .
The government also set a challenge to ensure that the cost did not exceed $ 1000 ( £ 560 ) per machine .
" Today we can run a voting machine for 20 hours with basic batteries and that 's for a country where you are taking voting machines into the forest for the Indians to vote , " said Mr Rocha .
Melting pot
Although the system has n't been immune to criticism , Mr Rocha believes that the nature of Brazilian society is what has made it a success .
" Brazil is a big melting pot with people from all over the world , so we are used to differences , " he said .
Questions about the machines ' accuracy and independence have been raised but supporters of the system say the design of the machines allays such fears .
" The voting machine is isolated , it 's not connected to any communication , so there 's no external hacking , " said Mr Rocha .
Overseeing the electoral process Brazil has created " Electoral Justice " that is independent from congress , political parties and the ruling government .
The latest machines are fitted with fingerprint readers " This is a very independent system which has judges , as well as lawyers that have knowledge of the system , " said Mr Rocha .
The success of the system has led to a series of improvements .
" There is a fingerprint identifier device that the Electoral Justice is introducing now , " said Mr Esio .
" In addition to the data from the voter - date of birth , voting area , etc , we will also have the fingerprint identification " , he added .
For the moment Mr Rocha feels that Brazil has the best system in the world .
" The main value of the system is that our society believes in it , " he said .

Both sides have been blamed over civilian casualties
There has been a sharp increase in the number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan this year , according to new figures released by the United Nations .
They show that August had the highest number of deaths since the overthrow of the Taleban almost seven years ago .
The UN says that from January to August 1,445 civilians were killed - a rise of 39 % on the same period last year .
Meanwhile , members of parliament are holding a one - day walk - out in protest the increase in civilian casualties .
A senior member of the senate , Abdul Khaliq Hosseini Pashaei , said the senators would hold further protests if measures were not taken by the Afghan government and foreign forces to reduce the number of civilian deaths .
Anger The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva - where the UN report was released - says that the issue of civilian casualties at the hands of foreign forces has caused widespread anger across the country .
Concern over civilian casualties Spiralling civilian deaths
The figures were collected by the human rights team of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan .
What is especially worrying , says spokesman Rupert Colville , is that every month things seem to get worse .
" August was a particularly bad month - 330 civilians killed , " he said .
" That 's the highest number of civilian deaths to occur in a single month since the end of major hostilities and the ousting of the Taleban regime at the end of 2001 . "
Fifty - five percent of civilian deaths so far in 2008 can be attributed to the Taleban , the UN says .
That is double the number for which they were held responsible last year .
Among the most recent , two doctors working for the World Health Organisation 's polio vaccination campaign were killed with their driver by a suicide bomber on Sunday .
The WHO has now put its vaccination campaign in Kandahar province on hold - 1.2 million children may go unvaccinated .
Meanwhile , civilian casualties caused by pro-government forces are rising too - 577 so far this year , compared with 477 over the same period last year .
Over two - thirds were caused by air strikes and the UN is calling for an independent assessment of damage , so that survivors and relatives can be compensated .

The Republican US presidential candidate John McCain was not tortured during his captivity in North Vietnam , the chief prison guard of the jail in which he was held has claimed .
In an interview with the Italian daily Corriere della Sera , Nguyen Tien Tran acknowledged that conditions in the prison were " tough , though not inhuman " .
But , he added : " We never tortured McCain .
On the contrary , we saved his life , curing him with extremely valuable medicines that at times were not available to our own wounded . "
McCain , who fell into enemy hands after his plane was shot down in 1967 , has frequently referred to being tortured and has cited his experiences as a reason for vigorously opposing the endorsement by the Bush administration of the use of techniques such as " water - boarding " on terrorist suspects .
Shortly after his release in 1973 McCain told US News & World Report that his prison guards had beaten him " from pillar to post " .
After being worked over at intervals for four days , he said , he had become suicidal and agreed to sign a " confession " admitting to war crimes .
In his 1999 autobiography , Faith of My Fathers , he described how after his capture he was subjected to inhuman treatment in an effort to force him to disclose his ship 's name , squadron number and the target of his final mission .
He was threatened with the withdrawal of medical assistance and , while still suffering from his crash injuries , his guards " knocked me around a little " .
For his service in Vietnam and his actions as a POW , McCain was awarded the Silver Star , the Legion of Merit , the Bronze Star , the Navy Commendation Medal and the Purple Heart .
Tran , now 75 , said McCain reached Hanoi with the worst injuries he had seen in a downed pilot .
But he denied torturing him , saying it was his mission to ensure that McCain survived .
As the son of the US naval commander in Vietnam , he offered a potential valuable propaganda weapon .
However , recommending McCain for a medal after the war , his former cellmate , the much - decorated Colonel George Day , said the admiral 's son had forced his interrogators to " drug him and torture him to get any cooperation " , according to a letter in the US National Archives cited earlier this year by the Washington Post .
Day said McCain suffered " torturous abuse " .
Tran told Corriere that McCain was sent to hospital the day after he was brought to Hanoi and stayed there for a month .
" I never lost him from sight .
I was frightened a doctor or nurse might do him harm . "
Tran dismissed as " absolutely impossible " perhaps the most famous story from McCain 's autobiography : that one Christmas , a guard traced a cross in the mud in front of him .
" My men were all communists and atheists , " he said .
As to why McCain , then 36 , left North Vietnam with prematurely grey hair , Tran denied it was because of mistreatment .
" It 's that in prison you think too much . "

If someone pitched a movie based on e-voting machines that work as bad as the ones being used in the current election , the story would be dumped as being unrealistic .
But truth is , indeed , often stranger than fiction .
You may recall on Friday that we had a post about problems with e-voting machines in West Virginia selecting the wrong candidate when voters touched the screen .
Various officials rushed to insist that there was absolutely nothing wrong .
One , the local county clerk , Jeff Waybright insisted that the problems were " the result of voter error .
" Well , it appears that a group called Video The Vote went and visited with Mr. Waybright as he showed them how the e-voting machines work , and perhaps the " human error " is on Mr. Waybright 's part .
The beginning of the video is troubling enough , as he brushes aside concerns while he shows a miscalibrated machine .
He demonstrates how he clicks on one candidate and another is highlighted , in a tone of voice that suggests why would anyone possibly be upset or annoyed if that happened ?
He then oddly thinks the fact that his wildly miscalibrated machine enhances his point because when he clicks on Barack Obama 's name , the actual name highlighted is n't McCain ( of course , it 's not Obama either , but he does n't seem troubled by this ) .
Waybright seems to think that the only complaint people are making is the fact that some tried to vote for the Democratic ticket and saw the Republican ticket show up -- when the real concern is simply the fact that when you touch one name , someone else 's name is highlighted .
Democrat or Republican really is n't the issue here .
However , then things get worse .
After mocking the idea that anyone clicking on a Democratic ticket vote would get the Republican ticket vote , he shows how tocalibrate the machine , showing how easy it is to fix the " problems " of the miscalibrated machine .
When he 's done , to prove it works , he touches the box to vote for a straight Republican ticket ticket ... and , would n't you know it , Ralph Nader 's name is highlighted as the voter 's choice .
His response ?
" Oh , that 's out of calibration ! " as if it was no big deal , apparently missing the fact that he had .
He then seems to think none of this is a big deal , because voters will see the misvote before they submit it , apparently unaware of the idea that many people are alreadydistrustful of these machines , and seeing them highlight the wrong name over and over again will make them seriously question the legitimacy of the election .

People for the American Way has created an ad that is now playing in potential Democratic - pick up Senate seats , targeting Susan Collins ( Maine ) , Norm Coleman ( Minnesota ) , Elizabeth Dole ( North Carolina ) , John Sununu ( New Hampshire ) and Gordon Smith ( Oregon ) .
As part of People For the American Way 's Save the Court campaign , we 're running ads in key states targeting senators who voted against their constituents ' interests by supporting George W. Bush 's extreme judicial nominees .
The ads below call out senators who sided with Bush when it came to judicial nominees whose decisions had very real — and negative — impacts on families in their state .
I 'm a member of PFAW .
You can join as well , and your donation will help buy ad time and hopefully help us increase the Democratic majority in the Senate .
By the way , one of the reasons that Dole faces such a tough race ?
The perception that she is nothing more than an empty suit .
In 2006 , she only spent 13 days in her state and was rated by Congress.org as 93rd most effective senator .
In a field of 100 , that 's gotta hurt .
She hunts !
She fishes !
She eats moose burgers !
She can gut a salmon as well as dispatch an incumbent governor !
She ’s a rural mother of five who clings to guns and religion -– exuberantly !
In choosing as his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , two years removed from her only other significant political job , as a small - town mayor , John McCain has certainly offered up a giant - killer -– “ Sarah Barracuda , ” as she ’s known in the Last Frontier State .
Palin , who has more than a passing resemblance to Tina Fey , took on the kleptocracy of Alaska ’s Republican politics and won .
First , she ousted the hated incumbent , Frank Murkowski , in a primary two years ago , and then promptly cleaned up his mess in Juneau , even selling his private jet on eBay .
Second , she rejected the “ bridge to nowhere , ” the famous earmark for a span from Ketchikan to an island of 50 people -– further angering the politicians - for - life who have run Alaska for half as long as it ’s been in the union .
But she has her own ethics concern , an investigation of whether the governor ’s office was involved in firing a state trooper who was in the midst of a nasty divorce from Palin ’s sister — Troopergate with a bit of Alaska Gothic thrown in .
And McCain ’s selection -– a woman who looks young enough to be his college - age daughter -– makes it hard for Republicans to criticize Barack Obama for his inexperience .
Palin is an inoculation for what may be the biggest rap against Obama .
That ’s a huge risk .
Could Palin take on Putin ?
Slaying Frank Murkowski and dueling with Don Young , the pork - loving congressman behind the bridge , is one thing .
Both men are old - style hacks , to be kind .
But Palin has zero experience on the world stage -– a crucial factor for McCain , who made the announcement on his 72nd birthday .
And , just recently , she seemed to have no idea what the job of vice president entails .
“ What is it exactly that the vice president does every day ? ” she asked in an interview on CNBC .
A fair question , but one that also reinforces her inexperience .
Her bio is classic Alaska , a state where everyone has a past but it ’s so far , far away – “ Outside , ” as Alaskans call the mainland United States .
If Hawaii is “ foreign and exotic ” to some geographically challenged pundits , what will they think of Alaska , which has its own time zone ?
Palin eloped with her husband , Todd , a commercial fisherman , who later won the 2,000 - mile Iron Dog snow machine ( as snowmobiles are called in Alaska ) race .
She gave each of her five children names that sound like her state -– Track , Bristol , Willow , Piper and Trig .
She ’s a self - described “ hockey mom , ” which means something in Minnesota and Colorado , two battleground states .
As a University of Idaho graduate , a television sports reporter , a beauty queen who was Miss Wasilla and competed for Miss Alaska , Palin brings a bit of the “ Legally Blonde ” aspect to the race -– you underestimate her at your peril , as opponents found in Alaska , and in the movie .
Militantly anti-choice and evangelical , the 44 - year - old gave birth to her last child five months ago .
( There were complications — the child has Down Syndrome — a point that she brings up in explaining her convictions . )
Does she woo women , the disgruntled ex-Hillary supporters ?
That may be a tougher sell , given that she ’s bound to back the kind of Supreme Court justices who will remove abortion protections .
And on energy , she could have a debate with her ticket - mate , for Palin favors drilling for oil in the Alaska wildlife refuge , while McCain opposes it -– for now .
Oil has made her state rich , so much so that Palin has asked the legislature this year to give every Alaskan $ 1,200 as one - time energy relief .
But it ’s also made it ripe for corruption .
Tough , independent , a feisty feminist — that ’s one image of the Republican pick .
But there ’s also the echo of Dan Quayle .
In Alaska , big dreams come to life quickly .
They just as swiftly crash .
you sound like you have a good chance of getting into yale or harvard ( although you should really learn how to spell them ! ) .
it 's hard to say exactly what they are looking for , because sometimes they take students with lower grades over those with higher grades .
you sound like you work hard to be active and to get good grades .
they only care about your high school grades , test scores ( like sat ) and activities .
basically , they just want to know that you will contribute to their college in more ways than simply getting good grades .
oh , and i just wanted to say that just because yale and harvard have good reputations does n't necessarily mean that they are " better " than any other colleges .
most colleges have great programs and it is up to the individual to get the most out of what they are given .
The competition specifies that the flying sub must be able to transport eight men and their equipment 1,150 miles ( 1,850 km ) by air , 115 m ( 185 km ) by sea or 14 m ( 22 km ) underwater - or a combination of the three - in less than eight hours , and then wait for up to three days to pick them up again .
All in all it ’s been a rough few days for the monkeys .
On Friday night , the Angels ’ Rally Monkey let down the home crowd in Anaheim .
Although the team triumphed Sunday night in Boston , you ca n’t credit the monkey unless he sneaked into Jared Weaver ’s suitcase .
On Saturday , John McCain ’s rally monkey , Sarah Palin , popped up in Carson .
Fresh off of her victory over herself at the debate , her campaign let Palin out of the cage to rev up the fan base .
Only problem was that , according to an Associated Press analysis , the lady maverick made some “ racially tinged ” remarks about Barack Obama .
Someone might want to inform Sarah that although comments like that may play well in Wasilla , here in Southern California we celebrate diversity along with divisional championships .
Now back to the other primate .
It pains me to write this because I ’m a fan of the Angels .
Having grown up in San Diego , then Huntington Beach , and finally settling in Los Angeles , I root for every SoCal team .
I also love the Rally Monkey .
Through the years I have purchased several of them .
The current one smells like stale beer , has cotton candy stuck in his fur and lives in my closet standing vigil over my shoe rack .
But it may be time to put the Rally Monkey out to pasture .
( Or Rain forest ?
Zoo? Jungle Cruise at Disneyland ? )
He ’s just not performing well in the postseason anymore .
Since 2000 he ’s done an admirable job overall and has a higher approval rating during this same span than that other monkey in the White House .
There ’s no denying that he was once a part of some historic , come - from - behind - victories at the Big A ( yes , I still call it that and the Angels will always be the California Angels to me ) .
Last month , my husband and I had dinner in New York with Johnny Damon and his wife , Michelle .
The subject of the Rally Monkey came up –- do n’t ask me why –- and he said that the Yankees “ fear him . ”
Derek Jeter told Johnny that while in the dugout during the 2002 ALCS , several members of the team were watching the scoreboard in Anaheim during a Rally Monkey video .
Derek stepped in front of them and warned his teammates to avert their eyes .
“ Do n’t look at the monkey , whatever you do , do n’t look at the monkey . ”
They laughed him off , watched the video anyway and the Angels defeated the Yankees three games to one and the rest was history .
Johnny told us that he believes in the power of the primate .
But has Rally lost his monkey mojo ?
And why ?
Is it his age ( what ’s 8 in monkey years ? ) ?
Could it be a woman ?
A lack of focus ?
Global warming ?
I guess for ol ’ times sake , if the Halos can pull off another stunner in Beantown , we should give Rally one more chance .
So , for now , I ’ll get off the monkey ’s back and if we ’re lucky , he ’ll get off Vlad’s .

AUDIENCE MEMBER :
If we do n't reenact the draft I do n't think we will have anyone to chase Bin Laden to the gates of hell .
MCCAIN : Ma'am let me say that I do n't disagree with anything you said , and thank you ...
Here 's what McCain said when asked about the draft in June :
" I do n't know what would make a draft happen unless we were in an all - out World War III . " ...
It 's certainly possible McCain had a senior moment and did n't realize he was essentially agreeing with the woman about needing to bring back the draft .
But what if he does genuinely agree with her ?
Should n't we have the know the answer to that question ?
The government is putting the brakes on proposals to give law enforcement agencies the power to collect electronic data in a bid to prevent terrorism .
The Communications Data Bill would allow the government to collect data on phone calls and other electronic communication .
The government had originally planned to put the proposal in Parliament 's upcoming legislative agenda , but opted instead to conduct a consultation next year due to concerns about intrusive monitoring of private citizens .
" It 's a sensitive issue , and there needs to be a proper public debate , " a Home Office spokesman said .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the legislation is needed because of the difficulty in collecting evidence against terrorists .
" These are not like other criminal investigations , " Smith said during a speech at the Institute for Public Policy Research .
" We put a very high premium on pre-emptive intelligence because we are trying to stop a criminal act and not investigate one which has already taken place . "
Critics contend that allowing the government to create a ' super database ' that logs emails , phone calls and website visits raises privacy concerns as well as potential security problems over how the data would be stored .
Smith denied the government seeks a super database .
" There are no plans for an enormous database which will contain the content of your emails , the texts that you send or the chats you have on the phone or online . "
But collecting data such as the location and identity of someone making a phone call " is vital to fighting terrorism and combating serious crime " , she said .
The government has not made a draft of the Communications Data Bill publicly available .
However , it is modeled in part on European Union Directive 2006 / 24 / EC , which requires that communication providers retain a vast array of data including IP address , physical address and user ID used for communications such as email .
The actual content of the communication should not be retained , but data around how it was sent and when should be retained for at least six months and up to two years , the directive says .
The directive was propelled in part by the July 2005 terrorist attacks in London .
EU countries were required to comply in part with the directive by September 2007 , but can delay the internet access and email monitoring until March 2009 .

LGBT activists have been protesting against fruit drink producer Bolthouse Farms over the founders 100k contribution to proposition 8 .
LGBT activist Lane Hudson has been advising Bolthouse Farms for the last month .
From his email to Joe My God it lists improvements that Bolthouse has made internally :
" Bolthouse Farms sponsored the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force LA Awards Brunch as a Gold Sponsor and the CEO personally contributed $ 5 K to their No on 8 work .
Bolthouse Farms was also a corporate table sponsor of the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner .
" In addition , they have clarified their non-discrimination policy to include sexual orientation .
They also clarified their benefits policy to include dependent children of same sex relationships .
They also edited their website , corporate philosophy and corporate mission to reflect what a consumer products company should be .
It 's a great deal of progress since the new CEO took the reigns a mere 12 weeks ago and since I began advising him a month ago . "
These are very positive changes !
Thank you all for your continued activism in urging them to be a socially responsible corporation .

Right wing columnist Kathleen Parker has been viciously attacked by over 11,000 right wing emailers for saying that she thought Sarah Palin was n't qualified for the job .
We 're used to seeing the media attack the left wing bloggers by quoting anonymous comments left on our blogs which is supposed to be a fair substitute for our own writings .
It 's about time the right was exposed for this behavior as she appeared on CNN's Reliable Sources to discuss this incident .
KURTZ : Here is what you wrote this week : " Allow me to introduce myself .
I am a traitor and an idiot .
Also , my mother should have aborted me and left me in a dumpster , but since she did n't , I should off myself . "
Now , this is all because some readers did n't like what you had to say about Sarah Palin .
PARKER : Some people were very upset .
Approximately 11,000 so far , and counting .
Yes , I wrote about Sarah Palin stepping down from the ticket .
I felt after her third interview -- I did n't think any of her interviews were very good , but the third was catastrophic -- that she ought to leave the ticket and let McCain try to put somebody else in place to do a better job and help him with maybe the economy .
<>
KURTZ : What about the reaction ?
All those e-mails , all the vitriol directed at you , I mean , that has got to be somewhat depressing .
Are you expected because you are on the conservative side of the spectrum to defend any nominee the Republican Party throws out there ?
PARKER : Apparently .
Apparently so .
KURTZ : And for those who missed the column , you said -- this was after one of her encounters with Katie Couric -- " If Palin were a man , we 'd all be guffawing .
And if B.S. were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself . "
Their posters are as nasty and sleazy on the internet as anybody , but the media likes to create a false narrative about the left so they usually ignore it .
However , Parker is one of their own and this time the Villagers did n't sweep it under the rug .

Have you seen the getting - prettier - all - the - time menus in 2.7 - almost - beta ?
They really are .
Getting prettier all the time , I mean .
Once we drop in the fonts and do a little brushing up of edges and colors , the menu system is going to be smooth .
The last thing we ’ll need to do to is replace the icons we ’ve been using as placeholders .
Currently , the menus are using icons from Crystal Project , which is perfect because they ’re released under LGPL ( yay for open source ! ) , but less perfect in that they do n’t quite fit with the new visual style of 2.7 , so we ’re thinking custom icons .
I ’m always meeting people at WordCamps or via email who say they wish they could give back to WordPress , but that since they are n’t PHP developers , they feel like there is n’t any opportunity for them to be a part of the open source project .
Well , here ’s a golden opportunity .
Want to design the new WordPress icons ?
The icons :
We ’ll need icons for each of the main navigation sections , plus a matching pair of list / excerpt view icons for the table screens like Edit Posts .
That ’s a total of 13 , and for the navigation icons we ’ll also need a larger size for use in the screen headers .
Some of the sections have natural iconography , while others may be more challenging .
The sections are : Dashboard , Posts , Media , Links , Pages , Comments , Appearance , Settings , Users , Plugins , Tools .
The style :
Icons should be subtle , with a classic / designed look , nothing cartoonish .
Thin lines .
Maybe a little old - fashioned looking .
They ’ll be grayscale by default , possibly with a color version for active menu items .
The timing :
Fast , fast , fast .
2.7 is due to release on November 10 .
That means icons need to be ready within two weeks , give or take .
The required experience :
To be taken seriously , you ’ll need to show a background in icon design .
It ’s a different skill than web site or application design , and given that there ’s not much time before the 2.7 launch , someone with experience ( and possibly existing work they can leverage ) is going to be the best candidate .
Interested ?
Send us an email and tell us why you want to design the icons , and include a link to your portfolio .
How we wind up choosing an icon designer will depend on how many people respond , but we ’ll keep you posted on the process .
For now , send in portfolio links by Saturday night , October 25 , 2008 .
We ’ll review them over the weekend and get in touch with people on Monday .
Hopefully we can be designing by early next week .

That ’s inspiration .
That ’s leadership .
That ’s Barack Obama .
In one of the largest crowds ever at a political rally in world history , St. Louis cheered for the man they want to lead them out of the turmoil created by 8 years of Bush rule .
Senator Obama spoke to the crowd , residents of a normally ‘ red ’ state , giving them reason to be both enthused , and concerned about the upcoming election .
This election is the most anticipated since the 1932 , in which America also needed to change economic and foreign policy directions .
It is possible that somewhere between 65 - 70 percent of voters will turn out this general election , which would mark the highest turnout at least since 1960 , if not the highest ever recorded .
With such anticipation , it can be expected that the electorate is emotionally driven by some issues , and the number one issue is the economy .
Senator Obama is seen as the clear leader on economic issues , and coupled with the desire voters have proffered about changing the nature of the presidency , it can be expected that he fits that brand as well .
Senator Obama has voiced his concerns over complacency , and the American voters need to be cognizant of it .
No change can occur in a system without energy added , and we , as voters , have that unique ability to add energy into the system .
We can change the momentum of a nation careening towards catastrophe , and correct its trajectory .
We can inject energy into a stagnant nation and cause movement once again .
We can change the future with a simple vote .
But we must add that energy to make anything happen .
Nothing happens without our input .
Vote on November 4 , or be complacent in the current trajectory of our nation .
Is Google Making Us Smarter ?
It depends on how you use the web , and how you define “ smarter . ”
The internet was abuzz this summer over Nicholas Carr ‘s eloquent argument in The Atlantic that the internet is eroding our ability to read long and complex texts ( if you agree , but ca n’t make it through to the end of his 4,200 - word essay , chalk it up to confirmation bias ) .
Now , a new study finds that skilled , thoughtful web surfing can actually build cognitive skills and may delay the onset of dementia in older users .
The findings of the study , by U.C.L.A. memory specialist Gary Small , do not necessarily refute Carr ’s argument .
Small ’s team found that experienced web users experience increased stimulation in the regions of their brains that handle complex reasoning and decision making .
The activity was more widespread than when the same subjects were reading a book , or when inexperienced web users surfed the internet .
In other words , being able to tease out useful information from all the chaff on the internet can be as intellectually demanding a task as completing a crossword puzzle .
But is puzzle solving the same kind of “ smartness ” as the “ smartness ” that comes from reading a book ?
By Eugene Robinson - October 14 , 2008
WASHINGTON -- Since George W. Bush became president , the Republican Party has presided over massive , out - of - control government spending , converted a federal budget surplus into a half - trillion - dollar deficit , and looked the other way while Wall Street 's greed and stupidity turned the hallowed free market into scorched earth .
Now the party has to watch as a Republican president orchestrates the biggest government intervention into the workings of the private sector since the New Deal .
Can any Republican candidate claim with a straight face to represent the party of small government ?
For that matter , can any Republican candidate plausibly explain what the party is supposed to stand for these days ?
It 's pathetic to hear right - wing talk radio blowhards try to associate Barack Obama with " radical " or " socialist " views when a Republican administration is tossing aside " Atlas Shrugged " and speed - reading " Das Kapital . "
The Federal Reserve even announced Monday that it will make unlimited quantities of dollars available for currency swaps with the Bank of England , the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank , as these institutions scramble to keep major commercial banks from failing -- and potentially taking U.S. banks with them .
None of Bush 's Cabinet members could be heard sniffing about the effete irrelevance of " Old Europe . "
This attitude adjustment is necessary , mind you .
The question is n't whether some kind of drastic , frankly socialistic measures are needed to save the American economy , but which ones -- buying up toxic mortgage - based investments ( as the White House said it would do ) , buying up the troubled mortgages themselves ( as John McCain wants to do ) , or pouring money into selected banks and taking part ownership ( as the White House now says it will do ) .
Sitting back and letting the dire situation correct itself is not an option , because the market 's phoenix - like solution begins with self - immolation .
Politically , though , there is at least some justice in the fact that a Republican president has to deal with this Republican - made crisis .
That little piece of irony is n't worth $ 700 billion , but so far it 's all we 're getting .
After eight years of the Bush administration , the Republican Party -- to put it bluntly -- is a mess and a fraud .
There is an intellectual case to be made for the economic philosophy that the party purports to represent .
I disagree with it strongly , but I respect its integrity -- in a way that this administration and the Republican leadership in Congress clearly did not .
The Republican Party said it believed in free and unfettered competition , but it picked winners and losers through a system of crony capitalism .
All it takes to make my point is a name : Jack Abramoff .
The Bush tax cuts , which heavily favored the wealthy , showed that the president and his allies in Congress did n't believe in progressive taxation .
I think that 's outrageous , but the administration goes further and actually seems to prefer a regressive tax scheme .
That 's the only explanation I can think of for why hedge fund managers making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay taxes at a lower rate than their chauffeurs .
Now that it 's election time , the party -- as usual -- is trying to convince Americans that it stands on the side of the little guy .
Sarah Palin has been trotted out to convince everyone that the party cares deeply about the eternal roster of cultural issues -- God , guns , gays , abortion , etc .
If McCain and Palin were elected , the party would doubtless return these issues to the storage locker until the next election , at which point they would be dusted off once more .
Oh , and is n't the Republican Party supposed to stand foursquare against intrusions on privacy ?
Then why were Republicans so unmoved when it was revealed that the Bush administration had been conducting unprecedented surveillance of Americans ' private electronic communications ?
When Ronald Reagan was president , I had a sense of what ideas and principles his party stood for .
When Newt Gingrich and his " Contract with America " brigade took Washington by storm in 1994 , I knew what they believed -- loopy though it was -- and what they hoped to accomplish .
I defy anyone to give a coherent explanation of what today 's Republican Party , under George Bush and now John McCain , wants to do except perpetuate itself in power .
When a political party reaches the point of lurching incoherence , the most effective cure is a good , long spell in the wilderness .
Americans should help Republicans out by sending them home to get their act together .
Elsewhere on RCP : The Latest News on Energy
Amid the hits to families ' budgets lately , many people are taking an added blow to something they value almost as much : Control over their time .
Although most people are feeling too much pain in the pocketbook to talk about it , the economic downturn is forcing many to defer dreams of striking a better work - life balance .
As past recessions have shown , downturns tend to quash such luxuries as cutting back to part - time work hours by choice , dropping out voluntarily for a while to stay home with the kids , or taking a sabbatical ....
I am not the first , nor the only one , to believe a superorganism is emerging from the cloak of wires , radio waves , and electronic nodes wrapping the surface of our planet .
No one can dispute the scale or reality of this vast connectivity .
What ’s uncertain is , what is it ?
Is this global web of computers , servers and trunk lines a mere mechanical circuit , a very large tool , or does it reach a threshold where something , well , different happens ?
So far the proposition that a global superorganism is forming along the internet power lines has been treated as a lyrical metaphor at best , and as a mystical illusion at worst .
I ’ve decided to treat the idea of a global superorganism seriously , and to see if I could muster a falsifiable claim and evidence for its emergence .
My hypothesis is this :
The rapidly increasing sum of all computational devices in the world connected online , including wirelessly , forms a superorganism of computation with its own emergent behaviors .
Superorganisms are a different type of organism .
Large things are made from smaller things .
Big machines are made from small parts , and visible living organisms from invisible cells .
But these parts do n’t usually stand on their own .
In a slightly fractal recursion , the parts of a superorganism lead fairly autonomous existences on their own .
A superorganism such as an insect or mole rat colony contains many sub-individuals .
These individual organisms eat , move about , get things done on their own .
From most perspectives they appear complete .
But in the case of the social insects and the naked mole rat these autonomous sub individuals need the super colony to reproduce themselves .
In this way reproduction is a phenomenon that occurs at the level of the superorganism .
I define the One Machine as the emerging superorganism of computers .
It is a megasupercomputer composed of billions of sub computers .
The sub computers can compute individually on their own , and from most perspectives these units are distinct complete pieces of gear .
But there is an emerging smartness in their collective that is smarter than any individual computer .
We could say learning ( or smartness ) occurs at the level of the superorganism .
Supercomputers built from subcomputers were invented 50 years ago .
Back then clusters of tightly integrated specialized computer chips in close proximity were designed to work on one kind of task , such as simulations .
This was known as cluster computing .
In recent years , we ’ve created supercomputers composed of loosely integrated individual computers not centralized in one building , but geographically distributed over continents and designed to be versatile and general purpose .
This later supercomputer is called grid computing because the computation is served up as a utility to be delivered anywhere on the grid , like electricity .
It is also called cloud computing because the tally of the exact component machines is dynamic and amorphous – like a cloud .
The actual contours of the grid or cloud can change by the minute as machines come on or off line .
There are many cloud computers at this time .
Amazon is credited with building one of the first commercial cloud computers .
Google probably has the largest cloud computer in operation .
According to Jeff Dean one of their infrastructure engineers , Google is hoping to scale up their cloud computer to encompass 10 million processors in 1,000 locations .
Each of these processors is an off - the - shelf PC chip that is nearly identical to the ones that power your laptop .
A few years ago computer scientists realized that it did not pay to make specialized chips for a supercomputer .
It was far more cost effective to just gang up rows and rows of cheap generic personal computer chips , and route around them when they fail .
The data centers for cloud computers are now filled with racks and racks of the most mass - produced chips on the planet .
An unexpected bonus of this strategy is that their high production volume means bugs are minimized and so the generic chips are more reliable than any custom chip they could have designed .
If the cloud is a vast array of personal computer processors , then why not add your own laptop or desktop computer to it ?
It in a certain way it already is .
Whenever you are online , whenever you click on a link , or create a link , your processor is participating in the yet larger cloud , the cloud of all computer chips online .
I call this cloud the One Machine because in many ways it acts as one supermegacomputer .
The majority of the content of the web is created within this one virtual computer .
Links are programmed , clicks are chosen , files are moved and code is installed from the dispersed , extended cloud created by consumers and enterprise – the tons of smart phones , Macbooks , Blackberries , and workstations we work in front of .
While the business of moving bits and storing their history all happens deep in the tombs of server farms , the cloud ’s interaction with the real world takes place in the extremely distributed field of laptop , hand - held and desktop devices .
Unlike servers these outer devices have output screens , and eyes , skin , ears in the form of cameras , touch pads , and microphones .
We might say the cloud is embodied primarily by these computer chips in parts only loosely joined to grid .
This megasupercomputer is the Cloud of all clouds , the largest possible inclusion of communicating chips .
It is a vast machine of extraordinary dimensions .
It is comprised of quadrillion chips , and consumes 5 % of the planet ’s electricity .
It is not owned by any one corporation or nation ( yet ) , nor is it really governed by humans at all .
Several corporations run the larger sub clouds , and one of them , Google , dominates the user interface to the One Machine at the moment .
None of this is controversial .
Seen from an abstract level there surely must be a very large collective virtual machine .
But that is not what most people think of when they hear the term a “ global superorganism . ”
That phrase suggests the sustained integrity of a living organism , or a defensible and defended boundary , or maybe a sense of self , or even conscious intelligence .
Sadly , there is no ironclad definition for some of the terms we most care about , such as life , mind , intelligence and consciousness .
Each of these terms has a long list of traits often but not always associated with them .
Whenever these traits are cast into a qualifying definition , we can easily find troublesome exceptions .
For instance , if reproduction is needed for the definition of life , what about mules , which are sterile ?
Mules are obviously alive .
Intelligence is a notoriously slippery threshold , and consciousness more so .
The logical answer is that all these phenomenon are continuums .
Some things are smarter , more alive , or less conscious than others .
The thresholds for life , intelligence , and consciousness are gradients , rather than off - on binary .
With that perspective a useful way to tackle the question of whether a planetary superorganism is emerging is to offer a gradient of four assertions .
There exists on this planet :
I A manufactured superorganism
II An autonomous superorganism
III An autonomous smart superorganism
IV An autonomous conscious superorganism
These four could be thought of as an escalating set of definitions .
At the bottom we start with the almost trivial observation that we have constructed a globally distributed cluster of machines that can exhibit large - scale behavior .
Call this the weak form of the claim .
Next come the two intermediate levels , which are uncertain and vexing ( and therefore probably the most productive to explore ) .
Then we end up at the top with the extreme assertion of “ Oh my God , it ’s thinking ! ”
That ’s the strong form of the superorganism .
Very few people would deny the weak claim and very few affirm the strong .
My claim is that in addition to these four strengths of definitions , the four levels are developmental stages through which the One Machine progresses .
It starts out forming a plain superorganism , than becomes autonomous , then smart , then conscious .
The phases are soft , feathered , and blurred .
My hunch is that the One Machine has advanced through levels I and II in the past decades and is presently entering level III .
If that is true we should find initial evidence of an autonomous smart ( but not conscious ) computational superorganism operating today .
But let ’s start at the beginning .
LEVEL I
A manufactured superorganism
By definition , organisms and superorganisms have boundaries .
An outside and inside .
The boundary of the One Machine is clear : if a device is on the internet , it is inside .
“ On ” means it is communicating with the other inside parts .
Even though some components are “ on ” in terms of consuming power , they may be on ( communicating ) for only brief periods .
Your laptop may be useful to you on a 5 - hour plane ride , but it may be technically “ on ” the One Machine only when you land and it finds a wifi connection .
An unconnected TV is not part of the superorganism ; a connected TV is .
Most of the time the embedded chip in your car is off the grid , but on the few occasions when its contents are downloaded for diagnostic purposes , it becomes part of the greater cloud .
The dimensions of this network are measurable and finite , although variable .
The One Machine consumes electricity to produce structured information .
Like other organisms , it is growing .
Its size is increasing rapidly , close to 66 % per year , which is basically the rate of Moore ’s Law .
Every year it consumes more power , more material , more money , more information , and more of our attention .
And each year it produces more structured information , more wealth , and more interest .
On average the cells of biological organisms have a resting metabolism rate of between 1 - 10 watts per kilogram .
Based on research by Jonathan Koomey a UC Berkeley , the most efficient common data servers in 2005 ( by IBM and Sun ) have a metabolism rate of 11 watts per kilogram .
Currently the other parts of the Machine ( the electric grid itself , the telephone system ) may not be as efficient , but I have n’t found any data on it yet .
Energy efficiency is a huge issue for engineers .
As the size of the One Machine scales up the metabolism rate for the whole will probably drop ( although the total amount of energy consumed rises ) .
The span of the Machine is roughly the size of the surface of the earth .
Some portion of it floats a few hundred miles above in orbit , but at the scale of the planet , satellites , cell towers and servers farms form the same thin layer .
Activity in one part can be sensed across the entire organism ; it forms a unified whole .
Within a hive honeybees are incapable of thermoregulation .
The hive superorganism must regulate the bee ’s working temperature .
It does this by collectively fanning thousands of tiny bee wings , which moves hot air out of the colony .
Individual computers are incapable of governing the flow of bits between themselves in the One Machine .
Prediction : the One Machine will continue to grow .
We should see how data flows around this whole machine in response to daily usage patterns ( see Follow the Moon ) .
The metabolism rate of the whole should approach that of a living organism .
LEVEL II
An autonomous superorganism
Autonomy is a problematic concept .
There are many who believe that no non-living entity can truly be said to be autonomous .
We have plenty of examples of partial autonomy in created things .
Autonomous airplane drones : they steer themselves , but they do n’t repair themselves .
We have self - repairing networks that do n’t reproduce themselves .
We have self - reproducing computer viruses , but they do n’t have a metabolism .
All these inventions require human help for at least aspect of their survival .
To date we have not conjured up a fully human - free sustainable synthetic artifact of any type .
But autonomy too is a continuum .
Partial autonomy is often all we need – or want .
We ’ll be happy with miniature autonomous cleaning bots that requires our help , and approval , to reproduce .
A global superorganism does n’t need to be fully human - free for us to sense its autonomy .
We would acknowledge a degree of autonomy if an entity displayed any of these traits : self - repair , self - defense , self - maintenance ( securing energy , disposing waste ) , self - control of goals , self - improvement .
The common element in all these characteristics is of course the emergence of a self at the level of the superorganism .
In the case of the One Machine we should look for evidence of self - governance at the level of the greater cloud rather than at the component chip level .
A very common cloud - level phenomenon is a DDoS attack .
In a Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attack a vast hidden network of computers under the control of a master computer are awakened from their ordinary tasks and secretly assigned to “ ping ” ( call ) a particular target computer in mass in order to overwhelm it and take it offline .
Some of these networks ( called bot nets ) may reach a million unsuspecting computers , so the effect of this distributed attack is quite substantial .
From the individual level it is hard to detect the net , to pin down its command , and to stop it .
DDoS attacks are so massive that they can disrupt traffic flows outside of the targeted routers – a consequence we might expect from an superorganism level event .
I do n’t think we can make too much of it yet , but researchers such as Reginald Smith have noticed there was a profound change in the nature of traffic on the communications network in the last few decades as it shifted from chiefly voice to a mixture of data , voice , and everything else .
Voice traffic during the Bell / AT&T era obeyed a pattern known as Poisson distribution , sort of like a Gaussian bell curve .
But ever since data from diverse components and web pages became the majority of bits on the lines , the traffic on the internet has been following a scale - invariant , or fractal , or power - law pattern .
Here the distribution of very large and very small packets fall out onto a curve familiarly recognized as the long - tail curve .
The scale - invariant , or long tail traffic patterns of the recent internet has meant engineers needed to devise a whole set of new algorithms for shaping the teletraffic .
This phase change toward scale - invariant traffic patterns may be evidence for an elevated degree of autonomy .
Other researchers have detected sensitivity to initial conditions , “ strange attractor ” patterns and stable periodic orbits in the self - similar nature of traffic – all indications of self - governing systems .
Scale - free distributions can be understood as a result of internal feedback , usually brought about by loose interdependence between the units .
Feedback loops constrain the actions of the bits by other bits .
For instance the Ethernet collision detection management algorithm ( CSMA / CD ) employs feedback loops to manage congestion by backing off collisions in response to other traffic .
The foundational TCP / IP system underpinning internet traffic therefore “ behaves in part as a massive closed loop feedback system . ”
While the scale free pattern of internet traffic is indisputable and verified by many studies , there is dispute whether it means the system itself is tending to optimize traffic efficiency – but some believe it is .
Unsurprisingly the vast flows of bits in the global internet exhibit periodic rhythms .
Most of these are diurnal , and resemble a heartbeat .
But perturbations of internet bit flows caused by massive traffic congestion can also be seen .
Analysis of these “ abnormal ” events show great similarity to abnormal heart beats .
They deviate from an “ at rest ” rhythms the same way that fluctuations of a diseased heart deviated from a healthy heart beat .
Prediction : The One Machine has a low order of autonomy at present .
If the superorganism hypothesis is correct in the next decade we should detect increased scale - invariant phenomenon , more cases of stabilizing feedback loops , and a more autonomous traffic management system .
LEVEL III
An autonomous smart superorganism
Organisms can be smart without being conscious .
A rat is smart , but we presume , without much self - awareness .
If the One Machine was as unconsciously smart as a rat , we would expect it to follow the strategies a clever animal would pursue .
It would seek sources of energy , it would gather as many other resources it could find , maybe even hoard them .
It would look for safe , secure shelter .
It would steal anything it needed to grow .
It would fend off attempts to kill it .
It would resist parasites , but not bother to eliminate them if they caused no mortal harm .
It would learn and get smarter over time .
Google and Amazon , two clouds of distributed computers , are getting smarter .
Google has learned to spell .
By watching the patterns of correct - spelling humans online it has become a good enough speller that it now corrects bad - spelling humans .
Google is learning dozens of languages , and is constantly getting better at translating from one language to another .
It is learning how to perceive the objects in a photo .
And of course it is constantly getting better at answering everyday questions .
In much the same manner Amazon has learned to use the collective behavior of humans to anticipate their reading and buying habits .
It is far smarter than a rat in this department .
Cloud computers such as Google and Amazon form the learning center for the smart superorganism .
Let ’s call this organ el Googazon , or el Goog for short .
El Goog encompasses more than the functions the company Google and includes all the functions provided by Yahoo , Amazon , Microsoft online and other cloud - based services .
This loosely defined cloud behaves like an animal .
El Goog seeks sources of energy .
It is building power plants around the world at strategic points of cheap energy .
It is using its own smart web to find yet cheaper energy places and to plan future power plants .
El Goog is sucking in the smartest humans on earth to work for it , to help make it smarter .
The smarter it gets , the more smart people , and smarter people , want to work for it .
El Goog ropes in money .
Money is its higher metabolism .
It takes the money of investors to create technology which attracts human attention ( ads ) , which in turns creates more money ( profits ) , which attracts more investments .
The smarter it makes itself , the more attention and money will flow to it .
Manufactured intelligence is a new commodity in the world .
Until now all useable intelligence came in the package of humans – and all their troubles .
El Goog and the One Machine offer intelligence without human troubles .
In the beginning this intelligence is transhuman rather than non-human intelligence .
It is the smartness derived from the wisdom of human crowds , but as it continues to develop this smartness transcends a human type of thinking .
Humans will eagerly pay for El Goog intelligence .
It is a different kind of intelligence .
It is not artificial – i.e. a mechanical — because it is extracted from billions of humans working within the One Machine .
It is a hybrid intelligence , half humanity , half computer chip .
Therefore it is probably more useful to us .
We do n’t know what the limits are to its value .
How much would you pay for a portable genius who knew all there was known ?
With the snowballing wealth from this fiercely desirable intelligence , el Goog builds a robust network that can not be unplugged .
It uses its distributed intelligence to devise more efficient energy technologies , more wealth producing inventions , and more favorable human laws for its continued prosperity .
El Goog is developing an immune system to restrict the damage from viruses , worms and bot storms to the edges of its perimeter .
These parasites plague humans but they wo n’t affect el Goog ’s core functions .
While El Goog is constantly seeking chips to occupy , energy to burn , wires to fill , radio waves to ride , what it wants and needs most is money .
So one test of its success is when El Goog becomes our bank .
Not only will all data flow through it , but all money as well .
This New York Times chart of the October 2008 financial market crash shows how global markets were synchronized , as if they were one organism responding to a signal .
How far away is this ?
“ Closer than you think ” say the actual CEOs of Google , the company .
I like the way George Dyson puts it :
If you build a machine that makes connections between everything , accumulates all the data in the world , and you then harness all available minds to collectively teach it where the meaningful connections and meaningful data are ( Who is searching Whom ? ) while implementing deceptively simple algorithms that reinforce meaningful connections while physically moving , optimizing and replicating the data structures accordingly – if you do all this you will , from highly economical ( yes , profitable ) position arrive at a result – an intelligence — that is “ not as far off as people think . ”
To accomplish all this el Goog need not be conscious , just smart .
Prediction :
The mega - cloud will learn more languages , answer more of our questions , anticipate more of our actions , process more of our money , create more wealth , and become harder to turn off .
LEVEL IV
An autonomous conscious superorganism
How would we know if there was an autonomous conscious superorganism ?
We would need a Turing Test for a global AI .
But the Turing Test is flawed for this search because it is meant to detect human - like intelligence , and if a consciousness emerged at the scale of a global megacomputer , its intelligence would unlikely to be anything human - like .
We might need to turn to SETI , the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( ETI ) , for guidance .
By definition , it is a test for non-human intelligence .
We would have to turn the search from the stars to our own planet , from an ETI , to an ii – an internet intelligence .
I call this proposed systematic program Sii , the Search for Internet Intelligence .
This search assumes the intelligence we are looking for is not human - like .
It may operate at frequencies alien to our minds .
Remember the tree-ish Ents in Lord of the Rings ?
It took them hours just to say hello .
Or the gas cloud intelligence in Fred Hoyle ’s “ The Black Cloud ” .
A global conscious superorganism might have “ thoughts ” at such a high level , or low frequency , that we might be unable to detect it .
Sii would require a very broad sensitivity to intelligence .
But as Allen Tough , an ETI theorist told me , “ Unfortunately , radio and optical SETI astronomers pay remarkably little attention to intelligence .
Their attention is focused on the search for anomalous radio waves and rapidly pulsed laser signals from outer space .
They do not think much about the intelligence that would produce those signals . ”
The cloud computer a global superorganism swims in is nothing but unnatural waves and non-random signals , so the current set of SETI tools and techniques wo n’t help in a Sii .
For instance , in 2002 researchers analyzed some 300 million packets on the internet to classify their origins .
They were particularly interested in the very small percentage of packets that passed through malformed .
Packets ( the message ’s envelope ) are malformed by either malicious hackers to crash computers or by various bugs in the system .
Turns out some 5 % of all malformed packets examined by the study had unknown origins – neither malicious origins nor bugs .
The researchers shrug these off .
The unreadable packets are simply labeled “ unknown . ”
Maybe they were hatched by hackers with goals unknown to the researches , or by bugs not found .
But a malformed packet could also be an emergent signal .
A self - created packet .
Almost by definition , these will not be tracked , or monitored , and when seen shrugged off as “ unknown . ”
There are scads of science fiction scenarios for the first contact ( awareness ) of an emerging planetary AI .
Allen
Tough suggested two others :
One strategy is to assume that Internet Intelligence might have its own web page in which it explains how it came into being , what it is doing now , and its plans and hopes for the future .
Another strategy is to post an invitation to ii ( just as we have posted an invitation to ETI ) .
Invite it to reveal itself , to dialogue , to join with us in mutually beneficial projects .
It is possible , of course , that Internet Intelligence has made a firm decision not to reveal itself , but it is also possible that it is undecided and our invitation will tip the balance .
The main problem with these “ tests ” for a conscious ii superorganism is that they do n’t seem like the place to begin .
I doubt the first debut act of consciousness is to post its biography , or to respond to an evite .
The course of our own awakening consciousness when we were children is probably more fruitful .
A standard test for self - awareness in a baby or adult primate is to reflect its image back in a mirror .
When it can recognize its mirrored behavior as its own it has a developed sense of self .
What would the equivalent mirror be for an ii ?
But even before passing a mirror test , an intelligent consciousness would acquire a representation of itself , or more accurately a representation of a self .
So one indication of a conscious ii would be the detection of a “ map ” of itself .
Not a centrally located visible chart , but an articulation of its being .
A “ picture ” of itself .
What was inside and what was outside .
It would have to be a real time atlas , probably distributed , of what it was .
Part inventory , part operating manual , part self - portrait , it would act like an internal mirror .
It would pay attention to this map .
One test would be to disturb the internal self - portrait to see if the rest of the organism was disturbed .
It is important to note that there need be no self - awareness of this self map .
It would be like asking a baby to describe itself .
Long before a conscious global AI tries to hide itself , or take over the world , or begin to manipulate the stock market , or blackmail hackers to eliminate any competing ii ’s ( see the science fiction novel “ Daemon ” ) , it will be a fragile baby of a superorganism .
It ’s intelligence and consciousness will only be a glimmer , even if we know how to measure and detect it .
Imagine if we were Martians and did n’t know whether human babies were conscious or not .
How old would they be before we were utterly convinced they were conscious beings ?
Probably long after they were .
Prediction :
The cloud will develop an active and controlling map of itself ( which includes a recursive map in the map ) , and a governing sense of “ otherness . ”
What ’s so important about superorganism ?
We do n’t have very scientific tests for general intelligence in animals or humans .
We have some tests for a few very narrow tasks , but we have no reliable measurements for grades or varieties of intelligence beyond the range of normal IQ tests .
What difference does it make whether we measure a global organism ?
Why bother ?
Measuring the degree of self - organization of the One Machine is important for these reasons :
1 ) The more we are aware of how the big cloud of this Machine behaves , the more useful it will be to us .
If it adapts like an organism , then it is essential to know this .
If it can self - repair , that is vital knowledge .
If it is smart , figuring the precise way it is smart will help us to be smarter .
2 ) In general , a more self - organized machine is more useful .
We can engineer aspects of the machine to be more ready to self - organize .
We can favor improvements that enable self - organization .
We can assist its development by being aware of its growth and opening up possibilities in its development .

We have no clue to the range of possibilities a superorganism this big , made out of a billion small chips , might take , but we know the number of possible forms is more than one .
By being aware early in the process we can shape the kind of self - organization and intelligence a global superorganism could have .
As I said , I am not the first nor only person to consider all this .

The Huffington Post :
So , because there 's a financial crisis , Senator McCain cannot take 90 minutes to address how he will face challenges around the world , including how and when he will send American troops to fight , and possibly die .
Wow .
Troops would sure love that luxury .
Unfortunately , though , insurgents in Iraq do n't stop shooting at us , or setting IEDs , because our Commander in Chief needs a breather to figure out Wall Street .
Al Qaeda in the Afghanistan / Pakistan border region do n't send our troops notes that read , " Hey , I hear you guys are tied up with Wall Street .
Your President needs to concentrate on other things , so we 'll give you a break .
So , to make things easier on you , here 's our coordinates . "
Read on ...
Ouch .
That 's going to leave a mark .
John McCain just choked and Soltz just made him pay for it .
By hittting him on what has always been perceived as his strong suit Jon shows how he once again -- like his abysmal voting record on veterans issues -- is all too eager to put politics before country .
And if he can't handle multiple issues and crises at one time , it is laughable to say that he could ever be the leader of the free world .
Flanked by a vice presidential candidate who is woefully inept , corrupt and unqualified , Senator McCain is proving without a doubt that in the moment of truth , when things get tough , he wo n't hesitate to cut and run on the American people .
Medics discover woman has tennis ball - sized brain tumour during WOMB operation
A woman who visited hospital for a routine operation had her life saved by medics who discovered a tumour in her brain the size of a tennis ball .
Cara Prestidge needed life - saving surgery after doctors found the massive tumour by chance .
Hairdresser Cara had gone to University Hospital , Coventry for the womb operation .
Lucky : Cara Prestridge with neurosurgeon Amar Saxena , bottom right , nurse Ian Edwards and the brain scan showing the huge tumour
But doctors called for a CT scan of her brain after she had problems regaining consciousness .
When the growth was found surgeons informed Cara ’s family and spent nearly four hours removing the killer 10 cm tumour , which turned out to be non-cancerous .
Cara , 36 , said : ‘ I was in the right place at the right time - I ’d suffered from bad headaches for years but just put it down to migraines .
‘ It was just completely unbelievable .
I was on morphine at the time so it took a while to sink in , and I ’m still not sure it has sunk in now .
‘ When I woke up I was convinced I was going to die , it was a real shock .
‘ My family were all devastated at first when they heard what I was going to have done , and felt a bit guilty because I had moaned about headaches for years and they had never taken me seriously .
‘ The hospital was absolutely fantastic .
The nurses , doctors , everyone who helped me I could n’t say a bad word about .
Even the food was good !’
Cara added her family , including husband Chris , 34 , were as shocked as she was when they were told about the gigantic growth which needed immediate medical attention .
She spent a total of 12 days - two days in intensive care and later in neurosurgery ward - recovering from her operation in April .
Cara added : ‘ When I first came around from the anaesthetic and my family were telling me what had happened I thought they were lying .
‘ Then I thought that the tumour had been cancerous and they were lying about that .
The staff say this was probably because of the after affects of the morphine .
I do n’t think it has still sunk in .
‘ I have never seen anyone as relieved as my husband when I woke up .
‘ There ’s always a risk when you do brain surgery , and the whole thing has completely turned our lives around .
‘ It was a real miracle , and it really puts the rest of your life in perspective .
‘ I could ”ve been walking around with this tumour for years and something much more serious could have happened .
‘ I want to thank all nurses and teams that work on the neurology ward and critical care and also nurses on gynaecology ward for their kindness to my family .
Surgeon Amar Saxena , who performed the miraculous three and a half hour procedure , said : ‘ I have no doubt this operation saved her life and I have been very pleasantly surprised by how she has recovered so quickly from a major operation on the brain .
‘ Cara had a meningioma which is a type of tumour that develops from the membrane covering the brain .
‘ While these are not rare it is very unusual for her to have had such a large growth and not have a clue about it .
‘ Normally patients would have symptoms like progressive weakness or numbness or they may present with fits .
‘ It ’s very satisfying for me to have been able to help her . ’

WASHINGTON —
The chief executives of the nine largest banks in the United States trooped into a gilded conference room at the Treasury Department at 3 p.m. Monday .
To their astonishment , they were each handed a one - page document that said they agreed to sell shares to the government , then Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said they must sign it before they left .
The chairman of JPMorgan Chase , Jamie Dimon , was receptive , saying he thought the deal looked pretty good once he ran the numbers through his head .
The chairman of Wells Fargo , Richard M. Kovacevich , protested strongly that , unlike his New York rivals , his bank was not in trouble because of investments in exotic mortgages , and did not need a bailout , according to people briefed on the meeting .
But by 6:30 , all nine chief executives had signed — setting in motion the largest government intervention in the American banking system since the Depression and retreating from the rescue plan Mr. Paulson had fought so hard to get through Congress only two weeks earlier .
What happened during those three and a half hours is a story of high drama and brief conflict , followed by acquiescence by the bankers , who felt they had little choice but to go along with the Treasury plan to inject $ 250 billion of capital into thousands of banks — starting with theirs .
Based on a 28 day cycle for your period you would have been most fertile between Sunday , June 8 , 2008 to Friday , June 13 , 2008 .
But you need to have sex no more then 5 days before your exact ovulation date to get pregnant ( Sperm can only live up to 5 day 's in a woman 's uterus ) .
You ovulation date would have been June 11th or 12th because an unfertilized egg can only survive 24 hours after leaving you ovary so ovulation dates are usually the day before your last fertile day .
And being that you had sex with Elijah exactly 5 day 's before your expected ovulation date , Jacob more then likely is not the father and Elijah would be .
I hope everything turns out ok and you wont be able to say for sure until a paternity test is done but the odds are pointing in favor of Elijah being your baby 's father .
Good Luck hun and do n't stress to much it 's not good for you or your lil one
America 's Financial Apocalypse Economists Need to Sit Down and Shut Up
I 'm really sick and tired of these economists out there who continue to claim that America will not enter a depression .
These are the same bozos that have yet to acknowledge the fact that the U.S. is in a recession and has been for several months now .
In fact , as I have previously mentioned , I can make a very strong case that the U.S. has been in the early stages of a silent , modest depression for at least two years ; at the very least a protracted recession masked by credit .
After the appropriate adjustments have been made for GDP , the U.S. economy has had no more than 3 to 4 quarters of GDP growth since 2005 .
Thus far , we have seen drastic emergency interventions by the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury – measures not taken since the Great Depression .
Thus far , we have seen the failure of the sixth largest U.S. bank – Washington Mutual , representing the largest bank failure in U.S. history .
As I have alluded to for several months now , this is just the beginning .
Thus far , we have seen many of the world 's strongest , most successful financial institutions file for bankruptcy or participate in a forced buyout to avoid further crisis .
Many of these buyouts have been prearranged behind closed doors with the Federal Reserve , the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC .
Bank of America , Merrill Bailout Disguised as Buyout ?
Wall Street powerhouses such as Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , and Merrill Lynch were global icons of banking power and prestige .
They survived everything …even the last Great Depression .
But they were unable to survive this one .
The other Wall Street firms , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have only been able to survive thus far due to conversion into commercial banks so they can share complete access to the Fed 's endless printing presses along with the rest of the banking cartel .
I have explained what the media , pundits and other “ experts ” have failed to for several months now .
Here is an excerpt from my July 13 , 2008 commentary of the IndyMac failure :
In the coming months , I expect to see several bank failures .
Not Citigroup or Bank of America .
The “ Big 5 ” wo n't fail because the Fed would never permit it .
You know the Fed – the entity that 's owned and operated by the “ Big 5 . ”
It will be the small local and medium regional banks that fail
By the time the washout is finished we could see several hundred take a fall .
If we include those destined for the auction block , I can almost guarantee you there will be hundreds of failures .
When the smaller banks fail , the “ Big 5 ” will snatch them up at pennies on the dollar compliments of Bernanke 's printing presses .
Maybe now you can see why every nation wants to get as far away from the dollar as possible .
They understand the worst is yet to come .
Bernanke 's “ Big 5 ” banking bailout is only ensuring the dollar crisis will continue .
However , no nation will be able to completely escape the effects of the falling dollar since it remains the universal currency .
It is deeply embedded within global commerce and has extensive reach throughout the global financial system . - Farewell Indymac , What 's Next ?
Say Hello to the 1970s Inflation Rate ( Part2 )
I 'm going to do something I 've rarely done in the past two years , but something economists do on a weekly basis – revise a forecast .
Instead of the 500 to 600 bank failures I have previously predicted , I 'd like to revise that figure to 1,200 to 1,500 over the next five years .
This revision is based upon what I anticipate as continued premature seizures by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC .
I 'm sure by now you know who will pick up the pieces … that 's right , the banking cartel .
And they will do it using taxpayer dollars .
Thus far , we have seen emergency lending by the Fed and U.S. Treasury to both commercial and investment banks ; something not seen since the last depression .
And now Washington plans to make direct loans to business …once again , something not seen since the last depression .
Even the nation 's largest mortgage company , Fannie Mae - created to help the housing crisis during the Great Depression - has failed , as did its younger brother Freddie Mac , formed a few decades later .
And taxpayers have been the unwilling recipients of billions of dollars in junk bonds from these two giants , while millions have lost their homes due to fraud , which wo n't ever be dealt with appropriately .
Now Washington has forced an irresponsible bailout of the entire banking system down the throat of taxpayers .
While this bailout will do very little than mend a short - term credit freeze , it will enrich those who wrecked havoc on the global economy .
Even the FDIC , created as part of the Glass Steagal Act of 1934 has been granted unlimited access to the Fed 's printing presses in order to survive .
Yet , these bozo economists still want you to think we have not entered a depression .
Ladies and gentlemen , America 's next Great Depression has commenced .
This is not something I an anxious to proclaim , but it is the unfortunate reality .
And apparently , most Americans are beginning to see through the web of deceit that Washington and the media has spent so much effort to create .
http://money.cnn.com/...
Those of you who understand what is going on should protest when you hear these economic shills rattle off their propaganda .
We have no need for this “ dog- and - pony ” show any longer .
We 've had our fill from Washington for eight years now .
Americans have had enough of this nonsense .
And for those who were entrusted with positions of authority to not have seen this coming and / or who failed to respond in a timely manner – Alan Greenspan , banking CEOs , and others – should be sent directly to jail .
For all of you economists who still do n't get it , I have provided some excerpts from a previous publication .
Fooling You with Simpleton Arguments
The pundits and economists continue to make simpleton arguments , such as the current conditions are no way like the depression .
They claim that the government made many changes that would prevent the same thing from happening again .
They claim that depressions cause deflation .
Sure .
But that does not mean inflation cannot be the lead into a depression .
If things are so different now , why is the US approaching the price declines in real estate seen during the depression ?
If things are so different now , why has the Fed had to resort to measures not seen since the depression ?
If things are so different now , why did the New Deal solution to the depression era real estate crisis ( Fannie Mae ) collapse ?
All of you guys in denial really need to get with the program .
The Next Great Depression
No we wo n't see 33 % unemployment like in the depression .
Why ?
Well for starters , Washington fudges all of the data .
I have discussed this in detail in the past .
As well , the bar for what are considered jobs has been lowered since the depression .
Today , you can say you 're employed if you 're a part - timer , you work at McDonalds , you 're a valet or massage therapist ( no disrespect to any of you who might be employed in these occupations but let 's face it , they do n't give you a pension plan or healthcare benefits ) .
Instead of massive unemployment , we will see significant unemployment combined with massive underemployment .
Already , my estimates are that the real unemployment rate is approaching 9 % while the underemployment rate is 20 to 25 % .
Over the next few years , the underemployment rate will continue to increase and could top 50 % .
As well , we wo n't see banks close their doors because we have the FDIC .
Sure , it will run out of reserves most likely within the next 2 years , but that does n't matter because the Fed will just print more money , causing higher inflation .
All of this will put further downward pressure on living standards .
The devastation wo n't be due to a crisis , it will be only heightened by a crisis .
The real devastation will be due to the transfer of wealth and jobs overseas .
It will be a silent depression .
The Silent Depression
In a few years , the real estate and banking crisis will have cooled off and Washington will start reporting much improved numbers ; numbers that will continue to be manipulated .
In reality , things will only get worse .
Real wages wo n't budge , inflation for basic necessities will remain high and most likely be higher , and job quality will continue to decline .
It will be a silent depression because there will be no crisis .
You wo n't feel the full effects on any given day .
If you 're in the lucky majority , you will go to work and carry out your life as usual .
But you just wo n't be able to make ends meet like in the past .
Each year things will get worse so you 'll spend more on credit .
It will be more difficult for your children to raise their income status because higher education is becoming an unaffordable luxury for the wealthy .
Millions will be stuck in slave labor , working for low wages and no benefits .
And they wo n't be working in factories churning out goods for the global economy .
They will be working in service jobs , tailoring to the needs of America 's wealthy .
And when you retire , only then will you realize that you 've lived through a depression because you will run out of money .
If you are lucky enough to have a home , you might have to end up selling it to pay for your medical bills , even if you have health insurance .
The smaller minority will have a much worse fate .
What the “ experts ” do n't get is that this will be a depression that will be much more difficult to reverse because it will be gradual .
There will be no urgency .
Many will wake up one day in a few years and realize that they just can't make ends meet ; they 'll have very little if any retirement assets .
It will be a continuation of declining living standards to a point that could lead to some major societal problems . -
The Bailout Plain Truth and the Silent Economic Depression
Make no mistake .
There are a few economists who understand what is going on .
But the media chooses to interview only those who remain clueless and offer the same denial speeches over and over .
The vast majority of the nation 's economists remain largely isolated from the real world and stick to the same status quo ideals that support Washington 's bogus economic data .
It 's like a Boy 's Club .
And they adhere to the rules of conduct or face the threat of being ostracized by their peers .
These are the same economists who have praised Greenspan and Bernanke 's monetary policies and rogue attempts to destroy the dollar while bailing out the banking system , with a total of over $ 5 trillion – yes that 's right I said trillion - handed out to the banking system in less than a year .
If you do the math you will see this number is correct .
The scary thing is that this printing frenzy has done nothing but worsen the crisis .
When it 's all said and done , the disastrous responses by the Fed and U.S.
Treasury are likely to have cost taxpayers much more .
Counting the losses to the stock market , housing market , banks and corporate defaults , as well as the lost jobs , the main villains of this historic crisis - Alan Greenspan , Wall Street and members of Washington who fought for banking deregulation will result in total losses in excess of $ 22 trillion for America alone ( another revision ) .
Already the losses have surpassed $ 13 trillion .
For those economists out there who remain in denial , I challenge you to come forward for to debate me on the realities of the economy and capital markets as well as the solutions .
I prefer to call it an educational seminar .
If you chose to accept this invitation , hopefully it will have a very large audience so that I can demonstrate to the crowd that you people are generally useless and often dangerous .
In fact , I would like to challenge all other “ experts ” who disagree with my insights and solutions .
This includes all of the clowns on television and radio .
I can assure you there is not one person – not an economist , politician , Wall Street executive , pundit , or other self - proclaimed expert out there of sound mind and body who would agree to debate me on these issues .
Once they come to realize the strength behind my insights they will run like cowards .
I 'd like to encourage all readers to forward this challenge to your economics professors or favorite media personality – from the clowns on CNBC and FOX , to the government shills and financial industry hired hacks on radio .
I have proven to be one of the leading experts on the U.S. economy and capital markets .
That fact , combined with my lack of celebrity status is precisely the reason why the media has shunned me .
They are afraid of my straight - talk commentaries and solutions .
They fear that my remarks and criticisms would derail their political agendas and upset their corporate sponsors .
And because I do n't have the celebrity status of Warren Buffett or Jim Rogers , the media stands to lose from my cold hard truth .
They 'll let Rogers talk about the realities of this mess despite the fact that he might upset some of their sponsors because having him on air will draw a big crowd , and rightly so .
That , my friends , is the way the media operates in America .
That 's why you continue to see Jim Cramer get on national television and claim that he “ called the crisis ” last year when the facts clearly show he missed everything and has been way behind the curve like the rest of the television and radio clowns .
You see , Cramer and others have been made into financial celebrities , so they draw an audience regardless how wrong they 've been .
And for that , YOU are to blame because YOU continue to watch them .
Only recently have these media clowns changed faces , hoping you will be fooled into thinking that they actually warned you ahead of time .
But the facts speak the truth and they all missed it .
The only thing that counts is a person 's track record – something the media ignores .
The next time you hear an economist ramble away the realities of the economy , I hope you will do as I plan and tell them to sit down and shut up .
The same applies to the goofballs on television and radio , especially CNBC .
The American people are sick and tired of the same clowns feeding us with the same bull .
Americans need intellectual leaders with practical experience and excellent track records who are capable of providing guidance and viable solutions .
We do not have time for liars , shills and idiots .

John McCain has mocked Democrat Barack Obama all week as so cocky that he is already “ measuring the drapes ” in the White House Oval Office .
The Republican 's audience usually boos on cue .
On Saturday , McCain found new ammunition ( see video by clicking on the Read more line below ) in a newspaper story on White House transition planning that every presidential campaign begins by now ( inlcuding the Republican's ) .
Campaigns , however , are usually careful to keep such planning behind - the - scenes to avoid inconvenient accusations of being presumptuous or over - confident .
Today 's erroneous New York Times story said that part of Obama 's transition team , John Podesta , who was President Bill Clinton 's fourth chief of staff and now is an Obama advisor , already has drafted a sample inaugural address for the Democrat .
Obama aides quickly pointed out that Podesta wrote the speech even more prematurely -- when he was still working for rival Hillary Clinton 's doomed campaign -- and published his offering in a book last summer .
A statement posted on the website of Podesta 's think - tank ....
There ’s been some turmoil in the world of ECMAScript .
While many are – even , at least , vaguely – familiar with the development of ECMAScript 4 the devil is in the details .
I ’ve blogged about ES4 extensively in the past – and even did a speaking tour last fall educating developers about its details and implementations , however , a lot has happened since that time .
The ECMAScript 4 specification development was very ad - hoc in nature ( primarily tackled by Adobe , Mozilla , Opera , and Google ) : Implementors agreed upon a set of features that they wished to implement and a specification was molded out of the remaining consensus .
Building a specification tailored by implementation is a very pragmatic means of reaching a reasonable result .
However there was a fundamental split related to how much of the specification should be implemented .
Enter ECMAScript 3.1 .
This working group ( lead by Microsoft and Yahoo ) set out to implement some minor changes and bug fixes to ECMAScript 3 while remaining as a subset of full ECMAScript 4 functionality .
These two groups continued to work side - by - side but a struggle was inevitable .
The ECMAScript 3.1 group wanted to add changes to the language that would affect the result of ECMAScript 4 .
This struggle over the past year finally came to a head this past month at the meeting of TC39 ( the committee responsible for both ECMAScript 4 and ECMAScript 3.1 ) .
Dubbed “ the Oslo meeting ” this discussion between the two groups saw an ultimate conclusion :
The two efforts had to be merged , otherwise neither one would succeed .
The result was a set of concessions and a re-focus on simplicity and pragmatic language additions .
Brendan Eich detailed the result in a lengthy email to the ECMAScript 3.1 and ECMAScript 4 lists .
The important part is the new set of goals for this , now dubbed , ECMAScript Harmony project :
Focus work on ECMAScript 3.1 with full collaboration of all parties , and target two interoperable implementations by early next year .
Collaborate on the next step beyond ECMAScript 3.1 , which will include syntactic extensions but which will be more modest than ECMAScript 4 in both semantic and syntactic innovation .
Some ECMAScript 4 proposals have been deemed unsound for the Web , and are off the table for good : packages , namespaces and early binding .
This conclusion is key to Harmony .
Other goals and ideas from ECMAScript 4 are being rephrased to keep consensus in the committee ; these include a notion of classes based on existing ES3 concepts combined with proposed ECMAScript 3.1 extensions .
This means a couple things :
First , you can forget a lot of what you learned about ECMAScript 4 , previously .
Many of the complicated concepts contained in the language have been tossed .
Instead there is a considerable amount of effort going in to making sure that new features will be easily duplicable through other means .
For example , ECMAScript 3.1 provides a new method – called Object. freeze ( ) – which allows you to pass in an object and “ freeze ” it , preventing it from being modified any further .
This is a subset of the functionality that is needed to implement classes in ECMAScript 4 ( classes are immutable ) .
This means that classes will be a part of the new language but they will be defined as simply being syntactic sugar for a series of plain methods or conventions ( such as using closures and Object . freeze to create a Class - like experience ) .
Making sure that complex concepts break down into a simplified form will serve users well – giving them a considerable amount of leverage in using the language .
There is still some debate surrounding the remaining features of ECMAScript 4 – such as type annotations or if classes should support inheritance ( and if they do , should the utilize the existing prototypal form of inheritance ) .
A lot of this will become apparent over time .
The process that ’s gone into developing ECMAScript 4 is being adapted to suit ECMAScript 3.1 development as well .
This means that there will be a runnable reference implementation for the language ( with as much of the language written in the language itself , as possible – self - hosting code is quite cool ) .
Probably the most important development within all this is the codification of existing de-facto standards .
For example , the concept of JavaScript getters and setters ( implemented by Mozilla , Apple , and Opera ) are going to be quickly fast - tracked into the specification ( in the case of getters and setters they already have been ) .
Seeing real - world code quickly make a bee - line for standardization is truly heartwarming .
We ’ll probably see more of this for topics like ‘ let ’ and ‘ expression closures ’ – but which will arrive post - ECMAScript 3.1 ( since they require new syntax ) .
There is still a significant amount of work left to do ( both in the realm of specification and implementation ) but there has been some important progress made here .
Seeing an agreement between all of the largest players in the ECMAScript space ( Mozilla , Microsoft , Apple , Opera , Google , Yahoo ) is quite historic and will stand to serve users well .

I will be doing another Open Web Podcast tomorrow with Dion Almaer , Alex Russell , Brendan Eich , and Arun Ranganathan where we will be discussing ECMAScript Harmony .

PS3 + PSP = Digital Media on the Go By Joseph Moran I recently picked up a Sony PlayStation 3 , which in addition to being a great gaming system and Blu - Ray movie player , offers a way to access things like digital photos , video and music from your living room .
Getting the PS3 reminded me of the Sony PSP I received last year as a gift  it has sat mostly idle aside from the few times I used it to watch recorded TV downloaded from my TiVo since I 'm not much into gaming on the go .
Both devices have built - in networking capabilities , and after some time spent experimenting with them I discovered a feature called Remote Play .
If your PS3 is connected to your home network , Remote Play lets you use a PSP to access your PS3 and its multimedia content from another room in your house or even while away from home .
Setup Before setting up Remote Play , you 'll want to make sure both your PS3 and your PSP are running the most recent versions of their respective system software .
At the very least , they should be no older than 2.10 for the former and 3.80 for the latter .
Read More about Gaming
The first step to using Remote Play is to register your PSP with the PS3 .
Power up your PS3 and connect the PSP to it using a USB cable .
Then navigate to the Settings menu on the PSP , select USB Connection , and verify that the PSP display reads " USB Mode . "
Now access the settings menu on the PS3 , select the Remote Play Settings option and choose Register Device .
When the PS3 displays the " Register completed " message , select OK and head over to the Network menu .
From there , select the Remote Play option and you 'll see a text screen indicating the PS3 is ready to be accessed remotely .
Disconnect the PSP from the PS3 if you have n't already done so , and cancel USB mode by pressing the circle button .
Then , go to the PSP's Network menu and choose the Remote Play option .
You 'll be asked whether you want to connect via the Internet or a private network .
Choose the latter , and then select OK to dismiss the informational screen .
Next , you 'll be prompted to select a connection , and you 'll probably see your own Wireless LAN as one of the options , but that 's not the one you want .
Choose PlayStation 3 instead because with Remote Play the PS3 and PSP establish a direct wireless connection rather than doing it indirectly through an existing network .
When you put the PS3 into Remote Play mode , it sets itself up as an access point and broadcasts its own WPA - encrypted Wi-Fi connection ( the SSID will be PS3 followed by a bunch of numbers . )
Setting up a second wireless network may seem superfluous when one is already available , but there is at least one benefit to this setup  since the PSP supports only 802.11 b , by connecting directly to the PS3 , you avoid having to run your wireless network in backward - compatible b/g mode to establish the link .
In this case , however , PSP 's distance from the PS3 , not your Wi-Fi router , will govern the strength of your wireless connection .
Using Remote Play What 's That Term ?
Not sure what a particular networking term means ?
Check out our searchable glossary .
A few seconds after you select the PlayStation 3 connection , you 'll be greeted by the PS3's XMB interface and able to control the console as if you were sitting in front of it with a PS3 game controller .
There are some things you can't do via Remote Play , like play a PS3 game or watch a DVD or Blu - Ray movie .
But you can use the Photo , Music and Video menus to access content stored either on the PS3 , an external storage device like a USB Flash drive , or a media server such as your PC .
( For info on how to set up a Windows PC as a PS3 media server , follow this link .
Remote Play also allows you to access the PlayStation Store to download content as well as play any original PS1 games you 've purchased there .
When you want to disconnect from Remote Play , press the PSP's Home button and select Quit Remote Play then follow the prompts .
You 'll have the option to simply end your session or turn off the PS3 as well .
If others in your household use the PS3 , it 's important to remember that only one person can use it at a time .
When you 're connected remotely the console , anyone who tries to use it will see a " Remote Play in Progress " message on the screen , and they 'll be able to take the system out of Remote Play mode ( even if you 're connected ) by pressing the circle button .
You should remind anyone that might use the console to put it back in Remote Play mode when they 're done  simply leaving it on wo n't let you get back in .
Remote Play From the Internet To use Remote Play across the Internet , you must have an account on The PlayStation Network , which is necessary for the PSP and PS3 to locate each other .
You probably created an account when you first set up your PS3 , but if not you can get one by selecting Sign up from the PS3's Friends menu .
When you are at the remote location , select Remote Play on the PSP , but choose Connect via Internet instead of private network ( and again dismiss the info screen ) .
If you 've already connected your PSP to the wireless network at your location , select its SSID from the list provided .
If not , choose [ New Connection ] to scan for available networks and configure the PSP with the relevant settings , which will add that network to the list .
After you select the network you want to connect with you 'll be prompted to enter the username and password for your PlayStation Network account , which must be the same account you use on the PS3 .
Finally , choose Sign In , and in a moment ( it could take up to 90 seconds ) you should be looking at the PS3's XMB .
Remote Start The PS3 has a feature called Remote Start , which is essentially Wake on LAN , enabling you to remotely access your console even if it 's turned off .
This can be a convenient alternative to having to remember to turn on the PS3 and put it in Remote Play mode every time you head out the door .
However , based on my experience as well as some supplemental research it does n't work very reliably .
If you 'd like to give Remote Start a go , you can activate it via the PS3's Remote Play Settings menu ( the connection process from the PSP 's perspective does n't change ) .
I 've managed to get Remote Start to work , but only intermittently 
I 'd say it was successful only once out of every five attempts .
Remote Start sketchiness notwithstanding , the PS3 / PSP Remote Play feature does provide a handy way to access your multimedia files while away , or even get the jump on a movie rental / purchase by initiating the download before you get home .

The tipping point that seemed still a comfortable distance away three years ago when the American ASPO meetings began in Denver , is now just about here .
And the solutions that have been discussed do not approach , as yet , the millions of barrels a day ( mbd ) of fuel replacement that we may need before long .
At the same time , to return to the theme of my own paper , we do not have the educated human resource that we need .
Data from my Dean of Enrollment shows that ACT report national high school student interest in engineering was at 14 % in 1982 .
By 1992 it had dropped to 9 % .
By 2005 it was down to 5 % , and has fallen below that since .
The recurrent word that cropped up , again and again , was Scale .
It was an attempt by the speakers to try and convey to their audience the size of the problem that is coming at us , increasingly rapidly .
That one word encapsulates the difference between those who talk of the world energy problem in Quads ( quadrillion Btu’s ) , as opposed to those that talk of the solution in terms of kilowatts and Megawatts .
( The handy Dashboard on my Mac tells me that a Megawatt is 56,869 Btus / min .
A Quad is 1,000,000,000,000,000 Btu . )
The current shortages of gasoline are largely brought about by a transient closure of refineries that affects around 1 mbd of oil supply .
The time is not far distant when such shortages will become more regular as we compete for supply in a more competitive global market .
This is the post where I try and draw my own conclusions from the Conference .
And not recognizing many of the papers in this does not mean that they were n’t important , but rather that from my own perspective that this is what I got most from .
( Ed note :
In what follows I ’m referencing presentations now , rather than folk , and the citations are pdf files . )
The net result is that we are heading into trouble .
As Matt Simmons , I think , said “ it will make what happened in the past week look like a picnic . ”
Glancing back through Richardson Gill ’s The Great Maya Drought I found the section where he talks of the impact of famine , and how priorities switch from nation , to community , to family , to self .
We ’re still at the nation level , or even , some might say , still thinking globally , but one wonders how long that will last .
Because the numbers are real , the decline in global production is coming , and it is going to be soon .
And the decline curve will be greater than we anticipate .
In that regard I do have to tip my hat to the organizers for inviting Peter Wells to give what might be considered the cornucopian view .
And he came and talked to a room full of cynics , so my hat is tipped again .
But that being said , the CERA / IHS position and predictions have been proven wrong so consistently , that some of the value of the talk came from seeing how intelligent people can be led so far astray .
Though to be fair , his predictions were less optimistic than those coming from CERA .
And I appreciate his giving us the view “ from the other side of the fence , ” and the problems that the folk in the Middle East have in deciding what world demand will be so that they do not overproduce into a market in a way that will drive the price down .
Part of the problem comes from what is defined as a resource , rather than a reserve , recognizing that this changes with circumstance .
For example the heavy oils that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , and Iran cannot produce and sell at the moment ( e.g. Manifa ) depend on the construction of new refineries , such as those at Yanbu and Jubail .
The Jubail refinery is scheduled to come on line in in 2012 , with a production of 400,000 bd .
The Yanbu refinery that will take the other half of the Manifa production is scheduled to come on line in 2013 .
To count the Manifa oil as an immediate reserve , as KSA and Mr Wells apparently does , is thus , in my opinion , wrong .
By the time that it comes into production that oil will be needed to match declines in production from the remaining fields in KSA , which by then will be in visible decline .
The evidence for that was provided by Joules Burn .
Mr Wells predictions for exploration success are , I believe , likely to be found optimistic , and the chances of Saudi Aramco being able to achieve the levels of sustained production from Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques that he gave are very optimistic .
As a result I do n’t think that we will see a sustained KSA production that rises much above 11 mbd , if it reaches that high ( he thinks more that 12 mbd and sustained ) .
I also think that his projections for Iraq , at up to 7 mbd , are way above what is likely to be achieved , even if the political mess out there does get straightened out in the next ten years .
But then , the nice / bad thing about making projections is that , after a while , you get to see whether they were true .
And sadly , we will know soon enough , whether undue optimism was in fact warranted .
With crude oil supply in bad shape , finding that natural gas supplies were no better as Andy Weissman pointed out reinforced some opinions that I had already formed , and written about .
But it leaves no other immediate choice , than a greater reliance on coal .
It may not be popular , it may have lots of cost issues .
( I can not yet see a willingness to pay the power and financial costs for significant carbon capture and sequestration , nor the political will , when that cost is openly discussed ) but there is little else .
On the liquid fuel alternatives , Robert Rapier was his usual excellent self in reviewing biodiesel .
Though while I do n’t completely disagree with his notion that “ algal biodiesel ” is still an R&D project , I do suspect that if the different parts of that complex puzzle are addressed simultaneously , rather than in order , then the impact can be sooner , and more promising , than he holds out ( but then I ’m biased ) .
But that said , there is not yet enough promise in the biodiesel future to answer the need .
However I would like to close with recognizing the talk that Randy Udall gave .
If it takes a little courage to come as a cornucopian to a peak oil conference , it takes a lot more to get up and tell folks not only that Peak Oil is more important than Climate Change , but also that there is an arrogance in the IPCC community , intolerant of outside information .
He shared a note from them :
“ We are all extraordinary skeptical of the " peak oil " stuff .
We know of no reliable information that suggests that we 're going to be running significantly short of any fossil fuel in this century …
It certainly wo n't happen with any significant price on carbon .
“ We 've done a few 300 - year scenarios that have some shortages in them , but even that may not be realistic .
This is especially so with coal ! ”
“ The Chinese say they have enough coal for centuries … The idea that we 're only going to reach 450 ppm is not defensible , especially when we 're already around 385 ppm .
Do we really think there is only another 60 years of fossil fuel left ?
I do n't think so . ”
With all the politicians now so earnestly lined up to parrot this opinion , it is going to take a significant shock to divert their , and the world ’s attention .
Sadly I suspect we may see it , even before the next conference .
( There were even those who wondered whether the situation would get bad enough in the next year that we might not have one . )
And so I came away a lot more apprehensive than on my arrival .
Somehow having a lot of folk confirm my fears brought home that this is not a theoretical exercise in a way that , as an academic , I sometimes forget .
The talks were all information intensive , and I would highly recommend not only downloading the presentations , but also getting the DVD ’s when they are issued .
The Energy Challenge has already posted some information on where and when .
Through this article , I will highlight 1 ) the courageous action of a few which most Americans are unaware of and 2 ) how the media does a disservice to the men and women who have returned from Iraq and who are fighting for immediate withdrawal , reparations for Iraqis , and benefits for veterans returning home .
Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) has consistently acted independently from the two major parties .
Unlike veterans in a coalition like United for Peace and Justice ( UFPJ ) , IVAW ’s strength is that it can always find a good amount of veterans to oppose both Democrats and Republicans .
Ever since March 2008 , when they held their “ Winter Soldier Investigation ” and were ignored , IVAW has been moving right along challenging the current policy in the Middle East despite the fact that media entirely blacked out the event ( search OpEdNews.com for stories ; OpEdNews.com was one of the few media sources that covered the event regularly ) .
The veterans eventually were able to testify on the hill in front of the click here Progressive Caucus ( CPC ) and that can be attributed to the fact that Dennis Kucinich , Robert Wexler , and John Conyers were holding private meetings with members of IVAW .
IVAW marched on the DNC with nearly 10,000 Americans .
The veterans were ready to engage in civil disobedience , but Obama cleverly diffused the situation .
On the night of the final debate , which was held at Hofstra University , Iraq Veterans Against the War along with other antiwar groups came to the debate with the intention of rallying , marching , and risking arrest .
The Associated Press reports :
Police : 15 protesters arrested outside of LI debate HEMPSTEAD , N.Y .
( AP ) — Police say 15 people have been arrested during anti-war protests outside the Long Island university campus where the presidential debate was held .
Nassau County Police Lt. Kevin Smith says the 15 protesters were arrested on disorderly conduct charges Wednesday night outside the gates of Hofstra University in Hempstead .
He says they identified themselves as Iraq war veterans .
Police say they were arrested trying to get onto the campus after they had been turned away from a university gate .
They say one person may have received a minor injury and has been taken to a nearby hospital .
About 350 people had gathered outside the campus in the afternoon and were met by mounted police and officers in riot gear .
In order to maintain “ objectivity ” ( or more importantly “ credibility ” ) , the Associated Press asked the police to explain what happened .
No statement in the article represents what was happening from the perspective of an antiwar protester .
“ He says they identified themselves as Iraq war veterans . ”
Either this is lazy journalism or this is appalling denigration of a group of courageous young men and women who are fighting to salvage the future of this country .
The veterans should be referred to as members of an official organization --- Iraq Veterans Against the War .
AP may be unaware of the group because it works hard to ignore such groups but that does not excuse how they note who was present .
At 11:23 am ET , there are only a handful of articles on IVAW 's attempts to get into the debate and ask a question .
Media blackout is the coup de grâce that will continually be levelled against these courageous men and women until they shut the hell up .

News
Complete Genomics is about to release fast , cheap sequencing into a competitive market .
Complete Genomics is the latest company to herald the arrival of cheap genome sequencing .
Complete Genomics
The era of the $ 1,000 genome has arrived .
That 's the claim from Complete Genomics , a young company based in Mountain View , California , that revealed today that it plans to sequence 1,000 human genomes next year — and 20,000 in 2010 .
But do n't get your hopes up : Complete Genomics wo n't be selling to just anyone .
It also has n't released any data to back up its claims , although it has the backing of prominent scientists in the sequencing field , including Harvard University 's George Church , who is sequencing the genomes of ten individuals in his Personal Genome Project and acts as an adviser to several sequencing companies including Complete Genomics .
" I think it 's quite probable " that the company will achieve a $ 1,000 genome by the middle of next year , Church says , but " it 's not going to be easy " to sequence that many genomes in that amount of time .
The company enters a market crowded with companies selling such ' next generation ' sequencers , which use faster , cheaper technologies than those used in the Human Genome Project .
But unlike the current crop of companies , Complete Genomics will not sell sequencing machines .
Instead , the firm is building a sequencing centre at its Mountain View base , where it plans to sequence human genomes for pharmaceutical companies , biotechnology firms , personal - genomics companies and government - funded sequencing centres .
It will charge customers $ 5,000 to sequence a genome , says chief executive officer Cliff Reid , who estimates that the cost of materials used to generate each sequence will be around $ 1,000 .
Exploding technology
DNA - sequencing technology has exploded since 2003 , when the Human Genome Project produced a composite human genome sequence containing DNA from many people .
In June 2007 , James Watson became the first person to have his own complete genome sequenced at a cost of $ 1 - 1.5 million .
Since then a handful of other people have had their genomes sequenced , and costs have dropped to tens of thousands of dollars .
So far , cheaper genome scans have examined a subset of a person 's DNA , looking at points of the genome called single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) – the markers targeted by ' personal genomics companies ' .
But SNPs only mark areas of the genome that are associated with a disease ; they do not reveal what precise genetic glitch causes the disease .
Comparing whole genomes , however , might reveal the genes underlying an illness .
Such studies will gain power as more genomes are sequenced .
Complete Genomics is proposing to sequence thousands of genomes at a speed and cost that no other company currently taking orders from customers is approaching .
By keeping its machines in - house , it will not have to spend money making them ' idiot - proof ' for outside customers .
And the company is also using some cost - saving technological tricks .
Faster , cheaper
Its process breaks up genomic DNA into single - strand fragments which , along with segments of synthetic DNA called adapters , form small circles of DNA that contain about 80 bases .
These adapters help to break the genomic DNA into smaller , easy - to - sequence chunks .
Hundreds of the DNA circles join together into a long chain that folds up into a ' nano - ball ' .
These nano - balls are then washed over a glass slide with activated sticky spots that bind the DNA .
Once a nano - ball has stuck to a spot it repels other nano - balls , ensuring that the slide carries as many different sequences as possible .
This high density means that a standard glass microscope slide holds about a billion spots .
The miniaturization cuts down on the cost of sequencing chemicals , the firm says .
A ligase enzyme then helps to add short strands of complimentary DNA , which have been dyed with several fluorescent compounds , to the nano - balls .
The fluorescence can be used to infer the sequence of the underlying DNA sample by monitoring the slide with cheap , off - the - shelf digital camera technology .
The whole system is very similar to methods developed by Church and used by the company Applied Biosystems in Foster City , California , in its SOLiD system .
Church is using similar technology in his Polonator , a sequencing machine designed to use cheaper materials and open - source software .
In just seven days ...
So far , Complete Genomics has used its technology to sequence a human genome in seven days .
By next year , it says that it will be producing finished genome sequences that include data from both the maternal and paternal contributions to an individual 's DNA , with DNA from 99 % of the protein - coding regions and 90 % of the total human genome .
But until the company releases more details , it is not yet clear how ' complete ' its genomes are .
Elaine Mardis , co-director of the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University , St Louis , is one of a handful of customers who have been briefed by the company .
Mardis , who describes herself as " a sceptic by nature " , says : " Before I would even know they were a ' fit ' for us , I would need to see data produced by their method . "
But Chad Nusbaum , co-director of the sequencing centre at the Broad Institute in Cambridge , Massachusetts , was more optimistic .
" If it works , it 's exciting , and I think there 's a decent chance it will work , " he says .
If it does , " it puts us in a position to be able to sequence thousands of genomes " .
And John Chant , a biotechnology entrepreneur based in San Francisco , is so bullish on the company that he says he convinced his former employer , San Francisco - based Genentech , to invest $ 1 million in it .
" The selling point is , if you keep DNA from everyone in a clinical trial , when patients have an adverse reaction you can find out the gene that causes it , " he explains .
This would potentially allow companies to screen out the patients who have that gene from future trials .
At $ 5,000 a genome , and perhaps 10,000 patients per clinical trial , the $ 50 - million sequencing cost might be worth it to save a multi- billion - dollar drug , Chant says .
In the meantime , Reid says that the company has already signed up its first customer : Leroy Hood , president of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle , Washington .
Hood , an adviser to Complete Genomics , has asked the company to sequence the genomes of more than 2,000 people as part of a project he is conducting with the government of Luxembourg .
Reid adds that the company will not compete for the X Prize in Genomics , which will award $ 10 million to the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days .
He says that the project would consume too much capacity of the 96 machines Complete Genomics intends to build next year .
10 Reasons Why Atheists Should Still Vote for Obama
even though he has been Christianing it up
9/27/08
As tough as it usually is to get atheists to agree on anything , you would still think that , after the last eight years , we would at least all be able to agree on the urgent need to get the Republicans the hell out of the White House .
But alas , it is not so .
Over the last couple of months , there have been rumblings in the atheist blogosphere from certain of us who think that Democratic candidate Barack Obama is too Christian — or , at least , has started making too much use of Christian rhetoric — and have been threatening to stay home on November 4th .
I understand your feelings , and I understand the need of any bloc of voters not to feel as if they are being taken for granted …
But I ’m afraid I really must insist that you vote for Obama anyway .
I realize your blogotime is precious , so as a gesture of good faith — er , good science — I ’ve managed to rein in my all - consuming need to hear myself type , and marshaled my arguments in the form of a brief and efficient Top Ten List , in lieu of one of my trademark exhaustive TLDR - fests .
Enjoy , and please forward / link / Stumbleupon / Digg or whatever you need to do to bring this to the attention of atheists you think might be contemplating sitting this one out .
* * * 1 . The Whole Reason He Had to Christian It Up Is Because of That Stupid Shit Where Rednecks Try and Say He ’s Muslim .
Really , this should have been obvious to people who are as smart as we are .
If there were a rumor that you were , say , really sexist , you would probably make more of an effort to say feminist things whenever gender issues came up .
You would n’t necessarily lie and say stuff you do n’t really believe ; you ’d just be more likely to go out of your way to emphasize certain aspects of your worldview , whereas under different circumstances , you might not have gone out of your way to emphasize them .
Because there are a ton of morons ( 12 % of the country at last count , to be exact ) who think Obama is Muslim — because they ’re , you know , racist — he has had to go “ Hey , by the way , have I mentioned I ’m Christian lately ? ” more times than he otherwise would have .
If you are pissed that he has had to do this , blame the moron racists , not Obama himself .
2 . By Staying Home , We Would Be Doing the Same Exact Thing as Women Who Are Pissed That It ’s Not Hillary .
Remember how , throughout the whole primary , we always followed up our cheers for Obama with frank stipulations that we would personally track down and tar - and - feather any and all women who did n’t vote because it was n’t Hillary ?
Well , then why is it okay for us to suddenly talk about not voting just because the candidate is n’t a member of our little group either ?
He ’s still the candidate who represents our interests .
Suppose Black people had not voted for JFK in 1960 because he was n’t Black .
Nixon would have won , and then there would have been no Civil Rights Act .
You vote for the person who is going to make things better for your group , even if he / she is not a member .
Us being pissed that Obama is not an atheist would be just as stupid as women being pissed that he ’s not a woman .
In fact , it would be even stupider if we did it , because women at least came really close this year , so it ’s not like their hopes were unrealistic .
On the other hand , since there ’s obviously no way that an avowed atheist — or even an enthusiastic secularist — could possibly be elected president anytime soon , us taking our ball and going home this year would be more like if women had not voted because no candidate was a woman in , say , 1924 .
3 . We Have to Accept a Division between What Our Pundits Can Say and What Our Politicians Can Say .
One thing the Right seems to have grasped a bit better than we have is the whole “ division of rhetorical labor ” thing .
You never have the people who are actually running for stuff say the real hardcore shit .
For example , the Right does n’t have George W. Bush actually get up there and say “ fag ” — they have Ann Coulter say “ fag ” to rev up the base , and then Bush says something that looks moderate by comparison .
That way , he benefits from what the nut - jobs say but ca n’t get blamed for it .
Similarly , we cannot expect Liberal politicians to actually get up there and say “ the Bible is a crock of shit , you dumbasses . ”
We say that , and then they say something moderate .
That ’s how it works … you dumbasses .
4 . There ’s a Very Good Chance That This Meme Was Started by Christian / Republican Trolls , and If It Works They Will Laugh at Us .
To return to the Hillary - supporters analogy , you know how , when there are people in comment threads who claim to be Liberal women who are n’t voting , we instantly go “ Oh , whatever , that ’s obviously a DeceptiCon troll ? ”
Well , what makes you think that a lot of these supposed atheists who are n’t voting are n’t the same thing ?
You know at least some of them are — which means that , if McCain wins , and the next day there is even one atheist blog on the whole internet saying “ I did n’t vote for Obama because he talked about Jeebus too much , ” the Religious Right will copy / link it to holy hell and laugh their asses off at us .
If that should happen , then I am going to blame some of the people in this room , and then I do not forgive .
5 . Oh , and You Know How We Have Such a Boner for Pointing Out Logical Fallacies ?
Well ,
It Turns
Out that an argument saying you should decline to support a solution that is clearly better just because it ’s not perfect is , in fact , a logical fallacy .
It ’s called the Perfect - Solution Fallacy , or Nirvana Fallacy .
This does n’t mean that there ’s never a good reason to abstain from voting — it is certainly possible for circumstances to arise in which both candidates are ethically / philosophically intolerable to us — but clearly Obama is not intolerable .
He supports all the same shit we do ; we just think it would be even awesomer if he made fun of religion .
But he does n’t .
Deal .
6 . Is n’t Our Position Supposed to Be That You Can Believe Whatever You Want , as Long as You Keep It Away from the Law ?
Yes , I know , privately , for ourselves , our position is that religion is unjustifiable in all circumstances , even if someone is only religious under their bed with all the lights off .
I am not saying we should not believe this .
It does , however , seem to me like a good public policy would be for us to say that , as long as you can avoid forcing your religion on people , we will somehow manage to restrain ourselves from driving up your ass about it .
Does Barack Obama actually believe that Jesus of Nazareth literally rose from the dead after three days and walked around nodding ’ sup to people ?
Maybe .
Maybe not .
Who gives a shit ?
As long as Obama does n’t want stuff to this effect to be taught in school , does n’t hold positions that require faith in stuff to this effect to agree with or understand , and does n’t think that people who believe stuff to this effect are better than people who do n’t — which he clearly does n’t — then you might as well be arguing that you should n’t vote for someone because he has shitty taste in movies .
You may very well be right about him having shitty taste in movies , but you know what else — who cares ?
Our prescription that The President Is Not a Religious Official needs to cut both ways .
That ’s right , it ’s Mixed Metaphor Day , and prescriptions cut things now .
7 . If You Have to Think of It as Voting Against Sarah Palin , Fine .
Self - explanatory .
When this meme started , the Religious Right had no dog in the fight , and now they do .
If McCain / Palin takes it , the fundies will be dancing around yelling “ We won !
We won ! ” ( well , the ones who are allowed to dance , anyway ) .
On election night , either James Dobson , Pat Buchanan , and Jack Chick will be happy , or they will be sad .
I choose to try and make them sad .
If you choose to make them happy , I do n’t see where you get off thinking that you are more of an atheist than I am .
8 . You Ca n’t Be “ Progressive ” If You Never , Ever Win , Ever .
I seem to see the most bitching about Obama ’s professions of Christian faith coming from the type of Liberals who like to use the word “ Progressive ” instead of “ Liberal . ”
But there ’s a difference between “ selling out ” and simply “ declining to fuck yourself directly in the ass . ”
Yes , it is just as annoying to me as it is to you that the Democrats have to keep spouting rhetoric about being “ people of faith . ”
And yes , in a sense , taking a harder line on religion would make them a more “ Progressive ” party .
In another , more accurate sense , however , it would make them an “ always lose 538 electoral votes to 0 ” party .
You might as well vote for Nader if you ’re going to argue stuff like this .
And by “ vote for Nader , ” I mean “ come to my house so I can kill you . ”
9 . Aw , Come On , It ’s a Black Thing , Just Leave It Alone .
Am I saying that you should vote for Obama just because he ’s Black ?
Of course not .
Am I saying that the fact that he ’s Black should make you less pissed about the Christianity ?
Yes , actually , I totally am .
It is a more - than - fair point that the African - American Christian tradition is a different organism altogether from the type of Christianity that pisses us off .
It is inextricably tied up with the Civil Rights Movement , and it is largely thanks to the continued influence of African - American Christians that people in this country are aware that it ’s even possible to believe in God and be a Liberal at the same time .
Despite being more authentically pious than just about everybody else , Black Christians still somehow manage to refrain from blowing up abortion clinics , picketing gay funerals , and waging loony juntas against local school boards over sex education and evolution .
Having this type of Christian as the nation ’s most prominent Christian could go a long way to making a lot of the other Christians chill out a little .
Would it be even better if they stopped believing in God altogether ?
Sure .
But between “ chilling out ” and “ nothing , ” I ’ll take chilling out — and if you would n’t , then this kind of belies the alleged concern for people that supposedly informs your distaste for religion .
Yes , Obama ’s rhetorical style is very deliberately and conspicuously informed by the rhythms of Black American gospel tradition .
You know what else ?
This is a big part of why he 's such an enthralling speaker .
Yes , when Obama wins , the celebrations in many Black communities will very pointedly include a lot of explicitly Christian rejoicing and whatnot .
But you know what ?
They have had to deal with so much bullshit over the years , I say let them have it .
I ’m not going to look an African - American in the eye and say “ Sure , I could have voted for your guy , and he could have won , but I said screw it because you ’re not ditching Christianity fast enough ” — not because I ’m scared , but simply because even I am not that big of an asshole .
Religious communities that have been fucked with beyond all comprehension in the recent past are a tricky issue — you know how we , um , kind of tend to go easy on Jewish people ?
Same thing .
10 . As Smart People , We Have a Responsibility to Protect Everyone Else .
Being an atheist means more than just bursting into comment wars bellowing “ Ha , ha !
I ’m smarter than you ! ” ( not that doing this is not awesome , but still ) .
As the only people who see the world as it really is , we have a responsibility to that world .
We simply do not have the right to sulk in our tent while the ships burn , just as adults who are responsible for children do not have the right to act like those children , no matter how much they might want to , even if the children do it first .
Barack Obama becoming President of the United States would be better for the world than John McCain ( and , quite possibly , subsequently Sarah Palin ) becoming President of the United States .
It would mean more widespread social justice , less unnecessary suffering , and greater happiness for a greater number , both in America and the broader world .
We are the teachers of the rest of humanity whether we want the job or not , and whether it takes another hundred years to teach them or another thousand , we have to teach them either way .
To punish them for not learning fast enough would be not only senselessly cruel , but counterproductive even from a self - centered point of view , since the ignorance , poverty , and misery that would be tolerated and increased by continued Republican control of the United States would serve both to extend and intensify the religiosity of the human race .
* * *
In conclusion , do n’t freaking not vote for Obama just because he says Christian stuff now and then , dumbass .
This would not make you more principled , or more atheist , than the rest of us — you will simply be the one asshole who screwed it up for everybody , and every other atheist / secularist will hate you for the rest of your life .
Now , the risk when dealing with atheists , as usual , is that we tend to enjoy being different so much that the prospect of being singled out this way is very likely an inducement to some of us …
But you know what ?
Let ’s let that shit go for once .
Let ’s just win for a change .
Ideally , yes , “ win ” would mean an atheist president .
But I do n’t see an atheist running .
All I see is someone that the Religious Right wants to win , and someone that the Religious Right does n’t want to win .
The guy they do n’t want to win is Barack Obama .
Case closed .
We all know what punishment fits the crime of murder , or even potential murder , if the security of post - 9/11 America is at stake .
We all know how self - appointed “ patriotic ” martyrs always justify taking the law into their own hands .
Obama can hardly be held accountable for Ayers ’s behavior 40 years ago , but at least McCain and Palin can try to take some responsibility for the behavior of their own supporters in 2008 .
What ’s troubling here is not only the candidates ’ loose inflammatory talk but also their refusal to step in promptly and strongly when someone responds to it with bloodthirsty threats in a crowded arena .
Joe Biden had it exactly right when he expressed concern last week that “ a leading American politician who might be vice president of the United States would not just stop midsentence and turn and condemn that . ”
To stay silent is to pour gas on the fires .
It was n’t always thus with McCain .
In February he loudly disassociated himself from a speaker who brayed “ Barack Hussein Obama ” when introducing him at a rally in Ohio .
Now McCain either backpedals with tardy , pro forma expressions of respect for his opponent or lets second - tier campaign underlings release boilerplate disavowals after ugly incidents like the chilling Jim Crow - era flashback last week when a Florida sheriff ranted about “ Barack Hussein Obama ” at a Palin rally while in full uniform .
From the start , there have always been two separate but equal questions about race in this election .
Is there still enough racism in America to prevent a black man from being elected president no matter what ?
And , will Republicans play the race card ?
The jury is out on the first question until Nov. 4 .
But we now have the unambiguous answer to the second : Yes .
McCain , who is no racist , turned to this desperate strategy only as Obama started to pull ahead .
The tone was set at the Republican convention , with Rudy Giuliani ’s mocking dismissal of Obama as an “ only in America ” affirmative - action baby .
We also learned then that the McCain campaign had recruited as a Palin handler none other than Tucker Eskew , the South Carolina consultant who had worked for George W. Bush in the notorious 2000 G.O.P. primary battle where the McCains and their adopted Bangladeshi daughter were slimed by vicious racist rumors .

No less disconcerting was a still - unexplained passage of Palin ’s convention speech :
Her use of an unattributed quote praising small - town America ( as opposed to , say , Chicago and its community organizers ) from Westbrook Pegler , the mid-century Hearst columnist famous for his anti-Semitism , racism and violent rhetorical excess .
After an assassin tried to kill F.D.R. at a Florida rally and murdered Chicago ’s mayor instead in 1933 , Pegler wrote that it was “ regrettable that Giuseppe Zangara shot the wrong man . ”
In the ’60s , Pegler had a wish for Bobby Kennedy : “ Some white patriot of the Southern tier will spatter his spoonful of brains in public premises before the snow falls . ”

" The queen had only one way of settling all difficulties , great or small .
' Off with his head ! ' she said without even looking around . "
-- " ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND "
WASHINGTON - Under the pressure of the financial crisis , one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high .
It is not Barack Obama .
Channeling his inner Queen of Hearts , John McCain furiously , and apparently without even looking around at facts , said Chris Cox , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , should be decapitated .
This childish reflex provoked the Wall Street Journal to editorialize that " McCain untethered " -- disconnected from knowledge and principle -- had made a " false and deeply unfair " attack on Cox that was " unpresidential " and demonstrated that McCain " does n't understand what 's happening on Wall Street any better than Barack Obama does . "
Perhaps an old antagonism is involved in McCain 's fact - free slander .
His most conspicuous economic adviser is Douglas Holtz - Eakin , who previously headed the Congressional Budget Office .
There he was an impediment to conservatives , including then - Congressman Cox , who as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee persistently tried and generally failed to enlist CBO support for " dynamic scoring " that would estimate the economic growth effects of proposed tax cuts .
In any case , McCain 's smearing of Cox -- that he " betrayed the public 's trust " -- is a harbinger of a McCain presidency .
For McCain , politics is always operatic , pitting people who agree with him against those who are " corrupt " or " betray the public 's trust , " two categories that seem to be exhaustive -- there are no other people .
McCain 's Manichean worldview drove him to his signature legislative achievement , the McCain - Feingold law 's restrictions on campaigning .
Today , his campaign is creatively finding interstices in laws intended to restrict campaign giving and spending .
I write a column for computer programmers called " Stevey 's Blog Rants . "
It 's basically a magazine column — I publish to it about once a month .
The average length of my articles is about 12 pages , although they can range anywhere from 4 to 40 pages , depending on how I 'm feeling .
But for precedent , do n't think blogs : think of Reader 's Digest .
The blog format sets the wrong expectations .
Hence , some people complain that my articles are too long .
Others complain that I have not given my arguments sufficient exposition , and that my articles are in fact too short on detail to warrant any credibility .
This is a lose - lose situation for me , but I keep at it nonetheless because I enjoy writing .
Even if nobody were to read my blog , the act of writing things down helps me think more clearly , and it 's engaging in the same way that solving a Sudoku puzzle is engaging .
You should try it yourself .
All it takes is a little practice .
My blog topics vary widely , and sometimes I even venture outside the realm of programming .
Programming is where I 'm most comfortable , and it's also where people seem to ascribe to me some level of punditry : I 'm not necessarily right , but even my greatest detractors grudgingly admit that I 'm entitled to an opinion , by virtue of my having spent twenty years hacking day and night without any sign of wanting to give it up and turn into a pointy - haired manager .
Even though I love both programming and to a lesser extent writing about it , there are also lots of non-programming topics I 'd like to write about .
Being a career programmer gives you an interesting perspective on issues not directly related to programming .
You start to see parallels .
So maybe I 'll branch out some more and see how it goes .
The first thing you notice as a programmer is that it trains you — forces you , really — to think in a disciplined way about complex logic problems .
It also gives you a big booster shot of confidence around problem - solving in general .
Junior programmers tend to have very high opinions of themselves ; I was no exception .
In time , though , programming eventually humbles you , because it shows you the limits of your reasoning ability in ways that few other activities can match .
Eventually every programmer becomes entangled in a system that is overwhelming in its complexity .
As we grow in our abilities as programmers we learn to tackle increasingly complex systems .
But every human programmer has limits , and some systems are just too hard to grapple with .
When this happens , we usually do n't blame ourselves , nor think any less of ourselves .
Instead we claim that it 's someone else 's fault , and it just needs a rewrite to help manage the complexity .
In many cases this is even true .
Over time , our worldwide computer - programming community has discovered or invented better and better ways ways to organize programs and systems .
We 've managed to increase their functionality while keeping the complexity under control .
But even with such controls in place , systems can occasionally get out of hand .
And sometimes they even need to be abandoned altogether , like a dog that 's gone rabid .
No matter how much time and love you 've put into such systems , there 's no fixing them .
Abandoning a system is a time of grieving for the folks who 've worked on it .
Such systems are like family .
And there 's a disturbing lesson at the tail end of such experiences .
The scary thing is that it 's very easy , as a programmer standing at the precipice of complexity , to envision systems that are orders of magnitude more complex , millions of times more complex , even unimaginably more complex .
In the end , programming shows us how small we are .
Long ago , I used to have a Siamese fighting fish , also known as a Betta splendens , or simply a " betta " .
You can buy these fish at almost any pet store .
I kept my betta , who was a deep vibrant red , in a pretty little 15 - gallon tank decorated with a resplendence of real freshwater plants .
And for a while I think my betta was happy there .
Like many Americans , I went through a phase in which I kept and ultimately killed many , many tropical fish .
I did n't kill them intentionally ; I wanted them to live and thrive .
But keeping them alive for long is a challenge when you do n't live in the tropics .
So they might live for a few months or maybe a year , but they would always die prematurely .
It was sad , and eventually I could no longer bear it , so I stopped keeping them .
Of all my fish , my betta left the biggest impression on me .
The betta is a remarkable fish in several ways .
For one thing , bettas are physically beautiful , and when they are at full display , their fins expand , peacock - like , into a fluid rose shape that is undeniably dramatic .
Bettas are also remarkable because they fight .
They do not fight to establish a pecking order , as other fish do ; they fight to kill .
The males display their fins and then fight whenever they see another male betta , or even their own reflection , so they have to be kept alone and away from mirrors .
But bettas , I think , are most remarkable for their intelligence .
Of all of the hundreds of tropical fish I kept , only bettas displayed anything resembling intellectual curiosity .
This really makes bettas some of the saddest stories in the tropical fish industry .
Like other hobbyist fishes , they are stolen from their natural habitat and shipped overseas , or at best farmed in unsavory conditions .
But unlike most other fish , bettas are also dyed to enhance their color .
They are generally housed in tiny fist - sized bowls because of their ability to breathe air when necessary .
And they are bred to express their fighting genes , and are often made to fight by their owners .
Whereas other fish are kidnapped and sold , bettas are abused .
But worst of all , I believe their high intelligence endows them with greater capacity for suffering than other fish species .
They can suffer physically and emotionally , but as we will see shortly , they can also suffer intellectually .
So bettas are a sad story .
Here is the specific sad story of my betta , the fish that left such an impression on me .
I had taken to lying on my bed and watching my betta for an hour or longer .
The betta was the sole occupant of the tank in my bedroom .
I had filled the tank with plants and copious natural light , so the effect was calming and serene .
At times I almost envied the betta for the nice home I 'd made for him .
One day , after the betta had been in his new home for several weeks , I found him exploring .
It was a most unusual exploration , and one that I will never forget .
For the first few weeks , the betta explored the way you would expect any reasonably intelligent fish to go about the task .
For the first few days he swam around to every nook and cranny of the tank , to make sure he had the lay of the land .
Then for a few more days he experimented with staying put in different locations to see how he liked their feel .
Just like people , most fish will soon find a spot or a path they like best , and they 'll stay in that spot or on that path for the rest of their lives .
But my betta was different .
After his initial explorations he became restless .
I 'm no Fish Whisperer , but I could tell that he was restless .
You would have thought so too .
The betta started spending most of his time looking out of the tank , examining my bedroom .
And he was clearly looking at specific things in the bedroom , not just " out there " in general .
He would periodically swim around looking mildly agitated .
He was acting like he wanted out .
I did everything I could to placate him .
I experimented with different fish foods .
I changed the water weekly and monitored it carefully to keep its temperature and pH within acceptable ranges .
I added more lights .
I added more plants .
I rearranged the plants .
In desperation , I even added a little castle .
Every time I tried something new , it would pique his interest for a little while .
But in time , and faster each time than before , he would revert to his state of restlessness .
I 'd never seen quite this behavior in other fish , so already he was demonstrating what seemed to be above average intelligence .
And then one day I found him engaged in an exploration that was altogether new .
He was n't exploring the tank .
He 'd already investigated its topology for weeks .
This time , he was exploring the nature of the tank .
That 's what caught my attention , and not just for that day , but for the rest of my life .
There was a twenty - inch vine in the tank that extended from the lower left back corner to the upper right front corner , along the diagonal of the main volume of the tank .
The vine belonged to one of the many plants I 'd put in there in the hopes of making it feel more like the Mekong river basin and less like a plexiglass tank in Seattle , Washington .
The betta had his nose on the vine .
He was floating just above it , twitching his fins slightly to stay in place , and he was keeping his eyes as close to the vine as possible while keeping it in focus : about half a centimeter to a centimeter .
And he was traversing the vine .
With the tiniest of motions , he was propelling himself along the vine towards the lower back right corner , keeping it under close scrutiny at all times .
This excursion , from the halfway point to the end of the vine , took him perhaps three minutes .
He was taking his time .
When he got to the end of the vine , he remained rooted in place while he inspected the 3 - inch - radius spherical volume at the end of the vine , which was truncated in three dimensions by the walls and floor of the tank .
He spent about three or four minutes doing this inspection , evidently making sure the vine really did terminate in the corner , and did not escape the tank .
After he had thoroughly scrutinized everything in the betta - sized vicinity of the vine 's end , he turned back to the vine , nose pressed close , and began working his way along the vine in the other direction .
At this point I sat down to watch , because if he was doing what I thought he might be doing , then ...
I did n't know what to think .
I wanted to see it for myself .
Over the next seven to ten minutes , he crept along the vine , never losing sight of it nor getting further than a centimeter from it , until he reached the upper - right front corner of the tank .
He then proceeded to repeat his inspection of the volume at vine 's end , ensuring himself that the vine terminated in the tank rather than protruding beyond the wall .
But what if he had missed something ?
Sure enough , he turned and looked down the length of the vine for a time .
And then he put his nose back on the vine and began again his long descent to the other end .
He did this for five days .
By the second day my amazement had turned to concern , and by the third day I felt utterly helpless .
Here was an intelligent prisoner , my captive , exploring the mechanics of his prison with a thoroughness that only the imprisoned can afford , looking for an escape with deathly tenacity .
But while purchasing my betta had been easy enough , returning him to his real home would be unthinkably difficult , and probably unsuccessful even if I 'd tried .
Returning him to the fish store seemed like a dead end ; he could easily wind up worse off than he was now .
So I concluded that there was nothing I could do .
As he inspected the vine , I bit my nails , and timed passed in silence .
After the fifth day he gave up .
And then he did something that I still do n't understand , even though I 've heard about this kind of thing before , and even though I personally saw him do it : he died of unhappiness .
It only took him a few days .
He refused his food , he stopped moving , and to all external appearances he had become ill .
But I knew better .
Whenever I find myself struggling against the tide of massive system complexity , I think of my betta .
He had a big heart , a small brain , and a small range of sensory input .
I watched him use them all as methodically as any programmer to reason his way through to a soundness proof of the inescapability of his prison .
We like to think of ourselves as being pretty smart .
Admit it .
We do .
But in the grand scheme of things we 're intellectually little better off than that fish .
We can easily find problems so complex that reasoning about them can take days or weeks of microscopic scrutiny , like my fish swimming along his vine .
And we can just as easily envision problems thousands or millions of times more complex : problems beyond the reasoning abilities of any person , any group of people , or even our entire species .
This has ramifications for the way we think about things today .
I believe I will have more to say about this soon .
Right now I need to go mourn my fish , whose soul shone as brightly as that of anyone I 've known .
The UK Ministry of Defense has just declassified nineteen secret files detailing UFO encounters over the past decades , one of them involving a USAF Sabre fighter pilot who was ordered to fire at will against an unidentified flying object in British airspace .
Unfortunately - or fortunately - lieutenant Milton Torres lost the contact after the UFO left the scene at a whooping 9,941 miles per hour .
According to him , it had the proportions of an aircraft carrier :
The blip was burning a hole in the radar with its incredible intensity .
It was similar to a blip I had received from B52s and seemed to be a magnet of light .
It had the proportions of a flying aircraft carrier .

According to the Ministry of Defense , it all happened over Norwich in 1957 .
The 26 - year - old Torres was called along with his wingman , taking off the Royal Air Force base in Kent .
But something strange was happening :
He was ordered to shoot the UFO down before they scrambled off to intercept it , something that had never occurred before .
I shall never forget it , and for the last 50 years I have been waiting for an explanation , but I 've never had one .
On that night I was ordered to open fire even before I had taken off .
That had never happened before .
I was ready to hit the target with all 24 rockets : it would have been like buckshot out of a shotgun .
I asked for authentication of the order to fire and I received it .

To make things even stranger , the now 77 - year - old Torres has declared now that he received a visit the next day from an American .
The man , wearing a trench coat , waved his badge and claimed to be working for the National Security Agency .
He said to him that what happened the day before was to be kept under complete secret .
Or else .
UFO experts say that , while all this could be explained by the existence of Project Palladium - the experiments that the CIA was conducting during those years to create false radar readings in the Soviet Union - this wo n't explain why the pilots were ordered to fire all the rockets loaded in their planes .
Or why the blip appeared over British air space in the first place .
There 's another interesting case in the newly - declassified files :
An account of a near - fatal accident at 22,000 feet , 17 years ago .
In this file , Alitalia Flight AZ 284 almost had a direct collision with an UFO while approaching London 's Heathrow airport .
Fortunately , nothing happened because the object vanished just before the impact .

( Part 4 in a 4 - Part Series on Elemental Art Featuring Natural Wonders of the World )
Clouds and light produce some of the most stunning yet transient works of Mother Nature : rare formations , brilliant rainbows , sprites and mirages and other gorgeous elemental air imagery .
( If you are just joining this earth formations and phenomena series , be sure to catch the other elements for some truly inspiring images and information : incredible earth and land , scorching fire and light and cool water , snow and ice phenomena . )
Cloud Types and Amazing Formations
( Image via Thomas Hawk )
Do you know your cloud types ?
It starts with altitude ( stratus , altostratus , and at the highest level , cirrus and cumulonimbus ) .
But there are varying types of clouds within each “ level ” , such as the famous low - level vertical cumulus clouds ( not the same as cumulonimbus clouds at the higher level ) .
Confused yet ?
It goes like this : below 6,000 feet , there are stratocumulus , stratus , and cumulus .
From 6,000 to 20,000 feet there are altostratus and altocumulus clouds .
At 20,000 feet and up there are cirrocumulus , cumulonimbus and cirrus clouds .
Of course , if you have ever lain on a grassy patch and spent an afternoon looking for cloud formations resembling animals , objects or people , you know that clouds are beautiful – if ephemeral – artworks of nature .
There are a few unusual types of clouds that are less known and eye - catching .
Mammatus Clouds
( Images copyright Jorn Olsen via DarkRoastedBlend )
Named for their resemblance to mammaries ( okay , breasts ) , these oddly bulbous clouds often form after or immediately preceding a tornado , though they cannot be considered an indicator of an impending tornado .
( Images via USRA and metvuw )
According to wikipedia , “ ammatus are most often associated with the anvil cloud that extends from a cumulonimbus , but may also be found under altocumulus , altostratus , stratocumulus , and cirrus clouds , as well as contrails and volcanic ash clouds . ”
Mammatus are literally the bumpy , lumpy underside of many types of clouds .
Lenticular Clouds
( Images via Magazinely )
These disc - shaped clouds have graced mountains , as if they are nature ’s version of a snug cap .
Yet they also appear singularly and seemingly out of place in blank expanses of sky .
“ Lens ” clouds tend to form at much higher altitudes than mammatus clouds and resemble everything from plates to discs to UFO’s .
Light and Air Formations and Phenomena
( Image via kulgen )
The interplay of humidity conditions , sunlight , temperature and the blank canvas of air can create some incredible artistic effects , from sunbeams to the mirages of storybook lore .
Crepuscular Rays
( Images via Wikimedia , BBC and Wikimedia )
Everyone can appreciate the beauty of crepuscular rays , and with good reason : they ’re inspiring , uplifting and often simply wondrous .
Poets refer to them in their works ; artists have tried to recapture them on canvas ; a morning with sunbeams is the most cheerful morning of all .
Sunbeams , as they ’re commonly called ( other nicknames are sunbursts , sun rays and Jacob ’s Ladder ) .
( Image via kozyndan )
Crepuscular refers to the hours of dusk and dawn , which is when these optical displays are most likely to appear .
Crepuscular rays are often very striking when you seem them under water .
Mirages
( Images via cplady and dewbow )
First : the famous mirages we watched in cartoons as a child – you know , the ones where a magical oasis appeared to a weary , hot traveler in the desert .
More pedestrian are road mirages .
They are very common sights , frequently making the asphalt appear to have large pools of collected water .
Mirages are optical illusions , caused by light rays bending and creating visible “ objects ” – which , of course , are subjective .
According to wikipedia : “ The principal physical cause of a mirage … is refraction rather than reflection .
A mirage is a real optical phenomenon that can be captured on camera , since light rays actually are refracted to form the false image at the observer ’s location . ”
In an inferior mirage , light is bent when it passes from cold air to warm air – the heat waves emanating from roads and ground in direct sunlight begin to cool the higher one goes , allowing for mirages to appear both ever out of reach yet planted soundly on terra firma .
In a superior mirage the temperature is inversed .
Below , see an inferior mirage ( top ) and a superior mirage time - elapse ( lower ) .
( Images via wikipedia and wikipedia )
Mirages are famously seen in the Great Salt Lake , Mojave Desert , Farralon Islands and many other places around the world .
Colorful Light and Sky Formations
( Images via artfromthesoul and destination360 )
Surreal optical displays like aurora borealis , rainbows and light pillars are some of nature ’s most thrilling artistic works .
It ’s simple physics at work , but the beauty is undeniable .
Rainbows
God ’s promise .
The path to a pot of gold .
A symbol of inclusive sexuality .
The rainbow has been the stuff of legends and symbolism for millennia , and this brilliant prism of the color spectrum can be seen in everything from garden hose sprays to rainstorms and squalls .
( Image via missourisky )
They ’re stunning , yet easy to explain : rays of light refract in molecules of water , causing a prismatic display of the color spectrum .
The rainbow is made up of “ Roy G. Biv ” ( red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet ) but the colors are actually a continuum , not distinct “ stripes ” of separate hues .
Light Pillars
( Images via wikipedia , wikipedia )
Light pillars are optical illusions , similar to mirages and sometimes confused with crepuscular rays .
These stunning visages are created by light reflecting off horizontal planar surfaces of ice crystals .
Rare , and breathtaking indeed .
Bonus Vintage Highlight : Aurora Borealis
It ’s worth a repeat from elemental light art : the aurora borealis are a surreal combination of unusual air conditions and tempermental physics .
There are actually both northern and southern polar lights .
Aurora , Latin for “ light ” , are most commonly seen in the northern hemisphere ( ” borealis ” for northern , as in the Boreal Forest ) but are also displayed in the southern hemisphere ( ” astralis “ … think Australia ) .
( Image via wikipedia )
The aurora borealis displays are colorful and dynamic , but the aurora astralis are remarkable in their own right , seeming to light up the frigid southern polar expanse with their intense vibrance .

Wandering the booths , with only one day to catch all the new and different products , I did come across a couple of items that are , I believe , worth a brief comment before I write a concluding post to wrap ASPO - USA 4 .
In that post , I will give some of my own interpretation of the conference .
It seems as though I have inhabited two different worlds in the past 24 hours .
I went from the relatively small ( 500 folk ) meeting in Sacramento where Peak Oil is viewed as imminent , to the halls of the Convention Center in Las Vegas , where the Quadrennial MinExpo is showcasing the latest machines to over 41,000 folk involved in the Mining Industry .
It overflows that very large ( 600,000 sq. ft ) building and extends out into the parking lot .
Here , with an industry in considerable profit , the displays were large and much more optimistic than I have seen them in previous years .
The two meetings were , however , joined by a common complaint that the human resource , the engineers and scientists needed by both communities , are in critically short supply .
One of the first things that I noted going into one of the halls was the display by Bucyrus , a company that I have long associated with making equipment that is used to mine coal and minerals at the surface .
The display now includes a significant amount of equipment for underground mining , perhaps a recognition on their part of the changing future of the industry .
At the same time it was hard to miss the number of training simulators that dot the floor of the different halls .
There is a lot of concern about training new employees and management , and the loss of the knowledge base of the industry , but in displays such as this , and the computer generated pictures of the ore in the deposit , there are some answers that technology can give to help .
However , more to the topic of this site I saw that Coal India Ltd ( CIL ) had a booth , and with all the emphasis that was placed on China at the ASPO Conference , it is perhaps useful to give some statistics , from their brochure , on the other country anticipating considerable increased coal use .
India uses coal to meet around 55 % of its industrial power needs , and has estimated reserves of 264 billion tons , with a proven reserve of 102 billion tons , 80 years at current rates of consumption .
CIL mines 84 % of India ’s coal feeding 72 of the 75 thermal power stations in the country ( 64,285 MW ) with the 380 million tons they mine .
Their sales brought in $ 9.69 billion of which $ 1 billion went in tax .
Because of increasing total demand , which is expected to rise to 730 million tons by 2011 - 2012 , CIL will increase its production to 520 million tons , rising to 664 million tons by 2016 - 2017 .
At present 84 % of the coal is mined at the surface , though this may only last some 30 more years .
They recognize that mining will thus have to focus more in the future on underground production .
Indian coal needs to be cleaned to meet international standards at higher prices , and so the company will also invest in larger coal washeries .
It has planted 69 million trees as part of land reclamation after mining .
With 473 mines and 424,000 employees , CIL claims to be the largest coal producing company in the world .
Wandering around the rest of the exhibition , I discovered that EPA has a Coalbed Methane Outreach Program , which it uses to encourage mines to collect and use the methane that is found with the coal , rather than just venting it to atmosphere ( the historic practice ) .
Herewith are some facts from their material .
In 2005 , for example , some 388 million metric tons of CO2E of coal mine methane ( CMM ) was vented , with China leading at 34 % , the US second at 13 % and Russia , North Korea and Ukraine third at 7 % each .
This is about 6 - 10 % of the methane generated by human activity .
Methane is considered to be a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide ( about 20 times by weight ) in trapping heat .
The Methane to Markets program is an international program to make use of this resource .
One illustrative example comes from the Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group in China , which started feeding methane to a 1.6 MW power plant in 1995 , and a second plant , raising total power to 4 MW was added in 2002 .
A third unit bringing power produced up to 120 MW is planned for this year .
A total of more than 166 million cu.m. of gas will then be used .
It is worth noting that this is also the site of Chinese CTL plant .
The methane capture program is part of an effort in China to clean up its air .
China has set a goal of reducing the emissions of major pollutants by 10 percent during this five - year period .
As part of the second Strategic Economic Dialogue , the United States and China have agreed to develop up to 15 large - scale coal mine methane capture and utilization projects in China in the next five years .
One of the problems with the conventional capture of CMM is that it is released from the coal as it is mined , and becomes dangerous as air concentration increases ( since it can ignite and cause a coal mine explosion ) .
To stop this from happening , mines increase the ventilation current to keep the concentrations at safe and low levels .
This makes it difficult to capture and then use the gas .
It also vents large quantities into the atmosphere .
To most effectively capture the gas requires that the coal bed be drained of methane before mining occurs .
This can be done by either drilling horizontal holes from within the mine forward into the coal , or by drilling down from the surface into undeveloped sections of the mine ( or even before the mining has occurred ) .
This is known as degasification .
Methane also migrates into the broken rock over the mining operation and can again build up concentrations over time .
By putting pipes or boreholes into these areas , methane can still be recovered from the abandoned regions of a mine , or even after the mine has closed .
The greatest volume of methane is , however , still emitted as part of the ventilation of the mine at about 46 % of the volume , with only 25 % being captured and used .
It is thus an area where there is a continued need for research and results that will allow total capture of the resource .
Looking at the brochure , however it is from 2002 , more recent values ( from the website ) show the US CMM Emissions for 2006 ( in billions of cubic ft ) :
By the way , and just to prove to those I told at ASPO that I was going to kick some tires that were a whole lot bigger than I , this is a snapshot of one of the haul trucks in the main hall .
There were several parked , one beside the other down the room .
They may each hold up to 400 tons of rock .
There was one final booth that I wanted to comment on and this was the EcoShale booth , describing plans for mining the Utah oil shale .
However because of the details of the process , and the complexity of my discussion of it , I will put that off until another post .
For now I am taking my weary feet and heading back home , and will there try and put together a summary report for the week , to appear soon .

Sen .
John Ensign says Palin not up to presidency , Biden more qualified
The head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee says Sarah Palin is not experienced enough to be president and says Joe Biden is " much more qualified . "
He made comments to Jeff Gillan of NewsONE at 9 .
The exact words :
GILLAN : do you think she 's qualified to be President ?
ENSIGN : well , I do not think that Barack Obama or her are experienced enough to be President of the United States - neither one of them , and Hillary Clinton was much more qualified to be President than Barack Obama was , but that who the nominee is .
John McCain is much more qualified than Barack Obama and certainly Joe Biden is much more qualified than Sarah Palin is .
I 'd rather have the most qualified person at the top of the ticket , not number two .
But Betty Boop did .
A little unnerving in its 1932 Palin prescience :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Thomas Carlyle once called economics " a dismal science . " 
Indeed , economists tend to be cautious and pedestrian , but can you blame them ?
After all , in these troubled times , who could sleep easy knowing these scary stories ?
1. The Irish Potato Famine
When you think of economics , think of food .
Until the late 1800s economic crisis usually meant agricultural crisis , with famine a not - so - infrequent consequence .
Before the advent of industrial agricultural methods , weather conditions and infestations of various kinds had the power to hold the economy hostage .
In 1845 a new fungus , Phytophthora infestans , struck the potato — the mainstay of Ireland 's food supply .
Although the blight lasted only a few years , its effects were far reaching .
As many as 1.5 million died as a direct result of the famine , and many more emigrated in the second half of the 19th century .
Even today , only half as many people live in Ireland as did before the famine .
2. German Hyperinï¬‚ation
By November 1923 in Germany , $ 1 in the United States equaled 4.2 billion German marks , and even daily staples had to be purchased with wheelbarrows of cash .
How did this happen ?
In 1918 Germany lost World War I , suffered a revolution , and became a republic when Emperor Wilhelm II was forced to abdicate .
The Treaty of Versailles , signed a year later , saddled Germany with 6.6 billion British pounds ' worth of reparations .
With the German treasury empty , the government could pay — and conduct its ongoing business — only by printing lots of money : the quickest recipe for inï¬‚ation .
At the height of inï¬‚ation in 1923 , prices rose 40 % per day .
People rushed to the stores as soon as they were paid , before their money became worthless .
The frightful experience of the early 1920s scarred the German national psyche and undermined faith in the Weimar Republic , which helped pave the way for Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party .
In fact , Hitler 's early grab for power — the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich — came on November 8 , 1923 .
3. The Great Depression
During the Roaring ' 20s in the United States , the wealthy spent a lot of money they had , and the not - so - wealthy spent a lot of money they did n't have .
The Great Depression began soon after the stock market crashed in October 1929 , but economists still argue whether the bursting of the 1920s ï¬nancial bubble caused the Depression or merely foretold the coming economic slump .
Either way , by 1932 the economy contracted by 31 % , and some 13 million were left jobless — a quarter of the workforce .
When President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office in 1932 , he started the New Deal , a set of policies to boost federal spending and create government - ï¬ nanced jobs .
Although the economy began growing again in the mid-1930s , the effects of the Depression lingered on until Pearl Harbor .
The number of unemployed fell to 7.6 million in 1936 but rose again to 10 million in 1938 — the same number of men drafted into the armed forces during World War II .
4. The '70s Oil Crisis
The price of oil tends to be slippery — something the economists forgot in the early 1970s when they conï¬dently predicted that crude prices could fall as low as the cost of pumping oil out of the Saudi desert ( estimated at less than $ 1 per barrel ) .
Instead , following the Yom Kippur War between Israel and its Arab neighbors in October 1973 , Arab oil producers declared an embargo .
Oil prices tripled to more than $ 10 per barrel , and gasoline shortages ensued .
By December President Nixon had to announce that because of the energy crisis , the White House Christmas tree would not be lighted .
The 1979 Iranian revolution brought a second oil shock , and oil prices eventually peaked at around $ 35 per barrel .
The oil crisis helped bring on a period of stagï¬‚ation — meaning that even though the U.S. economy barely dragged along , inï¬‚ation continued to rise .
5 . The Asian Flu
The domino - like collapse of several Asian economies in the late 1990s seemed to come out of nowhere .
The " tiger "  economies of Southeast Asia had been booming for years , and the region widely expected to stay an economic powerhouse straight into the upcoming millennium .
Yet in July 1997 things went spectacularly wrong .
Thailand became the catalyst for the crisis , when severe pressure from speculators brought down its currency , the baht .
The Philippine peso and the Malaysian ringgit fell next .
Then the Indonesian rupiah was devalued in August , ushering in political and social turmoil .
Finally , even South Korea , one of the strongest economies in east Asia , nearly went bankrupt and had to be bailed out .
Economists were at a loss to fully explain the crisis .
But as country after country succumbed to the ï¬nancial bug , one lesson seemed clear : an interconnected global economy can transmit panic just as well as it can goods and services .
6. Argentina 's Peso Crisis
During the 1990s Argentina was the star pupil of the International Monetary Fund .
After two decades of runaway inï¬‚ation and collapsing currencies , the Argentine government ï¬nally turned over a new economic leaf in 1992 .
Economy minister Domingo Cavallo helped set up a new currency , the peso , and ï¬rmly linked it to the U.S. dollar .
The government decreed that one peso could always be exchanged for one dollar and that it would print only as many pesos as were backed by dollar reserves .
The system functioned extremely well for a few years , but by late 1997 the overvalued peso and restrictive monetary policies helped bring on a prolonged recession , accompanied by turmoil in ï¬nancial markets .
Successive economy ministers and presidents could ï¬nd no solution .
In December 2001 the Argentine peso was devalued , and the government defaulted on some $ 140 billion in debt , the biggest default on record .

After 50 years the sad truth is revealed ...
by Dan Eden for Viewzone
" It is the meloncholy law of human societies
to be compelled sometimes to choose a great evil
in order to ward off a greater evil . "
- Lyndon Baines Johnson
Some years ago , I received a package containing several CDs .
There was no letter or note enclosed and there was no return address .
Thinking it was a book promotion or some other commercial product for me to review , I gave it a low priority .
The CDs remained on a corner of my desk for several weeks until I finally played them .
Instead of some commercial video describing the usual topics of " Cosmic Consciousness " or the " Hall of Records in Egypt , " the CD had a number of somewhat rough segments containing interviews with some famous individuals .
It also had some files containing scans of a variety of documents which were supported by the narratives in the interviews .
The topic of the collection was familiar to me -- the assassination of president John Kennedy .
But the evidence and conclusion of the data was new to me .
As I reviewed the CDs and checked the validity of the documents it became obvious to me that the murderer of JFK was known .
Most surprising was the realization that the guilty party had been known for some time , but aggressively supressed .
It was Lyndon Baines Johnson !
I spent a couple of weeks checking the sources and validity of the facts presented on the CD .
Sadly , they are all true .
It 's a shocking story and a sad one .
It reveals not only the evil that once existed , but reminds us of the evil that still exists in our country .
It 's a story about power , greed , sex and drugs .
It 's an American story .
Here is what it told :
The Smoking Gun ?
When president Kennedy was shot in Dallas , Texas in 1963 , police and the FBI stormed the Texas Book Depository and located a rifle near an open window .
The so - called " sniper 's nest " had been made by arranging several cardboard boxes so as to both hide the shooter from anyone who might have been on the 6th floor at the time and also to support the rifle while the shooter took aim from the window overlooking the president 's motorcade .
Investigators scoured the scene for fingerprints but the rifle and the boxes had apparently been wiped clean .
The only forensic element that could possibly identify the killer was a partial fingerprint that was lifted from one of the cardboard boxes .
In an attempt to identify this print , officials took the prints of everyone who worked at the Book Depository , including the main suspect , Lee Harvey Oswald .
They also compared this print to police and FBI agents who had access to the crime scene , but the print remained an enigma .
The print , as it turns out , belongs to Malcolm Wallace , the long time friend and associate of president Lyndon Baines Johnson .
Those unfamiliar with the methods of matching fingerprints may want to quickly review the protocols in a recent viewzone article on the subject .
Unlike the visual convergence that is shown on TV shows like CSI [ and the image above ] , most prints are not matched by this method .
Fingerprints can become distorted , bent and stretched by the surface of various objects .
The science of fingerprint analysis instead examines many unique features found in the fingerprint patterns .
It is an exact science .
A match is given a score based on the number of elements that are identical on any two sets of prints .
A " match " is usually confirmed if there are at least 12 identical elements .
The prints from Dallas and Wallace match on 14 unique points .
What 's more intriguing is that a recent documentary on the subject obtained the analysis of a fingerprint expert who had done this type of work for 35 years .
Upon his examination he found a correlation of 34 points .
There 's no doubt -- it 's Wallace .
Who exactly is Malcolm Wallace ?
Malcolm Wallace was born and educated in Texas .
He was an intelligent man who graduated from the University of Texas and was quickly recruited by Lyndon Johnson and given a job at the Federal Department of Agriculture .
He first came to the attention of authorities when he was arrested in 1951 , tried and convicted of killing a professional golfer named John Douglas Kinser .
At the time , Kinser was having an affair with Lyndon Johnson 's sister , Josefa -- and was also involved with Wallace 's wife .
Josepha was an alcoholic and drug user .
She had a reputation for being promiscuous and , especially when she was high , she disclosed personal information and stories about Lyndon .
It was feared that she might have already disclosed some illegal acivities about Johnson to Kinser , specifically certain activities he had engaged in during his race for the Senate .
Kinser was gunned down in his golf club .
Shortly after , Wallace was arrested and found guilty of First Degree Murder .
During his 10 day trial , Wallace was represented by LBJ 's own lawyer .
Johnson took a room near to the courthouse and had runners keep him updated on the testimony and proceedings .
To everyone 's surprise , the trial concluded with Wallace receiving a 5 years suspended sentence !
Later , in 1961 , Wallace again was implicated in another murder for Johnson .
This time the victim was Henry Marshall , an official with the local Agriculture Department who had been investigating an illegal source of Johnson 's funding .
In 1961 , State Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation official Henry Marshall was investigating a broad series of fraudulent government subsidies -- amounting to figures in the seven or eight digit range -- allotted to Billie Sol Estes , a close personal friend of Senate Majority Leader then Vice - President Lyndon B. Johnson .
Marshall had uncovered a paper trail that was leading him closer and closer to Johnson himself .
It is reported that all the guilty parties held a meeting at which Johnson gave the order , " Get rid of him . "
On June 3 , 1961 , Mac Wallace knocked Henry Marshall unconscious with a blunt object , fed the unconscious man carbon monoxide from a hose attached to Wallace 's pick - up truck , then shot him five times with a bolt - action .22 caliber rifle and dumped him in a remote corner of Marshall 's farm near Franklin , Texas .
Justice of the Peace Lee Farmer pronounced the death a suicide and ordered Marshall buried without an autopsy -- over the protests of Marshall 's widow .
Despite this , the local authorities , under the influence of the Johnson gang , declared that he had " committed suicide . "
Fearing that his sister might pose a threat to his political career , LBJ had more work for Wallace .
On December 25 , 1961 , LBJ 's sister , Josefa Johnson , was found dead in bed at her Fredericksburg , Texas home at 3:15 am .
The cause of death was stated to be a brain hemorrhage .
Josefa Johnson had returned home at 11:45 pm from a Christmas party at Lyndon Johnson 's ranch .
There was no autopsy and no inquest ; the death certificate was executed by a doctor who was not present to examine the deceased .
Ms. Johnson was embalmed on Christmas Day and buried on December 26th
We 'll return to Wallace later in this article .
But first , let 's take a closer look at the " boss " -- LBJ .
Presidents Suleiman and Assad held a groundbreaking summit in August Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad has issued a decree to set up diplomatic ties with Lebanon and open an embassy .
Anti-Syrian politicians in Lebanon and their Western backers have long called on Syria to recognise its sovereignty by establishing official ties .
The presidential decree did not say when the embassy would open in Beirut or give any further details .
Syrian troops left Lebanon in 2005 ending years of military and political domination by the giant neighbour .
The decree announced " the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Syrian Arab Republic and the Lebanese Republic and the creation of a diplomatic mission at ambassador level in the Lebanese capital Beirut , " Syria 's official news agency reported .
Lebanese officials said Foreign Minister Fawzi Salloukh would visit Damascus on Wednesday and the timing of the next moves would be announced later .
Tensions Syria and Lebanon have been in the process of normalising relations and their presidents have made clear in recent months their intention to start diplomatic ties .
But tensions have been raised again since September when Syria deployed 10,000 troops on the northern Lebanese border , prompting anti-Syria politicians in Beirut to raise the possibility of an invasion .
Washington - a strong backer of the Lebanese anti-Syrian movement - has said it is concerned about the troop movements and warned Damascus against interfering in Lebanon .
President Michel Suleiman - who has the support of both Lebanon 's pro- and anti-Syrian factions - said he accept Syria 's explanation that the deployment is to prevent smuggling .
Many Lebanese blame Syria for the killing of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri in 2005 .
An international tribunal into Mr Hariri 's death , which has already implicated the Syrian intelligence apparatus , is still a major potential stumbling block in bilateral ties .
Damascus strongly denies any involvement in Mr Hariri 's death .
During a groundbreaking visit to Damascus by Mr Suleiman in August , the two sides also agreed to tackle longstanding Lebanese demands to demarcate borders and investigate the question of missing Lebanese prisoners in Syria .
Correspondents say Damascus still has considerable influence over Lebanese affairs , much to the frustration of anti-Syrian politicians .
Syria 's close ally , the Lebanese Hezbollah movement , which has Lebanon 's most powerful military force , is now part of a national unity government and has the power of veto over its decisions .

WHEN people discover that I am a political reporter , they often ask me for the inside scoop .
" You 've travelled with Obama and McCain .
You 've sat at the back of their planes .
What 's it like ?
What 's the big difference between the two campaigns ? "
I 'd have to say it 's the food .
John McCain 's campaign serves macho Republican meals .
There are cooked breakfasts , chunks of dead animals on sticks and coffee that tastes like coffee .
One day following Mr McCain in Nebraska I ate beef five times .
( To be fair , the last time was in a hotel restaurant , where I could have ordered something wussier .
But who eats coquilles St Jacques more than a thousand miles from the sea ? )
On Mr Obama 's plane , by contrast , the breakfasts are designed to keep scribblers lean and liberal .
There are little plastic pots of cereal , no doubt rich in vitamins and fibre .
There are little tubs of chopped fruit .
There are cups of " coffee " that have clearly never met a coffee bean .
AFP
Who 's the real latte - drinker , Senator ?
The cereal and the fruit I can understand .
But what is the point of being a latte - drinking , sushi-eating , Volvo - driving progressive if you can't get a decent cup of coffee ?
The Onion , which is normally scrupulously accurate , recently depicted the Democratic candidate holding a delicious - looking latte as part of a story entitled “ Portrayal of Obama as Elitist Hailed as Step Forward for African - Americans ” .
But this is a serious distortion .
In fact , it is John McCain who is most often seen with a Starbucks cup in his hand .
He seems to live on the stuff .
Travelling with the candidates is hard work .
You wake up too early and do n't remember which state you are in .
You gather to have your bags sniffed by secret - service dogs .
You jump into the bus that will take you to the airport .
And then you wait .
And wait .
The motorcade will leave the moment the candidate is ready .
But that could take some time .
The waiting hacks read papers , surf the web and swap tales of unreasonable editors .
( Not me .
The others .
My editors are all wonderful .
OK ? )
Finally , we set off .
John McCain used to invite reporters to come and sit with him and chew the fat for hours every day .
It was fun .
We learned what he thinks about everything from health care to Waziristan .
He joked around , spoke his mind and wandered delightfully off - message .
But since late summer , his advisors have curbed him .
Now he is barely more accessible than his rival , which is saying something .
Back home , one of my African - American neighbours , who is terrified that Mr Obama will be assassinated , asked me if he has any security .
Are you kidding ?
He is surrounded by big yet agile men with guns and sharp eyes .
They hustle him into cars with darkened windows .
They block off freeways so his motorcade can zoom by .
They make sure that no one comes within distant eyeshot of him without first being checked for weapons .
My neighbour is concerned that crazed racists out there are plotting to take down the first black president .
And it is true that , from time to time , maniacs make threats .
But my impression is that such people are neither serious nor well - organised .
And you would have to very , very well - organised to get past the secret service .
My neighbour should sleep easy .
Meanwhile , a chum of mine working for a French wire service has a problem .
Mr Obama is holding a rally in a school sports stadium in Pennsylvania .
My friend smokes , and smoking is barred on school property .
He has to slip outside the security cordon for a puff .
Being a journalist , he looks shifty .
To the untrained eye , he also looks vaguely Middle Eastern .
Every tobacco break leads to him being stopped and questioned by state troopers .
Mr Obama is always urging crowds to get " fired up " .
But when someone tries to light up ...
Tablets to improve calcium and vitamin D . If new mothers have a vitamin D deficiency , their breastfed babies likely need vitamin D supplements , experts say .
Q&A : VITAMIN D Q&A : VITAMIN D Evidence is growing that vitamin D , which the skin makes from sunshine , is linked to lower risk of breast cancer and other cancers .
But that does n't mean it 's good to get a golden tan -- and certainly not a sunburn .
Vitamin D also is in certain foods and supplements , though the effectiveness varies .
Here 's the lowdown : Q : How much sun should I get ?
A : Many experts believe just 15 minutes a few times a week without sunscreen is sufficient and safe for most light - skinned people , but this is controversial .
Q : I 'm black .
Does my skin absorb enough ultraviolet rays to produce sufficient vitamin D? A : In most cases , no .
And some experts believe this may be one reason blacks have higher rates of cancer than whites .
Nutrition specialists think vitamin D - 3 supplements may be especially helpful for dark - skinned people .
But you 'll have to read the label to find D - 3 most multivitamins do n't contain it .
Q : How much do I need ?
A : Scientists think adults may need 1,000 international units ( IUs ) a day , possibly 1,500 for cancer prevention .
The government says 2,000 IUs is the upper daily limit for anyone over a year old .
Any more can cause the body to retain dangerous amounts of calcium .
Q. What about food sources ?
A. Vitamin D is in salmon , tuna and other oily fish , and is routinely added to milk .
But diet accounts for very little of the vitamin D circulating in blood .
Q : For years , we 've been told to use sunscreen .
Should n't we be worried about skin cancer ?
A : Sunscreen is advised for longer periods outdoors , to prevent skin cancer .
Skin cancer is rarely fatal .
Melanoma , the deadliest kind , accounts for less than 2 % of cancer deaths .
The risks posed by other , more common cancers is far greater .
VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY
Americans with low vitamin D levels :
As as many as 36 % of Americans are vitamin D deficient 40 % of infants and toddlers tested below the optimal blood threshold for vitamin D Sources : National Center for Health Statistics ; Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine .
To reduce rates of the bone - softening disease rickets and improve long - term bone health , the American Academy of Pediatrics is doubling its recommendation of vitamin D for babies , children and adolescents , according to a new clinical report out today .
The report suggests children receive 400 IU ( international units ) a day of vitamin D , beginning in the first few days of life — a big leap from a 2003 recommendation that suggested only half that amount starting in the first two months of life .
VITAMIN D : Low levels may raise risk of death TESTING : Requests soar as deficiency - diseases linked " We are doubling the recommended amount of vitamin D children need each day because evidence has shown this could have life - long health benefits , " says chairman of the AAP National Committee on Nutrition and a lead author of the group 's new report .
" Supplementation is important because most children will not get enough vitamin D through diet alone . "
Foods rich in vitamin D include fortified milk and cereals and oily fish , says Catherine Gordon , an endocrinologist and director of the Children 's Hospital Bone Health Program , Children 's Hospital Boston .
Though sunlight is a good source , UV rays can cause other health risks , she says .
Breast - fed babies are especially at risk , according to the study authors .
" Breastfeeding is the best source of nutrition for infants .
However , because of vitamin D deficiencies in the maternal diet , which affect the vitamin D in a mother 's milk , it is important that breastfed infants receive supplements of vitamin D , " says Carol Wagner , a member of the AAP Section on Breastfeeding Executive Committee and co-author of the report .
It is important to note that the new recommendation pertains to healthy infants , children and adolescents , Gordon says .
" There are children with chronic disease — such as epilepsy , celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease — who need much higher vitamin D doses to avoid vitamin D deficiency . "
The new recommendations from the Academy of Pediatrics include : • Breastfed and partially breastfed babies should be supplemented with 400 IU a day of vitamin D beginning in the first few days of life .
• All non -breastfed infants , as well as older children , who are consuming less than one quart per day of vitamin D - fortified formula or milk , should receive a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU a day .
• Adolescents who do not obtain 400 IU of vitamin D per day through foods should receive a supplement containing that amount .
• Children with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency , such as those taking certain medications , may need higher doses of vitamin D. Guidelines :

Airliner had near miss with UFO
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement A passenger jet bound for Heathrow Airport had a near miss with a UFO , Ministry of Defence files reveal .
The captain of the Alitalia airliner shouted " Look out " to his co-pilot at the sight of a brown missile - shaped object shooting past them overhead .
Civil Aviation Authority and military investigations could not explain the 1991 incident near Lydd in Kent .
The unsolved close encounter features in UFO - related military documents made available by the National Archives .
After ruling out the object flying past the Alitalia jet being a missile , weather balloon or space rocket , the MoD closed the inquiry .
Nineteen files covering sightings between 1986 and 1992 are being made available online .
Now you can look at the actual primary material - the stuff coming into the MoD every day - and make your own mind up
Dr David Clarke , UFO expert Almost 200 such files will be made available by the MoD over the next four years .
The current batch also includes a US Air Force pilot 's account of being ordered to shoot down a UFO that appeared on his radar while he flew over East Anglia .
There is also an MoD request that army and navy helicopters not take photographs of crop circles , because of concerns about undermining the official line that the military did not investigate unexplained phenomena .
And the files also contain a letter from a woman claiming to be from the Sirius system who said her spacecraft - also containing two " Spectrans " with " Mr Spock ears " - crashed in Britain during World War II .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The chances of there being nothing else in billions of cubic light years is too slim to consider Myles Harcourt UFO expert and journalism lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University , Dr David Clarke , said the documents would shed new light on relatively little - known sightings .
He said some conspiracy theorists would already have decided that the release of the papers was a " whitewash " .
He added : " Because the subject is bedevilled by charlatans and lunatics , it is career suicide to have your name associated with UFOs , which is a real pity .
" The National Archives are doing a fantastic job here .
Everyone brings their own interpretation .
" Now you can look at the actual primary material - the stuff coming into the MoD every day - and make your own mind up . "

As Crowley notes , she was noticeably absent from the TV airwaves .
While Biden was making the network and cable rounds for his guy , Team McCain had Palin with an invite - only crowd at an Irish pub in Philly .
CNN 's Peter Hamby turns a memorable pool report , which you can read in full after the jump .
Do n't miss the kicker .
Broad Street Bullies , indeed .
Fresh off an afternoon jog along the Schuylkill River , Sarah Palin stopped by a debate watching party at The Irish Pub on Walnut Street in downtown Philadelphia .
It was an invite - only event that pulled in about 450 McCain supporters who had been drinking and eating for several hours before the candidate arrived ( around 7:20 PM EST ) .
It was Palin 's first campaign stop in Philadelphia this cycle .
It was a boisterous night , both inside and outside the bar .
About 300 protesters had gathered outside the event , loudly chanting " Obama ! Obama ! "
Some set off flares .
Your pooler has covered Palin since Aug. 29th , and this was one of the largest , rowdiest group of protesters I have seen so far .
Some of the protester signs included :
" McSame / Failin ' "
" Hey Hockey Mom -- keep the puck out of PA "
" Just like Bush in lipstick "
And so on .
Inside the watch party , it was the picture of a warm , boisterous Friday night in a Philadelphia pub , except that only one of the flat screen TVs was tuned into the Phillies - Nats game .
The rest were on C - SPAN in anticipation of the debate , so these Palin fans were sipping brew as Eni F.H. Faleomavaega ( D - American Samoa ) offered statements on the House floor regarding the US - India Nuclear Agreement .
Two of Palin 's senior advisers pulled up a chair to the bar to down a couple pints of stout .
Palin entered the bar after the press pool was pre-positioned in the rear of the venue .
Donning a red Phillies jacket that was purchased for her earlier in the day , Palin came in to a loud roar , and the bar quickly descended into a mob scene .
She was dressed casually , wearing jeans , a brown leather belt with a leopard - print buckle , and a white t- shirt underneath the Phillies jacket that read " Sarahcuda . "
The governor was also sporting an odd , psychadelic " John McCain 2008 " button that a supporter had given her .
Pub - goers swarmed her asking for pictures and autographs , pleading with secret service agents and handlers just to get a handshake .
She made her way through the crowd , all smiles , and stepped up on a dais in the corner to make some brief remarks :
" Thank you .
Thanks for inviting us into The Irish Pub and we know this is going to be a great night for our ticket .
Thank you for being here for rooting on John McCain tonight in the debate even , you guys , thank you .
Yeah .
" Great to be here in the city of brotherly and sisterly love .
Thank you and we feel that .
And truly all the support that you 're providing us in this area that is so paramount to victory on November 4th .
We thank you so much for all your support .
Hope we all get around to meet each and every one of you so I can personally thank you guys for the support that you 're showing and for being so reform - minded and knowing that we have opportunity to put government back on the side of the people and shake things up in DC .
" And for that I thank you for being on the team , and hopefully we can bring more people from this area on that team , you guys , truly .
As our mission , getting to dc shaking things up , working for you .
John McCain and I will never forget whom we are working for is for you .
So we love you guys , city of brotherly love .
Thank you . "
The candidate then took another 45 minutes working her way through the sweaty crowd , glad - handing and saying hello to most of the crowd .
She said " thank you " and " bless your heart " to many folks .
One supporter wished her luck on the trail and Palin said , " Thank you .
I 'm having so much fun . "
She signed autographs in this way : " S Palin ' 08 "
A group of middle - aged guys were wearing blue - and - red hockey jerseys that said " USA " and " VP " on the front , and " Palin " on the back .
One of the men told me he had them made in Canada .
They had Palin sign the jerseys , and then they gave her one .
Dr. Maria Demario , a doctor from Media , leaned in to say , " Bless you .
Stay true to your convictions .
We are so proud of you . "
Palin smiled warmly and said thanks .
Josh Okulski , a Philadelphia native , had taped juxtaposing photos of Obama on a bicycle and Palin on a motorcycle to the back of his jacket .
He showed it to Palin and she said : " Where did you get that ?
That 's crazy ! "
Okulski then snapped a self - portrait of himself with the governor on his iPhone .
At one point while working the crowd she made a reference to " our union brothers and sisters , " but I could not hear the full context .
A local reporter in the scrum leaned in and asked Palin if she was seeing much of Philadelphia .
" Two months ago I did when I was here for the National Governor 's Association meeting , " Palin said , " so we got a lot of that in there , but with my 13 year - old who 's with me this time , Willow , we 're taking her around to see some of the sights also . "
Towards the end of her walk - through , he chatted with a man wearing a gray Philadelphia Flyers hat .
He gave it to her , and she wore it for the final few minutes of the event .
No Eagles gear .
When she emerged from the bar , she was met with a harsh chorus of boos from the protesters outside .
As she entered the motorcade to head back to her hotel , one man 's voice cut through the din of the crowd .
" I can see Alaska from Walnut Street ! , " he yelled .

Michele Bachmann address a news conference .
' I never called all liberals anti-American '
Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) said on MSNBC ’s “ Hardball ” Friday that Barack Obama may have “ anti-American views ” and that the news media should conduct a “ penetrating exposé ” to determine whether members of Congress are “ pro-America or anti-America . ”
Politico asked Bachmann what she meant .
Advertisement
Last Friday , all the liberal special interests from California to Vermont found a new outlet for their energy , their frustrations and their money .
That would be in defeating me .
In a matter of 48 hours after I participated in an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC ’s “ Hardball , ” more than $ 640,000 from donors across the country flooded into my opponent ’s campaign .
Almost to a one , these are people who never would have considered voting for me if they lived in Minnesota .
In fact , most of them have probably never voted for a Republican .
These are strong supporters of Barack Obama who want to see more liberal policies enacted in Washington .
These are not people who know anything about my policy views .
They do n’t know anything about my record of reaching across the aisle on issues ranging from support for small business to foster care improvements , an issue near and dear to my heart as a former foster mother to 23 troubled teens .
Or about my record of standing up to my own party when the occasion calls for it — such as opposing the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout — and standing up to members of the other party when they try to push through tax hikes or limit personal liberty .
These are not even people who know anything about my opponent or his positions on the issues — though they are willing to donate to him based on a few minutes of listening to the political echo chamber .
They have been riled up by a spin machine in serious overdrive as we come down the homestretch to Election Day .
Despite the way the blogs and the Democratic Party are spinning it , I never called all liberals anti-American , I never questioned Barack Obama ’s patriotism , and I never asked for some House Un- American Activities Committee witch hunt into my colleagues in Congress .
What I did was ask legitimate questions that Minnesotans have been asking me :
What does Barack Obama mean by change ?
He sounds good when he talks about hope and change — there ’s no denying that .
But what types of policies would come from an Obama White House ?
He has n’t had a long record in office , but what we do know is that he ’s been rated the most liberal senator .
Beyond that , we have to look for other ways to discern the substance behind his pretty platitudes .
Why is n’t it appropriate to ask about the formative relationships he ’s had ?
The types of relationships that may have influenced Barack Obama ’s views on public policy and on government decision making ?
Why is the media more intent on learning the type of plumbing license Joe the Plumber has than on exploring the obvious questions about Barack Obama ’s formative relationships with people such as the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers — people with views far outside the mainstream , where most voters find themselves ?
For at least two years , the American people are potentially looking at a liberal policy agenda dominating Washington from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue .
In fact , it ’s conceivable that the Democrat majority in the Senate could be large enough that the traditional minority right to filibuster would be entirely eviscerated .
So why is n’t it appropriate to ask what that policy agenda would look like ?
Of course , none of these points has been noted in any subsequent media reports of the interview .
It ’s like a political version of the children ’s game of telephone .
I make a statement in an interview .
Chris Matthews distorts it — as he is paid so well to do .
The liberal blogs contort it even more .
The speaker of the House and other Democrat leaders utter absolute lies about what was said in the interview .
Then the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee picks it up and runs with it , buying $ 1 million for negative ads so that they do n’t have to talk about the issues .
And it ’s the issues that the voters in Minnesota ’s 6th District want to talk about .
Everywhere I go , people ask about the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout , and they want to know why we ’re saddling taxpayers with generations of debt to pay for risky decisions by Wall Street financiers .
There ’s a clear distinction between my position on this bailout — I opposed it both times it came before the House — and that of my opponent , who says he would have supported it .
The Democrats do n’t want to talk about the pocketbook issues that are really on the minds of Minnesotans .
Those voters were concerned about how much it cost to fill their tank with gas this summer , but that pales in comparison to how much it might cost to heat their homes this winter .
They want to know how they ’re going to pay their mortgage and their grocery bills .
Again , my record and my opponent ’s are clearly different when it comes to the family budget .
I ’ve always stood up for lower taxes and against wasteful government spending .
But when you ca n’t win on the issues , you steal the election with a couple of lies and $ 1 million worth of mud .
And the media reports and Democrat responses to my interview on “ Hardball ” have been echoing the outright lies of the liberal blogs .
Is it really any wonder people are so cynical about politics ?

Treasury Secretary Paulson ’s Financial Disappearing
Act of 2008 is a charade .
Lawmakers who dug in and blocked this act of economic treason deserve applause .
The Orwellian name of the legislation itself should have frozen every American citizen in his tracks .
The economy is not about to implode and if it were , it ’s doubtful if government would do it anything but harm .
The financial markets are in a crisis of confidence because the US government is debasing its currency and stiffing its creditors .
Uncle Sam is a deadbeat and the world knows it .
The world is worrying what to do about the useless paper it ’s holding .
That ’s what the panic is about .
It ’s a strange day when Barry Goldwater and the Chinese Communists are in agreement ….
And they are both right .
Want to really stabilize the market ?
Put the government ’s financial house in order .
Pay down the debt .
Let the losers take their losses .
Tighten belts .
The economy is not in good shape , but it can still be whipped back into it .
It will only take financial discipline and some willingness to accept hardship .
Instead , since last summer , Federal Reserve chairman Bernanke has embarked on a series of epic blunders in the opposite direction .
Worried about cheap money ?
Give ’em cheaper money !
What does it mean that the banks have a liquidity crisis overlaying a solvency crisis ?
It means they are broke .
The loans are defaulting and no one will lend any more .
Why should they ?
They have n’t got back what they lent out before .
What did you expect ?
That is the result of the bankers ’ own stupidity , recklessness , and arrogance .
The remedy for it is not to hold up the rest of the population like gangsters and demand at gunpoint that they hand over their wallets .
Money is in plentiful supply all over the world — especially in the accounts of the very people who are demanding our money .
And , by the way , what ’s in it for Donald Trump that he ’s come out to defend all this ?
And what ’s in it for Warren Buffett who also defends Paulson ?
Paulson , Buffett and Hank Greenberg ( the former chief of corrupt insurance giant AIG , now a charity child of the Federal Reserve ) have all been in business together , one way or other .
And some of that business does n’t smell right .
We now know the bailout of AIG was also a bailout of Goldman Sachs , its counterparty on a number of deals .
This spring the government handed down convictions to employees in one of Buffett ’s reinsurance outfits , General Re , which did business with AIG .
For decades , Greenberg has been at the center of multiple frauds including falsification of documents offshore and bid-rigging back home .
His close associate , Mike Murphy , who lobbied successfully for tax treaties with Bermuda and set up many of the alter ego companies that were part of the fraud , has shredded documents to hide evidence .
[ There is also a behind - the - scenes power struggle at AIG between Greenberg and the post - Greenberg management , which has been cooperating with the FBI .
That ’s relevant to what ’s happening too . ]
What AIG did was hide losses in affiliated businesses that it owned .
It did it by phony risk transfer deals .
Risk transfers get better accounting treatment than loans .
The fake deals also helped to reduce reserve requirements on the books so that AIG could look better to stockholders .
That means the fraud worked both to boost prices and to shortchange shareholders of their dividends for years — at least through the ’90s and then again from 2000 — 2004 .
And who do you suppose sold some of those credit default swaps to AIG and its reinsurers ?
You guessed it — Hank Paulson ’s old bank , Goldman Sachs .
This is not just a problem of mortgage securities gone bad , as Buffett said in his public defense of Paulson and AIG .
No .
This is a matter of decades of white collar criminality , cronyism , and reckless business practices by leading banks and financial businesses , a massive bubble of stupidity , arrogance and greed that the market refuses to swallow any more .
Right at the center are the very financiers who set it off .
AIG was phonying its books long before the housing bubble , at least since Alan Greenspan began cranking out liquidity on the cheap at the end of the 1980s .
That is , as soon as the junk - bond mania died and the stock market crashed , money was injected into the system by Maestro Greenspan through low interest rates .
The tech bubble was inflated .
Goldman Sachs was in the thick of it , sending a tidal wave of credit across the globe through new and complex derivatives and through electronic trading .
MIPs , SPVs , SIVs .
These off - book vehicles and other hedges ( for Ghana ’s Ashanti Gold , for AIG , for Enron , even for Fannie and Freddie ) were developed before the real estate bubble , some to skirt tax rules , others to make the books look better .
What they also did was blind the companies who used them to the risks and losses they had on their books .
Accounting rules and business practices that rewarded managers in the short - term exacerbated the problem .
They encouraged shortsighted deal - making , quickie trading into hedge - funds , opaque off - book entities , and accounting swindles of all sorts .
Now the bar tab has come due and our boon companions are making their excuses and exiting in a hurry .
Guess who ’s paying ?
After turning his own investment bank into a hedge - fund , the Treasury Secretary now wants to turn the government into a super hedge - fund .
That is all this business amounts to .
The government is insuring the bad assets .
Well , as the AIG case shows , accounting tricks can turn insurance into loans or anything else .
Bad debt becomes a troubled asset .
Then the trouble passes ( into our pockets ) and out from the other end of the sleeve comes a white rabbit .
Welcome to the age of trompe l’oeil capitalism .
The Bush administration has already vanished a trillion ( and counting ) into the black hole of the Iraq war .
Then there is the infamous trillion ( and counting ) that seems to have disappeared from the Defense Department under former Comptroller of Defense , Dov Zakheim , between 2001 — 2004 ( Zakheim is now back in the Bush administration as a wartime contracts commissioner ) .
Why should this trillion be any different ?
Especially when we know Goldman Sachs is not only a big government contractor , it also defrauded the municipalities it sold bonds to ?
Look at the bill closely .
Section 2 ( Purposes ) states that it " provides authority to the Treasury Secretary to restore liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system and to ensure the economic well - being of Americans . "
That this legislation gives unprecedented authority to the Treasure Secretary is blindingly clear to everyone .
As to the next point , liquidity cannot be restored by decree .
It is not money alone but confidence that is being withheld .
As to the last part , it is drivel , and offensive drivel from a government that has bankrupted the country and crippled the future of its sons and daughters .
Contra Nancy Pelosi , who detects an inaudible voice of the people whispering in its leaves , this bill is nothing more than a loud crude Ave Caesar to the bankers .
There does not seem to be any more obvious point about the whole business than that the former CEO of Goldman Sachs gets more power .
In Section 101 the Treasury Secretary is given authority to establish a Troubled Asset Relief Program ( “ TARP ” ) and an Office of Financial Stability ( OFS ) within the Treasury Department to implement it that will coordinate with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( the Fed ) , the FDIC , the Comptroller of the Currency , the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) .
Is your head spinning ?
TARP is simply doublespeak .
It could have come straight from the old Soviet politburo .
There are no assets involved here .
These are liabilities .
These liabilities are not troubled ; they are junk .
And why do we need the Orwellian Office of Financial Stability ?
Is this the Minifinanz of the new United Sachs of America ?
Minifinanz seems to bypass or parallel departments we already have .
It actually looks strangely like a Treasury equivalent of Douglas Feith ’s Office of Strategic Influence , which " stove - piped " false information to the President .
Section 102 creates a program to guarantee the bad loans ( sorry , troubled assets ) by creating risk - based premiums to cover anticipated claims .
Well — the claims are going to come , and they will be even higher , now that the claimants know that Uncle Sam , the Supreme Court , and the military are backing them .
Because that is what the full faith and credit of the US ultimately means .
The US government has got itself into the insurance business .
Officially , this time .
Odd coincidence that earlier this year , Mr. Paulson was pushing a centralized insurance program that would bypass state insurance regulators .
Odder yet , Mr. Paulson ’s old firm Goldman Sachs , wrote many of the derivatives on the credit swaps filling the books of AIG , which the Federal Reserve recently rescued to the tune of $ 85 billion .
Oddest of all , AIG has been fighting NY State ’s insurance regulators on civil and criminal charges , as I noted .
Should someone point out that the remedy for state regulators who try to overreach and push federal regulators is not for the federal government to do an end run around state regulation ?
This may help Mr. Paulson ’s cronies .
It will not help federalism .
In the area of oversight also the bill is deficient .
In Sec 103 of the bill we find that it is Mr. Paulson who alone decides which institutions get to be vanished up his sleeve .
And in Sec 104 we find that oversight of Mr. Paulson will be conducted by …well , Mr. Paulson .
Yes , the charmingly named Financial Stability Oversight Board ( Drop the " Federal " and you are left with SOBs ) will also have Chairman Bernanke , the SEC chair and the Secy. of HUD , and the Director of the FHFA — but we are not inclined to think that these worthies are any more than rubber stamps for the world ’s most powerful banker .
Sec 105 requires Paulson to report to Congress within 2 months and for every 50 million spent .
But two months is a long time in the markets and 50 million can go up and out a lot of sleeves .
Does Congress know enough about pricing mechanisms to see through any foul play ?
Should n’t Paulson instead report to independent experts with authority and experience in the real market , who are not appointed by Congress but are self - selected by their peers ?
As for regulatory modernization , we recall derivatives regulation came up in the late 1990s .
It was the former chief of Mr. Paulson ’s old bank , then Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , and Federal Reserve Chairman , Alan Greenspan , who blocked it .
But apart from the bizarre spectacle of bank managers handing stickup guys the keys to the vault , there are other problems .
How do the rights granted to Paulson ( 106 ) relate to other government departments ?
Why ca n’t the management of assets be done within existing bureaucracies and laws ?
How extensive are Paulson ’s new rights ?
Can they be revoked ?
How easily ?
How can the Secretary of the Treasury determine the interests of the public on his own ( Sec 107 ) ?
And how can he waive Federal regulations on his own ( 107 ) ?
How can the Secretary manage conflicts of interest ( 108 ) , when the power given him here is in itself a conflict of interest ?
Why is the FDIC in the asset - managing business ?
( 107 )
Why should foreign banks be told to act in concert with ours ?
( 112 )
( They do anyway , but putting it into law makes global government official . )
And if the government ’s interests are to be protected , why does the government only get nonvoting warrants , and not shareholder votes , in the institutions participating in the program ?
( 113 )
Buy this book .
The media talks as if the bill gives Paulson $ 350 billion and he has to work for everything else .
Actually , it authorizes the full amount .
The only brakes are on the speed with which he gets the rest .
The President can request anything over $ 250 billion and the burden of disapproval is placed on a joint resolution of Congress .
How easy will that be to obtain ?
For all the talk about helping home owners and punishing CEO ’s , there is also little about either in the bill .
And what there is is set up poorly .
Buy this book .
Mitigating foreclosures ( 109 ) and modifying loans terms are both unjust to homeowners who ’ve abided by their loan terms or have already suffered foreclosure .
It creates a serious moral hazard problem and encourages more and more claims on the government .
Skip the lofty rhetoric .
Marketing bad loans does not help the feckless and improvident ( a number of whom are not poor ) , any more than selling credit cards helps them .
You might as well hand out bottles to alcoholics .
And more bad loans certainly do n’t help people who are really hurting .
Likewise , the penalties for participating firms hardly amount to a slap of the wrist ( 111 ) .
If we ’re serious about punishing the guilty , there should be disgorgement of all bonuses , incentives and golden parachutes , and severe penalties for unprofessional and illegal conduct .
Retroactive pay - cuts for senior managers is in order .
This bill was never about helping anyone but the same crowd who got us into this mess .
It ’s legislative chicanery that does little more than clear the board and shuffle the cards for the next round of government - backed gambling with financiers who hold the trumps ( and Buffetts ) and make jokers out of all of us .
No more three - card monte and disappearing acts , please .
The stakes are too high now .
The Best of Lila Rajiva
D uring the historic week of September 14 , 2008 , the executive branch of the U.S. government made a bold move .
Under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , the federal government proposed a rescue plan for Wall Street , featuring a $ 700 billion program to buy up bad mortgage assets and an outright ban on short - selling 799 financial stocks .
In any analysis it is important to distinguish motives from economic effects .
Unfortunately , the effects of the plan will be quite negative .
Possibly worse than the direct effects is that the bailout was introduced by a president who is a self - proclaimed free marketer .
Once the bailout has negative effects , therefore , these consequences may well be taken as evidence that “ markets fail ” and , if so , would be used to justify even more government intervention in the future .
What follows is an analysis of the effects of these actions and of policies that created the initial crisis .
The SEC’s Ban on Short Sales of Financial Stocks
As part of the government ’s efforts to contain panic in the financial markets , the SEC announced that the $ 700 bailout would be accompanied by a ban on ( initially ) 799 financial stocks considered vulnerable to “ predatory ” speculators .
Besides the abstract argument over liberty versus security , there is the very practical question of whether the ban will actually provide a floor — versus a ceiling — for financial stocks in the long run .
When an investor expects a stock ’s price to rise , he can profit by “ going long ” — i.e. , by buying shares of the stock .
If , however , an investor is pessimistic about a stock , she can sell its shares at the currently overvalued price .
If the investor does n’t own any shares to begin with , she can “ short ” the stock .
What happens is that her brokerage borrows shares of stock from current owners and then sells them to lock in the current price for the investor .
Assuming that the price of the stock drops as the investor had anticipated , she then instructs her broker to “ cover the short ” by buying back the shares and returning them to the lender .
During the period of the short , the investor , in effect , owns a negative amount of the stock , to counterbalance the extra positive shares held by the new owner ( who bought the shares when the investor shorted them ) .
Because the short - seller owns a negative quantity of shares , her wealth increases when the share price drops .
Now , some people view the stock market merely as a giant casino and see no rhyme or reason to speculation in the financial markets .
Indeed , politicians blame greedy speculators for skyrocketing oil prices in one breath , and then blame those same greedy speculators for collapsing bank stocks in the next breath .
Is it just a coincidence that the speculators “ caused ” these trends , rather than the opposite ?
Is there really any danger that unregulated speculators could now cause a bubble in mortgage - backed securities or could drive Exxon into bankruptcy merely on the basis of rumors and naked short - selling ?
Of course not .
In a relatively open market in which speculators are allowed to pocket gains but also suffer losses , competition punishes the true “ gamblers ” and rewards those who best anticipate future price movements .
Speculators bought oil futures because they predicted that demand ( for whatever reason ) would outpace supply , just as speculators shorted Bear Stearns and AIG because they thought they were in trouble .
If it really were a simple matter of a self - fulfilling prophecy — where the speculators could go make guaranteed profits by forcing commodity prices up or by forcing a financial firm into insolvency — then one wonders why the speculators started employing this money machine only within the last few years .
Presumably , speculators were just as wily and greedy during the 1980s , when oil prices fell sharply .
Once one accepts that there are underlying forces that move prices and that speculators try to ride these waves rather than direct them , the harmful effects of the SEC become clear .
Successful speculators buy low and sell high , or they short - sell high and cover low .
This is a countercyclical strategy that actually makes stock or commodity price movements less volatile than they would be in the absence of ( successful ) speculation .
By banning one side of this “ governor ” on financial prices , the SEC will make these particular stocks riskier investments .
It is true that the threat of an immediate “ attack ” by short - sellers has been taken away .
But now , when bad news comes out about a firm on the SEC ’s list , its share price will be jolted more than before the ban .
This is because the people least likely to anticipate bad news about the company are those currently holding the stock .
With the SEC ’s short - selling ban , as more and more people learn of the impending bombshell that will go public in a few days , their only incentive is to unload shares they already own .
They can do this quietly without causing ripples .
In contrast , when short - selling is allowed , then people who learn bad news about a company can sell many more shares if the news is really that bad .
There is an incentive for a knowledgeable person to announce his views to the world , as it were , by massively shorting the stock .
Thus , the shareholders will be less surprised by the bombshell announcement because their share prices had been getting pummeled by speculators for days before .
More generally , the ban on short - selling will make investors less willing to buy stock in , or lend money to ( i.e. , buy the bonds of ) , the companies on the SEC ’s list .
With the possibility of speculative shorting , investors know that the “ vultures ” are looking for weak targets to attack ( by shorting their stock ) .
This means that the remaining companies get an implicit stamp of approval from the speculators .
The financials who are not being “ attacked ” are less likely to be holding crippling amounts of mortgage - backed securities , and , hence , rational but ignorant investors — including institutional investors handling huge accounts where safety is paramount — can more confidently expose themselves to these financial companies .
The SEC ban takes away this important source of information to investors and makes the financial industry less attractive to them .
Finally , the SEC ban will make it harder to buy insurance against bond default by financial companies and , thus , will make it that much more difficult for these beleaguered firms to raise private capital .
Currently , a financial institution can act as a type of insurer by entering into a “ credit default swap ” ( CDS ) .
The insuring firm ( such as AIG ) might issue a CDS to the manager of a teachers ’ pension fund .
The CDS obligates the manager to make a stream of premium payments to AIG , but if Goldman Sachs ( say ) defaults on its bonds — what is called a “ credit event ” — then the CDS is triggered and AIG makes a large payment to the pension manager .
( It was n’t that the manager was betting Goldman would default , but that he had invested in some Goldman bonds and was insuring himself against the event . )
Now , one of the standard ways that insuring firms such as AIG could hedge themselves — perhaps if AIG executives became concerned about their CDS exposure — would be to short shares of Goldman Sachs .
This possibility allows the CDS market to unfold more naturally because AIG can short stocks if its clients want to buy more total protection against a certain credit event than AIG wants to sell them .
The SEC ban will , therefore , make bond insurance on Goldman Sachs and other “ protected ” firms more expensive , providing yet another disincentive for outside investors to deal with these firms .
Continuing the above logic , there are other firms that might use shorting as a hedge , rather than as a speculative move .
In the extreme , suppose that an analyst is dead certain that Medium Bank XYZ behaved beautifully throughout the housing bubble , that there is not a single “ toxic ” mortgage - backed security on its balance sheet , and , moreover , that XYZ has been very careful to become intertwined only with other financial institutions that have played it safe .
The analyst is convinced that Medium Bank XYZ is one of the safest banks out there .
Even so , it does not follow that the analyst will recommend buying large numbers of shares in XYZ .
After all , it is a minor player , and if bad news about a regulatory change or some other event sweeps the market , then XYZ ’s stock might go down with the herd .
A much safer bet , therefore , would be the spread between XYZ and comparable financial stocks .
For example , the analyst might recommend that clients take out a large long position on XYZ , while taking out much smaller short positions on the largest five banks .
The SEC ’s ban has now made this hedge illegal , and thus our hypothetical analyst may now recommend less aggressive buying of XYZ .
Above , we have described several mechanisms through which the SEC ban could reduce investor confidence in financial stocks , ironically reducing their share prices in the long run .
In practice , the market will probably invent ways around the new regulation .
There are many ways to implement a “ synthetic short ” ; simply buying put options is a different way to bet against a stock ( though the move is not equivalent to shorting ) .
If the SEC just stood still , the current ban on short - selling would merely translate into a deadweight loss from higher transaction costs , because investors would eventually find ( costly ) ways around the regulatory roadblock .
The real danger is if the SEC continually updates the regulations to chase the speculators from one strategy to another .
This “ whack - a- mole ” process would reduce confidence in U.S. financial markets altogether , causing investors to flee to other countries ’ exchanges .
One final comment on the SEC ’s ban is in order :
As of this writing , two firms — Diamond Hill Investment and JMP Securities — have asked to be taken off the list , and the SEC has approved their request .
This will pose an interesting dilemma for the regulators if the trend snowballs .
If more and more firms voluntarily take themselves off the no-short list , the remaining firms will look more and more suspicious to investors .
This possible development is just another illustration that limited interventions in the market are pointless .
As Ludwig von Mises warned , they are counterproductive in their stated purposes and provoke cries for even more interventions .

インターンはみんなペアプロをしていたので、自動的にコードレビューをしていた感じでした。また基本的に数千人もの開発者がいるGoogleと、数十人のはてなではかなり規模が違います。はてなでもレビューはやっていますが、専用のシステムもありませんし、行ごとにコメントを付けるようなこともしていなかったように思います。ただ、開発者が1フロアに集まっているため、コミュニケーションのコストはあまり高くありません。そのために当事者間で結構解決してしまっている気もします。evidenceを重視するのであれば、専用のシステムが必要かもしれませんね。（コミットログである程度はできると思いますが）
偉そうに書いてしまった・・・。違ってたら指摘をお願いします−。

This Halloween season , the Corn Refiners Association wants to remind you that high - fructose corn syrup contains the same amount of calories as cane and beet sugar , is metabolized by the body the same way as these sweeteners are , and is all natural , albeit manufactured by chemical engineers in a multi-step process using genetically modified enzymes and giant metallic centrifuges .
The Corn Refiners Association 's message is part of its new public relations campaign to counter the vilification of high - fructose corn syrup as the primary cause of the obesity epidemic .
Television commercials are airing across the country .
The ad campaign is loaded with revelations , such as how high - fructose corn syrup is just like honey , which is made by enzymes in a bee 's tummy as opposed to enzymes and acids in the aforementioned centrifuges before heading to ion exchange columns and liquid chromatographers .
If only half - truths could add up to the whole truth .
Just like sugar , which is bad
High - fructose corn syrup is indeed similar to cane sugar in that it is about 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose , two types of simple sugars .
This corn syrup contains about four calories per gram , like sugar .
And once table sugar or high - fructose corn syrup is digested , the body likely has no way of differentiating between their similar fructose - glucose ratios .
There was a theory , based on the way pure fructose is digested , that high - fructose corn syrup alters the body 's metabolism , causing it to store more fat while hindering the release of hormones that control appetite .
That theory was wrong .
So in weighing all these facts , the American Medical Association issued a statement on June 17 , 2008 , explaining how " high - fructose syrup does not appear to contribute more to obesity than other caloric sweeteners . "
Well , the corn people loved the AMA decision .
You 'll find that quote all over their websites , such as the one at http://www.sweetsurprise.com.
Unfortunately , they sort of left out part two of the AMA statement , two lines lower , which adds , " We do recommend consumers limit the amount of all added caloric sweeteners to no more than 32 grams of sugar daily . "
Just try consuming less than 32 grams of high - fructose corn syrup today .
Most sodas have about 40 grams .
Corn , it 's everywhere
High - fructose corn syrup is far cheaper than cane sugar , and it acts as a food preservative , too , so food companies love it .
But the syrup did n't replace cane sugar at some magical one - to - one ratio .
Cheap high - fructose corn syrup became the way to make lousy , processed food that is largely devoid of nutrients taste better .
The stuff began to appear everywhere starting in the 1980s , from products that indeed contained cane sugar , such as soda , to foods that never had it , like soup .
Grandma 's soup recipes likely did n't call for four teaspoons of high - fructose corn syrup per serving .
You 'll find high - fructose corn syrup in hundreds of commercial food products that once had the potential of being healthy , such as bread , breakfast cereal , crackers , yogurt , canned fruits and vegetables , and countless sauces and condiments , along with most sweetened drinks and snack foods .
All natural
Sweeteners that have been used for centuries or more , such as honey , sugar cane and maple syrup , can be produced rather easily through techniques such as pressing or evaporation .
You can't make high - fructose corn syrup in your kitchen .
It 's made from cornstarch , and there 's no syrup in the starch to extract .
High - fructose corn syrup meets the FDA standard of all - natural , though , merely because the FDA does n't have a definition of what constitutes natural , other than stating no artificial ingredients are added .
The enzymes , from bacteria , are natural .
High - fructose corn syrup could be all - natural if cornstarch happened to fall into a vat of alpha- amylase , soak there for a while , then trickle into another vat of glucoamylase , get strained to remove the Aspergillus fungus likely growing on top , and then find its way into some industrial - grade D-xylose isomerase .
This funny coincidence did n't happen in nature until the 1970s in a lab somewhere in Japan .
It 's called " food science , " two great words that become troublesome when combined , not unlike " public relations . "

It ’s around two in the afternoon in the afternoon on in the afternoon on Columbus Day that I get the news :
The Dow is up over 400 points !
Cut to the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange — the usual pandemonium , only instead of disconsolate traders clutching their heads , we see jubilant traders punching their fists in the air .
I must be the last person in New York to hear the glad tidings .
How did I tune out until this late in the day ?
I thought it was a holiday .
Turns out there are no holidays from the markets :
You can get up at three o’clock in the morning and trade in Hong Kong , or sleep in until five a.m. and start trading in London .
Money Never Sleeps — that ’s what they ’re calling the sequel to Wall Street , out next year , with Michael Douglas as Gordon ( “ Greed is good ” )
Gekko twenty years later .
The end of the day recorded an insane 936 - point spike , “ the biggest single - day percentage gain in 75 years , ” according to the Times .
Could it have been only a week before , on a beautiful Saturday night at the end of the “ roller - coaster week ” that finished with the Dow plunging 18 percent , that I walked past Isabella ’s , the restaurant on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 77th Street where we eat three or four nights a week now that the kids are gone — and got nervous because half the tables were empty ?
I should n’t have been surprised .
We had cut back ourselves and were sitting in our kitchen those three or four nights ( well , anyway , one or two ) eating Amy ’s Frozen Burritos thawed in the microwave .
Tonight ?
Table for two on the terrace , please .
I ’ll have the tuna tartare and the lamb shank .
But if the market tanks , break out the frozen tortellini al pesto from Fairway .
Up a thousand points on Monday , down 700 points on Wednesday , life in New York is always unpredictable ( sometimes harrowingly so , as 9/11 proved ) , but the whipsawing market is taking a toll on everyone .
The grief , the relief , the doomsday fantasies : A friend who has a farmhouse in the Berkshires says , “ We could always sell our co-op and go live off the land , grow corn . ”
Even the woman at the coffee - vending van on my corner shakes her head ruefully when the transistor radio reports a 400 - point drop on Tuesday .
Wait a minute !
What happened to the historic rise ?
Did it just evaporate ?
What ’s Hank Paulson doing with that $ 700 billion ?
On the No. 7 bus heading downtown , I pass the Lehman Brothers building , which until last week had these amazing multistoried billboards showing color films of exotic locales .
London , Tokyo , Frankfurt , Chicago :
Here was global capital at work , making money ’round the clock for … someone .
Now it ’s Barclays , and the neat film footage is gone .
Does that mean I have less money ?
And if so , how much less ?
I do n’t want to know .
You ca n’t not care about money in this city , even if you do n’t .
It ’s in your face all the time — in the Luxury Homes and Estates brochures , the Sotheby ’s auctions , the windows of Chopard on Madison Avenue , the “ Special Watch Portfolio ” that arrives on a peaceful Sunday morning with the Times .
Not that the rich have n’t been good for the city .
Thirty - year - old stockbrokers pulling down $ 4 million a year support a lot of aspiring - actor waitresses who live off their what - do - I - care tips — and when the tens of billions in lost bonuses kick in , the rest of us are going to feel it .
But a backlash was inevitable .
The more retirement accounts are lost , the more buyouts and firings you hear about , the more embarrassing it is to be ostentatiously rich .
Who rides in limos anymore besides kids from Long Island on prom night ?
As for the $ 300 tasting menu at Alain Ducasse at the Essex House , no wonder it closed :
Who would be caught dead in such a place even if you could afford it ?
Wealth has become a virtual stigma .
Still , it ’s a bad idea to gloat .
“ If you became obscenely rich riding this bubble , I ’m taking pleasure in your fall , ” John Schwartz writes in the Sunday “ Business ” section of the Times .
Do n’t be a churl , John : that my neighbor , a retired Wall Street veteran who ’d worked hard for his money , lost a bundle in stock options intended for his children is no joke .
No need to feel sorry for Hank Greenberg , ex-CEO of the disgraced insurance giant AIG , who told Charlie Rose that his holdings were “ virtually worthless ” — meaning that he ’d lost $ 2.4 billion and was down to his last $ 100 million .
But if you ’re a lawyer at a white - shoe firm and you have to sell the place in the Hamptons , it still hurts :
Your house is your house , whether it cost $ 5 million or $ 500,000 .
Still , it ’s not the end of the world , not yet .
No box seats at Yankees games , no Dress Circle at La Traviata — but have you bicycled down the bike path on the Hudson that goes all the way to Battery Park from where you can see the Statue of Liberty and the sailboats gliding by just feet from where you ’re standing on an emerald lawn that goes right down to the waterfront ?
Is it as much fun as taking your entire staff to Venice for a weekend like the hedge - fund king Remy Trafelet ?
Probably .
Let ’s admit it :
On some level , the meltdown has been — dare I say this ?
— exciting .
We get a frisson out of the plummeting numbers , the charts on the front page every morning zigzagging like a heart - attack victim ’s EKG .
How low can it go ?
The stimulus package is stimulating .
Media columnists are getting great copy out of their own self - coverage :
Over at CNN , an exhausted - looking Maria Bartiromo had been up for 48 hours …
We ’re history , in a positive sense .
Tell me about the Crash of ’ 08 , Grandpa .
And for the serotonin - deprived , emergencies are mood elevators .
Depressives thrive during a crisis .
The number of suicides dropped during World War II .
How much of these catastrophic losses are phantom , anyway ?
Say you ’re in the enviable position of having a job , your mortgage is paid off , the children ’s tuitions are paid , your mom is tucked away in assisted living , you just painted the kitchen …
What difference does it make if you ’ve lost a third of your net wealth ?
When the city ’s flush , your co-op is worth a fortune ; when there ’s a budget deficit and garbage piled up on the sidewalk , it ’s worth a lot less .
So what ?
You ’re still going to live there .
When the market is up , you feel rich ; when it ’s down , you feel poor .
Meanwhile , life goes on .
“ We ’ll be working until we ’re 90 anyway , ” says a psychiatrist friend of mine .
Maybe the Dow will be back to 14,000 by then .

Two months after Faiza Abu started working the front desk at the Best Western Airport Executel in SeaTac , new staff uniforms arrived .
A Muslim head scarf she had been wearing since she ’d taken the job would n’t work with the new garb , her manager told her .
But she kept wearing the scarf , called a hijab , for religious reasons .
“ Either you ’re going to take it off or I ’m going to fire you , ” she says the hotel ’s manager , Shawn Walters , told her .
“ I did n’t take it off — and he fired me . ”
Now the 20 - year - old Abu , who is pursuing a nursing degree at Highline Community College , is suing the hotel and its parent company , Piramco Inc. , for religious discrimination .
When the Airport Executel hired her in August 2006 , Abu says she went over the employee handbook with her new boss .
She was n’t wearing a head scarf at the time , she adds , but made her faith clear .
Abu says Piramco later claimed that not wearing the hijab at the interview showed her faith was n’t sincere enough .
“ My whole background ’s Muslim , ” she says .
Though she wore no scarf at the interview , she told her boss she would in the future .
“ He said he had no problem with that . ”
Later that month , Abu started wearing a black scarf to work .
No one had a problem with it then , she says .
But in October new uniforms arrived : navy - blue pants , a white button - up shirt , and a navy - blue vest .
( Previously , employees had just been told to dress nicely . )
For the first time , her boss took her behind the hotel and told her the scarf was no longer acceptable .
She offered to start wearing a navy one to match the uniform , she says , but was told that would n’t fly either .
In November 2006 , Abu says she was given the ultimatum : take it off or be fired .
She told Walters she would like to stay but could n’t remove the scarf .
He fired her , but she refused to leave his office until he wrote a letter informing her why .
She says the letter was in part to show her family what happened .
( Abu ’s family emigrated to the U.S. from Somalia in 1997 .
In addition to paying for school , Abu helps with expenses at their south Seattle home . )
According to court documents , the only issue addressed in the letter is the uniform .
It states that Abu had expressed a “ strong religious conviction that will not allow her to remove a garment that is not part of her uniform . ”
The scarf is described as “ not professional in appearance . ”
In addition to showing the letter to her family , Abu retained an attorney and turned the document over to the state ’s Human Rights Commission .
An agency investigator then interviewed Piramco president Mustaq Ali Pirani , as well as Abu .
At that point , Abu claims , the company stopped focusing on the uniform and began attacking her faith .
Abu says Pirani told the investigator that several people in the company are also Muslim and that the problem is n’t with the hijab itself .
Rather , because Abu had n’t worn the scarf at her interview or during her first few weeks of work , the company doubted the sincerity of her beliefs .
“ That really did hurt me too , that he doubted me , ” she says .
In its findings , included with court documents , the commission found that Abu ’s complaint — that she was fired for her beliefs and wearing the hijab — ” can be proven by a preponderance of evidence . ”
“ Head - scarf cases are pretty common nationally , ” says Marc Brenman , the Human Rights Commission ’s executive director .
Brenman adds that unless there is a specific safety hazard posed by the hijab , “ the answer is yeah , they ought to be allowed to wear the head scarf . ”
Abu filed a federal discrimination suit on Aug. 5 of this year .
Pirani did not respond to multiple requests for comment .
An assistant for Piramco attorney Kristi Favard says the company has no comment .
Water - soluble , self - assembling electronic organic wires
( Nanowerk News )
From pacemakers constructed of materials that so closely mimic human tissues that a patient 's body can't discern the difference to devices that bypass injured spinal cords to restore movement to paralyzed limbs , the possibilities presented by organic electronics read like something from a science fiction novel .
Derived from carbon - based compounds ( hence the term " organic " ) , these " soft " electronic materials are valued as lightweight , flexible , easily processed alternatives to " hard " electronics components such as metal wires or silicon semiconductors .
And just as the semiconductor industry is actively developing smaller and smaller transistors , so , too , are those involved with organic electronics devising ways to shrink the features of their materials , so they can be better utilized in bioelectronic applications such as those above .
To this end , a team of chemists at The Johns Hopkins University has created water - soluble electronic materials that spontaneously assemble themselves into " wires " 10,000 times smaller than a human hair .
An article about their work was published in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
" What 's exciting about our materials is that they are of size and scale that cells can intimately associate with , meaning that they may have built - in potential for biomedical applications , " said John D. Tovar , an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry in the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences .
" Can we use these materials to guide electrical current at the nanoscale ?
Can we use them to regulate cell - to - cell communication as a prelude to re- engineering neural networks or damaged spinal cords ?
These are the kinds of questions we are looking forward to being able to address and answer in the coming years . "
The team used the self assembly principles that underlie the formation of beta - amyloid plaques , which are the protein deposits often associated with Alzheimer 's disease , as a model for their new material .
This raises another possibility : that these new electronic materials may eventually prove useful for imaging the formation of these plaques .

WASHINGTON --
The House Democratic leadership is crafting new legislation to stimulate the shaky U.S. economy , and could call lawmakers back to the nation 's capital shortly after the Nov. 4 election to take up the $ 150 billion measure .
No final decisions have been made on details of the package or changes to the congressional schedule .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif . ) and other Democratic leaders have discussed reconvening the House the week of Nov. 17 to act on a package that could include new government spending in areas ...
Former Cuban president Fidel Castro says American society is marked by " profound racism " and it is a " pure miracle " that US presidential hopeful Barack Obama has not been assassinated .
" Profound racism exists in the United States , " Mr Castro wrote in a commentary that appeared on the website Cubadebate as he weighed in on the US presidential race ahead of the November 4 election .
" Millions of whites cannot reconcile in their minds with the idea that a black man with his wife and children would move into the White House , which is called just like that , White , " he wrote .
He added that it was a " pure miracle " the Illinois senator , who became the first black politician to win the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination , had not been assassinated thus far .
The ailing Cuban communist leader , who handed power to his brother Raul earlier this year , described Senator Obama as a politician who " has the habit of looking at his opponent with serenity and laughing at his rhetorical attacks . "
Mr Castro 's comments came as a war of words with racial undertones marked the US White House race after civil rights icon John Lewis accused Republican candidate John McCain of sowing " hatred " against Senator Obama , who is developing a commanding lead in opinion polls .
Mr Castro also mocked Senator McCain 's poor grades at the naval academy and said Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin " knew nothing at all about anything . "

Since being chosen as Sen. John McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has taken some heat for her rapid rise from small - town mayor to a national election .
So proponents have sought to amplify her achievements to date , which is what led former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to say this at the Republican National Convention :
" She got more votes running for the mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , than Joe Biden got running for president of the United States , " Huckabee said Sept. 3 , 2008 .
He made the same remark earlier that day to Florida Republicans at the Airport Marriott in Bloomington , Minn .
Biden dropped out of the presidential race in January , after an unimpressive finish in the Jan. 3 Iowa Democratic caucuses .
Because of the nature of the caucus process , which involves people gathering and regathering in groups in high school gyms and living rooms across the state to signal their candidate preferences , it is difficult , if not impossible , to get a fix on how many Iowans supported Biden .
According to a Jan. 4 article in the Cedar Rapids Gazette , the Associated Press calculated " state delegate equivalent numbers " that showed Biden got perhaps 2,329 votes across the state .
CNN reported essentially the same number , 2,328 .
It 's not clear whether Huckabee was referring to Palin 's 1996 election , or her re-election in 1999 — so let 's use both numbers .
Palin got 651 votes in Wasilla 's 1996 election .
She did a little better in her 1999 re-election bid , picking up 909 votes .
According to Wasilla 's deputy clerk , Jamie Newman , the city population now stands at 7,025 .
Although the precise Iowa tally is n't available , Biden 's support as reported by AP and CNN exceeds Palin 's 1,560 - vote combined total .
And it seems likely , based on those projections , that at least 910 actual Iowans supported him , which would mean that as an active candidate , Biden exceeded Palin 's single most successful mayoral race .
But Biden kept picking up votes even after he dropped his presidential bid .
Biden got 638 votes in New Hampshire 's Jan. 8 primary .
On Super Tuesday in February , he got 3,788 primary votes in Barack Obama 's home state of Illinois , and 4,321 primary votes in Hillary Rodham Clinton 's home state of New York .
If Huckabee is going to compare a small - town mayoral election to a national presidential race , then it 's only fair to look beyond the single , hard - to - quantify caucus for which Biden was an active candidate .
Iowa aside , his combined 8,109 - vote total in Obama 's and Clinton 's home state primaries alone is bigger than Wasilla 's entire population .
Pants on Fire is our ruling .
More Americans are showing an entrepreneurial spirit in the face of crisis !
BenandHank.comare selling " Evil Ben " and " Evil Hank " masks for Halloween , representing the dark side of the Fed Chief and the Treasury Secretary .
But the Evil Ben masks have already sold out ( they hope to make more after Halloween ) , and they have " only a handful " of Evil Hank masks left .
Each mask sells for $ 79.90 , or you can get the set for $ 159.80 ( uh , so no discount for buying both — exactly what I 'd expect from two guys from the U.S. Government ) .
It ’s been that kind of week for John McCain .
Obama gets an endorsement from Gen. Colin Powell , McCain gets one from Al Qaeda .
No kidding .
More and more Republicans with hearts and brains are jumping ship because they see a ship wreck ahead and do n’t think McCain will make a very good captain .
Once the “ brilliance ” of choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate wore off , the stupidity and self - serving shortsightedness of it set in .
As Obama began to look more and more like a President for the times , Palin began to look like a President for the End Times .
Last month , conservative columnist Kathleen Parker wrote a column for the National Review calling on Sarah Palin to withdraw from the ticket .
In recent weeks conservative commentators like Christopher Buckley endorsed Obama , as have Barry Goldwater ’s kin from McCain ’s home state and Arne Carlson , former GOP governor of Minnesota .
You ’ll find more endorsements on a prominent website called Republicans for Obama .
In addition to a long list of Republicans who favor Obama , the website offers an articulate endorsement of its own :
" We need a leader who can lay the foundations of another American Century — someone who can get past our partisan and ideological divisions , as we strengthen our standing in the world and tackle the challenges we face at home .
We need a leader who understands our differences , but who also knows the importance of finding common ground .
While we continue to debate and address many issues on which we all have strong opinions — abortion , gay rights , the relationship between church and state , to name a few — we need a leader who can command the support needed to break our government ’s paralysis and meet the growing challenges we face as a nation .
" Senator Obama is the one candidate who can unite the American majority that wants to move forward and improve the long - term economic well - being and independence of our nation . "
In other words , they believe Obama is more functional , more able to navigate us through the problems of the times .
Newspapers seem to agree .
Many that endorsed George Bush four years ago have gone for Obama this time .
These include two Texas papers , the Houston Chronicle and the Austin - American Statesman , as well as the Denver Post , Chicago Sun-Times , Kansas City Star , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution , and even the Salt Lake Tribune , which wrote :
" Out of nowhere , and without proper vetting , the impetuous McCain picked Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate .
She quickly proved grievously underequipped to step into the presidency should McCain , at 72 and with a history of health problems , die in office .
More than any single factor , McCain 's bad judgment in choosing the inarticulate , insular and ethically challenged Palin disqualifies him for the presidency . ”
Could it be said in any plainer terms ?
By a newspaper with a highly - conservative and largely Mormon constituency , no less ?
But the endorsement goes much further than condemning McCain :
" Still , we have compelling reasons for endorsing Obama on his merits alone .
Under the most intense scrutiny and attacks from both parties , Obama has shown the temperament , judgment , intellect and political acumen that are essential in a president that would lead the United States out of the crises created by President Bush , a complicit Congress and our own apathy . "
That says it pretty plainly .
Obama is functional , and we need functionality right now more than anything .
Among those who are able to see past their partisan loyalties , the distinct differences between McCain and Obama as leaders are apparent .
As of last Friday , newspaper editorial endorsements have favored Obama 58 - 16 .
Thus far , 26 papers that backed Bush in 2004 now support Obama .

So what does this all mean ?
It means that there is an opportunity and an opening over the next dozen days to speak to friends , family , coworkers , acquaintances who have emotional , spiritual and political intelligence and who are of the Republican persuasion .
I ’ve been engaged in several of these conversations , and here ’s what I ’ve found :
Surprisingly , but not surprisingly , a number of the Republicans I ’ve spoken to have an affinity for Obama .
And why would n’t they ?
He ’s firm , he ’s pragmatic , he ’s inspiring as a leader , a uniter not a divider .
In demeanor , he is a conservative .
However , their considerations include :
• They do n’t know that they can trust him .
He ’s a Democrat , after all .
• They ’re concerned he will bring “ socialism , ” whatever that is .
• They HATE and DESPISE and yes , I said “ hate and despise ” Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid and all the other straw man liberals .
Their fear is that a Democratic majority in Congress plus a Democratic President will bring about socialism .
How exactly do they define “ socialism ” and why are they so afraid of it ?
I dunno .
That ’s why they ’re Republicans .
You ’ll have to ask them .
Mainly , their dislike of Democrats ( and boy , do they HATE Michael Moore ... there ’s even a sick , sick movie out right now where a Michael Moore type character gets beaten up and abused because he ’s campaigning against the 4th of July ) is based on the impropaganda that ’s been drummed into their heads that liberals hate America .
It makes no sense whatsoever to argue against this belief .
It makes more sense to recognize that their hatred of liberals is on par with the way so many progressives despise George Bush , Dick Cheney and Sarah Palin .

Pearly Whites
by Sarah K
As Joe Biden declares , we must extend our bristles ' reach across party lines to preserve our best American asset .
Teeth are so instrumental in demonstrating our hygiene , our socio-economic class and most importantly our patriotism .
We ought not vote a man in the white house with dingy , plaque - ridden choppers .
The consequences of which would be unimaginable .
Joe Biden 's pearly whites will serve as the beacon on capital hill that the American people have been brushing for .
Let us raise our brushes to the teeth that have stopped warring nations dead in their plaque .
To the teeth protecting the tongue that calls wheel - chaired men to stand .
To the teeth flossed and whitened so proudly by Joe Biden .

At a time of economic struggle , it is always good to find a silver lining .
For IT administrators , that silver lining could very well be open - source databases .
Business decision makers will be tasked to do more for less money , which may make open - source databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL an attractive option .
However , it is unclear just how much the economy will affect adoption .
According to Forrester Research , companies such as Sun Microsystems , Ingres and EnterpriseDB have reasons to smile .
" Based our research we were now expecting a 24 percent growth in the open - source database - new licenses , support and services - market in 2009 , revised upward from an earlier 18 percent projected growth , " said Noel Yuhanna , an analyst with Forrester .
" This takes into account the current economic condition and market movement .
Over the last month , we are already seeing a large number of customer inquiries asking about how to save money in databases , and some are looking at open - source databases . "
Open - source databases such as MySQL , PostgreSQL and Ingres have established good credibility in the market , and customers are finding great value from open source , he continued .
That 's solid validation for a market that Forrester Research says stands to grow from $ 850 million - a number that includes licensing , support and services - to $ 1.3 billion in 2010 .
However , there are a number of issues that impact how much open - source databases will grow .
For one thing , there is the presence of Express Editions of popular proprietary databases such as IBM DB2 , Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL Server .
While open - source database adoption has grown alongside Express databases , a survey of more than 340 businesspeople by the 451 Group conducted in December 2007 found 19 percent were planning to increase their Express Edition database adoption over the next 12 months .
That is more than double the number who said they planned to increase their use of open - source databases .
It was a weird week to be in the United States .
On Tuesday , secretary of the treasury Henry Paulson told us that " this is all about the American taxpayer – that 's all we care about " .
But when I flipped the page on my morning paper , I came across the latest gloomy statistic which Americans should care more about .
" As of Wednesday evening , 4,162 US service members and 11 Defence Department civilians had been identified as having died in the Iraq war . "
By grotesque mischance , $ 700bn – the cost of George Bush 's Wall Street rescue cash – is about the same figure as the same President has squandered on his preposterous war in Iraq , the war we have now apparently " won " thanks to the " surge " – for which , read " escalation " – in Baghdad .
The fact that the fall in casualties coincides with the near - completion of the Shia ethnic cleansing of Sunni Muslims is not part of the story .
Indeed , a strange narrative is now being built into the daily history of America .
First we won the war in Afghanistan by overthrowing the evil , terrorist - protecting misogynist Islamist crazies called the Taliban , setting up a democratic government under the exotically dressed Hamid Karzai .
Then we rushed off to Iraq and overthrew the evil , terrorist - protecting , nuclear - weaponised , secular Baathist crazies under Saddam , setting up a democratic government under the pro-Iranian Shia Nouri al - Maliki .
Mission accomplished .
Then , after 250,000 Iraqi deaths – or half a million or a million , who cares ?
– we rushed back to Kabul and Kandahar to win the war all over again in Afghanistan .
The conflict now embraces our old chums in Pakistan , the Saudi - financed , American - financed Interservices Intelligence Agency whose Taliban friends – now attacked by our brave troops inside Pakistani sovereign territory – again control half of Afghanistan .
We are , in fact , now fighting a war in what I call Irakistan .
It 's hopeless ; it 's a mess ; it 's shameful ; it 's unethical and it's unwinnable and no wonder the Wall Street meltdown was greeted with such relief by Messrs Obama and McCain .
They could n't suspend their campaigns to discuss the greatest military crisis in America 's history since Vietnam – but for Wall Street , no problem .
The American taxpayer – " that 's all we care about " .
Mercifully for the presidential candidates , they do n't have to debate the hell - disaster of Iraq any more , nor US - Israeli relations , nor Exxon or Chevron or BP - Mobil or Shell .
George Bush 's titanic if mythical battle between good and evil has transmogrified into the conflict between good taxpayers and evil bankers .
Phew !
No entanglement in the lives and deaths of the people of the Middle East .
Until the elections – barring another 9/11 – they are yesterday 's men and women .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But truth lurks in the strangest of airports .
I 'm chewing my way though a plate of spiced but heavy - boned chicken wings – final proof of why chickens can't fly – at John Wayne airport in Orange County ( take a trip down the escalator and you can actually see a larger - than - life statue of the " Duke " ) , and up on the screen behind the bar pops Obama himself .
The word " Change " flashes on the logo and the guy on my left shakes his head .
" I got a brother who 's just come back from Afghanistan , " he says .
" He 's been fighting there but says there 's no infrastructure so there can be no victory .
There 's nothing to build on .
We 're not wanted . "
At California 's San Jose University , a guy comes up and asks me to sign my new book for him .
" Write ' To Sergeant ' D ' , " he says with a sigh .
" That 's what they call me .
Two tours in Iraq , just heading out to Afghanistan . "
And he rolls his eyes and I wish him safe home afterwards .
Of course , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict no longer gets a look into the debate .
McCain 's visit to the Middle East and Obama 's visit to the Middle East – in which they outdid each other in fawning to the Israeli lobby ( Obama 's own contribution surely earning him membership of the Knesset if not entry to the White House ) – are safely in the past .
Without any discussion , Israeli and US officials held a three - day security - technology forum in Washington this month which coincided with an equally undebated decision by the dying Bush administration to give a further $ 330 m in three separate arms deals for Israel , including 28,000 M72A7 66 mm light anti-armour weapons and 1,000 GBU - 9 small diameter bombs from Boeing .
Twenty - five Lockheed Martin F - 35 fighter jets are likely to be approved before the election .
The Israeli -American talks were described as " the most senior bilateral high - technology dialogue ever between the two allies " .
Nothing to write home about , of course .
Almost equally unreported in major US papers – save by the good old Washington Report – was a potential scandal in good old Los Angeles to which Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recently returned after a $ 225,000 junket to Israel with three council members and other city officials ( along with families , kids , etc ) .
The purpose ?
To launch new agreements for security at Los Angeles international airport .
Council members waffled away on cellphones and walked out of the chamber when protesters claimed that the council was negotiating with a foreign power before seeking bids from American security services .
One of the protesters asked if the idea of handing LAX 's security to the Israelis was such a good idea when Israeli firms were operating security at Boston Logan and Newark on 9/11 when a rather sinister bunch of Arabs passed through en route to their international crimes against humanity .
But who cares ?
9/11 ?
Come again ?
What 's that got to do with the American taxpayer ?
CNBC : Apple Likely to Hit Goldilocks Price With New MacBook

Pointing to Apple 's own boilerplate text that the company " ignited " the personal computer revolution , Jim Goldman at CNBC said on Monday that Apple will now exercise the " nuclear option . "
An $ 899 Macbook would hit just the right price point to create a sales explosion .
The goal for Apple is to lower the price of an attractive notebook well below the magic US $ 1,000 figure without going so low as to damage Apple 's brand .
Notebooks that sell in the $ 500 range feel cheap and do n't have the features Apple customers crave .
Mr. Goldman said that the magic number , according to his sources , is US$ 899 .
Apple is poised now to make that move .
While an $ 899 MacBook would lower the average selling price ( ASP ) of the Apple notebook line , something that might drive some analysts crazy , Apple believes that making up for that with mind share and market share , especially in the current economy , would be a smart move .
All will be revealed Tuesday , and then the world will know if Apple has hit the " Goldilocks " price point for the new MacBooks .
Some analysts , such as Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray , also expect the price points of the new MacBook Pros to be very aggressive as well .
Note : the Mac Observer 's own Bryan Chaffin will be in Cupertino to provide live coverage the event on Tuesday .
Photo of marathon runners last year by sgoralnick on flickr
This Sunday , 39,000 runners from around the world will take part in a November tradition , the New York City Marathon .
The 26.2 mile course will take participants on a winding course through all five boroughs of the city .
The runners start in Staten Island at the base of the Verrazano Bridge before crossing into Brooklyn , where runners will run their most miles of the race .
After Brooklyn , runners will head into Queens for a brief moment before going over the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan , where they will be welcomed by a roaring crowd on 1st Avenue .
The runners will follow 1st
Ave north until they enter The Bronx for a short while before returning to Manhattan for the homestretch down 5th Avenue .
Finally , the runners will enter Central Park for their final 2 + miles to the finish .
( PDF course map and approximate gmap )
The marathon is n't just an event for those that are running , but also for the millions of people that come out to watch the event .
While the race will be televised on NBC , watching the race in person is , in some neighborhoods , as easy as walking out your front door .
The marathon website has a great viewers guide to cheering not just the elite runners , but also your friends , if they 're running , and all the other participants .
And besides the runners , there are bands that line the course , providing tunes for all in earshot .
Start times for people in the race vary , and for the first time in NYC Marathon history , there will be a wave start for the open field .
The elite women start at 9:10 AM and the elite men start at 9:40 AM .
The wave start , designed to ease congestion along parts of the course , has the field starting at 9:40 , 10:00 and 10:20 .
Athletes with disabilities begin at 7:30 AM , wheelchairs start at 8:35 AM and handcycles start at 8:55 AM .
No matter who you 're watching , the professional runners , your friends , or " Joe and Jane Marathon " , be sure to cheer loudly as they run by .
And if you 're wondering who to look for in the elite women 's field and men's field , we have a quick list after the jump .
No assembly required .
Batteries included .
Rookie running backs do n't come into the NFL wearing such labels , but they are showing again this season that they arrive ready .
Matt Forte of the Chicago Bears , Darren McFadden of the Oakland Raiders , Chris Johnson of the Tennessee Titans and Steve Slaton of the Houston Texans lead their teams in rushing .
Jonathan Stewart is smashing for touchdowns with the Carolina Panthers .
Felix Jones is making big plays with the Dallas Cowboys .
Like all rookies , they face adjustments .
For running backs , that includes blocking on pass protection .
But running skills translate immediately .
Last February at the NFL scouting combine , all six showed they could run the 40 - yard dash very fast in shorts .
Now , they 're running in full pads with footballs in their hands .
" For the most part , they 're not doing anything differently than they 've been doing their whole lives .
It 's all about making people miss , " says Mike Mayock , draft analyst for the NFL Network .
" At each level it gets harder because the athletes get better .
But I think it 's the position in the NFL where a rookie can step in . "
This year , that theory is proving to be true .
According to the Elias Sports Bureau , rookie running backs have 550 rushing attempts for 2,407 yards .
Both totals are the most through the first five weeks since 2001 ( 628 attempts , 2452 yards ) .
With the NFL 's current strategy leaning toward teams using two running backs to share the load , the rookies are getting their shots .
USA TODAY looks at the top six running backs in this year 's freshman class :
• MATT FORTE , BEARS
Chicago drafted the 6 - 2 , 216 - pounder from Tulane in the second round after five running backs had gone in the first .
Forte figured to compete with incumbent Cedric Benson for the starting job .
But the Bears cut Benson in June after his second alcohol - related arrest in a month .
In an opening day start against the Indianapolis Colts , Forte ran 50 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter and totaled 123 rushing yards .
He 's been the starter since and tops all rookies in rushing yards ( 383 ) and carries ( 107 ) .
He 's run for two touchdowns and caught 22 passes for 172 yards and two touchdowns .
Forte has dropped to an average of less than three yards per carry in his past two starts .
But last week against the Detroit Lions he scored two TDs on a 9 - yard reception and a 1 - yard run .
" The thing you like about this guy is he 's very versatile , " says Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Johnson .
" He can block , he stays in on nickel defense , he 's got good hands , he catches the ball , and he's one of the top receivers that they have right now .
• CHRIS JOHNSON , TITANS
He 's started four of five games and tops the Titans with 381 rushing yards , while sharing carries with 235 - pound LenDale White .
" I watched a lot of tape of him ( Johnson ) at East Carolina , and I did n't think he liked to run between the tackles , " says Mayock of the 5 - 11 , 200 - pounder . " …
But they have really used him well and he 's run hard . "
The 24th pick in the first round , who ran the fastest time of any player at the NFL 's scouting combine ( 4.24 ) , is no surprise to coach Jeff Fisher .
" You do n't draft someone in the first round with question marks .
We had high expectations for him , " Fisher says .
• FELIX JONES , COWBOYS
At Arkansas , he was a playmaker as a backup to Darren McFadden and a kick returner .
Dallas made him the No. 22 overall pick .
ROOKIE FOCUS : Felix Jones sees Hall of Fame in his future
Marion Barber anchors the running game .
But while the 5 - 10 , 207 - pound Jones has rushed just 27 times , he has averaged nine yards per carry and scored three rushing touchdowns .
Last week he had a 33 - yard TD run vs. the Cincinnati Bengals .
He also returned a kickoff 98 yards for a score against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2 .
" Felix Jones might not get as many carries as the rest of these guys , yet he might have the biggest impact down the road because the touches he gets with the Cowboys are quality touches with a good team , " Mayock says .
• DARREN McFADDEN , RAIDERS
His time of 4.33 seconds in the 49 - yard dash at the NFL combine ranked second among running backs and solidified the 6 - 2 , 200 - pounder from Arkansas as the top- rated running back .
He came in with potential along the lines of 2007 rookie rushing star Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings .
In the Raiders ' second game , against the Kansas City Chiefs , McFadden ran 21 times for 164 yards and a touchdown .
But he suffered a big toe injury ( turf toe ) in that game .
In two starts since , he 's totaled 21 carries for 62 yards .
McFadden has shared carries with 245 - pound Michael Bush and Justin Fargas .
With Fargas expected back this week after missing two weeks with a groin injury , he , McFadden and Bush all figure to play Sunday at the New Orleans Saints .
" It 's a good mix with ( Fargas ) and Darren and Michael , " says new Raiders coach Tom Cable .
• STEVE SLATON , TEXANS
When he was drafted , the 5 - 9 , 201 - pounder from West Virginia looked like a potential third - down back .
But with Ahman Green sidelined by a knee injury , Slaton got the start in the Texans ' second game , against Tennessee , and he ran for 116 yards and a touchdown .
He 's started the past three games and leads Houston with 285 rushing yards .
" He 's been one of the big surprises of the year , " Mayock says .
" A lot of people had him going fourth , fifth , sixth round because there was a perception he was too small and too fragile playing in that spread offense at West Virginia . "
Slaton set out to show he 's more than a third - down back .
" I think that 's any running back 's mentality , " he says .
" You do n't want to be labeled as just one position or one down .
You want to carry the ball as many times as you can . "
• JONATHAN STEWART , PANTHERS
The 5 - 10 , 235 - pounder from Oregon has not started for Carolina , but he has been a factor in the running game along with third - year pro DeAngelo Williams .
He leads the Panthers with four rushing TDs .
Last week against the Kansas City Chiefs , while Williams was running for 123 yards and two touchdowns , Stewart ran a career - high 19 times for 72 yards .
Stewart , the second running back taken in the draft and the No. 13 pick overall , says he and Williams aim to wear down defenses .
" Wear and tear , no matter who is in the backfield , " Stewart says .
" Just keep pounding . "

McCain Suggests Bush Has Endorsed Torture
By Zachary A. Goldfarb
Sen .
John McCain today issued some of his strongest criticism of President Bush over an aggressive interrogation technique , clearly suggesting that the president has endorsed torture .
During an assessment of the Bush presidency on " Fox News Sunday , " McCain discussed the administration 's use over " waterboarding , " a technique that has been used to interrogate terrorist detainees .
" Waterboarding to me is torture , okay ?
And waterboarding was advocated by the administration , and according to a published report , was used , " McCain said .
" I obviously do n't want to torture any prisoners . "
McCain also said that he opposed the " spending spree " in the Bush years and wanted to take bigger steps to fight climate change .
He gave the president credit for preventing another terrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The issue of waterboarding has been a central one for McCain , a former prisoner of war who sponsored in 2005 the Detainee Treatment Act .
That legislation forbade the U.S. military from using waterboarding and other harsh tactics on prisoners , but it exempted the CIA .
Bush signed the legislation grudgingly , adding a signing statement that stated the president will decide when and how the bill 's limitations apply during wartime .
Earlier this year , McCain voted against making the CIA subject to the act .
Bush later vetoed that bill .
Democrats accused McCain of ignoring his principles to appeal to core Republican voters ; aides rejected that , saying the vote was consistent with his long - expressed view on how best to prosecute the war .
McCain 's comments , made in a taped interview broadcast the day before the Republican National Convention opens in St. Paul , Minn. , came as Hurricane Gustav threatened to wallop the Gulf Coast .
In comments that previously had been released , McCain said his team was studying " various options " about changing the convention 's schedule , " maybe devoting some of the activities to bringing [ the ]
American people 's attention to trying to help [ the hurricane 's ] victims . "
" We do n't want to appear in any way festive when you have that kind of tragedy possibly revisiting itself on the city of New Orleans and areas around it , " he said .
McCain faced questions about his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who was announced on Friday .
McCain called Palin " a partner and a soulmate ... a person who will help me reform Washington and change the way they do business . "
On ABC's " This Week , " the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee said the choice of Palin was evidence that McCain had gone from being a " maverick " to an " erratic " politician .
In his heart , Sen. John F. Kerry ( Mass . ) said , McCain wanted to pick former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge , a Republican , or Sen. Joseph Lieberman , an independent from Connecticut .
Both are good friends of McCain , and both favor abortion rights .
" Rush Limbaugh and the right wing vetoed it , " Kerry said .
" John McCain was forced to come back and pick a sort of Cheney - esque social conservative who 's going to satisfy the base . "
Kerry said the choice of Palin links McCain even more to the Bush legacy .
" We 've been warning against the third term of George Bush .
With the choice of Governor Palin , it 's now the third term of Bush - Cheney , " he said .
Some political analysts have speculated that , by choosing a woman for his ticket , McCain was trying to attract wayward supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Kerry said McCain should n't count on it .
" The people who supported Hillary Clinton are not going to be seduced just because John McCain has picked a woman , " he said .
" They 're going to look at what she supports . "
Kerry said Palin fails the " threshold test " of a vice president : " to prove to the American people that the person that you 've chosen can fill in tomorrow " as president .
Asked if McCain had picked someone who could lead the country if something happened to him , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , a close friend of his , first sidestepped the question .
" I think what he was looking for is a partner to tell a story about what he wants to do in Washington , " Graham said on ABC .
Pressed , Graham said Palin has far more of the right kind of experience for the job than does Sen. Barack Obama , the Democratic nominee .
" What has he done ?
What has he done ?
What has Senator Obama done in terms of managing a war ? "
Graham said .
On Fox , McCain cited several reasons that Palin 's experience on foreign affairs surpasses Obama's .
First , he said , she agrees with him on issues such as Iran and the Iraq war .
Plus , he said , Palin , as governor , has headed the Alaskan National Guard .
In an ABC interview , McCain 's wife , Cindy , noted that Palin is especially suited to confront foreign issues such as the resurgence of Russia because Alaska is in close proximity to it .
" Alaska is the closest part of our continent to Russia .
So it 's not as if she does n't understand what 's at stake here , " Cindy McCain said .
Cindy McCain also addressed her just - completed trip to war - torn Georgia , calling it the kind of trip she said she 'd like to take more often as a first lady .
" I do n't represent the government or anything , but , from the humanitarian aspect , it 's very important that we continue to get aid in , " she said .
Cindy McCain also addressed Obama 's acceptance speech at last week 's Democratic convention , saying she took umbrage at comments that McCain has lived a lavish life and can't relate to ordinary Americans .
" I 'm offended by Barack Obama saying that about my husband , " she said .
" My husband was a Navy boy .
His father and mother were in the Navy .
I mean , there 's nothing elitist about that . "
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , a Republican who was passed over by McCain for Palin , said his fellow governor would bring real - life economic experience to the ticket .
" One of the objectives is to be able to relate to ... and meet and address the needs of average Americans , " Pawlenty said on " Meet the Press . "
And Lieberman also supported the pick , calling it " a bold choice " on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
" If this is a change election , it 's about changing Washington so that it works again , " Lieberman said , " so that this alliance of partisan political power - brokers and special - interests peddlers is broken . "
McCain said ads of his that compare Obama to celebrities and attack his record were not , in fact , negative .
" It 's respectful .
But first of all , I also at that time asked Senator Obama to go to town hall meetings with me .
We could appear in front of the American people , the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy had pledged to do , " McCain said .
" I 'll tell you , that changes the tenor of a campaign , I know because I 've done them in the past . "

GOP longshot : ' No apologies ' for racy , moaning robocall David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 28 , 2008
Print This Email This
The longshot challenger for a California congressional seat is being pilloried for running a moaning , gasping robo - call that sounds more like phone sex than a political message .
" Mike Thompson been a bad boy , " the sultry voice begins .
" We all said no to the bailout , but Thompson backed Bush , just like he did with the Patriot Act.
Uhh !
Vote ' Yeesss ' for Zane . "
The office of incumbent Rep. Mike Thompson ( D - CA ) blasted the call , which ran on Sunday , as a " sophomoric and tasteless prank , " adding , " It 's incredible that someone would waste voters ' time with this drivel . "
Republican candidate Zane Starkewolf had pulled the call by Monday , but he told CBS13 News in Sacramento , " I make no apologies for it . "
" It was n't really the message exactly that I wanted to state , and the risque - type voice was n't exactly the tone that I wanted to set , " the 27 year old Starkewolf admitted .
" The original intent of the message was to be a little risque , you know , so I wrote the script for it and then it got , you know , a little more enthusiasm from the staff person who was reading the script . "
" The fact , is that 's a good thing , " concluded Starkewolf , " because we need enthusiasm back in politics . "
Starkewolf , a supporter of Ron Paul , has described the bailout as " devastating for America . "
In a statement on his campaign website , he further explains , " I acknowledge that the idea behind the ad , and indeed the execution of the call , was not the safe route to take .
And if my run for office was simply for personal gain , I would not have taken a risk .
But the content and the facts within the message were there and need to be discussed .
Hopefully this call opens up the forum for discussion on the issues and on the representation which is so essential to our system . "
Robocalls are illegal in California unless introduced by a live person and can incur a fine of $ 500 per incident .
However , the ban is rarely enforced .

The First Android Phone : Reactions and Predictions
by Ostatic Staff - Sep. 23 , 2008
So the details are in on the T - Mobile G1 - - the first phone based on Google 's open source Android operating system .
It 's got some interface attractions not found on the iPhone , including a trackball and a slide - out keyboard , and it ties in with a broad range of Google 's services , including StreetView , Google Maps , Gmail and more .
At $ 179 , it 's cheaper than the iPhone , but it has some disadvantages in comparison , especially the fact that T - Mobile only offers 3G service in 21 cities .
Let 's not forget that this phone runs an open source platform though .
Here are some thoughts from the LiMo Foundation , and predictions .
We 've covered the LiMo Foundation 's open source efforts in the mobile space several times , and it has attracted powerful partners , including Verizon Wireless and Mozilla .
There are already multiple handsets available running LiMo 's Linux - based platform .
So what does LiMo have to say about the new G1 phone and Android 's prospects .
Here is today 's statement from Morgan Gillis , executive director of the LiMo Foundation :
" As an organization that was brought into being by the mobile industry to unlock innovation and catalyze choice throughout the value system -- and especially for the mobile consumer -- LiMo Foundation welcomes the launch of the G1 device using Google 's Android platform .
We believe that the G1 , following after the 23 handsets already brought to mobile consumers using the LiMo Platform , provides further support to the widely held view that Linux is now positioned to become the most widely deployed OS within open mobile handsets . "
" We also look to Google to use the occasion of the launch of the G1 to openly answer some of the important questions outstanding since the Google Android platform was announced almost a year ago : which services will be made available to mobile consumers on Google Android handsets but not on other open mobile handsets ; will G1 users have an open and free choice about whether or not they subscribe to Google 's services ; why has Google elected to build its own handset platform rather than working collaboratively with the mobile industry on the available alternatives ? "
Hmm , the LiMo Foundation also " welcomed " the Symbian Foundation , which is moving forward with its own mobile open source efforts .
While I do n't think this first Android phone is going to represent stiff competition for the iPhone at this point , I think all the Android phones are going to be stiff competition for LiMo , open source Symbian , and especially for Microsoft .
This first Android phone ties in with Google 's services very closely , and that could end up being attractive enough for Google that it begins to subsidize Android phones .
At $ 179 , with a $ 25 monthly data plan , the G1 is cheaper than the iPhone , but Google could end up making these phones far cheaper if they prove to hook people with Google 's services and ad network .
Another wild card is whether developers deliver a lot of good , free applications for Android phones -- as can be had easily on the iPhone .
The early applications for Android that we 've covered look excellent .
If the applications keep coming through , we could see some exciting competition in the mobile space .
That has to be worrisome for LiMo , the Symbian Foundation , Nokia and Microsoft .
Beccy , 54 , said : " How on earth are they supposed to know what speed they are doing ?
You could be doing 28 mph , how would anyone know unless they had a speed gun ?
I just think the system is flawed – it's open to abuse and error . "
The Amish conjure thoughts of horse - drawn buggies , hand - churned butter and hand - made wooden furniture .
Technology certainly does n't spring to mind .
The Amish people are known for their no -thrills approach to life , which includes the rejection of most modern - day conveniences .
They use refrigerators , batteries and power generators , but hooking into the electric grid is a no - no because it would connect them to the outside world .
But some members of an Amish community in northeastern Indiana hope to get electricity from solar and wind power , The News - Sentinel of Fort Wayne reported last week .
Victor Wagler , a 63 - year - old Amish man , is seeking permission from Allen County officials to build an 87 - foot steel tower he plans to top with a wind turbine .
The generator would be capable of producing about 538 kilowatts of electricity per month , according to The News - Sentinel .
Along with a solar panel , Wagler plans to power his home and barn .
So what makes solar and wind power acceptable ?
According to an Amish interpretation of the Bible , members of the community should live with limited influences from the outside world .
Around 1920 , Amish leaders decided the linking of electrical wires into their community would bring temptations from the outside world into their community and destroy church and family life .
But Amish leaders stopped short of condemning electricity itself as an evil .
The connection to the grid was the problem , they said .
The Amish probably are n't the most obvious advocates of distributed renewable energy .
But they are boosting business for installer Solar Energy Systems of Nappanee , Ind .
The company 's owner told The News - Sentinel that the Amish make up 70 percent of his clientele .
Meanwhile , the Vatican is getting ready to install solar panels on the roof of the Paul VI building , a receiving hall that seats 12,000 people , according to an article by ZENIT , which covers the Pope and the Vatican .
The panels , scheduled to be installed during the next two months , are coming from the German company SolarWorld .
The firm gave 2,000 panels to help Pope Benedict XVI celebrate Three Kings Day , which marks the visit of the three wise men to the baby Jesus .
The panels are expected to generate about 315.5 megawatts of electricity annually .
The Pope has been vocal in his opposition to global warming , and in March included destroying the environment on a list of " new sins " ( see Green : The New Religion ? ) .
He is not the first religious leader to give solar power his blessing .
The Dalai Lama , for one , already has solar power at his private living quarters at the Gaden Jangtse monastery in the southern Indian state of Karnataka , according to the Solar Electric Light Fund , a nonprofit that supports solar power in developing countries .
At my previous employer , one of the early decisions that had huge payoffs later was the SQL naming conventions .
A good naming convention is more than just a nicety .
It lets you write programs that do n’t need to be told about the relationships among tables and columns .
There are many ways to do this , I think .
But in practice , I think I ’ve seen only a few customer systems that have a completely consistent , logical naming convention .
And there are levels of convenience ; some systems have a couple extra rules that make a big difference .
In this post I ’ll explain the components of my ideal naming conventions .
Consistent letter case .
I prefer all lowercase for readability and type - ability .
Regardless , you need the same case for both table and column names , unless your chosen programming language is case - insensitive ( and if it is , you should be flogged for using it ) .
This is n’t mandatory , but word separators ( underscores ) are pretty nice .
If you run things together , you ca n’t tell the difference between “ API rate sheet ” and “ a pirate sheet . ”
Yeah , that ’s a real example .
If a table has a single - column primary key , such as an auto - increment column , then that column is named the same thing as the table .
For example , the user table ’s primary key is called user .
Naming it id or user_id or anything else may be logical and consistent too , but in my experience it leads to a lot more code .
table ’s primary key is called .
Naming it or or anything else may be logical and consistent too , but in my experience it leads to a lot more code .
If a column expresses a relationship among tables , name it the same as the related table .
For example , a table of blog posts should have a column called user which is a foreign key to the user table .
which is a foreign key to the table .
Singular .
Both table and column names are singular .
Plurals add a ton of complexity , and defeat the niceness of naming columns and tables the same thing .
Fooling around with conversions between plural and singular ( goose / geese , moose / moose , cow / cattle ) is a waste of synapses and code .
Sakila ’s convention
That ’s not a lot of rules , is it ?
Let ’s see how the Sakila sample database would fare if these rules were applied to it .
Two of the core tables are actor and film , with the “ acted in ” relationship expressed in the film_actor table .
The tables look like this ( simplified ) :
CREATE TABLE actor ( actor_id smallint unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , first_name varchar ( 45 ) NOT NULL , last_name varchar ( 45 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( actor_id ) ) ; CREATE TABLE film ( film_id smallint unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , title varchar ( 255 ) NOT NULL , description text , ... other columns ... PRIMARY KEY ( film_id ) ) ; CREATE TABLE film_actor ( actor_id smallint unsigned NOT NULL , film_id smallint unsigned NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( actor_id , film_id ) ) ;
What ’s right about this
This is already a pretty nice convention .
For example , tables are singular , and the columns that have the same meaning have the same name everywhere .
This means you can write
select actor.first_name from actor inner join film_actor using ( actor_id ) inner join film using ( film_id ) ;
The ability to use the USING keyword in a join is one way to test whether your naming convention makes sense .
If you had gone with the “ every primary key is named id , and foreign keys are named [ table ] _id ” convention that ’s pretty common , you ’d have to write
from actor inner join film_actor on actor.id = film_actor .actor_id inner join film on film.id = film_actor.film_id ;
This is not nearly as elegant .
So Sakila ’s naming convention is pretty nice already .
What I ’d change about Sakila
If I had designed Sakila , I ’d have done this :
CREATE TABLE actor ( actor smallint unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , first_name varchar ( 45 ) NOT NULL , last_name varchar ( 45 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( actor ) ) ; CREATE TABLE film ( film smallint unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , title varchar ( 255 ) NOT NULL , description text , ... other columns ... PRIMARY KEY ( film ) ) ; CREATE TABLE cast ( actor smallint unsigned NOT NULL , film smallint unsigned NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( actor , film ) ) ;
It ’s not a dramatic change in this case , and it does n’t really simplify the example queries a lot , but consider what happens when you write an ORM on top of this simplified naming convention .
As an example , suppose your database has accounts that belong to clients , each of which is managed by a single employee .
Look at the following code snippet :
$ acc = new Account ( $ account_no ) ; $ email = new Email ( ) ; $ email -> to ( $acc->client ->employee -> email ) ; $ email -> body ( " Account $ acc for client $ acc -> client is expired " ) ; $ email -> send ( ) ;
If the table and column names match , such an ORM is really easy to build .
If they do n’t , there ’s more code to write .
It ’s hard to estimate the reduction in lines of code , tests , and mistakes , but I think it ’s pretty significant ; some five - line programs I ’ve written might have needed thousands of lines of code without the naming conventions , and I ’m sure a lot of code would have needed supporting meta - data tables to define the mappings between different types of data .
Summary
Here are a couple of concrete ideas .
With the conventions I ’ve shown , it ’s easy to write a simple recursive program that can examine your entire database for data consistency , based only on naming conventions .
And you can easily write a program to dump an account and all its related data ( client , employee , and so on ) for such purposes as migrating a client to a new shard or creating a dataset for a test suite .
There are many good ways to do this , and your favorite method probably has lots to recommend it .
But after having worked with lots of such systems myself ( including one company who mandated that column names had to be globally unique , which was horrible ) , I still have n’t seen anything better than the simple conventions I ’ve described above .
It ’s kind of a reductionistic “ let ’s make this absolutely as simple as possible ” philosophy , and it really pays off .

Google turns up only 657 hits for " Everything the government touches turns to . "
It seems to be an unfamiliar statement .
I first heard it in the 1970s from a Chicago economist named Karl Brunner .
It is attributed to Ringo Starr , of Beatles fame .
The whole statement is " Everything the government touches turns to s**t . "
Ringo ’s aphorism is true .
As long as a country like ours is under The One and Single government , this will be so .
No isolated person and no isolated private sector institution , be it church , company , institute , or university , is a match for the size and power of a national government like that of America .
Any industry that the government touches is no match for the government ’s power .
That industry will deteriorate , fade , kowtow to government , lose its innovative powers , misdirect its investment , seek subsidies , pay tribute to politicians , try to become a cartel , and eventually lose any semblance of operating in a truly free market .
The government has the power to kill any free market .
It has done this to industry after industry and market after market .
Worse still , since everything the government touches turns to s**t , and since the government ’s powers allow it to touch more and more things , we have a situation of deterioration .
I could say the same thing about individual freedoms .
At the moment , the national government imposes its paralyzing vision on everything in its territorial domain of power .
State , city , town , and village governments are often as much ordered about and forced into measures as any of us .
They do not currently give us the degree of competition in governance that would free up the system .
But as much as I believe all the above is true , I am vastly outnumbered by those Americans who disagree with me .
This article is about how most of us , I would hope , can become better off , despite our differences , by having the government of our choice all the time .
Americans are divided politically .
That is natural .
There is no way that we will ever be united on political matters , any more than we are united on religion .
And being united on political matters is neither necessary to improve the situation we are in nor a good idea .
Libertarians cannot convert large numbers of Democrats to libertarianism .
Democrats cannot convert large numbers of Republicans .
Anarchists cannot convert large numbers of libertarians to anarchism .
Anyway , most of us are interested first and foremost in improving our own situation , not that of everyone else in general .
To move forward , we do need some area of agreement .
Otherwise , if and when our national government fails , we will end up dividing into clans and sects and fighting one another to see who will impose his vision on the rest .
Or else , we will fail to take full advantage of the opportunity that such a breakup and failure would provide us .
The Soviet Union broke up , and the peoples immediately placed themselves into and under States again .
They did not learn from experience .
They were not ready to advance the nature of their governance .
The attitudes of people to the situation of deterioration that I see vary all over the map .
I may see deterioration , but many others see no problem at all .
Some think doomsday lies directly ahead .
Some do n’t care .
Some have given up hope .
It is an important political fact that attitudes vary .
This matters a great deal because a person ’s happiness depends on such attitudes , and each of us has a right to pursue happiness as we see fit ( within the normal boundaries of natural law . )
Attitudes are also held firmly .
No number of articles by me and no number of letters and e-mails between me and people who disagree with me are likely to convert them to my way of thinking .
If someone likes the Social Security program and likes subsidized housing , I can not convert them .
And if I try , they will feel threatened by my message and dig in their heels .
Pointing out truths in articles is one thing .
Pushing for conversions is another .
You are the best judge of your own welfare .
You do not want to be ruled by me any more than I want to be ruled by you .
That mutual attitude gives us the common ground we need to forge a new way of living together .
I therefore do not ask for anyone to convert to my way of thinking .
I ask only for one thing :
Give me my freedom from your government .
Correspondingly , I give you the freedom to have your government — with one important stipulation .
It is that neither of us demand that the other remove himself from the country ( this land , this place , and this people ) that we both cherish .
If you want social insurance programs delivered by your government , then , by all means , have them .
I will not stop you .
Will you then allow me to live my life without being forced into your programs ?
Will you allow me to have the governance of my choice if you have yours , both of us living in this land we now call America ?
Will you allow each of us to have the non-territorial government of our choice ?
Will you allow alternative governments operating over the same territory but on different self - chosen constituencies ?
Will you endorse that as an ideal ?
This ideal , freedom of choice in governance , is eminently just .
It is a natural right that flows directly from our rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
It is why we have a multitude of native nations within the boundaries of the U.S. " Under this policy , the U.S. recognizes 550 native nations within its borders .
These are not state or federal agencies .
This policy was established in 1970 by President Richard Nixon and reaffirmed on June 14 , 1991 by President George Bush . "
Cannot non-native Americans gain the same rights as native Americans and have their own governance ?
Governance involves various goods that we perceive governance brings us .
Each person has different views of what those goods are , what they are worth , and how to attain them .
If I argue for individual liberty , as I do , then I logically must argue for your freedom to choose those goods that you wish to consume in non-free markets .
Freedom of choice in government encompasses your freedom to trade off some of that freedom for the sake of being ruled by others , if that is what makes you happy .
If I believe in freedom , I cannot force other people to run their lives with the freedoms that I may value and think good and proper .
But neither may they justly force me into their views of government and into the government that they choose .
The situation we are in today is a situation of force , for both statists and non-statists , for both anarchists and minarchists , for Democrats , Republicans , and those who prefer third parties .
Many of us are seeking the power to control everyone else and remake society in our vision .
We need to agree to call a halt to that process if we are ever to move forward .
I am proposing non-territorial self - determination ( panarchy ) .
The notion of self - determination needs to be thoroughly revamped in order to remove its territorial context .
Otherwise , it is contradictory and leads into conflicts and civil wars .
Georgians leave the Soviet Union , for example , but then a portion of them are not allowed to secede .
The colonies gain independence from England , but then when the South secedes from the North , a terrible war follows as the North tries to prevent it .
In Wikipedia , we find " Self - determination is defined as free choice of one ’s own acts without external compulsion , and especially as the freedom of the people of a given territory to determine their own political status or independence from their current state . "
This definition is flawed , because it restricts self - determination to a people of a given territory .
In practice , however , any existing government demands allegiance of everyone in a given territory , so that self - determination as thus defined is internally contradictory .
Non-territorial self - determination means that each person has a right to determine ( or choose ) the government or governing institutions that he or she wants , on a voluntary and non-compelled basis .
This means that in a given region , there may co-exist a number of governments .
And persons choose the one or perhaps ones they wish to join .
These governments may retain the sovereignty and legitimacy that the subject peoples grant them , but they will differ drastically from existing governments in one respect : they will not necessarily be territorial .
They will not force everyone in a given region to be under their rule .
( They can be territorial to the extent that people willingly aggregate land and separate themselves . )
We can move forward .
But to do so we need the liberty to have competing governments on the soil we now call America in the same way that we have competing churches , supermarkets , towns , states , and universities .
We can open up the immense possibilities of handling our governance in more effective ways .
They will be ways of self - government that involve freely - chosen governance , in which it will be possible to opt out easily from badly - functioning governance .
It should be as easy to stop feeding a government we dislike with our hard - earned resources as it is to change gas stations .
It should be as easy to change schools as it is to change the supermarkets we patronize .
We take government for granted because we each have so little influence on it .
We take the short view .
In doing that , we shortchange ourselves and our progeny .
If we think about changing the basic structure of government , then we will start doing some important homework that we tend to neglect .
If we had a choice of governance institutions , not just candidates for a given form of government , we ’d pay far more attention to governance .
There are clues to progress that we need to investigate .
Some governments are better than others .
We should ask why .
Governments sometimes do some things better than other things .
We should ask why .
Government frequently does far worse than no government at all .
We should ask why .
Governments frequently start out in hope and end in despair .
We should ask why .
We cannot move ahead unless we are willing to abandon the erroneous beliefs we take for granted and do not question .
Chief among these is that government must be territorial and control vast amounts of territory and the people who live in them .
In Erie County alone , there are 3 cities and 25 towns in an area covering roughly 30 miles by 35 miles .
Erie is one of 62 counties in New York State .
A town is a semi-territorial form of government .
No town claims to cover the entire county , but each town governs a given area .
Within my town , there is already divided jurisdiction over roads .
A county road can join a town road which joins a state road .
There are already divided police forces .
There is already an array of different park systems , school systems , and sewer systems .
No one of us has a roadmap to non-territorial self - determination or can even define it fully .
The argument that it is the right course and a right goal is strong .
The argument that it will improve over our current situation is strong .
This is a goal that can find agreement from groups that are otherwise highly antagonistic in their political views .
Home - grown Nazis can sit down with anarchists and agree that each has a right to its own non-territorial self - determination .
Can Democrats and Republicans learn to tolerate each other if each has its own institutions ?
A degree of self - segregation may follow .
No one knows , but it is likely .
A Buddhist may not wish to have Nazis marching down his street every night or burning books .
I assume in all of this a basic framework of right action .
That goes without saying .
Tolerance of a government does not mean approval of anything anyone does under that government or anything that government does .
For an exposition of what tolerance means in the context of panarchy , see here .
Everything the government does turns to s**t , in my view .
Some agree .
Many do not .
In any event , all of us are stuck with one national government for the time being .
Many of us are unhappy with this .
The losers in each election are invariably unhappy .
They do not have to suffer , however .
There is a way out .
They can have their own government all the time .
You can have yours .
I can have mine .
But only if each government is non-territorial or ex-territorial .
This way is called panarchy .

Jim Balsillie , co-chief executive of Research In Motion ( RIM ) , holds the new Blackberry Bold handset during its launch in Mumbai September 18 , 2008 .
AT&T Inc said on Wednesday it would sell the BlackBerry Bold from Research In Motion Ltd for $ 299 , or 50 percent more than it charges for Apple Inc 's iPhone .
REUTERS / Punit Paranjpe
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - AT&T Inc said on Wednesday it would sell the BlackBerry Bold from Research In Motion Ltd for $ 299 , or 50 percent more than it charges for Apple Inc ’s iPhone .
AT&T , which had set a new bar for smartphones with a $ 200 iPhone , said it would start selling the high - speed version of Rim ’s popular mobile email devices from November 4 , just ahead of the unofficial start of the U.S. holiday shopping season .
But with its relatively high price , Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King said the Bold with likely be more popular among executives than consumers .
“ The BlackBerry is going to be almost entirely business focused .
i Phone is still mainly attracting consumers , ” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King .
AT&T said it would be the first U.S. operator to support navigation services for customers traveling outside the country with the Bold , which also supports Wi - Fi , a short - range wireless network technology found in coffee shops .
The $ 299 price tag applies to customers who sign up for a two year contract with AT&T , the company said .
( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin set the tone for how she would approach Thursday night 's vice presidential debate before it began .
Meeting Democratic rival Sen . Joe Biden at center stage to shake his hand as they walked out , she greeted him warmly and said , " Nice to meet you .
Hey , can I call you Joe ? "
For most of the rest of the 90 - minute debate at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri , the Republican nominee answered like that next - door - neighbor hockey mom who just happens to be running for vice president .
She sometimes seemed short on specifics and long on folksiness , as she aimed to appeal to what she called the heartland of America .
She spoke of people who know what it 's like to worry about not having health insurance , a worry she and her husband once shared .
" I 'll betcha , " Palin said in answering the first question , urging anyone who wants to get a barometer on the economy to " go to a kids ' soccer game on Saturday and turn to any parent there on the sideline . "
" Bless their hearts , " she said in another answer .
iReport.com : Did Palin knock it out of the park ?
On the cause of the mortgage crisis : " Darn right , it was the predator lenders . "
About tax cuts : " Darn right , we need tax relief for Americans . "
Those who have debated Palin before were not surprised .
" She clearly has a very canny ability to connect with people .
What she says .
How she says it .
And her body language , " said former Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles , a Democrat whom Palin defeated in 2006 , about the dozen times he debated her .
" But she has shown very little interest or knowledge of policy .
She goes for slogans . "
Andrew Halcro , former Alaska state representative and a Republican who ran for governor as an independent in 2006 , reckons he debated her about two dozen times .
" She spoke a lot in platitudes , in populist tones , " Halcro recalled .
" What I call glittering generalities . "
Halcro did n't see anything different Thursday night .
" She held her own by , in a number of those questions , not answering the question , " he said Thursday night .
" What were the quality of her answers ?
That 's filling 45 seconds , but it 's not saying a lot . "
For the course of the debate , Palin and Biden were friendly and cordial , often looking at each other when they talked .
There were no instances of the more - experienced Biden seeming to patronize Palin , as happened in the 1984 debate between then - Vice President George H.W. Bush and Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro .
" Let me help you with the difference , Mrs. Ferraro , between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon , " Bush said at one point .
Ferraro fired back : " Let me just say first of all , that I almost resent , Vice President Bush , your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy . "
Palin did not answer a number of the questions put before her , instead returning to her main talking points : cutting taxes , reigning in government spending and making the United States energy independent .
" I may not answer the questions that either the moderator or you want to hear , but I 'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also , " she said early in the debate .
Palin had miscues , sometimes mangling the wording in her sentences or calling someone by the wrong name .
She referred to Gen. David McKiernan , the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan , as " McClellan . "
Another time , she referred to Biden as " O'Biden . "
Palin also seemed to have a prerehearsed sound bite she was waiting to use .
" Say it ai n't so , Joe .
There you go again , pointing backwards again , " she said toward the end of the debate .
" Now , doggone it , let 's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future . "
Still , many pundits gave her a passing grade .
" She did pretty well for what she had to do , which is to be thought of as a possible vice president without being laughed at , " said Professor Richard Cohen of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
" Her job was to make up for her deficiencies in prior instances in which she looked unqualified and incompetent . "
Palin had received criticism after recent television interviews with CBS ' Katie Couric , when she stumbled through her answers to questions about foreign policy , Supreme Court rulings and which newspapers she reads .
Her answers regarding Russia and the congressional bailout bill have reverberated throughout the blogosphere and turned Palin into a punch line on " Saturday Night Live . "
Larry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia , also said she helped herself Thursday night .
" Expectations were very low for Palin , and she exceeded them , " Sabato said .
" She did n't win , but she did n't lose .
People tuned in to see a car crash , and there was n't one -- on either side . "
Susan MacManus , a politics professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa , also thought Palin did well enough .
Asked to score Palin on a scale of 1 - 10 , MacManus said , " For what she was intending to do , a seven . "
Neither Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama nor Republican challenger Sen. John McCain attended the debate .
In the end , observers said , the debate did not change much .
" This debate will be forgotten by next week , " Sabato said .
" As usual , the VP candidates wo n't matter much in the final result .
The status quo ( that favors Obama since he 's ahead ) has been preserved . "
This was the only vice presidential debate .
Obama and McCain are scheduled to debate twice more before the November 4 general election : October 7 at Belmont University in Nashville , Tennessee , and October 15 at Hofstra University in Hempstead , New York .
CNN 's Arthur Brice contributed to this report .
All About Joseph Biden • Sarah Palin
Last year , Robertson had said that the U.S. economy was in for " a doozy of a recession . "
He said the reason was the credit situation was worse than anyone had thought .
" Doozy ’s a tough one and long one , I think that ’s what we ’re headed for , " said the chairman of Tiger Management .
( Watch the accompanying video for the full interview with Julian Robertson ... )
" I do n’t mean to imply that this is going to last quite as long as what ’s been happening in Japan , but when they went into their decline in 1990 , almost 20 years ago , their people were loaded with savings — but [ Americans are ] all broke , " he said .
" ... If we leave out the home in the calculations , I ’d say that 80 - 85 percent of Americans are broke .
So they have to cut back on their spending . "
Robertson said that his current favorite trade is the " curve steepener " trade .
" It ’s a derivative which pays the movements in the difference between the two - year interest rate on government bonds and the 10 - year and 30 - year … I think the curve steepener is the best hedge against inflation and I think we ’re going to have some inflation . "
Robertson was optimistic about " some excellent buys " that investors should consider .
He likes Apple , Microsoft , Baidu , MasterCard and Visa .
" I have a pretty good bet on copper .
I think that copper , which is selling so far below its cost of production , is a terrific short , " he added .
“ He Denied It Was Racist ”
For the most part , I try to steer away from accusations of racism .
I ’m usually more interested in changing people ’s minds , and that tends not to happen when I call them racists , since they suddenly feel the need to convince me that they are not , in fact , about to excuse themselves for a moment and reappear in Klan robes .
It ’s not conducive to genuine engagement .
Sometimes , however , it ’s hard to see what other word would do the trick :
“ A local newspaper columnist , in a spoof of Obama ’s platform , wrote in one recent piece that the Democrat would hire the rapper Ludacris to paint the White House black ( a reference to a pro-Obama song by Ludacris ) , and divert more foreign aid to Africa so “ the Obama family there can skim enough to allow them to free their goats and live the American Dream . ”
He joked that Obama would replace the 50 stars on the U.S. flag “ with a star and crescent logo , ” an Islamic symbol , and that his policy on drugs would be to “ raise taxes to pay for Obama ’s inner-city political base . ”
The columnist , Bobby May , is also treasurer of the Buchanan County Republican Party and was listed in a July news release as the county ’s representative on McCain ’s Virginia leadership team , though he said his column reflected his views alone , and he denied it was racist . ”
You can read the actual column here ( pdf ) .
( One note : the passage above says that it describes Obama ’s position on drugs as “ raise taxes to pay for Obama ’s inner-city political base . ”
In fact , it ’s “ raise taxes to pay for free drugs for Obama ’s inner- city political base . ” )
In addition to a bunch of standard slams against Democrats ( “ tax breaks for NAMBLA memberships ” ) , and to the ‘ free drugs ’ and Ludacris passages above ( the latter of which also includes the claim that Obama would pay for free paint for graffiti on the White House ) , it includes the following “ planks ” from
“ Obama ’s platform ” :
* REPARATIONS TO BLACK COMMUNITY : Opposes before Election Day and supports after Election Day .
* FREEDOM OF RELIGION : Mandatory Black Liberation
Theology classes taught in all churches – raise taxes to pay for this mandate .
… * FOREIGN RELATIONS : Appoint Al Sharpton as Secretary of State , Jesse Jackson as UN Representative … * NATIONAL ANTHEM : Change to the “ Black National Anthem ” by James Weldon Johnson .
And raise taxes .
* CURRENCY : Update photos to reflect U.S. diversity : include pictures of “ great Americans ” such as Oprah Winfrey , Ludacris , Sheila Jackson - Lee , Paris Hilton , Britney Spears , and William Jefferson ( Obama ’s new Secretary of the Treasury … )
In some cases ( Black Liberation Theology ) I can see an actual connection to Obama .
But Al Sharpton as Secretary of State ?
Free spray paint for graffiti on the White House ?
The Black National Anthem ?
I ca n’t see how this is different from “ poking fun ” at John McCain by saying that he wants to change the national anthem to the Horst Wessel Lied , appoint David Duke Ambassador to Israel , require that Christian Identity theology be taught in churches , pay for free meth and Oxycontin for his base , and commission Thomas Kinkade to cover the facades of the White House with his saccharine stylings .
I mean , McCain is white , right ?
Get it ?
Hahahahaha !!
It will be interesting to see whether Bobby May is asked to leave McCain ’s Virginia Leadership Committee .
He should be .
Because even if he does n’t think what he said was racist , it is .
Barack Obama indicated this afternoon he intended to go forward with Friday 's debate as planned , saying " it 's more important than ever " that the presidential candidates lay out their principles to voters .
" This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess , " Obama told reporters at a news conference in Florida .
" In my mind , actually , it 's more important than ever that we present ourselves to the American people and try to describe where we want to take the country and where we wnt to take the economy as well as dealing with some of the issues of foreign policy that were initially the subject of the debate , " he said .
Obama also said he , McCain and other officials could address the crisis in a bipartisan fashion and still go on with the campaign , noting that multi-tasking comes with the office .
" It is going to be part of the president 's job to deal with more than one thing at once , " he noted .

The proverbial dam is breaking [ via E&P ] :
The Denver Post , which had backed George W. Bush in 2004 and is owned by Republican - leaning William Dean Singleton , this evening endorsed Barack Obama for president .
So did the Chicago Sun-Times , Kansas City Star .
Southwest News - Herald ( Ill. ) and the Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
And to top it off : another Bush - backing in 2004 , The Salt Lake Tribune .
This followed this afternoon ’s surprises : the Chicago Tribune , which has never in 150 years endorsed a Democrat , backed Obama , as did its fellow Tribune paper , the Los Angeles — which had endorsed no one in more than 30 years .
It seems like a dam broke yesterday with the unexpectedly early choice of Obama by The Washington Post .
Now , of 74 endorsements from Editorial boards at newspapers , Barack Obama has received 58 of them .

Social media , user generated content , folksonomies , Web 2.0 .
Geeks usually view these emerging phenomena in a glowing light – as ways for individuals and groups to co-operatively contribute to the generation of technology , culture and information .
To cynics such buzzwords define methods for private companies and corporations to build products and databases without needing to pay for the work involved .
Either way , social media has become ubiquitous online , with topic specific social networks connecting the audiences of most major websites , while user generated content ( from Facebook posts , to Google Maps mashups ) add value for users and content owners alike .
This year sees user generated content spill over into interactive entertainment in a big way , with games like Will Wright ’s ‘ Spore ‘ , and Media Molecule ’s ‘ Little Big Planet ‘ gaining appeal through thousands of user made creatures and levels ; content produced for free by people contributing their creative energies and time .
The downside of user generated content is that creators , coders , artists , and authors – the ones producing the content – are engaging in a one sided relationship .
Their work , once contributed , can become wholly owned and controlled by the company they provide it to .
If the creative work becomes part of a larger whole then this non reciprocal relationship means that while the website , book , or games they ’ve added to can freely use their contributions , the opposite is not true .
My friends and I experienced the flip side of social media this week .
Two years ago we entered a contest to be part of a video by the punk group ‘ Yeah Yeah Yeahs ’ .
The collaboration asked fans to dress up like the band and film themselves dancing around to the song ‘ Cheated Hearts ’ , a track from the Yeah Yeah Yeah ’s second LP ‘ Show Your Bones ’ .
It was n’t an original idea , the Welsh indie group Feeder had done pretty much the same thing almost five years before , with their fantastic video ‘ Just a Day “ ; but we liked the band , we liked the song , and it looked like fun .
My friends and I duly spent an evening getting dressed up in ludicrous costumes and makeup , and filming ourselves in various states of confusion .
Afterwards , we ripped our tapes to computer and sent the originals , along with a release providing the band and their representatives with ownership of “ all worldwide rights in the material submitted ” .
This rather lunatic agreement is pretty standard as far as user generated content goes , and though we did n’t like it , it was required to contribute .
A few months later we received a notice from the band , to the effect that our performance was to be included in the final video , and that we would receive a prize for our contribution .
Shortly afterwards the band sent us a token bunch of signed pictures , stickers , patches and the like .
Finally the Cheated Hearts video was released .
Rather than being exclusively fan made , it intermixed contributions from fans and a second official band video .
Despite being flattered ( and embarrassed ! ) at be flashed across MTV around the world , we were a little disappointed that our contribution ( it ’s at the 3.04 mark ) was a just 3 seconds long .
So we took our footage , synced it to the song and uploaded our own fan edit video , as did a variety of other folks [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
It was something to email our friends about , a bit of humiliating fun to play at parties .
Our finished video was no great shakes , but we liked it , as did just under seven thousand other folks on Youtube .
However , I ca n’t show it to you , because apparently someone at Universal did n’t .
Here it is n’t ..
The video has been removed from Youtube , removed from Youtube listings and cannot be accessed from the site .
Last Sunday ( October 19th ) , I received notice from Youtube that one of those dreaded Digital Millenium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) ‘ takedown notice ‘ had been sent to them – they do n’t tell you from whom – claiming ownership of the song included in the video .
All such DMCA copyright notices require is for someone to claim ownership of a video , or of audio or visual elements which appear in a video .
There is no defence for ‘ fair use ‘ , for parody or educational purposes .
All someone who wants a video – any video – removed from Youtube has to do , is to fill in this form on the Youtube site and email it off .
The video will be instantly removed .
The individual , group or company claiming ‘ infringement ’ does n’t have to demonstrate ownership .
Like I said , they do n’t tell you who sent the notice , but it ’s not hard to guess .
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are signed to Interscope Records , a label owned by the Universal Music Group .
According to the ( user generated ! ) encyclopaedia Wikipedia , UMG includes the largest music publishing company in the world , Universal Music Publishing Group , and is one of the ‘ Big 4 ’ record labels controlling much of the music industry .
Legally , what with the release we signed and the screwy DMCA , I figured we did n’t have a leg to stand on .
But I sent an email to the Electronic Frontier Foundation anyway .
The EFF are an organisation who monitor emerging internet and copyright law , and attempt to redress the misuse of copyright legislation .
I asked them if making a so called ‘ DMCA Counterclaim ‘ ( the only way to fight a DMCA take down notice ) , from outside the US would make me personally liable to legal action .
The EFF were kind enough to get back to me this morning .
So where does this leave us ?
We could re-upload the video to Youtube or another streaming service , potentially leaving us ( well , me ) exposed to legal action under the DMCA or it ’s European equivalent .
I ’m no lawyer , so I ’ve no idea what the potential penalties are in this area .
If I ’m quick ( you only get 14 days , and five have already passed ) , I could submit a DMCA counterclaim , which as Eva points out above , could theoretically expose me to conviction for perjury in a San Francisco court , and to a lawsuit for damages ( sic ) from Universal Music .
I could on the other hand use Youtube ’s internal tools , which became available as a link from my account ’s ‘ my videos ’ page , once the DMCA claim was received .
These provide a variety of unhelpful options – I can permanently mute the audio element of the video , replace the audio with content licensed by Youtube ( the Yeah Yeah Yeah ’s are n’t an option , and even if they were , the audio would n’t be correctly synced ) , or dispute the claim – which again could result in the deletion of my account , if the ‘ copyright owner ’ upholds their claim , which seems likely .
Or I could write this blog post , publicise the issue and perhaps in an ideal world where clouds are made of candy and butterflies whistle sweet music on Summer afternoons , get this unfair claim withdrawn .
My friends and I do n’t blame the band .
We doubt very much that they , or indeed anyone from their immediate label , contacted Youtube after being shocked and appalled by our ‘ misuse ’ of their copyright .
Likely an automated piece of software , somewhere in the bowels of a Universal subsidiary , scanned the video ’s audio track , and spat out a legal notice .
What bothers us are a ) the unfairness of the situation – the idea that we ca n’t share something we created because an element of it is ‘ owned ’ by a megacorporation , and b ) the precedent that cases like this set .
All creative work ( important and monumental , or just plain silly and fun ) is built upon the groundwork of existing culture – whether it be the brothers Grim appropriating European mythology , or Led Zeppelin integrating blues riffs into rock and roll music .
As the range of instruments we use become virtualised – from the game engines used in Machinima , to level design tools like those of Little Big Planet – they fall under the ownership of vast faceless corporations , and the legal purview of laws written and paid for my US media conglomerates .
This can leave creators , remixers and contributors powerless in the face of legal sanctions .
My friends and I helped ( in however small a way ) to create something , which was then used as a promotional tool .
It ’s only fair that we get to remix and share our efforts in return .

No , not building this to sell .
You would n't want to sell this if you had one , believe me .
It 's a once in a lifetime project .
I did this alone , no help .
I have found with other things in the past that if you have help , the help often does not get it ( parts ) right , and you have to do it over 95 % of the time , plus I like to work alone .
All parts are scratch built , cept ' tires , rims , brakes , engine , etc .. meaning all bodyparts , brackets , just about everything external on the car .

For now I manually activate the scanning service when I 'm on my way home .
Right before I get on my motorcycle I turn it on .
Then in ~ 3 - 5 minutes I 'm home and it opens .
In the future I 'll make it automatically adapt its scanning rate based on circumstances .
( e.g. if it 's 4 - 7 p m and it previously saw the google shuttle 's wifi , then it lost it , it can assume I just got off the shuttle and am on my way home and start garage door scanning at a much faster rate .....)

This is very awesome , what you have done here .
My idea would be to have speakers running through out my entire house and depending what rooms I am moving between the music / audio playing over the speakers follows me .
It never plays in a room I am not and even fades from room to room so that I never hear any strange disturbances with speakers going on and off .
Possibly than the phone can also be the volume control , or mute ( fade to low lvl ) the speakers when I receive a call or am in a specific room .
That would be sweet !

The United States and India have signed a civilian nuclear co-operation accord to end 34 years of US sanctions .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee signed the deal in Washington after years of negotiations .
India will gain access to US civilian nuclear technology and fuel in return for inspections of its civilian , but not military , nuclear facilities .
Critics say the deal sets a potentially dangerous precedent .
They say it effectively allows India to expand its nuclear power industry without requiring it to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) as other nations must .
The US restricted nuclear co-operation with India after it tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
' Doubts silenced '
" We look forward to working with the US companies on the commercial [ steps ] that will follow to implement this landmark agreement , " Mr Mukherjee said just before signing .
NUCLEAR POWER IN INDIA India has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction Nuclear power supplies about 3 % of India 's electricity By 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity India has limited coal and uranium reserves
Its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long - term Source : Uranium Information Center
A win-win situation for India Indian firms eye nuclear business Ms Rice said : " Many thought this day would never come , but doubts have been silenced . "
US President George W Bush signed the accord into law earlier this week , after it had finally been approved by the US Congress .
The deal was first agreed three years ago and is regarded as a key foreign policy priority for both the Indian and US governments .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh said earlier that the deal would help India to liberate itself from " the constraints of technology denial of 34 years " .
Although India has said it retains the right to conduct nuclear tests , the US has said the deal will be cancelled in such an eventuality .
The Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) recently lifted a ban that had denied India access to the international nuclear market .
India and France have also signed a major co-operation pact which paves the way for the sale of French nuclear reactors to Delhi .
France is the world 's second largest producer of nuclear energy after the United States .
Russia has also been lobbying the Indian government hard on behalf of its firms .

WINNIPEG , Manitoba , Oct. 7 ( UPI ) -- A Canadian man alleges he was asleep when a woman had sex with him and became pregnant .
The man , from Tyndall , northwest of Winnipeg , is suing the Selkirk woman for mental distress and anxiety caused by the fact that he may be forced to pay child support under Canadian law , The Winnipeg Free Press reported Tuesday .

In a lawsuit filed in Manitoba Court of Queen 's Bench , the man said he was visiting the woman in October or November 2006 when he woke up to find the woman having sex with him .
The man claims the woman stopped when he " demanded that she cease and desist , " but about nine months later gave birth to his child .
Sarah Palin walks across the tarmac in a tailored black suit to meet John McCain after arriving in Allentown , Pa. , on Oct.
8 . RNC shells out $ 150 K for Palin fashion
The Republican National Committee has spent more than $ 150,000 to clothe and accessorize vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and her family since her surprise pick by John McCain in late August .
According to financial disclosure records , the accessorizing began in early September and included bills from Saks Fifth Avenue in St. Louis and New York for a combined $ 49,425.74 .
Advertisement
The records also document a couple of big - time shopping trips to Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis , including one $ 75,062.63 spree in early September .
The RNC also spent $ 4,716.49 on hair and makeup through September after reporting no such costs in August .
The cash expenditures immediately raised questions among campaign finance experts about their legality under the Federal Election Commission 's long - standing advisory opinions on using campaign cash to purchase items for personal use .
Politico asked the McCain campaign for comment on Monday , explicitly noting the $ 150,000 in expenses for department store shopping and makeup consultation that were incurred immediately after Palin ’s announcement .
Pre -September reports do not include similar costs .
Slideshow Palin Fashion
Spokeswoman Maria Comella declined to answer specific questions about the expenditures , including whether it was necessary to spend that much and whether it amounted to one early investment in Palin or if shopping for the vice presidential nominee was ongoing .
“ The campaign does not comment on strategic decisions regarding how financial resources available to the campaign are spent , " she said .
But hours after the story was posted on Politico 's website and legal issues were raised , the campaign issued a new statement .
" With all of the important issues facing the country right now , it ’s remarkable that we ’re spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses , " said spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt .
" It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign . "
The business of primping and dressing on the campaign trail has become fraught with political risk in recent years as voters increasingly see an elite Washington out of touch with their values and lifestyles .
In 2000 , Democrat Al Gore took heat for changing his clothing hues .
And in 2006 , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) was ribbed for two hair styling sessions that cost about $ 3,000 .
Then , there was Democrat John Edwards ’ $ 400 hair cuts in 2007 and Republican McCain ’s $ 520 black leather Ferragamo shoes this year .
A review of similar records for the campaign of Democrat Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee turned up no similar spending .
But all the spending by other candidates pales in comparison to the GOP outlay for the Alaska governor whose expensive , designer outfits have been the topic of fashion pages and magazines .
What has n’t been apparent is where the clothes came from – her closet back in Wasilla or from the campaign coffers in Washington .
The answer can be found inside the RNC ’s September monthly financial disclosure report under “ itemized coordinated expenditures . ”
It ’s a report that typically records expenses for direct mail , telephone calls and advertising .
Those expenses do show up , but the report also has a new category of spending : “ campaign accessories . ”
September payments were also made to Barney ’s New York ( $ 789.72 ) and Bloomingdale ’s New York ( $ 5,102.71 ) .
Macy ’s in Minneapolis , another store fortunate enough to be situated in the Twin Cities that hosted last summer ’s Republican National Convention , received three separate payments totaling $ 9,447.71 .
The entries also show two purchases at Pacifier , a top - notch baby store , suggesting $ 196 was spent to accommodate the littlest Palin to join the campaign trail .
An additional $ 4,902.45 was spent in early September at Atelier , a high - class shopping destination for men .
Editors ' note :
In earlier versions , a purchase at Steinlauf & Stoller was inaccurately described as a baby item .

YouTube has rejected John McCain 's request for special treatment when his campaign videos are hit with DMCA takedown notices .
Earlier this week , the McCain campaign fired a letter at the Google - owned video sharing site , urging it to " commit to a full legal review of all takedown notices on videos posted from accounts controlled by ... political candidates and campaigns . "
But YouTube general counsel Zahavah Levine did n't bite .
Yesterday , Levine replied with a letter of her own , telling the McCain campaign that her site does n't play favorites .
" We try to be careful not to favor one category of content on our site over others , and to treat all our users fairly , regardless of whether they are an individual , a large corporation , or a candidate for public office , " she writes .
In an effort to comply with the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , YouTube removes videos when it receives notices from content owners complaining of copyright infringement .
YouTube users can file counternotices , arguing for reinstatement of their videos .
But in accordance with the DMCA , the site does n't consider counterclaims for 10 to 14 days after they 're received .
John McCain was among those who voted in favor of the DMCA , which provides safe harbor for sites like GooTube .
But his campaign 's general counsel , Trevor Potter , insists that the video site 's DMCA takedown policy is " silencing political speech " by removing non-infringing political videos .
" Numerous times during the course of the campaign , our advertisements or web videos have been the subject of DMCA takedown notices regarding uses that are clearly privileged under the fair use doctrine , " Potter writes in his letter to YouTube .
" Despite the complete lack of merit in these copyright claims , YouTube has removed our videos immediately upon receipt of takedown notices ...
It is unfortunate because it deprives the public of the ability to freely and easily view and discuss the most popular political videos of the day . "
Potter argues that YouTube should review takedown notices on political vids before they 're removed from the site - rather than waiting those 10 to 14 days .
" 10 days can be a lifetime in a political campaign , and there is no justification for depriving the American people of access to important and timely campaign videos during that period . "
With her response , Levine says that YouTube responds to all takedown notices immediately because reviewing each and every claim is n't feasible .
" A detailed substantive review of every DMCA notice is simply not possible due to the scale of YouTube 's operations , " she says .
" More importantly , YouTube does not possess the requisite information about the content in user uploaded videos to make a determination as to whether a particular takedown notice includes a valid claim of infringement . "
Without counternotices , she argues , YouTube is n't in a position to judge the notices .
Regardless , the site refuses to dole out special treatment .
" While we agree ... that the US Presidential election - related content is invaluable and worthy of the highest level of protection , there is a lot of other content on our global site that our users around the world find to be equally important . "
The real problem , Levine says , is all those people who are abusing the DMCA by bombarding YouTube with invalid takedown notices .
Like other video posters , she explains , the McCain campaign can seek retractions of " abusive takedown notices " and even file suit against copyright holders who overstep their bounds .
What 's more , YouTube would like Senator McCain to beef up the old fair use doctrine , " so that intermediaries like us can rely on this important doctrine with a measure of business certainty " .
In short , YouTube believes that it's the victim here .
Not John McCain . ®
Three teenage girls have been buried alive by their tribe in a remote part of Pakistan to punish them for attempting to choose their own husbands , in an " honour " killing case .
After news of the deaths emerged , male politicians from their province , Baluchistan , defended the killings in parliament , claiming the practice was part of " our tribal custom " .
The girls , thought to have been aged between 16 and 18 , were kidnapped by a group of men from their Umrani tribe .
They were driven to a rural area and then injured by being shot .
Then , while still alive , they were dragged bleeding to a pit , where they were covered with earth and stones , according to the findings of Human Rights Watch , the international campaigning group .
Officials , speaking off the record , confirmed the killings .
However , six weeks after the deaths , no one has been arrested , amid claims of a cover -up .
According to several accounts , Baluchistan government vehicles were used to abduct the girls , and the killing was overseen by a tribal chief who is the brother of a provincial minister from the ruling Pakistan People 's party .
Some reports said that two older relatives of the girls had tried to intervene , but they too were shot and buried with the girls while still alive .
" This is a heinous criminal offence , " said Ali Dayan Hasan , of Human Rights Watch .
" We have corroborated it and cross - corroborated it , but the second the police admit that it happened , it would trigger an investigation . "
Hasan said that , with a presidential election on September 6 , one in which Baluchistan 's provincial parliament would be strongly relied on to deliver votes , action that would antagonise the region 's politicians was highly unlikely .
In Pakistan 's national parliament , an MP from Baluchistan , Israrullah Zehri , said on Friday that " this action was carried out according to tribal traditions " , a view backed up by some other male lawmakers , who attacked a woman senator who had raised the case .
" These are centuries - old traditions and I will continue to defend them , " Zehri added over the weekend .
The killings happened in the Naseerabad district of Baluchistan .
Although so - called honour killings are not unusual , burying the victims alive seems to have been brutal even by tribal standards .
" It is very common for women in these cases to be deprived of an honourable burial .
This is to make sure others learn the lesson , " said Samar Minallah , a human rights activist based in Islamabad .
Sarang Mastoi , a local journalist in Baluchistan with Pakistan channel KTN , said that the villagers were scared to talk openly about the crime , but he had been taken by some to see the burial site .
Under tribal - not religious - tradition , marriages are carefully arranged by elders .
Marrying without permission is considered an affront to the honour of the tribe .
Sadiq Umrani , a provincial minister , has admitted that the girls were buried alive but denied the involvement of his brother .
An editorial , published in Pakistani daily The News yesterday , said : " Surely the government should be seeking the murderers , not protect [ them ] through some dark conspiracy of silence .
The fact the act was ' kept quiet ' means the government sympathises with such doings . "
AUGUSTA , Ga. - A powerful antioxidant in green tea may prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes , Medical College of Georgia researchers say .
Researchers were testing EGCG , green tea's predominant antioxidant , in a laboratory mouse with type 1 diabetes and primary Sjogren 's syndrome , which damages moisture - producing glands , causing dry mouth and eyes .
" Our study focused on Sjogren 's syndrome , so learning that EGCG also can prevent and delay insulin - dependent type 1 diabetes was a big surprise , " says Dr. Stephen Hsu , molecular / cell biologist in the School of Dentistry .
They found it also worked well in their original disease focus .
In the mouse , EGCG reduced the severity and delayed onset of salivary gland damage associated with Sjogren 's syndrome , which has no known cure .
" EGCG modulates several important genes , so it suppresses the abnormality at the molecular level in the salivary gland .
It also significantly lowered the serum autoantibodies , reducing the severity of Sjogren 's syndrome - like symptoms , " Dr. Hsu says .
Autoantibodies are antibodies the body makes against itself .
Both type 1 diabetes and Sjogren 's syndrome are autoimmune diseases , which cause the body to attack itself .
Autoimmune disorders are the third most common group of diseases in the United States and affect about 8 percent of the population , says Dr. Hsu .
Sjogren 's syndrome can occur alone or secondary to another autoimmune disease , such as lupus , rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes .
The study , published in the Oct. 24 issue of Life Sciences , supports earlier research showing EGCG 's impact on helping prevent autoimmune disease .
Researchers treated a control group of mice with water and a test group with a purified form of EGCG dissolved in the drinking water .
At 16 weeks , the EGCG - fed mice were 6.1 times more likely to be diabetes - free than the water - fed group , and 4.2 times more likely at 22 weeks .
" Previous studies used another animal model that developed type 1 diabetes only after an injected chemical killed the insulin - producing cells .
That may not accurately resemble disease development in humans , because type 1 diabetes is a genetic disease , " says Dr. Hsu , the study 's corresponding author .
" Our study is significant because we used a mouse model with the genetic defects that cause symptoms similar to human type 1 diabetes and Sjogren 's syndrome , so the immune cells attack the pancreas and salivary glands until they are no longer functional . "
Another related finding was that even when salivary cells were under attack , they seemed to be rapidly reproducing in the control group .
The proliferation was suppressed in the EGCG - fed group .
" It 's kind of counterintuitive - why would there be proliferation of the glandular cells occurring when the present cells are not secreting saliva ? " says Dr. Kevin Gillespie , first author of the study he conducted for his master 's research project at MCG .
The proliferation phenomenon also can be observed in psoriasis , an autoimmune disease affecting the skin and joints , says Dr. Hsu .
" Normal skin cells turn over every 30 days or so , but skin cells with psoriasis turn over every two or three days . "
Dr. Hsu 's group previously found that green tea polyphenols , including EGCG , inhibited rapid proliferation in an animal model for human psoriasis .
" We never thought proliferation was going on to this extent in the salivary gland , but we now believe it is tightly associated with Sjogren 's syndrome , " he says .
The next step is to observe Sjogren 's syndrome in human salivary gland samples to determine whether the study findings hold up in humans .
" If the abnormal expression of these genes is the same in humans as in the animal model , then the second stage will be intervention and treatment with a pure form of EGCG , " says Dr. Hsu .
" The benefit of using green tea in preventing or slowing these autoimmune diseases is that it 's natural and not known to harm the body , " says Dr. Gillespie , periodontics chief resident at Fort Gordon 's Tingay Dental Clinic .
" EGCG does n't have the negative side - effects that can be associated with steroids or other medications that could otherwise be prescribed . "

The pledges by Germany , Britain , France , the Netherlands Spain , Portugal and Austria total 1.7 trillion euros ( $ 2.3 trillion ) .
About 250 billion euros ( $ 341 billion ) of the European pledges was earmarked to be spent on recapitalizing banks by buying stakes .
The coordinated announcements were aimed at restoring confidence a banking system that has continued to bleed despite assurances the last 10 days from leaders in separate capitals that they would n't let their banks go under .
" The time of everyone acting alone is over , " French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who heads the rotating presidency of the European Union , said in Paris .
Monday 's announcements demonstrated European governments are starting to take the right steps to stave off a meltdown , says Alistair Milne , associate professor of finance at the Cass Business School at City University London .
" Shoring up the banking system with substantial public funds is absolutely necessary , " says Milne , who studies financial systems and advises the Bank of England .
As part of making taxpayer money available to bail the banks out , European governments are requiring they lend to companies and mortgage holders .
But Milne questions whether banks will be stingy after making five years of bad loans that led to the current crisis .
" Will they lend ?
I 'm not so sure , " he says .
" United Europe has pledged more than the U.S. , " Sarkozy said during a press conference after an emergency cabinet meeting .
And Europe 's response does dwarf the Bush administration 's $ 700 billion rescue program .
Milne questions whether the U.S. government needed to do more to shore up U.S. banks .
The $ 700 billion U.S. plan to absorb banks ' bad assets represents less taxpayer money that European governments are making available to ease the crisis .
" ( That ) may just not be enough , " Milne says .
" For the size of its banks , Britain has made available six or seven times as much . "
European markets responded positively .
Bank shares , which had been badly battered in downward trading last week , led the rise on major exchanges .
At the close , Germany 's DAX was 518.14 points , or 11.4 % , higher at 5,062.45 , while France 's CAC - 40 was up 355.01 points , or 11.2 % , at 3,531.50 .
Britain's FTSE 100 was 324.84 points , or 8.3 % , higher at 4,256.90 , despite some hefty falls in the banks that have accepted government help .
Earlier in the day , Britain announced that three of the country 's biggest banks would take up to $ 63 billion from the government to improve their balance sheets .
The British government last week made $ 87 billion in direct aid available to banks along with additional guarantees .
The British plan served as a blueprint for what the other governments unveiled , including : • In Berlin , German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced her cabinet had approved $ 136.5 million in direct taxpayer aid if banks needed it , along with $ 546 billion in guarantees .
• Sarkozy said the French government would set up two funds , one to provide $ 54.6 billion in state funding to capitalize needy banks by buying shares and $ 437 billion in another to provide guarantees .
•
In Italy , which has the fourth biggest European economy behind Germany , Britain and France , the government said it would make more than $ 27 billion available .
• Austria 's government said it is prepared to offer up to 85 billion euros ( $ 114 billion ) to banks in guarantees , if they need it to survive the global financial crisis .
Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer said his government is also ready to provide an additional 15 billion euros ( $ 20 billion ) in capital .
Last week , Austria also decided to guarantee bank deposits up to their full value .
•
The Netherlands put up 200 billion euros ( $ 273 billion ) to guarantee interbank loans .
• Portugal guaranteed 20 billion euros ( $ 27 billion ) — nearly 12 % of annual GDP — to encourage Portuguese banks to lend to each other .
Meanwhile , Spain has said it would make similar guarantees .
And Sweden , which is n't part of the eurozone , said it would introduce legislation to safeguard banks , but without injecting capital into them .
Also helping markets was a joint move by the U.S. Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to provide unlimited short - term credit in U.S. dollars to financial institutions .
The Bank of Japan said it is considering similar measures .
The coordinated action by the big economies comes amid the worst banking crisis since the 1930s Great Depression .
Global credit markets have been frozen the last four weeks after the collapse of U.S. financial house Lehman Brothers .
Even previously healthy banks have teetered without money to cover their debts and have witnessed their share value shrink as equity investors bailed on them last week in historically massive sell - offs .
At a morning news conference here , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the unprecedented move by his and other European governments as necessary to restore confidence in what is a global crisis .
" The government cannot just leave people on their own to be buffeted about , " Brown said of putting British taxpayers money into its banks .
" We must , in an uncertain and unstable world , be the rock of stability upon which people can depend . "
Under the government - banks agreement announced here : • Royal Bank of Scotland Group would take $ 34 billion in aid .
The government is to buy $ 8.6 billion in preferred bank shares and underwrite $ 25.7 billion of ordinary shares .
• HBOS and Lloyds TSB Group are to take $ 29.2 billion .
Lloyds is the process of taking over HBOS , Britain 's second - biggest mortgage lender .
But the merger has been slowed amid the banking chaos and steep declined in the two banks ' shares .
•
Barclays announced it would boost the capital on its sheets — but without the government 's help .
This could give taxpayers up to a 60 % stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland and 40 % in a merged Lloyds - HBOS bank , the BBC reported .
British Chancellor Alistair Darling said that under the deal , the government would pocket the shares until the crisis ends and banks have returned to health .
The government , he said , had no interest in being in the banking business long term .
In return for the aid , some bank executives will step down , others will forgo bonuses and lending to companies and mortgage holders will return to levels seen last year before the current financial crisis .
Merkel and Sarkozy said similar lending guarantees and caps on bank executive pay were part of their governments ' requirements for providing bailouts .

Hedge funds learn to revere volatility , correlation and the “ option value of cash ”
Some of the world ’s largest pensions , endowments and hedge funds met in Boston today to discuss the future of the “ absolute return ” industry .
Joining them were leading academics such as Stanford ’s Myron Scholes and Wharton ’s Sandy Grossman , hedge fund managers such as Michael Huttman , the Chairman of Millennium Global Asset Management , one of the world ’s largest currency hedge funds and the heads of European and US public pensions and university endowments .
This , just as the FT reported on the historical challenges facing these investors :
“ Public pension funds in US states are facing their worst year of losses in history , exacerbating existing funding shortfalls and putting pressure on government to shore them up . ”
Jokes abounded today about how the asset figures printed in the 2 - month - old program now needed to be adjusted downward by 20 % ( or much more for funds denominated in Canadian and Australian dollars ) .
But despite not having received “ absolute ” returns from their hedge fund managers this year , the pensions and endowments here were actually very sanguine about the future of alternative investments .
Although the day involved panel discussions on topics ranging from the “ endowprise ” ( an emerging form of endowment management ) to the future of the funds - of - funds industry , a number of common themes arose …
Correlations Going to One
It seems that traditionally low correlations between hedge fund strategies has taken a brief sabbatical in 2008 .
Many speakers pointed to the non-linear aspect of the correlations between different hedge funds strategies .
One panelist expressed his surprise ( and moderate frustration ) that the funds - of - funds in his portfolio seemed to have synchronized in the past quarter .
Liquidity Mismatch
The topic of hedge fund liquidity was also never far from the surface of the discussions .
Hedge funds have been accused by some of instigating the recent market sell - off by providing a level of liquidity to their investors that far exceeded the liquidity of their underlying portfolios .
Some funds - of - funds admitted today that they had undertaken what might be described as “ pre-emptive redemptions ” ( liquidating their underlying hedge fund positions “ just in case . ” )
This raised the question of whether large investors should actually be conducting due diligence , not just on the hedge fund in question , but on the other investors in it in order to gauge their propensity to liquidate their position .
Mark to Market Accounting
Some panelists complained that the requirement to liquidate a hedge fund or an underlying position was often precipitated by the falling market value of the position or overall portfolio .
As a result , they said , a well - intentioned accounting rule may have inadvertantly sparked a liquidity - driven death spiral .
They argued that some modified version of market to market is now required .
Redemption Gates
No discussion of hedge fund liquidity was complete without addressing redemption gates ( see related article in today ’s Times , and another on eFinancial news ) .
Contrary to popular perception , this crowd was clearly not scared of locking in their capital as long as they knew such lock - ups would yield an appropriate illiquidity premium .
“ M& M ” Turns 50
Yes , for those finance students out there , the famous “ Modigliani & Miller Theorem ” was evoked several times in a discussion between Myron Scholes and Sandy Grossman .
The Theorem ( which is exactly 50 years old this year ) states that in the absence of a several complicating factors , the value of the firm is not dependent on its capital structure .
This begged the question : why then were financial services firms so enamored with debt , and not equity , over the past decade ?
Furthermore , as one audience member mused , why had the marginal cost of debt financing not risen for firms that were gradually piling on the leverage ( as the “ M& M Theorem ” would posit ) ?
The Option Value of Cash
Several panelists and speakers argued that cash has been undervalued since it represented the option to invest or not to invest .
When the market was steadily rising , this option seemed kind of useless .
Now , anyone lucky enough to have been in cash earlier in 2008 is creaming their fully - invested peers and has enough dry powder to pull the trigger on new investments as opportunities arise .
Scholes , for one , referred to this as the “ option value of flexibility ” and compared it to a car that is traveling slower than the surrounding traffic , and therefore still had the “ option ” of hitting the gas if and when required .
The Future of Funds of Funds
A panel on “ top - down ” vs. “ bottom - up ” construction of hedge fund portfolios raised the question of whether funds - of - funds could be replicated ( or at least approximated ) with so - called “ hedge fund betas ” .
The importance of strategy / geography focus , and the need to go beyond the “ traditional value proposition ” of funds - of - funds ( i.e. education , diversification , and access to the best managers ) were highlighted as critical success factors by several panelists .
Recommended Reading
That ’s all from our reporter ’s notebook on Day One of the off - the - record “ unnamed hedge fund conference ” in Boston .
Before we sign off , we wanted to quickly draw your attention to an article in this week ’s Economist that should be required reading for anyone who wants to cut through the mass media hype about hedge funds , hedge fund leverage , and hedge fund performance .
It contains a dispassionate analysis that highlights the challenges faced by the industry without assigning blame for those problems .
Many of the themes raised in this piece weaved their way through the debate here in Boston today .
The Incredible Shrinking Funds …
Excerpts …
“ … What is the cause of the fire sales that seem to be at the root of the industry ’s problems ?
The obvious answer is a withdrawal of credit …
Yet the role leverage has played in bringing the industry to its knees is subtler than this … ”
“ … Sweeping generalisations about the degree of leverage among hedge funds are misleading … According to one prime broker ’s estimate , the industry as a whole has a ratio of assets to equity of about 1.3 , against 1.8 a year ago .
The assets themselves often contain further embedded leverage , through , for example , derivatives .
A study by McKinsey , a consultancy , suggests that this might take the industry ’s leverage today to two or three times equity . ”
“ … Even if institutions want to buy and hold their positions , some are being forced to raise cash .
One hedge - fund manager says that pension funds have onerous commitments to private equity , which they are meeting by selling out of hedge funds .
And there is a widespread feeling that money originated through funds - of - hedge - funds is liable to get jumpy at any hint of trouble and skedaddle if losses are made . ’
Daily Show : Bush ' wo n't be satisifed until American children are eating roadkill ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The Bush administration 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout of troubled investment firms got the Daily Show treatment on Tuesday , and Jon Stewart was particularly incensed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's coy reluctance to accept the taxpayers ' money unless his decisions on how to spend it are made " non-reviewable . "
" Before we hand this Munster - esque unelected official 700 billion no -strings - attached dollars , " Stewart remarked , " there is one thing you should know -- this financial guru never saw it coming . "
" I 've got great confidence in our financial market , " Paulson stated last March .
" Our markets are resilient , are flexible .
Our institutions , our banks and investment banks , are strong . "
President Bush also came in for his share of ridicule .
" It turns out there are a lot of interlinks throughout the financial system , " an apparently astonished Bush recently explained , illustrating the point with appropriate hand gestures .
" Then AIG came along and the house of cards was much bigger .
...
And so when one card started to go , we worried about the whole deck going down . "
Stewart turned next to Daily Show analyst John Oliver , saying , " After Katrina , after Iraq ... I did n't think there was another area that these guys could screw up . "
" It was n't easy , " Oliver replied .
" It was like finding a vein on a failure junkie . "
" Is this economic crisis , then , sort of the turd icing on this administration 's shitcake ? "
Stewart wondered .
" Do n't count them out , Jon , " Oliver cautioned .
" It 's a long way to January . "
" You think there 's more out there ? "
Stewart asked .
" What 's left for them to -- decomplish , if you will . "
" Do you still have a home ? "
Oliver asked .
" Did your children have breakfast this morning ? ...
Was it something they found in the street ? "
" You 're saying the president here wo n't be satisfied until American children are eating roadkill ? " suggested Stewart .
" Until they 're fighting over roadkill , " Oliver emphasized .
" Until roadkill is the prize for the strongest . "
When Stewart asked why Bush would possibly want this , Oliver explained that it was a matter of " legacy .
...
We all know he 'll never be ranked as the best president .
But he could still , if he works hard enough ... "
" Be the worst ? "
" The last . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street had its worst day since the 1987 stock market crash on Wednesday , as bleak economic data fed worries that all the efforts to unlock credit markets may not stave off a severe recession .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke added to those concerns when he said the economy faced a “ significant threat ” from paralyzed credit markets .
Dismal monthly U.S. retail sales set the tone for the session , dropping the most in more than three years , while a measure of New York state manufacturing hit its lowest level since the index started in 2001 .
The Nasdaq has now wiped out all of its gains from Monday ’s 11 percent rally , while the benchmark S&P 500 is up only about 1 percent from Friday ’s close .
Wednesday ’s data intensified recession fears , as did the Federal Reserve ’s Beige Book report , which showed economic activity weakened across the United States in September as businesses revised capital investments and consumers curtailed spending .
Shares of companies considered economic bellwethers , such as industrial conglomerate Caterpillar Inc , fell sharply .
Caterpillar ’s shares slid over 11 percent .
Fears of recession knocked commodities lower , with Exxon Mobil tumbling 14 percent as the price of oil fell .
“ Retail sales spooked investors this morning and has increased the near - term risk of a broad - based recession , ” said Tom Sowanick , chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial LLC in Princeton , New Jersey .
The Dow and the benchmark S&P 500 suffered their worst one - day percentage drops since 1987 .

LATE SLIDE FOR eBAY
The negative news continued after the closing bell , with online auctioneer eBay Inc warning that its full - year revenues would fall below its previous forecast .
Shares of eBay dropped about 4 percent after the closing bell .
During the regular session , shares of retailers skidded , with Wal - Mart falling 8.1 percent to $ 50.05 and Home Depot dropping 5.9 percent to $ 19.83 .
Analysts said the weak retail sales data underscored the severity of the squeeze on consumers faced with sliding home values , a tumbling stock market and tight credit .

Other commodity - related companies were also slammed as materials tumbled .
Miner Freeport McMoran slid 19 percent to $ 33.17 .
FOR BANKS , NO QUICK FIX
Financial shares fell after Meredith Whitney , an influential bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Co , said government ’s plan to stabilize key U.S. banks by injecting $ 250 billion is not a “ panacea solution . ”
The S&P ’s financial sub -index dropped 9.1 percent .
Shares of State Street Corp , one of the world ’s biggest institutional asset managers , plummeted 17.4 percent to $ 46.83 .

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - Global leaders are considering a new world financial order in the wake of the financial crisis which is threatening to tip the global economy into recession .
European Union leaders meet on Friday in Brussels and Group of 20 central bankers and finance ministers gather in Sao Paulo at the weekend ahead of a G20 leaders ’ summit in Washington on November 15 .
The meetings aim to thrash out potential changes to the global financial architecture set out in 1944 at the Bretton Woods conference , which established the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and laid the foundations for the dollar to become the cornerstone of world currency exchange .
The Washington summit will be the first in a series of such meetings to apply lessons learnt from the worst financial market turmoil since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Below are possible features of the new financial system .
FIRMER FINANCIAL REGULATION
- EU finance ministers have backed principles for a root - and - branch revamp of how the world ’s capital market is governed and how banks and credit rating agencies are run .
- The EU says supervisory colleges should be rapidly established for all significant cross - border firms ; risk control mechanisms in financial institutions should be improved ; a code of conduct should be drawn up to tackle excessive risk - taking , and accounting and prudential standards should be more consistent .
“ We have in mind ... the fact that we should not over - regulate , not overshoot , but clearly we also want to make sure that we do not leave loopholes or dark holes in the regulations where either products , players or territory would be left completely without such regulation , ” French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said .
LESSER ROLE FOR U.S. DOLLAR
- The U.S. dollar has been the linchpin of the world financial system since 1944 , when the Bretton Woods conference agreed on a pegged exchange rate system with the dollar as the effective reserve currency .
- Although this collapsed in 1971 , when the dollar stopped being convertible into gold and gave way to the current model of freely floating currencies , the dollar has remained the favored international currency , although the euro runs a close second .
- Countries including Italy are keen to broaden the base .
“ Today the dollar is the currency of Bretton Woods , but now it could be that there will be other combinations .
The debate on foreign exchange is being reopened , ” Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti said on October 15 .
STRONGER ROLE FOR INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said the key role in supervision should go to the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum ( FSF ) , which have no binding powers of enforcement .
He has called on Saudi Arabia , China and other relatively wealthy countries to help raise hundreds of billions of dollars to boost the IMF ’s resources .
- Europe favors an expansion of the FSF , a body consisting of regulators , central bankers and finance ministry officials from the G7 and other major economies , as well as international financial institutions and supervisory groupings , headed by Italian central bank Governor Mario Draghi .
GREATER DEPENDENCE ON TAXPAYERS ’ FUNDS
- Authorities are trying to soften the impact of the economic downturn with support for banks , cheaper lending and stimulus measures , which have already amounted to around $ 4 trillion and will push up budget deficits around the world .
- Germany ’s cabinet agreed a package of measures on Wednesday to give Europe ’s biggest economy a 50 billion euro ( $ 64.2 billion ) boost and protect about 1 million jobs , following a 500 billion euro bank rescue package last month .
- Societe Generale economist James Nixon said policymakers were turning more to old - fashioned models such as direct fiscal stimulus to find a solution to the financial crisis .
“ We are back into an environment where you have to look at more Keynesian - style solutions which have been out of fashion for 30 or 40 years , ” he said .
Keynesianism is based on the theories of UK economist John Maynard Keynes and includes a belief in active government and the benefits of public spending to boost growth .
EMERGING ECONOMIES TO HAVE BIGGER SAY
- The World Bank and the IMF are dominated by G8 members -- the United States , Russia , Japan , Canada , Britain , France , Germany and Italy -- even though a country such as China now has a bigger economy than many of them .
- Reformers say it is essential for developing countries to take a bigger role in the global system , including the IMF .
- The World Bank is calling for an expansion of the club of the world ’s richest nations -- the Group of Eight -- to include rapidly expanding economies of China , India , Brazil , Mexico , Saudi Arabia and South Africa , which together would represent 62 percent of global gross domestic product .
- “ Any new architecture that comes out of the Washington meeting , we need to have proper representatives including emerging countries on the one hand and of course Europe on the other , ” EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said .
- Gulf Arab states have also called for a bigger role in setting global economic policy and the EU backs a bigger role for emerging economies such as India and China at the IMF and the G8 .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Housing and credit market turmoil drove Citigroup Inc to its fourth straight quarterly loss and $ 13 billion of write - downs and credit losses , but the giant U.S. bank still wants to acquire deposits after its bid to acquire much of Wachovia Corp failed .
Citigroup , until this quarter the nation ’s the largest by assets , is in a difficult spot because it is experiencing rising losses from traditional lending operations , such as U.S. credit cards , even as losses continue from repackaged mortgage debt and other securities on its balance sheet .
On top of this , emerging markets , a key engine of Citigroup ’s growth , are becoming much less profitable and in some countries are big money losers .
Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said in an interview that losses are entering a new phase , moving away from securities writedowns , which can make earnings volatile , and toward consumer losses , which tend to rise more gradually .
“ That ’s an important shift , ” Crittenden said , adding that “ we would have interest in looking at businesses like ” Wachovia , where the bank could add U.S. deposits without substantial downside risk .
Citigroup investors are looking for signs of stability after the bank posted losses of $ 20.3 billion in the last year and more than $ 71 billion worth of writedowns and credit losses over five quarters .
The bank ’s effort to buy Wachovia ’s retail and investment banking businesses for $ 2.16 billion cheered some analysts , who had long pressed the bank to boost its U.S. deposit base , which can provide stable funding .
Wells Fargo &
Co beat out Citigroup with a $ 15.1 billion bid for all of Wachovia .
“ We are in an environment where more deposits is better than less , ” said Michael Holland , who oversees more than $ 4 billion at Holland & Co and does not own Citigroup stock .
JPMORGAN PASSES CITIGROUP IN ASSETS
Citigroup ’s third - quarter net loss totaled $ 2.82 billion , or 60 cents per share , compared with a profit of $ 2.21 billion , or 44 cents , a year earlier .
Its loss from continuing operations was $ 3.42 billion , or 71 cents per share , compared with analysts ’ average estimates of a 70 cent a share loss .
Revenue fell 23 percent to $ 16.68 billion .
Expenses totaled $ 14.43 billion , up 2 percent from a year earlier , but down 8 percent from the second quarter .
Citigroup shed $ 50 billion in assets during the third quarter , ceding its title as the largest U.S. bank by assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Vikram Pandit is looking to shed $ 400 billion of assets to strengthen the bank ’s balance sheet .
JPMorgan ended September with $ 2.25 trillion in assets , compared with $ 2.05 trillion at Citigroup .
Bank of America Corp would pass both if it completes its planned acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co Inc in early 2009 .

Citigroup also cut 11,000 jobs during the quarter , leaving it with 352,000 employees .
The bank ’s shares fell 33 cents , or 2 percent , to close at $ 15.90 on the New York Stock Exchange and are down 46 percent this year .
The KBW Bank Index rose 2.6 percent on Thursday and broad U.S. market indexes rose more than 4 percent .
CONSUMER CREDIT DETERIORATES
Quarterly results reflected $ 4.42 billion of net writedowns tied to mortgage debt , leveraged loans and other investments , and a $ 612 million charge for a regulatory settlement related to auction - rate securities .
Citigroup also reported an 86 percent increase in credit costs to $ 9.1 billion , including $ 4.92 billion in net credit losses and a $ 3.9 billion increase in loan loss reserves .
On a conference call , Crittenden said there was broad deterioration in consumer credit worldwide , with particular stress in Brazil , India and Mexico .
The bank operates in more than 100 countries .
Credit losses have spurred Citigroup to raise more than $ 40 billion in capital from investors .
The bank is also receiving $ 25 billion from the U.S. Treasury Department ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , one of nine banks to receive initial injections .
“ Being handed $ 25 billion means they do n’t have to come to the market and I think that ’s huge , ” said Anton Schutz , president of Mendon Capital Advisors Corp in Rochester , New York , which owns Citigroup shares .
Citigroup ’s Tier - 1 capital ratio , a measure of its ability to cover losses , was 8.2 percent as of September 30 , compared with 8.74 percent three months earlier and 7.12 percent at the end of 2007 .
Regulators consider 6 percent sufficient .
In the interview , Crittenden said the bank has no compelling need to raise more capital now .
He offered few details on how the bank will use the new capital , but said Citigroup wants to expand in retail banking , credit cards , investment banking and trading , wealth management and transaction services .
Abstract
We present motion magnification , a technique that acts like a microscope for visual motion .
It can amplify subtle motions in a video sequence , allowing for visualization of deformations that would otherwise be invisible .
To achieve motion magnification , we need to accurately measure visual motions , and group the pixels to be modified .
After an initial image registration step , we measure motion by a robust analysis of feature point trajectories , and segment pixels based on similarity of position , color , and motion .
A novel measure of motion similarity groups even very small motions according to correlation over time , which often relates to physical cause .
An outlier mask marks observations not explained by our layered motion model , and those pixels are simply reproduced on the output from the original registered observations .
The motion of any selected layer may be magnified by a user - specified amount ; texture synthesis fills - in unseen holes revealed by the amplified motions .
The resulting motion - magnified images can reveal or emphasize small motions in the original sequence , as we demonstrate with deformations in load - bearing structures , subtle motions or balancing corrections of people , and rigid structures bending under hand pressure .
System Overview
To find small motions in a video and magnify them , we model the appearance of the input video as translations of the pixel intensities observed in a reference frame .
Naively , this sounds like one might ( a ) compute the translation from one pixel to the next in each frame , and ( b ) re-render the video with small motions amplified .
Unfortunately , such an approach would lead to artificial transitions between amplified and unamplified pixels within a single structure .
Most of the steps of motion magnification relate to reliably estimating motions , and to clustering pixels whose motions should be magnified as a group .
Below we motivate and summarize each step of the motion magnification processing .
The processing steps are illustrated with the swing set images in the figure below .
The details can be found in our publication [ pdf download ] .

Applications
We foresee broad application of this algorithm in fields related to visualization , such as education , physical diagnosis , pre-measurement planning for precise physical measurements , and surveillance .

But the BBC's North America editor Justin Webb says the latest surveys also suggest Mr McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin , is sinking in the public 's estimation : Some 59 % of respondents said she was not ready to be vice - president .
Meanwhile there were reports that Mr Obama had approached a controversial congressman to be his chief of staff if he becomes president .
The Illinois Congressman , Rahm Emanuel , is regarded as a highly partisan politician , and supporters of John McCain say he is an example of the real face of an Obama administration - governed from the left .
' Not over '
Mr McCain made his emergency donations plea less than a day after Mr Obama spent an estimated $ 5 m ( £ 3.1 m ) on a 30 - minute primetime " infomercial " aired on US TV networks .

In an email to supporters the Arizona senator wrote : " I 'm asking for your financial support today to help us respond to attacks against our entire ticket .
" This election is not over and we need everyone 's hard work in the coming days to be victorious . "
On the campaign trail on Thursday , the candidates accused each other of favouring oil companies over middle class Americans , as oil company Exxon Mobil reported record profits .
At one campaign event in the town of Defiance , Mr McCain criticised his rival for voting in favour of a 2005 energy bill , which contained tax breaks for oil companies .
" Senator Obama voted for billions in corporate giveaways to the oil companies , " he said .
" I voted against it . "

Mr McCain was joined at one rally by Joe Wurzelbacher - perhaps better known as " Joe the Plumber " - who has been adopted by the Republicans as a mascot after questioning Mr Obama 's tax plan .
Mr Wurzelbacher had failed to appear at a previous campaign stop , despite being called on stage .
Mr McCain also restated his policy in favour of reducing US reliance on foreign oil imports .
" If I 'm elected president , we 're going to stop sending $ 700 bn a year to pay for oil from countries that do n't like us very much .
We 're going to drill off shore and we 're going to drill now . "
Mr Obama has said that he backed the 2005 energy bill because it also contained tax breaks for renewable energy producers .
And the Illinois senator has accused Mr McCain of supporting more tax breaks for oil firms , because the Republican candidate favours cutting corporate tax rates .
' Rear - view mirror ' Speaking in Florida , and later repeating the message in Virginia and Missouri , Mr Obama drew his supporters ' attention to the news that US GDP had dropped by 0.3 % in the third quarter of 2008 , and blamed President Bush for the decrease .
" Our falling GDP is a direct result of eight years of the trickle - down , Wall Street first / Main Street last policies that have driven our economy into a ditch , " he said .

Former Democratic US Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to appear in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , with his wife , Tipper , later on Friday .
The state holds significance for Mr Gore because - during his 2000 presidential run - he lost there by just 537 votes , triggering a recount , which was controversially halted by the US Supreme Court .
Had he won the state , he would have won the presidential election .
Recent polls from CNN / Opinion Research suggest that Mr Obama leads Mr McCain by four points in Ohio , by six points in North Carolina and by seven points in Nevada , all states won by George W Bush in 2004 .

A Dutch court has convicted two teenagers of theft for stealing virtual items in a computer game and sentenced them to community service .
Radio Netherlands reports that the two teenagers - a 15 and a 14 - year - old - were found guilty of using violence to rob a 13 - year - old classmate of virtual property in the multiplayer online game RuneScape .
The Dutch broadcaster 's English language news services reported that the victim was coerced into transferring the item to the older boys after they " kicked and struck the victim and threatened him with a knife " on several occasions last year .

1. HyperX Cloud Revolver S Elite feel and sound at a premium price Interface : Wired ( USB ) | Features : 7.1 - channel surround sound , 50 mm drivers , Dolby DSP , 3.5 mm jack Excellent all - around sound All - day comfort Finicky mic positioning Cable may be too long
When we first sat down to review the HyperX Cloud Revolver S , we were a tad conflicted .
On one hand , it boasts incredible 7.1 - channel surround sound , delivered through Dolby 's trademark digital signal processor .
On the other , it 's extremely expensive when compared to other similar headsets .
Fortunately , as one of Kingston 's most subdued pair of cans we 've ever seen ( or heard ) , the pure comfort and top - notch sound more than make up for its high price and weirdly placed detachable mic .
And that ’s why it tops our list of the best PC gaming headsets .

2. Logitech G Pro X Wireless Wireless freedom Interface : Wireless | Features : up to 20h battery life , Detachable mic with foam windscreen , 1.8 m USB A to USB C charging cable Excellent sound quality Superb build quality Comfortable Kind of expensive Weak mic
Wireless headphones are no longer plagued with latency , with such releases as the Logitech G Pro X Lightspeed setting a higher standard for wireless audio .
One of the best gaming headsets out there , this pair of cans gives you wireless freedom alongside low latency , robust build quality and , most importantly , excellent sound .
It also boasts up to 20 hours of battery life , and a wireless range of up to 13 m .
Its microphone could be better , and it could also be cheaper .
However , if you have the cash ( and you do n’t use the mic that much anyway ) , this one ’s a shoo -in .

Adjustable steel slider ; PC and PS4 compatibility ; Detachable noise - cancelling mic 30 hour battery life Great sound quality Tad pricier than its competitors

This means you can likely get two full days of gaming in between full charges .
There is a catch , however – unlike the Cloud Flight ’s competition , namely the Astro A20 , this gaming headset only offers stereo sound , ditching any surround sound capability .

Honestly , I do n’t see why any self - respecting homosexual would want to drag their friends and family and a bunch of other people they never cared to see again in their lives halfway across the country to wear tuxedoes and dresses they ’d never otherwise be caught dead in , much less buy , and eat cake when they could be having pie , and make a bunch of mushy promises that set the bar way too high , just so they could have their love recognized by a bunch of backwards old men in silly hats .
But whatever .
If the only constitutionally acceptable reason for opposing gay marriage is not wanting to have to buy that much more crap from that much more registries for that much more weddings , then believe me I sympathize but shut the fuck up .
Oh also there ’s that whole not - being - allowed to visit partners in hospitals like every other couple , not - being - allowed to share benefits like every other couple , not - being - allowed to file taxes jointly like every other couple , and not - being - allowed to share equal custody of children like every other couple .
That kinda sucks too .
I ’ve said before that when you ride a small Honda you do so with the grinning ghost of company founder Soichiro Honda on the pillion seat .
On the Cub you can sense the way his genius imbued the machine ; in the way the air filter is raised out of the harmful influence of the dust and water of unmade roads , in the proportions of the wheels and tyres and the softness of the springing , in the way the one - piece plastic leg shield can be replaced in a minute when you fall off .
Even the range of nut and bolt sizes used to hold the thing together seems to have been considered .
Honda did n’t just save you money on fuel , he saved you money on spanners as well .
In 1954 , Denham Harman proposed the free radical theory of aging ( FRTA ) , which posits that the accumulation of lipid , protein , and nucleic acid damage from free radicals results in a decline of function over time .
Although the FRTA is one of the leading theories on aging today , it is still being modified .
One major breakthrough was the identification of mitochondria as the major source of oxygen free radicals , such as superoxide and hydroxyl radical , and other reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , like hydrogen peroxide .
Support for the FRTA includes a decrease in ROS production in calorie restricted ( CR ) animals , a dietary strategy known to increase lifespan in a whole host of animals .
A hot area of research is the search for calorie restriction mimetics , which mimic the lifespan extending effects of CR .
By using CR mimetics therapeutically , we may be able to have lower cholesterol , blood glucose , and blood pressure , as well as lower instances of cancer , diabetes , neurodegeneration , and heart disease — and still be able to eat a hot fudge sundae every night .
Caldeira da Silva and Cerqueira suggest that mitochondrial uncoupling is an effective mimic of CR .
In mitochondria , the electron transport chain uses electrons from glucose and lipids to pump protons across a membrane .
This proton gradient can be used to make energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation .
The process is kind of like generating hydropower .
Uncouplers work by putting a leak in the dam , which lets water through without going to the generator .
They “ uncouple ” the electron transport chain from oxidative phosphorylation , thus reducing the efficiency of energy production .
Although animals have uncoupling proteins ( these proteins are important for thermogenesis , especially during hibernation ) , so far there are no known agonists .
The researchers instead used low doses of the mitochondria uncoupler DNP .
DNP was actually used as a diet pill because the body makes up for inefficient energy production by burning more fat .
Unfortunately , all that potential energy in the proton gradient is released as heat , which can cause fatal fevers .
( The FDA deemed DNP unfit for human consumption in 1938 , although supplements are now sold online to bodybuilders ) .
Notably , the mice in the study had no change in body temperature .
They were given doses 1000X below the lethal dose and plenty of space to let off any extra heat .
The DNP treated mice ate the same amount of food as control mice but had lower body mass .
The DNP treated mice showed many phenotypes observed in calorie restricted mice .
Like CR mice , DNP treated mice had higher rates of respiration with lower production of ROS .
These mice also had lower oxidative damage to their DNA and proteins , another hallmark of CR .
They showed lowered blood glucose , lower triglycerides , and lower insulin .
Most importantly , DNP treated mice showed an extended lifespan .
This study suggests that mitochondrial uncouplers are an effective mimic of calorie restriction and might be a realistic therapeutic intervention for delaying aging and extending lifespan .
Uncouplers may be even more effective than resveratrol , which may – or may not – only work on mice on a high fat diet .
US Army Works to Cut its Carbon " Bootprint " … ba da bum !
July 29th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
In what is just another example in a long stream of such , the US Army is beginning to realize that it is not only good for publicity , but essentially cheaper , to turn their operations green … er. Going green was never solely about making some cheap points on the PR board ; it has , from the start , been a cheaper option across the board .
The Army had begun pushing for environmental sustainability in all of their bases , starting with Fort Bragg in North Carolina .
And they ’re thinking it through as well ; not only are they thinking about the current footprint ( I ’m not going to say it ) , they ’re thinking about the future as well .
Since 2001 , each village set up within Fort Bragg for training purposes has been made up of shipping containers , reducing the cost from $ 400,000 to $ 25,000 , and keeping the shipping containers out of the solid waste stream .
But the goal is not solely to save money , but also lives as well .
One of the most common reports we would hear in the early days of the Iraq war and the War on Terror in Afghanistan , would be convoys encountering IED ’s , or Improvised Explosive Devices , along the side of the road .
The main reason that these convoys had to make the long trek to the forward command posts was to transfer fuel from A to B .
And the more trucks in the convoys , the more soldiers there were , and thus the more risk there was to more people .
“ If we can reduce consumption on our forward operating bases by using renewable energy , let ’s say wind or solar instead of a diesel generator outside the tent … then we can reduce the number of these supply convoys that need to come forward that are getting hit by these IEDs , ” said Tad Davis , deputy assistant secretary for environment , safety and occupational health .
Another saving that the Army has made of late is to spray their tents with foam insulation .
After a recent survey of U.S. forward bases in Djibouti , Kuwait , Iraq and Afghanistan showed that 85 percent or more of the power was used for air conditioning , to provide comfort sleeping and keep communications equipment cool , something had to be done .
The foam insulation has now shown to cut the loss of energy by 45 % .
One aspect of the military that has hit a sticking point in going green is Army vehicles .
Keeping our troops safe is a priority , and should n’t be put by the sidelines for anything .
Hence , many of the vehicles have to rely on heavy armor to prevent lessening the safety for troops inside .
However , according to Davis , “ There ’s emerging technology that is providing lighter - weight armor , so I think at some point … you ’re going to see more hybrid vehicles in the tactical military fleet . ”
And as for the notion that the US military is the world ’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses on the planet , Davis questions the notion , and hopes that an online tracking program started in June will bring a favorable result .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican President Felipe Calderon , locked in a bloody battle with drug cartels , wants to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of street drugs in a plan likely to irk Washington .
Calderon , a conservative in power nearly two years , sent a proposal to Congress on Thursday that would scrap the penalties for drugs including cocaine , heroin , methamphetamine , opium and marijuana .
“ What we are seeking is to not treat an addict as a criminal , but rather as a sick person and give them psychological and medical treatment , ” said Sen.
Alejandro Gonzalez , head of the Senate ’s justice committee .
Under Calderon ’s plan , people carrying up to 2 grams ( 0.07 ounces ) of marijuana or opium , half a gram of cocaine , 50 milligrams of heroin or 40 milligrams of methamphetamine would face no criminal charges .
It would also give Mexican states the power to try drug dealers in local courts instead of at the federal level .
Reviving a similar effort by his predecessor , Calderon aims to free up police to hunt for dealers and smugglers .
But the plan could run into opposition in largely conservative Mexico as well as in the United States .
In a separate proposal , the president asked the Senate to shake up Mexico ’s notoriously inept and often corrupt police .
Calderon said poor training and a lack of coordination between forces are hindering efforts to rein in rampant drug violence and organized crime .
“ They are at the limit in terms of not sharing intelligence in crime fighting , something which eventually means a lack of organization in the state ’s capacity to deal with the crime phenomenon , ” he said .
Some analysts say that up to half of Mexico ’s police could be in the pay of drug cartels , which offer bribes that dwarf the paltry wages of the average officer .
Former president Vicente
Fox introduced a drug decriminalization measure in 2006 but ditched it after Washington objected and critics on both sides of the border said it could lure “ drug tourists ” from the United States .
Drug use is less common among young people in Mexico than in the United States or Europe .
But consumption is creeping up with the growth of the middle class and as tighter border controls mean more cocaine stays in the country .
Calderon has deployed thousands of troops to clamp down on the drug gangs that shuttle Colombian cocaine over Mexico ’s northern border .
But cartel violence has soared as a result , killing some 3,000 people this year .

At the Science Leadership Academy , we encourage current upperclassmen to participate when we interview incoming students .
We prepare these budding leaders to be patient and professional when sitting across from students who are only one to three years younger than they are — and our kids exceed our best expectations .
Yet , among the student body , there is one wrong way to answer our questions about why they ’ve applied : “ I hear you ’ve got laptops . ”
Our students smile warmly at this , but , despite their training , most reflexively attempt to meet their teacher ’s eye .
We look back knowingly and continue the conversation , aware that , for many eighth graders , going to school carrying a personal laptop and no textbooks seems otherworldly .
Much as they deny it , the technology was just as cool to our current students when they sat across the table .
It ’s just that with each hour spent in our environment their understanding of what makes a school progressive has matured — and has put the technology in its right place .
It ’s fun watching this year ’s freshmen begin this growth process — for their trials mirror the school ’s own developing ideas on the subject of technology .
They struggle against the frequent distractions popping into their view .
Not long ago , students would ball up scraps of notebook paper and pass them around the room .
They now instant message three friends at once .
Boys would tuck copies of Sports Illustrated under their textbooks — now they open another tab at SI.com .
They no longer fold elaborate fortune - tellers out of loose - leaf ; instead they go online to check horoscopes or play role - play games .
When I spoke at a conference last year on being a young teacher in a progressive technology school , the most important understanding shared was that I was not as interesting as what they could pull up on their screens .
I am overmatched in most battles for my students ’ attention .
Classroom management has a new language .
The sternest words in my arsenal are “ Screens down . ”
Yet , I am a forgiving disciplinarian , because I too fight distractions .
New technology provides sexy alternatives to older methods of instruction and assessment .
In the same conference , I spoke about my “ podcast year ” — when , as a first year teacher , I discovered the joy of digital microphones .
Every piece of creative writing was recorded , an activity that ate up entire class periods .
By the time I reached a unit where it actually made sense to capture student voice ( speeches ) , the kids were ready to fight me .
I too had allowed myself to be distracted .
Technology is also expensive .
The kids have to buy insurance , and they constantly lose and replace parts .
Schools feel the pinch , too .
There is the myth about the Soviets using a pencil when we spent millions developing a pen — and I ’m sure that ’s how many feel about schools using technology .
In hard economic times , there certainly is an argument to be made against unnecessary expenses .
Still , one should ask why our older students cringe when the technology is put at the forefront .
They understand , most importantly , that our staff ’s greatest strengths are our love for them and our progressive pedagogy .
But also , they know that the distractions that attract 13 - year - olds and confound young teachers are only themselves distractions from the real benefits of technology .
First is the communication .
I rarely grade alone .
The students rarely do their homework in isolation .
The same chatting software that , when mismanaged , give us fits in our classrooms , enables us to collaborate in dynamic ways .
Students now continue fiery classroom debates when they get home from school .
They now walk each other through difficult readings of “ The Odyssey ” and “ Hamlet ” and return to class with stronger understandings .
Our projects are regularly published — which leads to comments and ongoing conversations with the outside world .
As important as it is for students to expand their sense of community and learn to collaborate — it is more crucial that they learn how to sift thoughtfully through increasing amounts of information .
The Internet presents a unique challenge to scholarship — many of the questions that once required extensive research can now be answered with 10 - minute visits to Google .
The issue now is distinguishing between rich resources and the online collection of surface facts , misinformation , and inexcusable lies that masquerade as the truth .
It will be hard for our students to be thoughtful citizens without this ability to discern the useful from the irrelevant .
This is especially clear during this election season .
If they are never asked to practice dealing with this new onslaught of information , they will have to practice when the stakes are much higher .
I was once asked in a mock interview how to best use technology in the classroom .
My deadpan answer , “ Very carefully , ” drew laughs from the audience of undergraduates .
After three years , my philosophy has n’t changed .
When prudently used , the technology prepares our students to make the most of a world that we ca n’t yet imagine .
Please come back later .
John Lewis :
" What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history .
Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division , and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse .
George Wallace never threw a bomb .
He never fired a gun , but he created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights .
Because of this atmosphere of hate , four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham , Alabama ...
As public figures with the power to influence and persuade , Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are playing with fire , and if they are not careful , that fire will consume us all .
They are playing a very dangerous game that disregards the value of the political process and cheapens our entire democracy .
We can do better .
The American people deserve better . ” " - civil rights icon John Lewis on the rhetoric being stoked at McCain - Palin rallies .
Lewis was one of " three wise men " McCain said this summer that he would call on for advice as president .

China ’s dramatic jump into wind power installations and manufacturing provides a glimmer of hope amidst what is otherwise a terribly polluted picture of unsustainable environmental devestation driven largely by coal - fired power generation .
But just a glimmer .
Cambridge , MA - based consulting firm Emerging Energy Research affirmed the wind sector growth last week , issuing an analysis that puts China on track to hit 135,000 - megawatt of wind capacity in 2020 ; EER expects China to lead the world in annual wind installations by 2011 .
EER ’s 135 - gigawatt prediction for 2020 marks a big jump up from the already optimistic prediction by Chinese Wind Energy Association secretary general Haiyan Qin that closed our May 2008 reporting on China ’s wind sector — namely that his members would have no trouble doubling the official 30 GW national goal for 2020 .
And still the wind sector remains dwarfed by the heft and growth of China ’s coal - fired power sector .
In 2006 alone , China commissioned 102 GW of new coal - fired power stations , a power bloc that exceeds the United Kingdom ’s entire electric power system .
In other words it will likely take a decade of world - leading growth in wind power installations before China ’s total installed base of wind turbines can put out more power than the coal plants it added in 2006 .
Factor in the intermittent output from the wind turbines and the comparison looks that much more lopsided ( averaged out over a year , wind turbines produce at their peak capacity only 30 % of the time ) .
The result is toxic air that probably kills upwards of a million people per year in China , and is a leading contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions .
Cleaning up the coal - fired plants provides a more likely handle for cutting the local air pollution .
According to a survey of coal plant operators issued by MIT ’s China Energy Project in August — Greener Plants , Grayer Skies ? —
China ’s coal - fired power plants have the means to capture acid rain and smog forming pollutans , as well as particulates .
The authors determined that most of the new plants being added in China employ decent technology , including pollution controls .
The problem , they conclude , is that these controls are n’t turned on .
Why break the law and leave pollution - trapping scrubbers and baghouses lying dormant ?
They consume energy , which cuts into revenues , and China ’s inadequate environmental enforcement is incapable of enforcing compliance .
Could Beijing ’s extension of controls on auto traffic post -Olympics signal the new ethic of environmental protection needed to activate those scrubbers and start detoxifying China ’s air ?
One that could even , some day , include carbon capture to start trimming China ’s world - leading greenhouse gas emissions ?
Those may sound like terribly hopeful notes , but they ’re at least as realistic as relying on wind power to do the job .

( LifeWire ) --
While she was studying in Brazil during college , the one thing Stephanie Gerson longed to do before leaving was spend time in the thick of the Amazon rain forest .
Unfortunately , she could n't find a tour that would take her past the forest 's edge .
Survey at college finds 27 percent of men and 14 percent of women willing to trade favors or gifts for sex .
So , when a college - aged busboy at a resort she was visiting began flirting with her , she asked him if he thought a tourist could survive alone in the jungle .
" He laughed and told me I was nuts , " says Gerson , 27 , who works part - time in online marketing for a chocolate company in San Francisco .
Then he told her that he'd grown up in the jungle in a nearby indigenous community .
That was all Gerson needed to hear .
Although she was n't attracted to the guy , Gerson flirted right back in the hopes that he would be her jungle tour guide .
It worked .
The busboy wormed his way out of work , and the two headed into the rain forest .
" It was amazing , " Gerson says of her adventure in 2000 .
" We built our homes out of palm leaves , I saw animals I 'd never seen before , he taught me the medicinal properties of all the plants , we picked fruit off the trees , we swam with and ate piranhas .
And , of course , we had sex ... for almost two weeks . "
Body currency system
Gerson never felt sleazy or uncomfortable with her unspoken arrangement with the busboy .
" It was a good barter both ways , " she says .
" I got to stay in the jungle , and he got to have sex with a cute , young American girl . "
Such trades are n't so unusual .
Throughout history , humans have used their bodies to get what they want -- from ancient Egyptian ruler Cleopatra , who cemented her power through liaisons with Roman rulers Julius Caesar and Mark Antony , to the man and woman who were arrested at a Fort Wright , Kentucky , motel in late June for allegedly swapping sex for gasoline .
Regardless of our motivation , scientists say we 're hardwired to use our bodies as a bargaining chip .
A recent study of 475 University of Michigan undergraduates ages 17 to 26 found that 27 percent of the men and 14 percent of the women who were n't in a committed relationship had offered someone favors or gifts -- help prepping for a test , laundry washing , tickets to a college football game -- in exchange for sex .
On the flip side , 5 percent of the men surveyed and 9 percent of the women said they 'd attempted to trade sex for such freebies .
And although they were n't hard up for resources , the students surveyed " recognized the value of this socioeconomic currency system , " says Daniel Kruger , research scientist at the University of Michigan School of Public Health , who published his findings in the April issue of " Evolutionary Psychology . "
" It 's more about getting what you want than getting what you need , " he says .
" Unless you think everyone needs a $ 200 Louis Vuitton bag . "
The handyman hookup
But unattached coeds are n't the only ones who barter with their bodies .
Some professionals will attest that their skills are , well , sexy .
" Women are turned on just by the simple idea of their guy getting off his ass and doing something for them , " says Rocky Fino , author of " Will Cook for Sex : A Guy 's Guide to Cooking . "
It works both ways , he adds .
" Give it to me first thing in the morning , and I 'll play [ handyman ] all day , " says Fino , a 39 - year - old father of two and part - time construction worker .
Ben Corbett , a 39 - year - old contractor from Boulder , Colorado , credits his tool belt with prompting the barrage of come - ons he fields from female clients -- most of them married -- on a regular basis .
" It starts with the flirting , and it just progresses , " says Corbett , who has run a construction and remodeling business for 20 years .
" They 'll touch my hand , and there 's all this physical contact .
Or they 'll run around in their pajamas . "
" Once , " he says , " I was painting the hallway right outside a client 's bedroom , and she was lying on her bed like a girl at a slumber party with her legs up and her arms crossed and her head resting on them , asking me if I had a girlfriend .
" It 's all about the fantasy of being taken by the rough - hewn construction guy , " muses Corbett , who , despite the temptation , has avoided getting sexually involved with his clientele for fear of jeopardizing his business .
It 's the biology , stupid
Call it crass , sexist or gender stereotyping all you want , but there are thousands of years of biological programming at work here , says Dr. Chris Fariello , director of the Institute for Sex Therapy at the Council for Relationships , a nonprofit relationship - counseling group based in Philadelphia .
Plain and simple , a partner who provides more resources -- wealth , shelter , home repairs -- is seen as more attractive and stands to reap more sexual rewards .
Or , as Fariello puts it , " I do n't get anybody in my office who says , ' My husband sits on the couch all day and eats bonbons , and I want to have sex with him all the time . ' "

Election Day is in two weeks .
Or is the campaign already over ?
“ At this point it would be difficult to see Republican losses in the Senate and House to be fewer than seven and 20 respectively , ” Charlie Cook writes in his National Journal column .
“ A very challenging situation going into September turned into a meltdown last month , the most dire predictions for the G.O.P. early on became the most likely outcome .
The metrics of this election argue strongly that this campaign is over , it ’s only the memory of many an election that seemed over but was n’t that is keeping us from closing the book mentally on this one . ”
Among Cook ’s reasons :
First , no candidate behind this far in the national polls , this late in the campaign has come back to win .
Sure , we have seen come - from - behind victories , but they did n’t come back this far this late .
Second , early voting has made comebacks harder and would tend to diminish the impact of the kind of late - breaking development that might save McCain ’s candidacy .
With as many as one - third of voters likely to cast their ballot before Election Day , every day more are cast and the campaign is effectively over for them .
The longer Obama has this kind of lead and the more votes are cast early , the more voters are out of the pool for McCain .
Third , considering that 89 percent of all voters who identified themselves as Democrats voted for John Kerry four years ago and 93 percent of Republicans cast their ballots for George W. Bush , the switch from parity between the parties to a 10 - point Democratic advantage would seem to almost seal this outcome irrespective of the candidates fielded on each side .
The unprecedented surges seen in Democratic party registrations in those states that require party affiliations confirm that .
At the end of his column , Cook concludes , “ As things are going now , this election would appear to be on a track to match Bill Clinton ’s 1992 5.6 percent margin over President George H.W. Bush , the question is whether it gets to Bush ’s 1988 7.7 percent win over Michael Dukakis or Clinton ’s 8.5 percent win over Robert Dole in 1996 .
Maybe some cataclysmic event occurs in the next two weeks that changes the trajectory of this election , but to override these factors , it would have to be very , very big . ”
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Solar stocks rallied on Wednesday after the U.S. Senate voted to continue tax breaks worth $ 18 billion for renewable energy sources , including a generous eight - year extension for solar .
Top gainers included top U.S. solar company SunPower Corp SPWR.O , which soared as much as 12.7 percent to $ 98.60 on the Nasdaq .
Solar cell maker Evergreen Solar Inc ESLR .
O rose as much as 14.5 percent to $ 6.58 and solar installer Akeena Solar Inc AKNS .
O gained as much as 25 percent to $ 5.33 .
Chinese solar companies also rallied on the news .
Yingli Green Energy Holding Co Ltd YGE.N , also boosted by the announcement it would supply 1.4 megawatts ( MW ) of solar panels to a Rutgers University campus , was up 8.6 percent at $ 13.59 in early afternoon trading .
Trina Solar Ltd TSL.N shares rose 6.8 percent to $ 29.28 , helped by news that it would provide 2.4 MW in cells for a project in Atlantic City , New Jersey , in what it said would be the largest single rooftop solar installation in the United States .
Federal renewable energy tax credits , which had been set to expire at the end of this year , are considered critical to helping solar power compete with electricity from dirtier sources such as coal and fossil fuels .
The Senate ’s failure to extend the subsidies on eight occasions earlier this year put a major damper on solar stocks as investors fretted a lack of government support would cause U.S. solar demand to slump next year .
“ The solar industry wins big in this bill , ” Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in a client note , pointing to the bill ’s provision allows utilities to claim the tax breaks .
In addition , the bill eliminated a $ 2,000 cap on tax credits for residential solar systems .
“ The bill therefore opens the door to vastly greater domestic adoption of solar power within the residential and utility markets , ” Molchanov wrote .
The renewable tax credits measure , which is expected to be approved by the House of Representatives and President George W. Bush , gives businesses a 30 percent tax credit to offset the development costs of solar and other clean energy projects .
The solar tax credit extension will create 440,000 permanent jobs in the United States and generate $ 232 billion in new investment , according to a recent study by Navigant Consulting Inc .
Analysts agreed that a U.S. tax credit extension removes a key concern for solar investors .
But looking ahead , the industry still faces high raw material costs , declining prices for solar panels , a pullback in government subsidies in big markets such as Spain and Germany and global economic turmoil -- all of which could continue to weigh on solar stocks .
“ Investors may wait for less uncertainty before jumping back into the sector , ” Oppenheimer analyst Sam Dubinsky wrote in a client note .
BALM BEACH , ONT .
–Idyllic and twee , this little lakeside hamlet , complete with a shabby arcade featuring a menu of greasy summertime delights , would seem the unlikeliest place to be pondering its own version of martial law .
But here in the Township of Tiny on the shores of Georgian Bay , desperate times call for desperate measures .
It 's been quite a summer .
Vandalism , assaults , broken bones , torn earlobes , a chainsaw attack , arson , charges of public mischief , hundreds and hundreds of police calls – and all this in the space of just a few months .
Increasingly , a day at the beach here is anything but .
Balm Beach has become the most visible flashpoint in the growing schism between public access and private ownership of the province 's cherished – and increasingly crowded – waterfront places , and a sudden , stark notice to the public at large : Ontario waterfront is more likely than not to be private .
" Everyone 's looking for their little piece of heaven , " says Const .
Peter Leon from the nearby Midland OPP detachment .
" Some people do n't want to share .
Maybe that 's their right .
But that 's when the problems start . "
Some contend Balm Beach is an abject lesson in what happens when such grey areas as beach access are left to fester – unregulated , hazy and unclear .
Police patrols have increased ; OPP cruisers are an almost constant presence .
Plainclothes officers monitor the arcade , the street ( there is only one ) and the shoreline .
Last week , floodlights went up along the beach for the first time .
Most trace the root of the trouble to 2006 , when John Marion , whose lakeside home sits one lot south of the official public beach , started building a 2 - metre - tall wooden fence along his property line toward the water 's edge .
By the fall of 2007 , the fence had reached the shore .
Parallel to it , a chain - link fence hems in Marion 's property , which was confirmed as extending to the water 's edge when the owner made an application under the provincial Boundaries Act in 2005 .
Beyond it , 30 shoreline cottage owners who say their original deeds erroneously excluded beachfront from their property have acquired the same right as Marion .
Much of the land quietly has been decreed private .
This summer , the crowds have returned to Balm Beach – and the fence .
Most gripe or shrug , wading around it to the beach beyond .
Others take a different approach .
On June 29 , the fence was attacked with a chainsaw in the middle of a sunny day .
Local cottager Mark Tasikas , 44 , was charged with mischief to property .
Hundreds of stunned beach - goers gawked in amazement ; some burst into applause .
Elisabeth Marion , 63 , John 's wife , had a video camera snatched from her hand and was knocked to the ground , according to witness accounts taken by OPP Insp.
Rick Philbin .
" It was just a mob mentality , " Philbin told the Star .
The OPP inspector , who says he experienced less vitriol during a nine - month policing stint with the UN in Kosovo , added : " I could n't believe the hatred . "
On July 22 , the fence was set on fire during the night ; no arrests have been made .
Then , on July 24 , 14 - year old James Brennan , vacationing with his family from Mississauga , ended up in a physical confrontation in the water beyond the Marions ' property .
His earrings were torn out , and his hand was broken .
John Marion , 63 , and his son Greg , 42 , were charged with assault causing bodily harm .
They appear in court on Sept. 25 .
Since then , the usually talkative Marions have fallen silent ; several attempts by the Star to reach them have been rebuffed .
The conflict is the culmination , some say , of years of animosity between the Marions and the community .
In the past , there have been verbal confrontations and attacks on people 's yards and gardens – bleach thrown on a lawn , vegetable patches doused in weed killer .
Elisabeth Marion was charged in July with mischief to property under $ 5,000 ; she is accused of destroying a neighbour 's flowers .
She is due in court on Sept. 4 .
John Marion has described his family as victims in published reports – prisoners in their own home .
Others call them the aggressors , forcibly pushing their neighbours ' limits .
Joe Randolph 's wife , Judy Ryan , runs The Surf Restaurant , next door to the Marions .
Randolph says black smoke often wafts from the Marions ' property onto The Surf 's deck at dinnertime , forcing patrons inside .
The property squabble can be traced to 2001 , when Nicholas Leblovic , a Toronto lawyer with a summer home on Balm Beach , made the first application under the Boundaries
Act to extend his property line to the water 's edge .
" ( This was ) nothing like public land being scooped up by property owners , " he says .
" It 's just a correction of an error in the deeds . "
But the Marions are the only ones to cordon off their property – even though , legally , any of the successful applicants could do the same , transforming the beach into barricaded corridors .
The notion has been enough for Kim Craitor , Liberal MPP for Niagara Falls , to introduce the Great Lakes Shoreline Right of Passage Act , a private member 's bill to preserve the public 's ability to walk all the shorelines of the Great Lakes .
It 's now awaiting committee review .
Craitor was spurred by similar conflicts along the Lake Erie shoreline near Fort Erie , but his bill speaks to an old , broad - ranging rift between private property owners and members of the public who believe shoreline access is an inalienable right .
In Michigan , the state Supreme Court passed a bill in 2005 much like the one Craitor has proposed for Ontario .
Here , though , things have been officially hazy since 1951 , when H.R. Scott , Minister of the Department of Lands and Forests , moved the province 's jurisdiction from the high - water mark to the low - water mark – meaning that anything above the water itself was no longer government responsibility .
" With one stroke of the pen , thousands of kilometres of coastline disappeared from public lands , " said Stephen Passero , the director of Shorewalk , an activist group in Fort Erie pushing for an act like Michigan's .
" It 'd be a different story if that land was never public .
But it was .
And we want it back . "
GEORGE LAWRENCE , Tiny Township 's deputy mayor , wrings his hands .
" It 's devastating to have a black mark like this be what we 're known for , " says Lawrence .
It 's a beautiful , clear day at Balm Beach , and Lawrence has had to run a gauntlet of beach - goers , each of them prodding him to do something , just to get to the picnic table where he now sits .
" That 's what it 's like down here right now , " Lawrence shrugs .
" That fence makes a loud statement . "
For Lawrence , the current situation is depressingly familiar .
He chaired the local ratepayers ' association in 1994 , when shoreline owners on Rowntree Beach , north of Balm Beach , won a court decision to declare itself entirely private .
" It was hard for some people to digest , " Lawrence recalls .
" There were protests and marches .
It was at that point I could see a serious problem , where there could be physical harm , property damage , that sort of thing . "
In 1999 , he appealed to then - attorney general Jim Flaherty to appoint a mediator to solve the Rowntree Beach problem .
Toronto firm Global Solutions was appointed but then cut mid-stream when the Liberals were elected – $ 400,000 later – and said the issue should be solved at the local level .
( " The township is not in a position to do that , " Lawrence protests . )
Somewhere along the way , in the interest of détente between property owners and beach - goers , the OPP received a memorandum from the Crown Attorney 's office , telling them not to issue trespass notices on the beach , further clouding the issue .
" It 's still a private waterfront , " Lawrence shrugs .
" Some ( owners ) just tolerate ( public use of it ) .

" It 's upsetting , and it runs right up and down this whole shoreline .
Is that what this bay is about ? "
DOUG LORRIMAN clambers over the boulders just past his property – a man-made breakwater to form the small bay in which the public beach sits .
Lorriman and the Marions bookend the public beach on opposite sides .
Their views are just as polarized .
Lorriman , 63 , a full - time resident since 2005 , is the field marshal for Preserve the Use of Balm Beach ( PUBB ) , a group lobbying to have the Marions ' fence removed .
" I did n't run for the position , I 'll tell you that , " he says , his face grim .
" I just thought somebody has to stand up to him ... "
Trained as an architect , Lorriman has become an unintentional expert on shoreline rights .
He says Rowntree – the precedent the Boundaries '
Act applications lean on – is wrong ; an earlier Ontario Superior Court decision on Lake Huron , near Grand Bend , denied a shoreline resort owner an application to declare his beach private in 1989 .
" It should supersede it . "
PUBB is struggling to raise $ 60,000 to mount a court challenge to have the fence removed .
Lorriman produces a letter from the Ministry of Government Services , which says the Marions ' property " is still subject to interests in land that others may have by virtue of pre-existing length of possession or use . "
That means if PUBB can prove the public has had traditional use of the beach , the fence may well have to come down .
" This is ours all the time , " Lorriman says .
" Surely , a few days a year , we can share it . "
" IT'S ALL MY FAULT , " says Roger Neal , 62 .
He speaks with a slight lisp , the result , he says , of having some teeth knocked out .
( Greg Marion was charged with assault ; he agreed to a peace bond and the charge was withdrawn ) .
Neal runs the beachfront Sunport Beach Resort Motel , a few doors down from the Marions ' property .
Neal says the history between him and his neighbours is long and ugly .
It started when he got zoning to rent motorboats in front of his property in 2004 .
All along the shore , cottagers – the Marions included – loathed the crowds , the noise , he says .
Neal , a gruff sort who 's been on this beach full - time for more than 30 years , wonders aloud about an outright conspiracy : Marion was a pawn of wealthy shoreline owners , offered up to make a statement .
( Marion said almost that much himself in an interview with The Barrie Examiner : " All those people helped me .
They are as scared as I am , " he told the paper .
" My education is not good , but if you read all the letters I 've sent the government you would think I 'm a Philadelphia lawyer .
That 's because I had a Philadelphia lawyer write it for me . " )
Neal 's problems with the Marions go well beyond business matters .
Twice they 've applied to have a peace bond placed against him for harassment .
The first , in 2006 , was dismissed ; the second will be ruled on Aug. 28 .
" I might be guilty of being rude , " Neal chuckles .
He recalls an incident in May , when he was walking his dog .
He stooped to pick up the droppings just as Marion rounded the corner in his car .
Neal says he approached the car , opened the door , unpackaged the droppings , and " held them six inches from his nose .
Then I turned around and walked away . "
On a brilliant summer afternoon , a small crowd sits near the fence .
Some touch its charred portions or have their picture taken with it .
Some clamber around the end of it , between the final post and an iron boat ramp Marion has dragged into the water , making it more difficult to pass .
Domenic Novielli is up from Oakville , visiting friends with a cottage nearby .
" Imagine this beach with fences all along it , " Novielli says .
He waves south , past the Marions ' fence , exasperated .
" Everyone has owned this forever , " he says .
" Is this what God intended when He put this on Earth ? "
GALVESTON , Tex . 
For thousands of people stuck on an increasingly fetid Galveston Island , the aftermath of Hurricane Ike is proving to be far worse than the storm itself .
With no water or power , no working toilets , no food or phones , people faced growing public health concerns here on Sunday .
More than 2,000 residents who had defied an evacuation order were taken off the island , and state officials tried to ensure that no one could return .
“ The storm was easy , ” said Brenda Shinette , 51 , who rode out the hurricane in her home but went to a shelter Sunday hoping to be taken to the mainland .
“ It ’s what came after that was terrible . ”
“ We have no showers , and the food is spoiled , ” Ms. Shinette added .
“ I feel like I want to pass out , but I ca n’t tell if it is from too much heat or too little food . ”
A major puzzle for neurobiologists is how the brain can modify one microscopic connection , or synapse , at a time in a brain cell and not affect the thousands of other connections nearby .
Plasticity , the ability of the brain to precisely rearrange the connections between its nerve cells , is the framework for learning and forming memories .
Duke University Medical Center researchers have identified a missing - link molecule that helps to explain the process of plasticity and could lead to targeted therapies .
The discovery of a molecule that moves new receptors to the synapse so that the neuron ( nerve cell ) can respond more strongly helps to explain several observations about plasticity , said Michael Ehlers , M.D. , Ph.D. , a Duke professor of neurobiology and senior author of the study published in the Oct. 31 issue of Cell .
" This may be a general delivery system in the brain and in other types of cells , and could have significance for all cell signaling . "
Ehlers said this could be a general way for all cells to locally modify their membranes with receptors , a process critical for many activities -- cell signaling , tumor formation and tissue development .
" Part of plasticity involves getting receptors to the synaptic connections of nerve cells , " Ehlers said .
" The movement of neurotransmitter ( chemical ) receptors occurs through little packages that deliver molecules to the synapse when new memories form .
What we have discovered is the molecular motor that moves these packages when synapses are active . "
When neurons fire at the same time , their connections strengthen and a person can associate certain features .
" Once you have heard someone 's name , seen his face , where he was standing , all these features can be bound into a unified packet of information – a percept – and at a very cellular level this occurs by strengthening synaptic connections between co-active neurons , " said Ehlers , who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator .
To learn and make new associations , the brain alters the strengths of the synapses ' electrical inputs onto cells that compute these features .
Scientists studied the hippocampus , where memories form , but this machinery could operate in other brain areas .
" One of earliest changes in Alzheimer 's disease is synapse dysfunction , so this molecule might be a new target for that disease , " he said .
" Abnormal movement of receptors may be implicated in brain development , in autism . "
He said the molecule potentially is involved " in the abnormal electrical activity of epilepsy and the overactive brain pathways of addiction . "
In a series of biochemistry and microscopic imaging experiments , Ehlers and colleagues found that the myosin Vb ( five - b ) molecule in hippocampal neurons responded to a flow of calcium ions from the synaptic space by popping up and into action .
One end of the myosin is attached the meshlike actin filaments so it can " walk " to the end of the nerve cells where receptors are .
On its other end , it tows an endosome , a packet that contains new receptors .
" These endosomes are like little memories waiting to happen , " Ehlers said .
" They are reservoirs of neurotransmitter receptors that brain cells deploy to add more receptors to a particular synapse .
More receptors equals stronger synapses . "
Electrical impulses cause one nerve cell to dump its neurotransmitter , in this case , glutamate , into the small space between neurons ( the synapse ) , which activates neurotransmitter receptors on the receiving side .
These are ion channels that open in response to neurotransmitter and generate the electrical impulse .
When the scientists blocked myosin in single cells , this stopped the addition of new receptors and prevented electrical impulses from getting stronger , showing that myosin is essential to enhancing nerve cell connections .
" This is a very basic cellular mechanism of brain plasticity .
It is likely fundamental to brain development and disease , " Ehlers said .
" The myosin Vb molecule gives us a new way to think about designing therapies for treating memory loss , psychiatric disease and brain development . "

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) --
A former ethics adviser to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin warned in July that firing her public safety commissioner would become a " grave concern " for her administration .
Gov. Sarah Palin is fighting allegations she improperly tried to force the firing of her then brother - in - law .
Wevley Shea , a former U.S. attorney and fellow Republican , urged Palin to apologize to former Commissioner Walt Monegan and fire anyone on her staff who discussed her former brother - in - law , state Trooper Mike Wooten , with the commissioner .
" Your ' political advisers ' have given you poor counsel ; the situation is now grave , " Shea wrote in a July 24 letter to the governor .
" I recommend the following action ' now ' to restore your credibility and Alaska 's bright future with you . "
Palin , now the Republican nominee for vice president , is battling allegations that she and her advisers pressured Monegan to fire Wooten .
Palin has said she fired Monegan over budget issues and denies any wrongdoing , calling Wooten a " rogue trooper " who threatened her family during his divorce from the governor 's sister .
Shea , who says he's an admirer of Palin's , said Thursday that the governor 's aides are trying to stall an investigation into Monegan 's dismissal by the state Legislature .
" The problem , in my opinion , is that there has been out - and - out cover - up and misleading statements by staffers in the governor 's office , " he said .
" And the parallel that I tried to draw is , you know , the problem with the firing or terminating of the U.S. attorneys . "
The governor has not publicly answered questions since Republican presidential nominee John McCain picked her as his running mate August 29 , and her representatives did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment Thursday .
Shea had acted as an informal ethics adviser to Palin , but he told CNN that his advice on the Monegan firing was unsolicited .
" If they would have done what I said , I think it would have been over , " he said .
He also recommended that Palin and her husband apologize " for any overreaching or perceived overreaching " regarding Wooten , who was involved in a child custody dispute with the governor 's sister .
" Trooper Wooten was / is a grave public safety threat to your family .
It was / is a very personal , emotional matter , which was either mishandled or covered up by certain individuals , " Shea wrote .
But , he added , " I am extremely concerned about certain ' wolves ' if my recommended action is not taken immediately . "
The state Legislature launched an investigation into Monegan 's dismissal in July .
In August , Palin disclosed that members of her staff had called state police officials nearly two dozen times to discuss Wooten and pledged to cooperate with the inquiry .
But since she became McCain 's running mate , her representatives have attacked the investigation as a " political circus " and argued that it should be conducted by the state Personnel Board .
Lawmakers have scheduled a Friday meeting on whether to subpoena a list of top advisers in their investigation , and the state Personnel Board was to meet Thursday afternoon to discuss Palin 's request for a separate probe .
The Legislature 's inquiry is scheduled to be completed by October 10 .
But the state attorney general 's office is now warning that the administration is likely to challenge any subpoenas in court .
Shea said he did not believe that Palin was pushing for the Personnel Board inquiry , but " there may be tactical reasons to do that from a legal standpoint . "
However , he said , the board would be unlikely to take an " independent look " at the conduct of Palin 's aides .
" The Personnel Board , number one , is appointed by the governor , " he said .
" Number two , it 's a delaying tactic , because what the Personnel Board then has to do is appoint another investigator , which the attorney general would appoint this time .
And who does the attorney general work for ?
The attorney general is appointed by Gov. Palin . "
" Bluntly and to the point , we think there is a legitimate concern that this investigation is no longer being conducted in a fair manner -- and therefore is potentially violative of Alaska 's constitutional due process safeguards , " Senior Assistant Attorney General Mike Barnhill wrote in a letter Tuesday to the bipartisan committee that launched the investigation .
State Sen. Hollis French , the Anchorage Democrat managing the investigation , did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
French has drawn fire from Palin 's supporters for suggesting that the investigation could yield an " October surprise " for the Republican ticket and that officials in her administration may have violated state law by obtaining confidential information from Wooten 's personnel files .
Complaints about Wooten from Palin and her family have been under scrutiny since the governor 's July firing of Monegan .
Monegan has said that no one directly demanded Wooten 's firing but that his refusal to sack the trooper led to his dismissal .
Palin placed one aide , Frank Bailey , on leave after disclosing a tape - recorded call in which Bailey discussed Wooten 's case with a state trooper lieutenant .
Shea blamed the controversy on " yes people " in Palin 's administration who he said were " doing what they think makes them look better in the governor 's eyes . "
Wooten and Palin 's sister , Molly McCann , began divorce proceedings in 2005 after four years of marriage .
Palin , then a private citizen , and other members of her family filed several complaints about Wooten with the state police , accusing him of threatening his in - laws and other improper conduct .
Wooten was suspended for five days in March 2006 after state police commanders determined that he had used a Taser on his 10 - year - old stepson " in a training capacity ; " drove his patrol car while drinking beer and illegally shot a moose using his wife 's hunting permit .
As early as October 2005 , more than a year before Palin became governor , a judge hearing the divorce case warned her relatives against trying to get Wooten fired , according to court records .
Superior Court Judge John Suddock said the family appeared to be putting Wooten 's job at risk at a time when he would be required to pay child support and warned them " not to slay the goose that lays the golden egg . "
And in his final divorce decree the following January , Suddock warned against the " disparagement " of Wooten by his ex-wife 's family and said it could lead him to transfer custody of their children if it continued .
CNN 's Randi Kaye , Matt Smith , Susan Chun and Traci Tamura contributed to this report .
All About Sarah Palin • John McCain
Our credit record is the information that a lender will use to decide whether they feel they want to give us a loan .
This means that it is really important to make sure that it is correct and that it is the best that it can be .
You therefore need to be aware of what it says and then know how you can improve it .
It is possible to look at your credit record for free through certain companies .
Do some research and find one that you trust and take a look .
It is worth noting that you should never have to pay to look at it and it does not affect your credit score if you look at it .
Once you have looked at it you will be able to see whether there are things on there to improve .
It could be that you have a great credit record and you have no need to do anything but this is unlikely as most people have some areas that they can improve .
However , it is worth noting that different people who check your credit record are looking for different things .
This means that you may have the perfect credit record for one company but not another .
It is worth checking to make sure that everything is correct .
If you think that they have got something wrong then get it changed because it could make a big difference .
For example , if it says you have bills outstanding which you have paid off , then by getting that altered you could really improve your rating as they will know that you are reliable with regards to paying things .
If you are about to apply for anything big then it is well worth checking even if you have done it recently , just in case .
If you have no registered to vote then it is unlikely that you will get any credit .
You do not have to vote of course , but once you are registered it means that potential lenders will be able to use it as an ID check .
If you are not eligible to vote then you can send the three credit reference agencies proof of residency to help you to get credit .
This is the only way you ’ll be able to borrow money .
Do not get behind in any credit repayments because it can mean that you will not get any more .
If you set up all payments by direct debit then it is much harder to miss a payment .
Try to avoid going in jointly with anyone that has a poor credit record .
This could mean that you should not be jointly named on a bill or account with anyone , even if they are a flat mate , as it could have a bearing on your rating .
Once you are no longer together , make sure that the credit reference agencies know that this is the case and it will mean that their future credit history will not affect yours .
If you apply for lots of credit this could have a negative impact .
Therefore try to do a soft search to see whether you are likely to be accepted first .
This will only be visible to you and so will have no impact on your credit score .
Do not apply for credit too often as the application will show on your report and if you get rejected a lot then this will not look good .
Make sure that you have no mobile phone contracts , credit cards or things like this registered to old addresses .
Having lots of addresses on things in your name could make ID checking not go through properly .
One way to improve your credit rating is to use a credit rebuild cards .
These are credit cards with very high interest rates for those who want to improve their rating .
If you pay off the full balance each month you will not pay any interest and so the cost of it will be irrelevant .
If you have a card that you do not use , you could use that instead and get the same result .
You do not even have to pay that much out on it each month to benefit .
Never draw cash on your credit card .
As well as being expensive a lender will see it as evidence that you are not managing your money well .
The same with a payday loan , as although lenders may say it will improve your credit rating it is unlikely and many mortgage lenders will never lend money to someone who has had one as they see it as a sign of poor financial planning .
In case you needed more , here 's a proof that seems to completely confirm that — as expected — both the MacBook and MacBook Pro will be updated this Tuesday at the Apple MacBook 2008 event in Cupertino , where heads may be rolling after a PDF document referring to the " MacBook / MacBook Pro ( Late 2008 ) " line was accidentally posted today in their support site .

Becky :
From the time he stepped off the plane in China , the cameras were rolling .
Reporters from across Asia , recording his every move on the ground .
And everywhere , everyone wanted to hear what Warren Buffett had to say , especially about the markets .
Warren : Markets tend to overshoot in both directions and initially people get excited in markets and they advance because things are getting better and earnings are developing ....
My reaction is always to get more cautious because it 's easy to get carried away in the stock market when things have been going very well .
So , you should buy stocks because you think the businesses are worth more than you are paying ...
I do n't try to predict stock markets .
I try to find securities - stocks - that are selling for less than I feel that they 're worth and buy them .
Becky : Just about every word he said in the interviews seemed to hit the wires .
In fact , even things he did n't say hit the wires .
Let 's just say some things got lost in translation .
But Buffett doled out plenty of his characteristic advice on value investing .
Buffett : I am always looking for things I can understand and if you understand the businesses and you buy at attractive prices , there really is n't much risk .
Becky :
And he made some news , too , criticizing the plan by Citi and other big banks to create a super SIV fund .
Warren :
One of the lessons that investors seem to have to learn over and over again , and they will have to learn it again in the future , is that not only can you not turn a toad into a prince by kissing it , but you also can't turn a toad into a prince by repackaging it .
Becky :
He also weighed in on high - flying Google .
Warren :
It 's not hard to see that Google is a phenomenal company , but Google is valued at about $ 200 billion in the market now , so to make 14 percent a year , Google has to be valued at $ 400 billion in five years .
It may very well be .
It may be valued at 5 or 600 billion , but I am not smart enough to figure that out .
Becky :
And while he did n't say which markets or stocks he favors the most , he did mention one place he does n't favor at all .
Warren : I would say things would have to change a whole lot before we would be investing in North Korea .
I 'm flattered that you asked that question , because I am 77 years old and the fact that the day might come in my lifetime when North Korea offers an investment opportunity is kinda flattering .

The chaplain to the London Stock Exchange may be forced to walk the plank after demanding that gay chaps be tattooed with cig - packet - style health warnings highlighting the evils of boy - on - boy .
The Rev Peter Mullen , 66 , declared on his blog : " It is time that religious believers began to recommend ... discouragements of homosexual practices after the style of warnings on cigarette packets .
Let us make it obligatory for homosexuals to have their backsides tattooed with the slogan SODOMY CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH and their chins with FELLATIO KILLS . "
The Bishop of London , Rt Rev Richard Chartres , did n't take kindly to the suggestion , and branded Mullen 's outburst " highly offensive " , the Evening Standard reports .
Gay rights outfit Stonewall has demanded his resignation .
Mullen 's cheeks are evidently not for turning , as other highlights of his blog show .
He has previously slammed gay pride marches as " obscene " , and posted a poem " condemning the blessing of two gay priests at a ' wedding ' which the Rev Martin Dudley performed at his church St Bartholomew the Great in the City " .
The entertaining ditty begins : " The Bishop of London is in a high huff , Because Dr Dudley has married a puff ;
And not just one puff - he 's married another :
Two priests , two puffs and either to other . "
Mullen is also rector of St Sepulchre without Newgate and St Michael 's Cornhill - the latter describing itself as " traditional Church of England - real Anglicans " .
The campaigning rev's " real " Anglicism is further evidenced by this article in the Times , in which he lays into secularism ( " far worse than the threat from international terrorism " ) ; abortion ( " 200,000 embryos every year are ripped , untimely , from the womb ... " ) ; and , naturally , homosexuality ( " what was once a mortal sin is now only a lifestyle choice " ) .
Mullen may have overstepped the mark , though , with his audacious tattoo plan .
A spokesman for The Bish of London said : " While clergy are entitled to their own personal views , we recognise that the content of this text is highly offensive and is in no way reflective of the views of the Diocese of London . "
A Diocese source added : " These comments are now being looked at internally within the Diocese and he faces disciplinary procedures . "
The embattled clergyman was confronted yesterday at St Michael 's Cornhill .
He offered : " I wrote some satirical things on my blog and anybody with an ounce of sense of humour or any understanding of the tradition of English satire would immediately assume that they 're light - hearted jokes .
" I certainly have nothing against homosexuals .
Many of my dear friends have been and are of that persuasion .
What I have got against them is the militant preaching of homosexuality . "
Loyal parishioner Nicola Beckley , who 's been in Mullen 's flock for 10 years , defended : " He 's a great leader and does n't cloud his views in political correctness . " ®
A woman on the north coast of New South Wales in Australia is being held hostage in her own home by a large pig , Australian media report .
Uki woman Caroline Hayes , 63 , says the pig is as big as " a Shetland pony " and that she can not get out of her house because of its aggressive behaviour .
" It started knocking on my door at 4 am , head - butting the door , [ after ] some food , " she told ABC television .
When she opened the door , she said , the pig pushed her back inside the house .
The offending animal , whom neighbours have named Bruce , also pulled a king - sized mattress out of her garage and ripped it up .
Ms Hayes , who describes herself as an animal - loving vegetarian , admits she and some of her neighbours had begun feeding Bruce .
Rangers from Murwillumbah Council tried to catch the large animal but the cage was too small .
Animal ranger Len Hing , who visited the scene , explained that Bruce 's large size makes him difficult to control when hungry .
" He is a bald pig [ weighing ] about 80 kilos [ 176 lb ] , " he said .
" I would n't like to see the pig go as a pet anywhere because he could become a potentially dangerous animal . "
Rangers say the pig will be captured and taken to a piggery .

Equinox : The Sun from Solstice to Solstice

Explanation : Today is an equinox , a date when day and night are equal .
Tomorrow , and every day until the next equinox , the night will be longer than the day in Earth 's northern hemisphere , and the day will be longer than the night in Earth 's southern hemisphere .
An equinox occurs midway between the two solstices , when the days and nights are the least equal .
The picture is a composite of hourly images taken of the Sun above Bursa , Turkey on key days from solstice to equinox to solstice .
The bottom Sun band was taken during the winter solstice in 2007 December , when the Sun could not rise very high in the sky nor stay above the horizon very long .
This lack of Sun caused winter .
The top Sun band was taken during the summer solstice in 2008 June , when the Sun rose highest in the sky and stayed above the horizon for more than 12 hours .
This abundance of Sun caused summer .
The middle band was taken during the Vernal Equinox in 2008 March , but it is the same sun band that Earthlings will see today , the day of the Autumnal Equinox .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Republican U.S. vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin heard about foreign policy challenges ranging from Russia to Latin America on Tuesday in a drive to prepare her for a debate with her Democratic counterpart , Joe Biden .

Palin , who as the governor of Alaska has virtually no foreign policy expertise , had her first meetings with foreign leaders , sitting down for separate talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe , who are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly .
She also held an hour - long session with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in his Park Avenue office , talks that concentrated on Russia , Iran and China .
Russia ’s invasion of Georgia in August was a key topic .
“ It was great , ” Palin told reporters of her talks with Kissinger as she left his building .
Kissinger escorted her outside and she gave him a kiss on the cheek in parting .
Palin foreign policy adviser Stephen Biegun told reporters that Palin ’s purpose in the meetings with foreign leaders was “ to develop relationships and to listen . ”
“ These are relationships that she intuitively understands are very important for the next president and vice president of the United States , ” Biegun said .
In the sessions with Karzai and Uribe , she discussed ways to attack the underlying conditions in those countries that have given rise to the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan and FARC guerrillas in Colombia .
Karzai , in an appearance later before the Asia Society , said he found Palin to be a “ quite capable woman . ”
“ She asked the right questions on Afghanistan , ” he said .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Biegun said Palin asked a lot of questions from Kissinger about how to develop a “ cooperative relationship ” with Russia , whose invasion of U.S. ally Georgia has strained U.S. - Russian ties .
Palin ’s thin foreign policy resume has been the subject of criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans .
Until Tuesday she had never met a foreign leader .
Palin , 44 , faces an October 2 debate with Biden , the veteran senator from Delaware who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has broad knowledge of foreign policy issues .
MEETS MORE LEADERS WEDNESDAY
With Republican presidential nominee John McCain , Palin on Wednesday is to meet President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia , whose military was crushed in a short August war with Russia after he tried to retake by force a breakaway pro-Moscow region .
Kissinger credited French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who brokered the Russia - Georgia ceasefire , for his strong stance on behalf of the Georgian people during the crisis .
He told Palin he was going to give a speech “ and I ’m going to give him a lot of credit for what he did in Georgia . ”
“ Good , good , ” Palin replied .
“ And you ’ll give me more insight on that , also , huh ?
Good . ”
On Wednesday , she and McCain will also meet the leaders of Ukraine and India , and she will meet solo with Iraq ’s president .
In a sign of how concerned the McCain campaign is about having Palin exposed to unscripted moments with the news media , print reporters were barred from a picture - taking session at the beginning of the Palin - Karzai meeting in Karzai ’s hotel suite .
After they protested , reporters were allowed to attend Palin ’s photo sessions with Uribe and Kissinger .
VLADIVOSTOK , Russia ( Reuters ) -
Twenty people were killed on board a Russian nuclear submarine , the navy said on Sunday , in an accident that exposed the gap between the Kremlin ’s ambitions and its military capability .
The accident , which happened while the submarine was on sea trials in the Pacific Ocean , was the deadliest to hit Russia ’s navy since the Kursk nuclear submarine exploded beneath the Barents Sea in 2000 , killing all 118 sailors on board .
Prosecutors investigating the latest incident said they suspected the victims died after inhaling a toxic gas used as a fire suppressant when the vessel ’s fire extinguishing systems went off unexpectedly .
It was not clear why the portable breathing gear usually issued to Russian submarine crews did not save them .
A navy spokesman said the nuclear reactor was not damaged and the vessel was now in port .
“ Twenty people died , ” the Prosecutor - General ’s Office said in a statement .
“ Results of a preliminary investigation show that death occurred as a result of freon gas entering the lungs . ”
Twenty - one people were injured and taken to a military hospital in Vladivostok .
Many of those on board were civilian workers from the shipyard that built the submarine .
Vera Sanzhonova said she had driven to Bolshoi Kamen , the naval base where the submarine was moored , to seek word on her husband , a civilian technician who was on board .
“ I have not received any news .
My husband is neither on the list of those injured nor among the dead , ” she told Reuters .
“ I ’ve been driving here all the way down from Vladivostok , shedding tears and swallowing pills . ”
Asked if there was a hope her husband was alive she said : “ None at all , just despair . ”
KREMLIN AMBITIONS
President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the Defense Ministry to carry out a full inquiry , the Kremlin press service said .
The Kremlin is seeking to establish itself as a global power and is using the military to project its influence .
A flotilla of warships is heading to U.S. foe Venezuela for the biggest maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea since the Cold War ended .

But analysts say the navy in particular is still struggling with the legacy of over a decade of under - funding , despite a cash injection in the past few years .
“ This most recent incident signals that , though Russia is increasingly assertive and aggressive on the geopolitical stage , it still faces very real challenges in terms of the revitalization of its naval power , ” Stratfor , a U.S. - based consultancy , said in a commentary .
The navy said 208 people -- or nearly three times more than its usual crew -- were on board the submarine .
Seventeen of the dead were employees of Amur Ship - Building Enterprise and three were sailors , prosecutors said .

“ It is possible that some of the people lingered ( putting on their breathing apparatus ) or they did not have the apparatus at all , ” Ruslan Pukhov , director of military think tank the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technology , told the Ekho Moskvy radio station .
The navy did not identify the submarine .
Russian news agencies quoted naval sources as saying it was the Nerpa , classified by NATO as an Akula - class attack submarine .
Media reports said Russia had planned to lease the submarine to the Indian armed forces but there was no confirmation of this .
In Delhi , a navy spokesman said it had no plans to purchase any submarines from Russia at the moment .
The Fluffy Bunny Crew , a street gang , was formed years ago on upscale high - school campuses in the northeast Valley , a far cry from the low - income neighborhoods believed by many to spawn second - and third - generation gang members .
Members of the predominantly
White gang of suburban young people first attracted police attention by mugging classmates at northeast Phoenix parties .
During the past two years , they have evolved from a party crew into a street gang known for armed robberies , drug deals and violent crime , police say .
Phoenix police say the Fluffy Bunny Crew is under investigation in a Phoenix homicide and other crimes in northeast Valley communities .
Phoenix police Lt. Larry Giebelhausen said investigators at the Desert Horizon Precinct want more parents to be aware of the gang that started as a joke before escalating into a public - safety threat .
" They 're getting more and more violent , " said Giebelhausen , adding that the Fluffy Bunny Crew is now a recognized Arizona street gang .
" Parents need to know who their kids are hanging out with . "
The violent exploits of the 100 or more members have played out in upper - middle - class neighborhoods around Desert Ridge , Cave Creek and Deer Valley , police say .
The Fluffy Bunny Crew 's online presence is no different than that of most American gangs , police say .
Members boast about their exploits or " Web bang " on social - networking sites , where they challenge police and threaten rival gangs and members of the public .
Phoenix Officer Toni Gebbia started compiling information on the Fluffy Bunny Crew and documenting members two years ago after the group was connected to a number of northeast Phoenix armed robberies .
Gebbia , an investigator with Desert Horizon Precinct Neighborhood Enforcement Team , said Fluffy Bunny members appear to be average American teenagers or college students .
Few details have been released as Phoenix police investigate the homicide and robberies , Gebbia said , for fear of jeopardizing ongoing investigations .
The Fluffy Bunny Crew , she said , is known by other names to avoid being targeted by police .
The meaning behind the original name is not clear .
" While they 're a danger to the public , it seems like a lot of kid - on - kid crime , " Gebbia said .
" This group is more isolated out here .
They primarily start and stay in the northeast Valley . "
Scottsdale police began to take a closer look at the Fluffy Bunny Crew last summer after a homeowner was shot during an attempted home invasion , said Jim Hill , a gang investigator who works as part of the Arizona Department of Public Safety 's regional GIITEM task force .
GIITEM is the Gang and Immigration Intelligence Team Enforcement Mission .
Hill said gang members were wanted or have been questioned in numerous felonies in Scottsdale .
" They progressed from having their own parties to party takeovers that were home invasions , " Hill said .
" These guys are moving more and more into traditional gang crimes .
We have drug transactions on a regular basis . "
Non-Hispanic
White gangs are rare , according to the National Youth Gang Center , an organization that compiles gang - related statistics from law - enforcement agencies across the U.S .
The organization estimated that 49 percent of gang members in the U.S. were Hispanic and 34 percent were Black .
Nearly 10 percent were non-Hispanic
White , the group said .
But the " newest gang - problem areas " involve Whites more than any other racial or ethnic group , according to the organization 's Web site .
Bruce Ferrell , president of the Midwest Gang Investigators Association , said he noticed a rise in gangs similar to the Fluffy Bunny Crew in Omaha , Neb. , where he worked as a gang - intelligence investigator .
Ferrell said the presence of the Internet was leading to the rise in popularity , enabling major gangs to communicate with members in different cities , and recruit new members from lesser - known gangs .
" At - risk kids can learn the gang mentality and gang culture so much more quickly on the Internet , " said Ferrell , who shared his insights on gang use of the Internet at a recent investigators conference in Arizona .
A common misperception among parents and teachers , he said , is that suburban kids who develop their own gang or gang Web sites were little more than wannabe bangers who pose no threat to the community .
" They 're not wannabes , " Ferrell said .
" They 're gang members in training .
" The biggest problem is we undercut and minimize what these kids are about . "
Barely two weeks after Sarah Palin had been sworn in as Alaska ’s governor , in December 2006 , then - Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan ’s executive secretary got a confusing phone call from Palin ’s office :
The first gentleman would like to schedule a meeting with her boss .
“ I was not familiar with the term ‘ first gentleman , ’ or did n’t hear her correctly , so I kept asking her , ‘ Who ? ’ ” the secretary , Cassandra Byrne , testified recently .
“ And she eventually said , ‘ Todd Palin . ’ ”
The appointment was fixed , and Monegan arrived in the governor ’s office to find himself alone with the brawny , popular fisherman and snowmobile champion , who was sitting at a 12 - foot - long conference table , surrounded by stacks of documents .
One of the documents had the logo and letterhead of Monegan ’s own Department of Public Safety .
The subject , it turned out , was Alaska State Trooper Mike Wooten , who had been involved in a messy divorce with the governor ’s sister .
The Palins , Todd made clear , wanted Wooten fired for a long record of behavior they saw as inappropriate for a police officer .

“ He kept using the term ‘ we . ’
‘ We went to go talk to , we , we . ’
And so I assumed it was he and Sarah , of course , ” Monegan testified .
The meeting “ made me a little uncomfortable , ” he said .
“ We ’re having it in the governor ’s office , and he ’s not the governor .
I think he was trying to use state trappings to handle a personal issue . ”
Todd Palin would become a familiar voice for the Palin administration .
Independent legislative investigator Stephen Branchflower ’s report on Monegan ’s subsequent firing -- in part , the investigation found , because he would n’t fire Wooten -- contains an exhaustive record of Todd Palin ’s frequent and intimate presence in the day - to - day workings of his wife ’s administration .
Testimony compiled as part of the inquiry , and The Times ’ own review of e-mail logs from the administration , show that Todd Palin was a fixture in the governor ’s office , spending about half of his time there .
He attended Cabinet meetings that are supposed to be closed to the public , and was copied on a wide variety of high - level government correspondence on issues such as contract negotiations with the police officers union , Alaska Native issues and the privatization of a dairy near the Palins ’ hometown of Wasilla .

A campaign issue
The presence of the governor ’s husband at Cabinet sessions and in meetings over the state budget has become an issue in Palin ’s campaign as the Republican vice presidential nominee , raising the question of whether Todd Palin would become the kind of activist spouse that Hillary Clinton proved to be during the first years of her husband ’s administration .
“ It ’s almost as if he ’s behaving as a lobbyist , ” said Andree McLeod , an Anchorage activist who has sued to obtain the full text of government e-mails sent to the governor ’s husband .
On Friday , she won a temporary restraining order requiring the Palin administration to preserve copies of messages sent under the governor ’s private e-mail address .

“ Here he is involved in a lot of high - level meetings , and he ’s really involved in a lot of policy .
He ’s involved with mining interests ; he ’s involved with Native corporations , ” McLeod said .
“ I ’m very curious as to who he ’s representing . ”
But Todd Palin last week defended his role in the administration , arguing in written testimony to the Branchflower inquiry that he was being singled out for scrutiny because he is married to the state ’s first female governor .
“ I have heard criticism that I am too involved with my wife ’s administration .
My wife and I are very close .
We are each other ’s best friend .
I have helped her at every stage in her career the best I can , and she has helped me , ” Palin wrote .
“ Few complained when Nancy Murkowski helped [ former Gov. ]
Frank Murkowski .
Frank Murkowski even issued a memo telling everyone his wife was his closest advisor , and would travel wherever he went , ” Palin said .
“ It is unfair to apply a double standard against my wife , just because she is the state ’s first female governor . ”

But according to the legislative inquiry , the “ first gentleman ’s ” influence was so pervasive that senior staff members began to be uneasy about his constant phone calls about Wooten .
Former legislative director John Bitney , the report said , took several calls a day from Todd Palin on his cellphone .
“ Todd . . . would call me about once a day , sometimes two or three times a day , just on a myriad of things ” -- very often about Wooten -- Bitney testified .
“ You were kind of caught in the middle here ? ” Branchflower asked him .
“ Yeah , but I did n’t want to tell him I was n’t going to do anything . . .
I did n’t think that was appropriate , but I did n’t want to tell Todd that . ”

An unofficial regular
Bitney ended up losing his job .
No reason was given at the time , but Bitney believes it was connected to the fact that he had an affair with , and later married , the wife of a close friend of the Palins ’ .
A variety of top - level administration officials told Branchflower that Palin was a frequent presence in the governor ’s office , but many have said he was often there to help baby - sit the couple ’s youngest child .
Advertisement
But Atty .
Gen. Talis J. Colberg , during his interview with Branchflower , was unable to explain the presence of the governor ’s husband at Cabinet meetings .
“ If someone said that they have seen him at more than one or two Cabinet meetings , would that give you pause ? ” Branchflower asked .
“ That would give me pause , but it ’s possible , ” Colberg responded .
“ Are Cabinet meetings open to the public ? ”
Advertisement
“ Not to my knowledge . ”
“ Is Todd Palin a state employee , to your knowledge ? ”
“ No . ”
“ Do you know why he was allowed to remain there ? ”
Advertisement
“ No . ”
Taylor Griffin , a spokesman for the McCain - Palin campaign , said the answer to his involvement was simple : Palin often asked her husband , who was at home with the children , to print out government e-mails so she could read them at home at night .
“ Todd has played an appropriate and similar role to that played by the spouses of dozens of governors throughout the country , ” Griffin said .
Todd Palin received copies of e-mails dealing with a bill on parental consent for abortion ; a radio talk - show host “ hammering ” a political opponent of the governor ; discussions about the police union , which was involved in contentious contract negotiations with the state ; invitations to legislators for bill signings ; and a wide variety of e-mails about Andrew Halcro , a longtime irritant to the Palin administration who ran unsuccessfully against Palin for governor in 2006 .

Todd Palin also got a copy of the celebratory e-mail that circulated through the governor ’s office about talk - show host Rush Limbaugh .
The new Alaska governor , Limbaugh had declared , was “ a babe . ”

We 've dished about its lame , possibly coked out employees .
But the biggest issue we have with American Apparel is that the majority of the company 's designs make a normal - sized body look like two pigs fighting under a blanket .
To prove this point , Slut Machine and I took videographer Alex Goldberg to a Brooklyn AA and tried on a few aggressively unflattering outfits .

No one wants to give up a holiday , but could n't we celebrate some more honorable personality in history than Columbus .
Why does media suppress the dastardly enslaving , murdering , thieving , actions and racist character of Christopher Columbus as described by Columbus himself in his written diary / journal during his first months in America ?
Howard Zinn's in his popular A Peoples History of the United States writes :
" Arawak men and women , naked , tawny , and full of wonder , emerged from their villages onto the island 's beaches and swam out to get a closer look at the strange big boat .
When Columbus and his sailors came ashore , carrying swords , speaking oddly , the Arawaks ran to greet them , brought them food , water , gifts . "
Columbus wrote n his log :
" They ... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things , which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks ' bells .
They willingly traded everything they owned ... .
They were well - built , with good bodies and handsome features ....
They do not bear arms , and do not know them , for I showed them a sword , they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance .
They have no iron .
Their spears are made of cane ... .
They would make fine servants ....
With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want . "
Zinn :
" These Arawaks of the Bahama Islands were much like Indians on the mainland , who were remarkable ( European observers were to say again and again ) for their hospitality , their belief in sharing .
These traits did not stand out in the Europe of the Renaissance , dominated as it was by the religion of popes , the government of kings , the frenzy for money that marked Western civilization and its first messenger to the Americas , Christopher Columbus . "
Columbus wrote :
" As soon as I arrived in the Indies , on the first Island which I found , I took some of the natives by force in order that they might learn and might give me information of whatever there is in these parts . "
Zinn :
" The information that Columbus wanted most was :
Where is the gold ? "
Arawak Indians , who swam out to greet them wore tiny gold ornaments in their ears .
This was to have enormous consequences : it led Columbus to take some of them aboard ship as prisoners because he insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold .
Spain was recently unified , one of the new modern nation - states , like France , England , and Portugal .
Its population , mostly poor peasants , worked for the nobility , who were 2 percent of the population and owned 95 percent of the land .
Spain had tied itself to the Catholic Church , expelled all the Jews , driven out the Moors .
Like other states of the modern world , Spain sought gold , which was becoming the new mark of wealth , more useful than land because it could buy anything . "
On Hispaniola ,
He took more Indian prisoners and put them aboard his two remaining ships .
At one part of the island he got into a fight with Indians who refused to trade as many bows and arrows as he and his men wanted .
Two were run through with swords and bled to death .
Returning to Madrid , Columbus reported ,
" The ' Indians [ Columbus mistakenly thought he had sailed to a part of India ] are so naive and so free with their possessions that no one who has not witnessed them would believe it .
When you ask for something they have , they never say no .
To the contrary , they offer to share with anyone .... "
He concluded his report by asking for a little help from their Majesties , and in return he would bring them from his next voyage " as much gold as they need ... and as many slaves as they ask . "
The aim was clear : slaves and gold .
Upon his Columbus ' return he went from island to island in the Caribbean , taking Indians as captives .
In the year 1495 , they went on a great slave raid , rounded up fifteen hundred Arawak men , women , and children , put them in pens guarded by Spaniards and dogs , then picked the five hundred best specimens to load onto ships .
Of those five hundred , two hundred died en route .
The rest arrived alive in Spain and were put up for sale by the archdeacon of the town , who reported that , although the slaves were " naked as the day they were born , " they showed " no more embarrassment than animals . "
Columbus later wrote : " Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold . "
Zinn :
In Haiti , where he and his men imagined huge gold fields to exist , they ordered all persons fourteen years or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months .
When they brought it , they were given copper tokens to hang around their necks .
Indians found without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death .
The Indians had been given an impossible task .
The only gold around was bits of dust garnered from the streams .
So they fled , were hunted down with dogs , and were killed .
Trying to put together an army of resistance , the Arawaks faced Spaniards who had armor , muskets , swords , horses .
When the Spaniards took prisoners they hanged them or burned them to death .
Among the Arawaks , mass suicides began , with cassava poison .
Infants were killed to save them from the Spaniards .
In two years , through murder , mutilation , or suicide , half of the 250,000 Indians on Haiti were dead .

As McCain 's campaign is falling apart , so are the right - wing talking heads .
This is a sickness that runs deep .
Case in point : Republican strategist Brad Blakeman actually attacks Obama for visiting his sick grandmother in a campaign plane .
These people have no conscience .
Schuster : Brad , if it 's so important not to be spending money like a drunken sailor and I have n't asked you this but I 'm curious to hear your view of the the amount of money that was spent , 150,000 was spent on Sarah Palin 's clothes at high end stores like Saks and Neiman .
I do n't even think you shop at Saks and Neiman .
Blakeman :
No I do n't , but let me tell you this .
You know what the outrage is today ?
Is Barack Obama taking a 767 campaign plane to go visit his grandma .
Forget about the energy that is wasted , what about the hundreds of thousands of dollars to take a private trip when this guy should be humping his bags on a commercial plane or taking a smaller plane .
Taking a 767 of campaign money from people who could least afford it is more of an outrage in my opinion .
Shuster :
That is one of the most valiant tries I have ever seen in this entire debate about Sarah Palin 's clothing allowance .
Blakeman :
It 's a fact !
Shuster : Nice try , Brad .
How was he supposed to get there , walk ?
He is under tight security , remember , Brad ?
Really , they will say and do anything at this point .
They have no arguments to make so they dream up garbage like this .
America is really taking a good look at these people I think for the first time and it's ain't pretty .
Keep it up , Brad .
You only help our case against conservatives .

" Pour Some Sugar on Me " is a song by British hard rock band Def Leppard from their 1987 album Hysteria .
It reached number 2 on the U.S. Hot 100 .
It later became an MTV classic , and is generally regarded as the band 's signature song .
Although the band was nearing the end of recording sessions for Hysteria in 1986 , producer Mutt Lange felt that the album was still lacking a song that would have an appeal beyond the hard rock fans who had bought Pyromania .
That song came to him during a 5 minute coffee break .
According to the Pour Some Sugar Songfacts , the idea for this … read more

Featuring Pieces of Interviews with Brad Friedman & Thom Hartmann ...

John Carmack 's Armadillo Aerospace has won the $ 350,000 Level One X - Prize Lunar Lander Challenge .
As this video shows , their spaceship blasted off the designated area , got up to 150 feet , and then hovered for 90 seconds at that altitude to land with absolute precision on a pad 150 feet away .
And they did it twice .
Armadillo was also the first one to try the $ 1.65 million Level
Two challenge , but unfortunately crashed badly on that attempt , as the next video shows .
The second level of the challenge is even more difficult , requiring the spacecraft to hover for twice the time and then land in a simulated lunar surface full of craters and boulders .
The problem with the second level was with the fuel mix , which was altered because of a slowly moving valve .
The resulting mixture reached a temperature that was too high for the exhaust nozzle , which finally broke with obvious results .
The Lunar Lander challenge is sponsored by NASA - providing the prize money - , Northrop Grumman , and the X - Prize foundation , and it has been designed to get new private companies into the space race using new designs and technologies .
Definitely , we are getting there .

Researchers at the University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute have discovered that a drug used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorders blocks the formation of plaques that cause Alzheimer 's disease in animal models .
The team led by UBC Psychiatry Prof. Weihong Song , who is also the Jack Brown and Family Professor and Chair in Alzheimer 's Disease at UBC , found that if Valproic Acid ( VPA ) is used as a treatment in early stages of AD memory deficit is reversed .
The study , published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine , reveals that VPA works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that produces a neurotoxic protein called beta Amyloid .
In doing so , plaque formation is discontinued .
Amyloid beta-proteins are the central component of neurotoxic plaques in AD .
" We found that if we used VPA in the early stage of Alzheimer 's disease , in model mice , it reduced plaque formation and further prevented brain cell death and axon damage , " says Song , who is a Canada Research Chair in Alzheimer 's disease and Director of the Townsend Family Laboratories in UBC 's Faculty of Medicine .
" The drug also improved performance in memory tests . "
The results will help inform the design of human clinical trials because researchers now understand the mechanisms and pathology of VPA in AD animal models .
" We are very excited about these results because we now know when VPA should be administered to be most effective and we now know how VPA is working to prevent AD , " says Song , who is also a member of the Brain Research Centre at UBC and VCHRI .
" A small human clinical trial is currently underway and we expect results to be available in the next year . "
AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration and is the most common form of dementia .
The Alzheimer Society of Canada estimates that AD affects close to 300,000 Canadians and accounts for two - thirds of all cases of dementia .
By 2031 , about 750,000 Canadians will suffer from AD and related dementias .
Approximately $ 5.5 billion per year is spent caring for persons with AD and related dementias in Canada .

In order to solve global energy shortages , renewable sources of energy — such as hydrogen — that do n’t produce pollutants or greenhouse gases are needed .
Fossil fuels such as coal , oil , and natural gas are considered nonrenewable energy sources and have been accused of causing global warmingdue to their emissions of carbon dioxide .
The two research teams from ARS and NC State developed a novel way to identify strains of agricultural bacteria that produce hydrogen gas .
Using a selecting agent to grow only these bacteria , the teams identified a gene that inactivates the bacteria ’s hydrogen uptake system so that all of the hydrogen produced is released .
Because the bacterial cells cannot recycle the hydrogen , the hydrogen they produce can be captured and used as a fuel whose byproduct is water and heat .
If successful , the invention holds the promise of hydrogen as a source for use in fuel cell technology .
Fuel cell energy works by combining hydrogen and oxygen in order to produce electricity and water , which are considered more efficient , quiet , and pollution - free in comparison with other power sources .
Currently , one of the biggest problems of what has become known as the future “ hydrogen economy ” is the cost of producing hydrogen – which currently requires large amounts of electricity produced either from polluting coal / oil / gas power plants or expensive solar / wind power plants .
The new biological method for producing hydrogen could cut costs considerably and potentially solve another problem with hydrogen – transporting it .
There is currently a huge hurdle in transporting and storing the fuel , as well as building a distribution network as far - reaching as today ’s system of gas stations .
If the new process will indeed be cheaper and simple enough to replace today ’s huge gas and coal centralized production facilities it might be possible to distribute the production of hydrogen into many smaller facilities closer to gas stations or possibly in the gas stations themselves , although this could still be a long way down the line .
TFOT recently reported on a different new way for creating hydrogen developed by researchers from MIT .
The method is rooted in a new catalyst material , based on cobalt phosphate rather than expensive metals like platinum , which can be used for hydrolysis in water .
TFOT also reported on a new electrically - generated fuel cell developed by scientists from Monash University .
More about the new hydrogen - producing bacteria can be found on the North Carolina University website .

In Palin ’s own state , where she still has a favorable rating , they are not blinded to the facts of who would be the best choice for President .
I have to say when I read this , I was a little surprised .
I figured they would not endorse either candidate .
Here is an excerpt of their endorsement for Barack Obama as President .
Sen . Barack Obama , the Democratic nominee , brings far more promise to the office .
In a time of grave economic crisis , he displays thoughtful analysis , enlists wise counsel and operates with a cool , steady hand .
The same can not be said of Sen. McCain .
Since his early acknowledgement that economic policy is not his strong suit , Sen.
McCain has stumbled and fumbled badly in dealing with the accelerating crisis as it emerged .
He declared that “ the fundamentals of our economy are strong ” at 9 a.m. one day and by 11 a.m. was describing an economy in crisis .
He is both a longtime advocate of less market regulation and a supporter of the huge taxpayer - funded Wall Street bailout .
His behavior in this crisis — erratic is a kind description — shows him to be ill - equipped to lead the essential effort of reining in a runaway financial system and setting an anxious nation on course to economic recovery .
Sen .
Obama warned regulators and the nation 19 months ago that the subprime lending crisis was a disaster in the making .
Sen. McCain backed tighter rules for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , but did n’t do much to advance that legislation .
Of the two candidates , Sen .
Obama better understands the mortgage meltdown ’s root causes and has the judgment and intelligence to shape a solution , as well as the leadership to rally the country behind it .
It is easy to look at Sen. Obama and see a return to the smart , bipartisan economic policies of the last Democratic administration in Washington , which left the country with the momentum of growth and a budget surplus that President George Bush has squandered .
On the most important issue of the day , Sen. Obama is a clear choice .
Now this is interesting .
Hillcrest Labs is suing Nintendo , trying to create an import ban on the Wii .
They claim that Nintendo is infringing on a number of their patents relating to the Wiimote and the on - screen menu system on the Wii .
The whole thing does n't make a lot of sense to us , as we were under the impression that both Nintendo and Hillcrest Labs licensed their tech from Gyration .
We 're looking into this now , but I 'm going to go out on a limb and say that an import ban on the Wii is pretty unlikely .
Hit the jump for Hillcrest 's full press release .
Update : After the jump , a clarification on what Hillcrest is suing over from Gyration .
The Hillcrest patents referenced in the action against Nintendo are secondary patents relating to user interface details and compensation techniques , whereas Movea 's Gyration patents are central to the usage model , i.e. using sensors to detect human motion and control graphics on a screen .
Gyration was the pioneer in developing fundamental motion sensing technologies and IP , and was a core enabler to Nintendo and Hillcrest , both of whom had entered license arrangements with Gyration to enable their products .
PRESS RELEASE : Hillcrest Labs Issues Statement About Legal Action Against Nintendo and the Wii
August 20 , 2008 – Rockville , MD – Hillcrest Labs issued an official statement about legal action that the company has taken today against Nintendo ( R ) for patent infringement .
The statement is as follows :
Hillcrest Labs has filed a complaint for patent infringement with the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) in Washington , D.C. , and a separate patent infringement suit in the U.S. District Court in Maryland against Nintendo ( R ) related to the Wii( TM ) video game system .
Hillcrest 's patents at issue are U.S. Patent Nos.
7,158,118 , 7,262,760 , and 7,414,611 , which relate to a handheld three - dimensional pointing device , and U.S. Patent No. 7,139,983 , which relates to a navigation interface display system that graphically organizes content for display on a television .
Since 2001 , Hillcrest Labs has pioneered technology that allows consumers to interact with digital media on television using motion - control and pointing techniques .
The company holds 29 patents in this area worldwide , and has filled for more than 100 related patents .
Leading consumer electronics companies , not all of whom have been disclosed publicly , have already licensed Hillcrest 's technology for use in their products .
While Hillcrest Labs has a great deal of respect for Nintendo and the Wii , Hillcrest Labs believes that Nintendo is in clear violation of its patents and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights .
Given the current status of the filings , the company will not disclose any additional details about the matter at this time .
Information about Hillcrest Labs and its products are available at www.hillcrestlabs.com
Focus Design sent us a video of their self balancing unicycle ( looks like they ’re taking on Focus Features too ) .
The electric machine moves at 8MPH and lasts 1.5 hrs on a single charge .
It only weighs 24.6 lbs .
They say that new riders only need about 2hrs. practice .
They ’re building ten units to start for $ 1500 each .
Electric unicycles are nothing new to our community .
We ’ve long been fans of [ Trevor Blackwell ] ’s electric unicycle .
[ Trevor ] spent several months learning how to ride a regular unicycle before he could properly debug the electric version .
There are several other designs out there :
The Einrand - Fahrzeug has a wide wheel to make balancing easier .
The eniCycle includes a steering mechanism .
The Uniquecycle has a brushless motor in hub for a compact design .
We did a roundup back in July that covers these plus many other motorized unicycle concepts .
Attempts to succinctly explain banker bailout scam that Obama helped push through met with mindless bleating
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Thursday , October 9 , 2008
Police kicked protester Benjamin Harms off Belmont University campus this week before the presidential debate for the crime of “ trespassing ” as hundreds of mindless Obama supporters cheered the outright violation of free speech .
The protagonist ’s attempts to succinctly explain the banker bailout scam – which Barack Obama has fully supported – in clear and concise terms was met with the mindless bleating of “ Obama , Obama , Obama ” – perfectly underscoring the vacuum of Obama ’s empty platitudes of “ change ” and the deluded idolatry of his supporters .
“ Obama and McCain are the same , ” chanted another demonstrator as police and security thugs moved in to ensure that anyone that dared use their freedom of speech to communicate a real message was hastily ejected , while the Obama cult members were left completely alone to continue their pointless rhetoric .
“ Kick him out , kick him out , ” chanted the Obama -ites as the group tried to explain to the police the meaning of the first amendment .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ I am now being escorted away by police from the scene because I do n’t have a right to free speech , ” said Harms , to which the Obama crowd responded with whoops , cries and hollers of “ yeeeeahhhh ” in celebration of the fact that cops were crushing the first amendment .
“ I have a right to speak my mind just like all of you do , ” added Harms .
“ They do n’t like what I ’m saying so I ’m being escorted by the police off of the campus . ”
Police threatened to arrest Harms and refused to tell him where the property line of the campus was .
They were also unable to tell him why the use of a bullhorn was illegal , enforcing a claimed law of which they had no knowledge .

Via the Minnesota Independent we learn that a McCain / Palin supporter compared Obama to mass murderer Charles Manson during a rally for First Dude Todd Palin and Republican Senator Norm Coleman ( who is about to lose to Al Franken ) in Minnesota .
And , as usual , no one at the McCain / Palin rally did a thing about it .
It ’s also interesting that the person even got into the rally with his own sign – these kind of things are often stopped at the door , since the campaign does n’t want errant messages – or worse , protesters , raising signs in front of the candidates .
Yet a sign comparing Obama to a mass murderer miraculously slips through .
Maybe the Secret Service was busy making sandwiches for Todd .
McCain / Palin :
Hate we can believe in .

\" McCain 's handling of the financial crisis made me feel nervous , \ " Pressler said .
Former GOP senator , vet backs Obama
Former Sen. Larry Pressler ( R - S.D. ) , who was the first Vietnam veteran to serve in the United States Senate , is the latest Republican to back Sen.
Barack Obama 's presidential campaign , Politico learned Sunday .
Pressler , who said that in addition to casting an absentee ballot for Obama he 'd donated $ 500 to the Illinois senator 's campaign , cited the Democrat 's response to the financial crisis as the primary reason for his decision .

" I just got the feeling that Obama will be able to handle this financial crisis better , and I like his financial team of [ former Treasury Secretary Robert ] Rubin and [ former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul ]
Volcker better , " he said .
By contrast , John McCain's " handling of the financial crisis made me feel nervous . "
The former senator added that he hoped the next president would help place restraints on executive pay , and said : " I do n't think [ McCain ] will take action in that area , or he 's as likely to . "
Pressler , who said that he had never voted for a Democrat for president before , added , " I feel really badly .
I just hate to go against someone I served with in the Senate .
I voted and I got it mailed and I dropped it in the mailbox , and it tore at me to do that . "
Currently an adjunct professor at Baruch College in New York , Pressler served in the Senate from 1979 through 1997 , and prior to that spent two terms in the House of Representatives .
During the 104th Congress , from 1995 to 1997 , Pressler chaired the Senate Commerce Committee .
When Pressler was defeated for reelection in 1996 , McCain took over his chairmanship .
After leaving office , Pressler formed a legal and lobbying firm , The Pressler Group , and in 2002 unsuccessfully sought election to South Dakota 's sole seat in the House of Representatives .
He joins a growing list of Republicans who have thrown their support to Obama in recent days .
Last Sunday former Secretary of State Colin Powell endorsed Obama on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
On Thursday Obama picked up the support of former Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson , who was joined on Friday by former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld .
Like some of Obama 's other Republican supporters , Pressler said he had concerns about his party 's fiscal policy , particularly the war in Iraq , that went beyond the presidential campaign .
" We have to be a moderate party .
We can't be for all these foreign military adventures .
We have to stop spending so much money .
My God , the deficit is so high ! " he said .
" The Republican Party I knew in the 1970s is just all gone . "
Despite his support for Obama , however , Pressler emphasized that he intended to stay in the GOP and described himself as a " moderate conservative . "
" I 'm not leaving the Republican Party .
We 're going to reform it , " he said , but added : " In the general election , if you have disagreements , you should not vote the party line . "
In the early days of developing Gmail and Contacts for Android , the team set a clear goal to make this problem disappear once and for all .
We envisioned a world where your various computers and phones would always be in sync without needing discipline , USB cables , Bluetooth , and synchronization software .
It occurred to us that the best way to synchronize these various pieces of information is to let the device do it on its own while you 're not looking , so you never have to think about it .
Once you 've logged into your Google account on an Android - powered phone it automatically synchronizes all your contacts and Gmail information so everything is always available , regardless of where you are and whether you have cell coverage .
Since all your contacts and mail are backed up to the network , they will still be available if you get a new phone or just have multiple phones .
You will also find that Gmail on Android preserves all the nice functionality that you are used to on your desktop , such as starring , archiving , assigning and reading labels , and the conversation view that makes reading email on Gmail so pleasant .
You can also configure which labels you want to synchronize to your phone and how much data you want there .
More than ever , you are in control of the data that you want to find on your phone .
Gmail even syncs your drafts so you can begin a message on the phone and send it from the web , or vice versa .
With push email , Gmail offers real - time , two - way synchronization of your email , notifying you of new e-mails even when you 're using another application .
Of course , your contacts list in Gmail also syncs to the phone , and any changes you make on the phone sync to your contacts list on the web .
Because this synchronization works in both directions , you can add a contact on the web and almost immediately use it to call the person from your phone .
Once you get used to automatic synchronization , you 'll wonder how you could ever live without it .
We certainly became addicted to it , and we hope you will too !
FOR SALE : BUY MY DUMP !
Buy My Dump :
By now I suppose you all have seen my Houston investment rental property that had been trashed .
Yes it 's doing the rounds on various blogs , news sites and forums .
Well I have to sell it .
Basically I was underinsured and my insurer will NOT pay for the tenant damage .
I 'm pretty jaded by the whole thing but I want to just walk away from it .
Problem is it has a mortgage over it so I need it sold .
A savvy Houston area investor could pick up a bargain .
The place should be worth around $ 80,000 any figure that would clear my mortgage could very well land you this place .
Serious bidders can email me at buymydump@gmail.com for an address , plans , rental figures and repair estimates .
My highest current bidder is sitting at $ 38,900 .
If you have n't keep abreast of the news the short version of the story is that I had a resident who had an outstanding balance for over a month and no one could get ahold of her .
The Bookkeeper went inside after so many tries to leave a note and this is what she found :
The pictures do NO justice .
There is suppose to be 2 cats living here but I can't find them ( I think they 're dead somewhere inside the apartment - I contacted the SPCA ) .
The place REEKS to say the least , I gagged non stop .
If you 're good with a scrubbing brush this could be bargain of the century for you ...

WWF 's report , Climate Change : Faster , stronger , sooner , has updated all the scientific data and concluded that global warming is accelerating far beyond the IPCC 's forecasts .
As an example it says the first ' tipping point ' may have already been reached in the Arctic , where sea ice is disappearing up to 30 years ahead of IPCC predictions and may be gone completely within five years - something that has n't occurred for a million years .
The findings include :
* Global sea level rise could more than double from the IPCC 's estimate of 0.59 m by the end of the century .
* Natural carbon sinks , such as forests and oceans , are losing their ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere faster than expected .

Sumgayit used to be the New Jersey of the Soviet Union — the town was the nation ’s center of chemical and pesticide production .
Today , it is still feeling the aftereffects of years of untreated , mercury - contaminated waste dumped directly into streams feeding the Caspian Sea .
Cancer rates in the city of 275,000 are sky - high .

The WWF is learning all about how non-linear systems work : Nature , and complex non-linear systems , work like the mouse you use on your desktop : the farther you move it , the faster it accelerates .
This accomodates big changes in position without forcing you to move slooowly , constantly for too long , because that 's less likely to happen .
The downside is that the environment hippies of the 1970s were right -- we were screwing it up then and if we did n't stop , the problem was going to get out of hand .
We 're inheriting a past mess and since we have n't turned around in time , we now have at least another decade of making it worse before we get our act together .
Of course , the environment hippies were wrong in that they thought " education " and some songs about peace strummed on acoustic guitars could convince people .
That 's not so .
You need to force the average person to face reality , because they enjoy avoiding reality as much as possible .
When you look at humanity from that view , you can see how persecuting drug users is a result of our hypocrisy .
Our entire society is stoned on illusion .

" POLITICS IS THE ART OF CONTROLLING YOUR ENVIRONMENT "
That is one of the key things I have learned in these years , and I learned it the hard way .
Anybody who thinks that " it does n't matter who 's President " has never been Drafted and sent off to fight and die in a vicious , stupid War on the other side of the World - or been beaten and gassed by Police for trespassing on public property - or been hounded by the IRS for purely political reasons - or locked up in the Cook County Jail with a broken nose and no phone access and twelve perverts wanting to stomp your ass in the shower .
That is when it matters who is President or Governor or Police Chief .
That is when you will wish you had voted .
Hunter S. Thompson
Hunter S. Thompson is no longer with us ( except in spirit ) but here is a letter from his wife :
Dear John McCain ,
This is a sincere Thank
You note for being the man to put my heart , soul , time and money back into politics .
My beloved late husband , Hunter S. Thompson , gave me the political bug years ago .
And to honor his spirit , I was asked to blog for several exciting websites during the Denver Convention .
I accepted , but because I was a Hillary supporter , I was going through the motions with thinly veiled apathy and losing steam fast .
My story is not uncommon .
I was one of the millions who were hoping for that Clinton / ( Obama ) ticket .
With that failure , it got worse as the months went by .
I got depressed , and even sick , my self - esteem tanked , and interest in either party was slipping away .
Then whamo !
With your VP pick , the Obama / Biden ticket is not just the better of the two parties , it is a bright and shining star next to the arrogant and stupid Sarah Palin you put in our faces .
So thank you John McCain for picking a woman who represents the worst - case scenario : A cute wild buffoon who is proud to be dumb .
You put a twisted mirror up to all of us who strive to work hard , keep learning and become better women .
Because of your choice for VP , I have arranged for some time away from my studies at Columbia University to fly home to Colorado during election week and volunteer for Obama .
So thank you for putting the spring back in my step , my money , time and spirit to Obama & Biden that was not there before .
Thank you again , you beautiful little man .
Most Sincerely ,
Anita Thompson

War And Peace
" War is not a polite recreation but the vilest thing in life , and we ought to understand that and not play at war .
Our attitude towards the fearful necessity of war ought to be stern and serious .
It boils down to this : we should have done with humbug , and let war be war and not a game .
Otherwise , war is a favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous … there is no profession held in higher esteem than the military .
And what is war ?
What makes for success in warfare ?
What are the morals of the military world ?
The aim and end of war is ... murder ; the weapons employed in war are espionage , treachery and the encouragement of treachery , the ruining of a country , the plundering and robbing of its inhabitants for the maintenance of the army , and trickery and lying , which all appear under the heading of the art of war .
The military world is characterized by the absence of freedom — in other words , a rigorous discipline — enforced inactivity , ignorance , cruelty , debauchery , and drunkenness .
And yet this is the highest caste in society , respected by all .
Every monarch in the world , except the Emperor of China , wears a military uniform , and bestows the greatest rewards on the man who kills the greatest number of his fellow creatures .
Tens of thousands of men meet — as they will tomorrow — to massacre one another : to kill and maim , and then they will offer up thanksgiving services for having slain such vast numbers ( they even exaggerate the number ) and proclaim a victory , supposing that the more men they have slaughtered the more credit to them .
Think of God looking down and listening to them ! ” cried Prince Andrei in a shrill , piercing voice . " - Leo Tolstoy ( 1828-1910 ) : " An example of Tolstoy 's view that history proceeds inexorably to its own ends with mankind appearing as an incidental instrument of the historial process .
Whilst so tendentious an approach to the philosophy of history is difficult to accept today , as one of the themes of Tolstoy 's greatest novel , it adds depth and perspective to a narrative that intersperses historical , social and personal interaction . "
- The Reading Group . ( A New Translation : From Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky , the best - selling , award - winning translators of Anna Karenina and The Brothers Karamazov , 2007 ) .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A new space race is officially under way , and this one should have the sci - fi geeks salivating .
Lift to space :
This is a NASA interpretation of what a space elevator may look like .
The project is a " space elevator , " and some experts now believe that the concept is well within the bounds of possibility -- maybe even within our lifetimes .
A conference discussing developments in space elevator concepts is being held in Japan in November , and hundreds of engineers and scientists from Asia , Europe and the Americas are working to design the only lift that will take you directly to the one hundred - thousandth floor .
Despite these developments , you could be excused for thinking it all sounds a little far - fetched .
Indeed , if successfully built , the space elevator would be an unprecedented feat of human engineering .
A cable anchored to the Earth 's surface , reaching tens of thousands of kilometers into space , balanced with a counterweight attached at the other end is the basic design for the elevator .
It is thought that inertia -- the physics theory stating that matter retains its velocity along a straight line so long as it is not acted upon by an external force -- will cause the cable to stay stretched taut , allowing the elevator to sit in geostationary orbit .
The cable would extend into the sky , eventually reaching a satellite docking station orbiting in space .
Engineers hope the elevator will transport people and objects into space , and there have even been suggestions that it could be used to dispose of nuclear waste .
Another proposed idea is to use the elevator to place solar panels in space to provide power for homes on Earth .
If it sounds like the stuff of fiction , maybe that 's because it once was .
In 1979 , Arthur C. Clarke 's novel " The Fountains of Paradise " brought the idea of a space elevator to a mass audience .
Charles Sheffield 's " The Web Between the Worlds " also featured the building of a space elevator .
But , jump out of the storybooks and fast - forward nearly three decades , and Japanese scientists at the Japan Space Elevator Association are working seriously on the space - elevator project .
Association spokesman Akira Tsuchida said his organization was working with U.S. - based Spaceward Foundation and a European organization based in Luxembourg to develop an elevator design .
The Liftport Group in the U.S. is also working on developing a design , and in total it's believed that more than 300 scientists and engineers are engaged in such work around the globe .
NASA is holding a $ 4 million Space Elevator Challenge to encourage designs for a successful space elevator .
Tsuchida said the technology driving the race to build the first space elevator is the quickly developing material carbon nanotube .
It is lightweight and has a tensile strength 180 times stronger than that of a steel cable .
Currently , it is the only material with the potential to be strong enough to use to manufacture elevator cable , according to Tsuchida .
" At present we have a tether which is made of carbon nanotube , and has one - third or one - quarter of the strength required to make a space elevator .
We expect that we will have strong enough cable in the 2020s or 2030s , " Tsuchida said .
He said the most likely method of powering the elevator would be through the carbon nanotube cable .
So , what are the major logistical issues keeping the space elevator from being anything more than a dream at present ?
Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics and astronautics Professor Jeff Hoffman said that designing the carbon nanotube appeared to be the biggest obstacle .
" We are now on the verge of having material that has the strength to span the 30,000 km ... but we do n't have the ability to make long cable out of the carbon nanotubes at the moment . " he said .
" Although I 'm confident that within a reasonable amount of time we will be able to do this . "
Tsuchida said that one of the biggest challenges will be acquiring funding to move the projects forward .
At present , there is no financial backing for the space elevator project , and all of the Japanese group 's 100 - plus members maintain other jobs to earn a living .
" Because we do n't have a material which has enough strength to construct space elevator yet , it is difficult to change people 's mind so they believe that it can be real , " he said .
Hoffman feels that international dialogue needs to be encouaraged on the issue .
He said a number of legal considerations also would have to be taken into account .
" This is not something one nation or one company can do .
There needs to be a worldwide approach , " he said .
Other difficulties for space - elevator projects include how to build the base for the elevator , how to design it and where to set up the operation .
Tsuchida said some possible locations for an elevator include the South China Sea , western Australia and the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean .
He said all of those locations usually avoided typhoons , which could pose a threat to the safety of an elevator .
" As the base of space elevator will be located on geosynchronous orbit , [ the ] space elevator ground station should be located near the equator , " he said .
Although the Japanese association has set a time frame of the 2030s to get a space elevator under construction -- and developments are moving quickly -- Hoffman acknowledges that it could be a little further away than that .
" I do n't know if it 's going to be in our lifetime or if it 's 100 or 200 years away , but it 's near enough that we can contemplate how it will work . "
Building a space elevator is a matter of when , not if , said Hoffman , who believes that it will herald a major new period in human history .
" It will be revolutionary for human technology , and not just for space travel .
That 's why so many people are pursuing it , " he said .
" This is what it will take to turn humans into a space - bearing species . "
With Intrepid on track to hit the wires today I thought I ’d blog a little on the process we followed in designing the new user switcher , presence manager and session management experience , and lessons learned along the way .
Ted has been blogging about the work he did , and it ’s been mentioned in a couple of different forums ( briefly earning the memorable title “ the new hotness ” ) , but since it ’s one of the first pieces of work to go through the user experience design process within Canonical I thought it would be interesting to write it up .
Here is a screenshot of the work itself in action :
In one of the first user experience sessions , we looked in more detail at the way people “ stop working ” .
We thought it interesting to try and group those actions together in a way which would feel natural to users .
We have already done some work in Ubuntu around this – for a long time we have had a button in the top - right corner of the panel which brought up a system modal dialog that gave you the usual “ end your session ” options of logout , restart , shutdown , hibernate , suspend and switch user .
That patch was always a bit controversial and had not been accepted upstream , so we looked at ways to solve the problem differently .
We decided to use the top - right location , because it ’s one of the key places in the screen that ’s quick and easy to get to ( you can throw your mouse into a corner of the screen very easily and accurately ) and because there was a strong precedent in the old Ubuntu logout button .
One key insight was that we wanted to make “ switching user ” less an exercise in guesswork and more direct – we wanted to let people switch directly to the specific user they were interested in rather than have an intermediate step where they login as that other user .
So we started with the Fast User Switcher applet , or FUSA , as a base fr the design .
Another key idea that emerged was that we wanted to integrate the “ presence setting ” into the same menu , because “ going offline ” or “ I ’m busy ” are similar state - of - mind - and - work decisions to “ log me off the system ” or “ shut down ” .
Menu order
We discussed at length the right order for the menu items .
On the one hand , putting the “ other users ” at the top of the menu would mean that all the user names – yours and the ones you can switch to – would appear “ in the same place ” at the top of the menu .
On the other , we strongly felt that things that would be used more casually and more easily should be at the top .
In the end we settled on putting the presence management options at the top ( Available , Away , Busy , Offline ) .
Right next to those ( in the same set ) we put the “ Lock screen ” option , because it feels like a presence setting more than a session management setting – you are saying “ Away ” more than anything else .
Ted did a lot of work to make the presence menu elements work with both Pidgin and Empathy because there was some uncertainty as to which would be used by default in the release .
Since it all uses dbus , it should be straightforward to make it work with KDE IM clients too .
We then put the user switching options – including the Guest Session which is a cool new feature in Intrepid that as been widely blogged ( check out the YouTube demo ) and which uses AppArmor to enforce security .
And finally , the session termination options – log out , suspend , hibernate , restart and shutdown are at the bottom of the menu , because you ’re only ever likely to use them once in a session , by definition !
Styling
The design of the menu is deliberately clean .
We use very simple colours and shapes for the presence indicators , and replicate those colours and shapes in the actual GNOME panel so that you can see at a glance what your current presence setting is .
Ted had to jump through some hoops , I think , to get the presence icons in the menu to line up with the current - presence - status indicator in the panel applet , but it worked out quite nicely .
There ’s some additional work to tighten up the layout which did n’t make it in time for the release but which might come in as a stable release update ( SRU ) or in Jaunty .
We decided not to put icons into the menu for each of the different statuses .
Our design ethic is to aim for cleaner , less cluttered layouts with fewer icons and better choice of text .
A couple of people have said that the menu looks “ sparse ” or “ bare ” but I think it sets the right direction and we ’ll be continuing with this approach as we touch other parts of the system .
Upstream
This work was discussed at UDS in Prague with a number of members of the GNOME community .
I was also very glad to see that there ’s a lot of support for a tighter , simpler panel at the GNOME hackfest , an idea that we ’ve championed .
The FUSA applet itself is going through a bit of a transformation upstream as it ’s been merged into the new GDM codebase and the old code – on which our work is based – is more or less EOL’d .
But we ’ll figure out how to update this work for Jaunty and hopefully it will be easier to get it upstreamed at that point .
In Jaunty , we ’ll likely do some more work on the GNOME panel , building on the GNOME user experience discussions .
There was a lot of discussion about locking down the panel more tightly , which we may pursue .
Integration into Ubuntu
We realised rather late in the Ubuntu cycle that we had n’t thought much about packaging .
The Ubuntu team had kindly offered to help package and integrate the applet but we definitely learned the value of getting the packaging done earlier rather than later .
We had the applet in a PPA for testing between developers fairly early , but we underestimated the difference between that and actual integration into the release .
The Ubuntu team rallied to the cause and helped to smooth the upgrade process for new users , so that we can try to get everyone onto the same footing when they start out with Intrepid whether as a new install or an upgrade .
There are some challenges there , because the panel is so customisable , and we had to think hard about how we could ensure there was a consistent experience for something as important as logging out or shutting down while at the same time trying not to stomp on the preferences of folks who have customised their panels .
Similarly , we were concerned that people who run different versions of Ubuntu , or different distributions entirely , with the same home directory , would have problems if those other OS ’s did n’t have the same version of FUSA – we were n’t really able to address that satisfactorily .
We also realised ( DOH ! ) that we had n’t thought all the way through the process of integration , because we had n’t figured out what to do with the old System menu options .
It turned out that those were in a state of flux , with the Ubuntu folks having to choose between the current GNOME default which everyone said would change , the patches for the likely NEXT GNOME approach , and the old Ubuntu approach .
Ted whipped up some patches to make the GNOME panel more dynamic with its menus , so that we could remove the System menu logout options when people have the same menu in the FUSA applet , but that landed too late for inclusion into Intrepid final .
All in all , I think it ’s a neat piece of work and hope other distro ’s find it useful too .
It ’s just a teaser of the work we plan to do around the desktop experience .
I ’m looking forward to seeing everyone at UDS Jaunty in Mountain View in December , when we can talk about the next round !
Thanks and well done to Ted , Martin , Scott , Sebastien and everyone else who helped to make this a reality .
Well done to Team Ubuntu ( thousands of people across Ubuntu , Debian and upstreams ) who make the magic in 8.10 possible .
Happy Release Day everyone !

Cynicism may now represent one of the greatest threats to democracy , according to a research project at the London School of Economics .
Findings indicate that people are more cynical about politics than anything else , and that cynicism is a more important factor than distrust when it comes to whether people vote .
Those who think politicians are liars will probably continue to vote , whereas those who are contemptuous of them are less likely to do so .
But what if politicians could measure the impact that their buzz words were having on the cynicism levels of different groups ?
The Syntony Research Team at the LSE is trying to develop a ' Cyndex ' - a cynicism index .
It would measure the emotional responses of cynics according to their age , race , religion , gender and socio-economic backgrounds - from mild frustration to violent anger .
' All the evidence shows people are getting more cynical with the messages we get from government , from businesses , from the media , ' said Charles Liasides of Syntony , who is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Social Psychology .
' People are deserting some TV stations because they are becoming cynical about reality TV insulting their intelligence ; they turn off from some adverts because they are patronising ; and all those wonderful gaffes we have had with the government recently - the U - turns , the backfiring policies - are having an effect .
But is it good for democracy ? '
In a pilot survey linked to the Royal Society of Arts ( involving questionnaires completed by 1,100 fellows ) , Syntony 's conclusion is that cynicism is infecting the very fabric of our society .
Top of the list was politics , for which the average level of cynicism registered was 51 per cent , compared with 31 per cent for general cynicism of life , 30 per cent for business cynicism and 37 per cent for media cynicism .
Men were more cynical about their fellow human beings than women ( 32 per cent compared with 27 per cent ) .
' It seems women are more idealistic , ' said Dr Alain Samson of the Syntony team .
Those who regularly read newspapers were significantly less cynical about the media ( 34 per cent against 40 per cent ) .
' But our most important finding suggested that people who did not vote were more likely to be cynical about the government than distrusting , ' said Samson .
' Usually , people focus on distrust , or lack of confidence , as the most important factor when it comes to disengagement .
But in fact , it is cynicism . '
Samson said the indications were that this was because politicians have a public face , making them more prone to criticism than faceless businessmen .
The consequences of such cynicism are vast , the team believes .
It can result in people disengaging from politics , turning away from major media , or boycotting products .
It could also prompt people to join pressure groups or , in more extreme cases , to resort to direct action or violence .
' This has wide implications in the cohesiveness of society , ' said Liasides .
The team is planning a nationwide sample to create the Cyndex , which it intends to develop commercially .
' We believe it will be valuable for all communicators to help them be more credible with the public , ' said Liasides .

Obama : McCain ‘ stoking anger , division ’
Barack Obama attacked John McCain on Friday for launching a “ barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks ” as the stock market tumbled .
“ Even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time , even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes , my opponent ’s campaign announced last week that they plan to ‘ turn the page ’ on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead , ” Obama said during a speech in Chillicothe , Ohio .

“ So in the last couple of days , we ’ve seen a barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks , and I ’m sure we ’ll see much more over the next 25 days .
We know what ’s coming .
We know what they ’re going to do . ”
“ I think that folks are looking for something different , ” Obama continued .
“ It ’s easy to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division .
But that ’s not what we need right now in the United States .
“ The times are too serious .
The challenges are too great .
The American people are n’t looking for someone who can divide this country — they ’re looking for someone who will lead it .
We ’re in a serious crisis — now , more than ever , it is time to put country ahead of politics . ”
Conservative Leader Stephen Harper speaks at a campaign rally in Quebec City on Sunday .
( Tom Hanson / Canadian Press ) Conservative Leader Stephen Harper is predicting that there will be a minority government after Canadians vote Oct. 14 .
Speaking in French in Saint - Tite , Que. , he said Sunday that " the next government will probably be a minority , Liberal or Conservative . "
Saint - Tite is about 150 kilometres southwest of Quebec City .
Harper has not been in the habit of forecasting the election outcome , although he said " we believe in all likelihood it will be a minority " when he called the vote on Sept.
7 .
Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion is still pushing for victory .
" I 'm working to win , " he said Sunday , even though polls suggest the Liberals are lagging the Tories by nine percentage points .
In his comments Sunday , Harper said whatever the outcome of the election , the Bloc Québécois will be outside of the government .
" They will only be spectators , " and have no plan to deal with the economic problems .
Harper has been campaigning in Quebec , where the Conservatives had hoped to make big gains at the BQ 's expense .
But the Bloc support has been growing , polls indicate .
When the election was called , the Conservatives and Liberals both held 11 Quebec seats , and the Bloc 48 .
The NDP held one , Independents two and two were vacant .
Meanwhile , the Conservatives have 35 per cent of national support , while the Liberals are at 26 per cent , the Canadian Press / Harris - Decima poll suggested Sunday .
The NDP sit at 18 per cent , the Bloc 10 per cent and the Green party nine , the running four - day poll indicated .
The poll was based on 1,284 interviews done between Wednesday and Saturday .
It has a margin of error of 2.7 per cent , 19 times out of 20 .
While focusing on the Bloc , Harper warned that a Liberal minority government would produce deficits and a recession .
Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion during an interview in Toronto on Sunday .
( ( Adrian Wyld / Canadian Press ) )
Dion has repeatedly denied that .
He charged on Sunday that Harper has falsely painted the Liberals ' Green Shift plan — which features a tax on carbon fuels and offsetting individual and business tax cuts — as a tax grab .
" Stephen Harper built his campaign on a lie .
He must lose on this lie , " Dion said .
Campaigning in Ontario , the Liberal leader urged voters not to split the anti-Conservative vote by supporting NDP or the Green Party candidates .
" The only job a vote for Jack Layton is going to save is a Stephen Harper 's job , " Dion said , referring to the NDP leader 's emphasis on heading off more industrial job losses .

Ever the cautious candidate , Barack Obama warned his supporters at a fundraising breakfast today not to get too cocky about their lead over John McCain , but due to his lead , Obama does have a chance to extend his campaign into more red states , to potentially give himself a mandate and extend the Democratic congressional majority .
According to The Caucus , Obama said , “ For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky or think this is all set , I just have two words for you : New Hampshire .
I ’ve been in these positions before when we were favored , and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked .
That ’s another good lesson that Hillary Clinton taught me , so we want to make sure that we are closing strong , running through the tape . ”
Here is why people who think that the Obama campaign is going to get complacent and set on their lead are wrong .
Unlike in the primaries , there are no super delegates that Obama can count on to put him over the top in the general election .
The strategy for closing a fall campaign is different from that of a Democratic primary .
In the primaries , the campaign knew before the public did , how many uncommitted super delegates that they had waiting in the wings .
They have no such luxury or cushion in this election , so they must keep running hard .
Advertisements
The bigger concern from the campaign is that if Obama ’s lead continues to grow , some of his supporters might assume that he has this locked up , and that they do n’t need his vote .
As the race stands today , the only way that McCain can win is if the Obama people do n’t vote , but from what I have observed over almost two years , Obama supporters are a different breed .
They are passionate and dedicated to Obama to a degree that has n’t been seen in this party since both the Kennedy brothers in the 1960s .
Since Obama has the lead , it is possible for him to get more aggressive and extend his campaign into red states like West Virginia , and Georgia , because McCain does n’t have the resources to defend all of the states that President Bush carried in 2004 .
Every additional dime that McCain has to spend in a West Virginia , Georgia , or Kentucky is less money that he can spend in Ohio , Florida , and Virginia .
Obama has a chance to capture a mandate , and have some big coattails for his fellow Democratic candidates .
His campaign would be foolish to pass up this opportunity .
The unit was set up to fight organised crime and corruption
South Africa 's parliament has voted to abolish the country 's independent crime - fighting unit , the Scorpions .
The body has been behind several high - profile political investigations , including a corruption probe against ruling party leader Jacob Zuma .
Last month a judge dismissed charges against Mr Zuma , who is expected to become president after polls next year .
Opposition parties accuse the governing African National Congress of waging a political campaign against the unit .
The BBC's Mpho Lakaje in Johannesburg says Thursday 's parliamentary debate and vote had been seen as formalities , as the ANC had already spelled out plans to disband the Scorpions .
They followed a series of failed attempts by opposition parties and members of the public to save the body .
The ANC - dominated parliament voted by a margin of about four to one to disband the Scorpions and create a new force of criminal investigators that will be integrated into the police .
Power struggle
The Scorpions unit has shaken South Africa 's political landscape in the last few years , probing and arresting several prominent politicians , our correspondent says .
Among those pursued were ANC former chief whip Tony Yengeni and Winnie Madikizela - Mandela , the former wife of ex-President Nelson Mandela .
The Scorpions also led an investigation against suspended police commissioner Jacki Selebi , who faces trial next year .
But observers say the unit , formally known as the Directorate of Special Operations , pushed its luck too far when it pressed corruption charges Mr Zuma .
That case was at the centre of a power struggle between Mr Zuma and Thabo Mbeki , with Mr Zuma 's allies accusing Mr Mbeki 's supporters of using the Scorpions to stop his rival gaining power .
Mr Mbeki stepped down as president after Judge Chris Nicholson suggested that he had interfered in the case against Mr Zuma .
The former president has strongly denied this and has appealed against the judge 's ruling .
Literally .
A woman in West Virginia and a man in Wisconsin have quit their jobs at call centers rather than read a script that included the message : " Hello , I 'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers , whose organization bombed the US Capitol , the Pentagon , a judge 's home , and killed Americans .
" The Wisconsinite had read negative scripts about Obama before as part of the job , but drew the line at that script , choosing joblessness and a clean conscience over being a purveyor of incendiary lies .
Not much of a choice , that .
Features of Cecil
Cecil has multimethods , which generalize singly dispatched receiver - oriented languages to allow dynamic dispatching on any subset of a method 's arguments .
Dispatched arguments are treated symmetrically , unlike Common Lisp where earlier arguments are more important than later arguments .
Cecil has a classless object model .
Objects have methods attached directly to them , without needing a separate class to hold their format & behavior .
One - of - a - kind objects with their own behavior ( e.g. true , false , nil , and other enumerated constants ) are easy to define .
Cecil has first - class lexically - nested anonymous functions , a la Smalltalk blocks , Scheme lambdas , and ML functions .
Function values are heavily used in Cecil code for user - defined control structures , iterators , exception handlers , typecase - like constructs , and more .
Cecil has both immutable ( the default ) and mutable versions of local , global , and instance variables ( called fields in Cecil ) .
Immutable variables support clearer , more understandable code .
Initial values of variables are specified at the point of declaration , except that for fields initial values can be specified when the containing object is created .
Cecil accesses both fields ( instance variables ) and methods via dynamically dispatched messages .
Each field declaration implicitly generates a get and ( if mutable ) a set accessor method providing the sole means for reading and writing the field 's contents .
By accessing fields and methods uniformly , implementors can easily change between storing and computing some value w/o modifying clients , and methods can be overridden with fields and vice - versa .
Cecil has predicate objects , which allow virtual " subclasses " to be defined carrying specialized methods that override their parent 's methods whenever some boolean predicate over the object is true .
In this way , inheritance can be used to model time - varying and / or state - dependent properties of objects just like permanent properties of objects .
Cecil supports multiple inheritance .
The inheritance graph is treated as a partial order , inducing a corresponding partial order on methods attached to those objects .
This design results in the simple rule that a method attached to a child overrides any method attached to an ancestor .
Cecil 's object declarations do not " contain " their method , field , or even parent declarations .
Instead , all these attributes of objects are declared externally , allowing clients to add methods , fields , and even parents of existing objects separately from their original definition .
Cecil supports a polymorphic static type system .
Types and subtyping is semantically distinct and independent from from objects and inheritance , although syntactic sugar makes declaration of parallel subtyping and inheritance easy .
Any declaration can be polymorphic over some set of type parameters , and constraints can be placed on these type parameters to limit the set of legal instantiating types to those that satisfy needed properties ;
Cecil 's constraint - based bounds subsume ( F - ) bounded polymorphism and where clauses .
Cecil 's type declarations are optional .
Where type declarations are present , static type checking ensures that the type declarations are internally consistent .
Where omitted , dynamic type checking guarantees run-time type safety .
History of Cecil
The initial Cecil design effort was started in early 1991 .
The first Cecil interpreter and typechecker implementation , written in Self , was done over 1992 and 1993 .
In 1993 , a translator from Cecil to C was added to the interpreter , making the first Cecil compiler .
In 1994 , a larger Cecil optimizing compiler , this time written in Cecil , was begun ; this compiler eventually evolved into the Vortex optimizing compiler .

David Tennant has said will quit as Doctor Who at the end of next year .
By the time his last shows are screened he will have played the Doctor , to popular and critical acclaim , in the BBC series for four years .
Last night , Tennant , 37 , won an award for his popular portrayal of the Time Lord at the National Television Awards .
He told the ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall by video link : " I love this show and , if I do n't take a deep breath now , I never will and you will be wheeling me out of the Tardis in my bath chair . "
Tennant was unable to collect the outstanding drama performance award in person because he is currently starring as Hamlet in a RSC production at Stratford - upon - Avon .

Hey , look !
I got a postcard from Sarah Palin :
Governed from the center , eh ?
Let ’s see what the other side of the card says :
Whu - ?
Stem - cell research ?
Climate change ?
Bill Ayers for the proles , stem - cell research for the college - educated suburbs ?
Whatever works , I guess .
My zip code is telling the world too much about me .
I turned off “ Marketplace ” last night when they got to the news of GM and Ford ’s stock price ( $ 4.76 and $ 2.08 , respectively ) .
There ’s a downside to living in a company town , and this is it .
I ’m thinking I ’m going to restrict myself to the digest items for a while , lest I fall down hyperventilating .
I took the dog for a meander — “ walk ” does n’t really describe our excursions these days — and thought about other scary times in history .
I was Kate ’s age in 1968 , a year that must have seemed at least as perilous as this one , and I do n’t recall my parents doing anything more than discussing current events calmly .
I was driving with my mother one night in May 1970 when the radio broadcast was interrupted by an emergency bulletin directing all off - duty Columbus police officers to report to their local station house immediately .
The student riots that followed the invasion of Cambodia had begun , and while Ohio saw blood spilled and lives lost by the end of it , all my mother said about the muster of police was , “ It must be something on campus . ”
So that ’s the role model , right there : Calm acknowledgment , sans freak - out .
I made a mental list of everything I could do to get through this , and came up with :
1 ) Make soup .
2) Exercise .
3 ) Drink lots of water .
4 ) Keep the house looking nice .
5 ) Take good notes .
So we had a curried butternut squash / apple soup — recipe in the Junior League cookbook , which gives the lie to the old myth about WASPs not appreciating non-salt - and - pepper flavors — and got our vitamin A .
It ’s probably just as well I ’m concentrating on soup , because I no longer understand the world of finance ( if I ever did ) .
Ford and GM have plants all over the world , production lines , product that ’s still selling ( badly , but still selling ) .
I do n’t understand how the market could value them at a fraction of what you could get even if you pulled the plug on the whole business and parted out each and every factory .
This is what a lack of liquidity does , I guess .
Ca n’t get a loan , ca n’t get a car .
Even Toyota sales are down by a third .
How this shakes out remains to be seen — that ’s a phrase they teach you on the first day of j - school — but I do n’t imagine it ’ll be pretty .
It ’s hard to believe I ’m going to spend the next two weekends making a no - budget zombie movie .
On the other hand , why not make a zombie movie ?
What else should I do ?

Press Releases
National Bank Acquires All the Deposits of Meridian Bank , Eldred , Illinois
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 10 , 2008 LaJuan Williams - Dickerson
Office : 202-898-3876
Lwilliams-dickerson@fdic.gov
Meridian Bank , Eldred , Illinois , was closed today by the Illinois Department of Financial Professional Regulation - Division of Banking , and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) was named receiver .
To protect the depositors , the FDIC approved the assumption of all the deposits of Meridian Bank by National Bank , Hillsboro , Illinois .
All depositors of Meridian Bank , including any with deposits in excess of the FDIC 's insurance limits , will automatically become depositors of National Bank , and they will continue to have uninterrupted access to their money .
Depositors will still be insured with the new institution .
Therefore , there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain deposit insurance .
The failed bank 's four offices in Altamont , Carlyle , and Eldred will reopen for normal hours on Saturday , October 11th and the Alton office will reopen Tuesday , October 14th , as branches of National Bank .
Over the weekend , customers of Meridian Bank can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards .
Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed .
Loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual .
Meridian Bank had total assets of $ 39.18 million in total assets and $ 36.88 million in total deposits as of September 25 , 2008 .
National Bank will purchase approximately $ 7.55 million of Meridian 's assets , and did not pay the FDIC a premium for the right to assume all of the failed bank 's deposits .
The FDIC will retain the remaining assets for later disposition .
Customers with questions about today 's transaction or who would like more information about the failure of Meridian Bank can visit the FDIC's Web site at http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/meridian.html, or call the FDIC toll - free at 1-877-894-4713 , today until 9 p.m. ; Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ; Sunday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. ; and thereafter from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m .
All times are Central Time .
The FDIC estimates that the cost to its Deposit Insurance Fund will be between $ 13 million and $ 14.5 million .
National Banks ' acquisition of all deposits was the " least costly " resolution for the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund compared to all alternatives .
Meridian Bank is the first bank to be closed in Illinois since Universal FSB , Chicago , Illinois on June 27 , 2002 .
This year a total of fifteen FDIC - insured institutions have been closed .
# # #
Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 to restore public confidence in the nation 's banking system .
The FDIC insures deposits at the nation 's 8,451 banks and savings associations and it promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions by identifying , monitoring and addressing risks to which they are exposed .
The FDIC receives no federal tax dollars – insured financial institutions fund its operations .
FDIC press releases and other information are available on the Internet at www.fdic.gov, by subscription electronically ( go to www.fdic.gov/about/subscriptions/index.html) and may also be obtained through the FDIC's Public Information Center ( 877-275-3342 or 703-562-2200 ) .

Lately , I have had the chance to dabble a bit in OpenSolaris while working on a particular server installation .
OpenSolaris , as you may know , is the recently open - sourced version of Sun 's Solaris OS , which in turn is one of the many flavours of Unix .
Before I talk a bit about my experience with it , let 's consider where OpenSolaris came from .
And why should we care about it anyway ?
The attention is on GNU / Linux as a server OS , and maybe Windows .
But traditional Unix OSs - and with that also Solaris - seem to have lost much of their relevance and mind - share .
How did that come to pass anyway ?
Good times for Sun :
The dot - com boom
Let 's take a walk back in time .
Around 8 to 10 years or so should do .
Oh , will you just look at that ?
We are at the height of the dot - com boom !
And would n't you know it , Sun and its Sparc - based servers are truly ubiquitous .
Any self - respecting , VC - funds - burning startup is running their business on Sun 's machines , and even many developers ' desktops come from the “ Stanford University Network ” .
I know , I was there in the Silicon Valley when it all happened ( “ Can you say ' gold - rush ' ?
Yeah , baby ! ” ) and I worked on one of those Sparc / Solaris workstations .
Our server room – like that of so many other startups at that time – was stacked full with Sparc / Solaris servers , and our customers were mostly running them as well .
Sun at that time was indeed “ the dot in .com ” , as they claimed in their advertising .
The crash and Sun 's declining fortune
Alas , we all know it came to a sad end .
With the collapse of the dot - com bubble , Sun was hit hard : Suddenly the excessive flow of VC funds dried up and many of those new , high - flying Sun customers crash landed .
Not only did they not buy more Sun gear .
No , it was worse :
All those failed dot - coms were liquidated , with their assets being cheaply sold off to whoever cared to pick them up .
Usually , the only assets they had were their office furniture and their computers .
So , at the time of the dot - com bust , not only did lucrative Solaris license sales dry up and support contract sales collapsed as well .
No , the Sparc servers themselves could n't be sold to new customers , since whoever needed a practically new Sparc server was able to pick one up for $ 2.50 on eBay .
Yes , Sun was hit hard .
Just take a look at what happened to their stock price during that time :
Sure , Sun had invented Java , which was all the rage back then and which still is very popular .
But then and now they have failed completely to monetize on it .
Sparc servers really were and are Sun 's cash cow .
Everything else they did was just aimed at assisting in the sale of more Sparc servers .
Why bother with Solaris now ?
But time had moved on .
Customers were migrating to Windows , or to the strengthening GNU / Linux .
In fact , GNU / Linux made the strongest inroads in the market at the expense of the various Unix variants .
Why pay for a commercial , closed - source Unix , if you can get the same sort of look and feel for free and in an open environment ?
Exactly .
It took Sun many years , but they eventually realised that the only way to remain relevant is to make their products more widely available .
To paraphrase a famous line from a certain movie : Build it ( or better : Distribute it ! ) and they ( support contracts and such ) will come .
After years of soul searching and agonising , Sun finally decided to open - source Java and even Solaris itself .
Thus , I get back to the start of this article : OpenSolaris .
Sun still has the closed - source Solaris , which they probably use for their remaining enterprise customers , but for everyone else who wants to try a ' real '
Unix ( not some upstart lookalike ) , well , there is OpenSolaris .
Or course , Sun hopes to keep their name relevant , to convert initial OpenSolaris users to their enterprise Solaris , or at least support contracts .
Sun has also seen the sign of the times and has made ( Open ) Solaris work really well on x86 platforms .
However , they still like to claim that it actually would run much better on their Sparc architecture .
So , it is hoping that eventually some people who start out with OpenSolaris on x86 will move on to Solaris on Sparc .
Technical pros-and - cons of this aside , the jury is still out on whether Sun will manage to stop the bleeding and regain at least some of its former glory with that strategy .
Recently , the director of the Linux foundation has laid into Sun , claiming that OpenSolaris is essentially irrelevant .
The strongest argument is that OpenSolaris competes with GNU / Linux on basically just a few small features ( dtrace , some system management and cool virtualization features ( Zones ) , and of course ZFS , which some people would say is certainly much more than a ' small ' feature ) , but is sorely lacking in community and wider support .
He has a point .
Sun , of course , claims that it has signed up more than 160,000 developers to its OpenSolaris community .
Well , signing up is not the same as contributing , but some people certainly see the opening of Solaris as a very important and promising point in Sun 's history .
All criticism from the Linux camp aside , there are still plenty of people who swear by Solaris :
It is fast , they claim .
For large server installations , it has better maintainability , they claim .
It has a reputation of being rock solid .
All of these are certainly very interesting points , as well .
Working with OpenSolaris
One of my customers is using OpenSolaris , which gave me the chance now to dust off some of my long forgotten Solaris ' skills ' and take another look at it on the server .
Honestly , when you are used to GNU / Linux and log into an OpenSolaris machine for the first time you initially really do n't see a difference .
Most of the commands you know are there and will work as usual .
That is of course no coincidence , since the GNU project set out to specifically provide a familiar environment , re-implementing all the tools and commands people were used to on Unix .
A few minor differences on the command line
Sure , there are some peculiar differences : ifconfig on Solaris requires the ' - a ' option to show all interfaces , while on GNU / Linux it will do so without any options .
To see the running processes , you need to type ps - ef rather than ps auxw .
You use snoop rather than tcpdump .
The tail command can only watch one file at a time .
And so on .
It 's not huge , but just something to get used to .
The GNU developer 's tool - chain may also have to be installed first , since it does n't seem to be there by default .
I was a bit weary , because I needed to install a couple of applications that are common and easily available for GNU / Linux , but are not typically associated with Solaris .
Specifically , the nginx web server , squid proxy , django web development framework and the vsftpd FTP server .
Fortunately , all of them had been ported to Solaris before , so I just needed to unpack their TAR ball , run the configure script – where available – and then make .
Only in the case of vsftpd did I have to track down an issue .
I could see that there was specific code and conditional code paths for Solaris in the vsftpd source , but nevertheless , it did n't compile without complaint for me .
In the end , I only had to comment out a single line , though .
Phew !
We have to remember that GNU / Linux and ( Open ) Solaris are two completely different operating systems , even though at first glance they look and feel the same .
So , I was glad that the developers had gone through most of the work for me already .
In general , I would recommend strongly to check whether the particular application one wishes to run has been ported to Solaris before .
If so , you are probably good .
If not , I know from my previous work experience that it can take quite an effort to get the more esoteric system calls translated in an efficient manner .
The Service Management Facility
What I really liked about Solaris is the Service Management Facility ( SMF ) .
I 'm sure there are probably comparable tools available for GNU / Linux , but in the case of Solaris , it is all built in by default and very well integrated .
The SMF provides a very nice and powerful way to define the services that should run in the system , which other services they depend on , and so on .
SMF will resolve those dependencies and arrange the services to start up in the proper order after reboot .
If some services fail , dependent services are not started either and the whole thing is logged .
The administrator can then resolve the problem .
Once given the ' clear ' by the administrator , the problematic service and all the services that depend on it are started in one swoop .
SMF also continuously monitors the state of the running service processes .
Should they be killed for some reason , SMF will restart them immediately .
That is very neat : I can kill nginx , for example , and faster than I can check with ps - ef , it is back up and running again .
You define dependencies , startup , restart and shutdown options and scripts for your services in an XML file , called a ' manifest ' .
You then tell SMF about the new manifest , and from that moment on , you can use commands like svcadm restart|enable |disable , etc .
The svcs -x command shows you all the services that may have had problems starting up , with hints to the relevant log messages that explain the issues .
Once fixed , you just say svcadm clear and it should all be up and running .
Very nice , indeed .
None of that is probably very exciting for experience Solaris admins , but for me it certainly was .
OpenSolaris is really neat in that way .
I hope that it has a good future , since competition is always good for the end user .
There are some good ideas in Solaris , which can inspire GNU / Linux as well .
In the meantime , I hope that open source projects continue to be ported to OpenSolaris , since as usual , the availability of software really makes or breaks the success of a platform .

In a startling new take on data center engineering , Google has filed a patent for a " water - based data center " that uses the ocean to provide power and cooling .
The patent also confirms Google 's development of a container - based data center , describing " crane - removable modules " to power the computing platforms .
The floating data centers would be located 3 to 7 miles from shore , in 50 to 70 meters of water .
If perfected , this approach could be used to build 40 megawatt data centers that do n't require real estate or property taxes .
The patent application , which was filed in Feb. 2007 , was noticed by TheODP , who posted details to Slashdot .
That suggests that Google 's plans for floating data centers may predate a similar proposal from San Francisco startup International Data Security ( IDS ) to build data centers on cargo ships .
The Google design incoporates the Pelamis Wave Energy Converter units , which use the motion of ocean surface waves to create electricity and can be combined to form " wave farms . "
The largest existing project uses seven Pelamis units to generate about 5 megawatts of power .
Diagrams included with Google 's patent application indicate the company plans to combine 40 or more Pelamis units to produce 40 megawatts of power .
The patent documents describe a cooling system based on sea-powered pumps and seawater - to - freshwater heat exchangers .
Google previously was granted a patent for a portable data center inside a shipping container , which the company began developing in 2003 , well before Sun Microsystems and other competitors began unveiling products based on the " data center in a box " concept .
One of the inventors listed on the Google patent , William Whitted , later said the portable data center project had been discontinued .
Back in April we asked Google about the status of its container research .
" We do a lot to make our infrastructure scalable and cost efficient , but at this time we have nothing to announce regarding this specific technology , ” a company spokesperson said .
But the patent filing describes the use of shipping containers in the sea - going data center :
The data centers may be employed with the computers inside standard shipping containers to make them more portable ( e.g. , capable of being hauled to the boat or by a truck ) .
The data centers may be constructed modularly in areas having low costs , and may be transported to locations needing communications support relatively quickly .
The data centers may be offloaded to areas where a more permanent presence is needed , and may also be connected to the motion - powered machines after such offloading , freeing the ship to deploy to another area .
Also , data centers , when in the form of shipping containers , may be quickly traded out when technology changes .
Modularization also makes maintenance simpler ; hardware that is corroded or worn out from the harsh salt water environment can be easily replaced with fresh hardware by swapping containers
Google says the data center containers could be stacked two or more high , so that each data barge could hold " 12 or more " containers .
The patent filing says the data centers would be located 3 to 7 miles offshore , which may signal that Google 's interest in undersea cables goes beyond connectivity between land - based data centers .
While the floating data centers would include power and cooling , they would still require industrial strength connectivity .
Earlier this year Google said it would partner with five other companies in building an undersea communications cable across the Pacific , which could provide high - speed connectivity to new Google data centers in Asia .
Google said it would use signaling mechanisms such as strobing lights , flags , and horns to alert other ships of the existence and location of its data centers .
The offshore location also raises interesting questions about jurisdiction , and which laws would govern the handling of any consumer data managed from the floating data centers .
U.S. territorial waters typically extend 12 nautical miles , but other nations ' claims range from 3 miles ( Singapore ) to 200 miles .
The offshore location also differentiates Google 's plans from those announced by IDS , which plans to build up to 50 data centers on de-commissioned cargo ships moored at piers in major cities .

In California , ' Gay Rights ' Now Superior to Everyone Else 's Rights
Schwarzenegger signs Democrats ' homosexual - bisexual - transsexual bills
Contact : Agency Contact , 877-405-4005 , Campaign for Children and Families
SACRAMENTO , California , October 6 / Christian Newswire / -- Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed three bills squashing moral values and religious freedom .
By elevating the homosexual - bisexual - transsexual agenda above the rights of everyone else , Schwarzenegger has confirmed his legacy is being the most anti-family Republican governor in California history .
" There is no gay gene , but religious freedom is a God - given right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution .
So it 's wrong and unfair to create new laws which make homosexual - bisexual - transsexual ' rights ' superior to everyone else 's rights , " said Randy Thomasson , president of Campaign for Children and Families , a leading West Coast family issues organization .
" The words ' discrimination , ' ' harassment , ' and ' tolerance ' have been redefined and are actually resulting in reverse discrimination and intolerance against people with moral values , " said Thomasson .
" Under these new laws , foster parents , nurses , doctors , health insurance plans , city and county commissions , and court - appointed children 's advocates must abandon their moral , social or financial values at the alter of the homosexual - bisexual - transsexual agenda .
This crate load of homosexual - bisexual - transsexual laws embodies the same intolerant spirit of the recent California Supreme Court ruling that trampled the religious freedom of doctors at the behest of homosexual ' rights . ' "
Among the " LGBT " bills signed by Arnold Schwarzenegger , after being approved by the Democrat - controlled Legislature , are :
• AB 3015 forces foster parents to train foster children to support homosexuality , bisexuality and transsexuality .
The 2000 law upon which AB 3015 is based resulted in homosexual , bisexual and transsexual activism on school campuses from " LGBT " students and teachers .
AB 3015 will do the same for foster children , many of whom have already been emotionally damaged by sexual abuse and neglect .
Under the new law , morally - minded foster parents will be trained to teach children in their homes what they themselves believe is a lie .
In addition , the bill author says AB 3015 will " ensure that foster youth and their caregivers are knowledgeable about how to report " foster parents and public school teachers who cannot and will not support homosexuality , bisexuality or transsexuality .
In other words , under AB 3015 , positive and healthy pro-family values on sexual behavior and believing in natural gender can be reported as " harassment . "

So , I recently ran into one of those situations where a customer complains that his MySQL database is slow , and “ it worked great until about two weeks ago ” .
The first thing I look at in these situations is not the queries or any code , but the indexes .
Once I determined that the indexes were almost nonsensical , I had a look at the queries themselves , which proved that the indexes were , in fact , nonsensical .
Running the queries as written in the code , from a mysql shell , with EXPLAIN , I was able to further confirm that the indexes ( most of them , anyway ) were never used .
Easy right ?
Just reindex the table !
NOTE : I ’m going to skip the talk about all of the database design issues on this gig and just go straight to solving the immediate problem at hand .
Just know that I had nothing to do with the design .
But , supposing this table has 15 million rows and is running on a machine with 2GB of RAM and only a single ( well , mirrored ) drive ?
It will take forever to reindex that table , and the machine ca n’t be made completely unavailable at any time , either by driving the load up so high that the Linux OOM killer reaps the mysql process , or by putting a lock on the table for , oh , 3 days or so 🙂
The solution is to create a brand new table , which I ’ll call “ good ” using the “ SHOW CREATE TABLE ” output from the bad table , which I ’ll call “ bad ” .
I do this right in the shell , actually .
I run “ SHOW CREATE TABLE bad ” , cut and paste the output , remove the part that defines the indexes , rename the table to “ good ” , and bam !
New , empty table .
Of course , you still have to define your new indexes , so run whatever statements are needed to do that .
You might even want to populate it with some test data ( say , 10000 rows from the bad table ) to test your new indexes are being used as expected ( or that they can be by altering the query and getting back the same results … but faster ) .
Once done , it ’s time to start copying rows from bad to good .
I ’ve written a shell script to help with that part .
It ’s designed to run on a Linux host running MySQL .
The variables at the top of the script are pretty self - explanatory , except to note that there are separate NEWDB and OLDDB variables in case your new table also lives in a new database .
The INCREMENT is the number of rows you want to copy over at a time .
If you set INCREMENT to 1000 , it ’ll copy 1000 rows , check the load average , and if it ’s under MAXLOAD , it ’ll copy over another 1000 rows .
It also keeps track of the number of rows in each database as it goes , since writes are still happening on the bad table while this is going on .
So here ’s my nibbler script , in shell .
I would ’ve written it in Python , but it was n’t my machine , and I could n’t install the python mysql module :-/

A Long Island teacher has mysteriously vanished – and in a bizarre twist , her dad spotted her abandoned car along the side of a highway as he drove a school bus full of kids .
Leah Walsh , 29 , of Bethpage , who teaches autistic kids in Glen Cove , was reported missing after the school called her mother to say she never showed up Monday , cops said .
Around noon , her father , Howard Hirschel , spotted her black Ford Focus with the front left tire flat on the side of the Seaford - Oyster Bay Expressway in Bethpage .
Hirschel pulled over his bus and called Walsh ’s husband , who came to the scene and notified cops .
Leah ’s purse was in a nearby ditch and her book bag was on the front seat , cops said .
Her husband , William , told reporters , “ You can have my cars , you can have everything .
I just want my wife back . ”
Police said William is a mortgage broker ; Leah ’s mom , Mattie Hirschel , said her son - in - law had recently lost his job but had gotten a new one .
William said his last contact with his wife was a text message she sent at 6:25 a.m. that read , “ Have a great day .
Love bunches muaw , ” the last word a texting shorthand for a “ kiss ” sound .
A state Department of Transportation truck stuck a tag on Leah ’s car at 6:30 a.m. , saying it was disabled and abandoned .
The missing teacher ’s close friend , Lucas Bean , said his pal had been having marital problems and she and her husband had a big fight Saturday night .
Walsh said of his wife of three years , “ I believe she had a flat and I think she got out to look at it and was getting back in the car to call me .
She ’s just got to be somewhere . ”
He was reinterviewed today by Nassau County cops .
Leah ’s frantic mom , Mattie , begged , “ Just bring her back .
She ’s my baby . ”
Bean described his friend as “ one of the most upbeat people ” who ’s passionate about her job teaching special - needs kids .
“ Think about the person it takes to do something like that , ” he said .
“ She loves what she ’s doing – she ’s found her path . ”
Her husband said that on Monday , she left their home early to get to the School for Language Development to work on her lesson plans .

The Self - Balancing Electric Unicycle : Silly or Innovative ?
October 20th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Are you an electric vehicle - loving balance guru ?
Then you should get in line for Focus Design ’s self - balancing unicycle ( SBU ) .
The unicycle can blaze down the street at 8.5 MPH , and can go for 12 miles on a single charge .
At 25 pounds , it can easily be carried to a charging station .
The unicycle rider controls the vehicle ’s speed by leaning forwards or backwards to go faster or stop .
There are no pedals — only foot rests .
According to Focus Designs , even balance - challenged riders may fare reasonably well on the SBU .
The vehicle stays upright using “ accelerometers and gyroscopes with sophisticated balancing algorithms ” .
Riders will need to stay at least partially upright by themselves , though — the company says that the SBU is about half as difficult to ride as a regular unicycle .
The SBU is coming out in limited production next month for $ 1,500 .
If you ’re interested , start boning up on your interview skills now — the first ten buyers will be chosen on the basis of order date and the quality of a personal interview .
Will the release of the SBU spawn an electric unicycle trend ?
Probably not .
But it ’s definitely a fun addition to the rapidly growing canon of electric vehicles .

His advantage could be as narrow as 7 points , depending on likely voters
Gallup Daily : Obama Ahead , 51 % to 41 %
His advantage could be as narrow as 7 points , depending on likely voters
PRINCETON , NJ -- Voter preferences in the presidential race continue to be generally auspicious for Barack Obama 's election prospects only three weeks ahead of the eve of Election Day .
Obama leads McCain by 10 percentage points , 51 % to 41 % , among all registered voters , according to Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Oct. 10 - 12 .
The percentage of registered voters favoring Obama has been 50 % , 51 % , or 52 % in each Gallup Poll Daily tracking report since Oct.
4 . Support for McCain has been a steady 41 % to 43 % across the same time period .
Thus , although the gap between the two candidates has varied from seven to 11 points in recent days , voter preferences have , in fact , been quite stable .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Likely Voters
Among typical " likely voters " -- the subset of registered voters who appear most likely to vote on Election Day according to their current voting intentions and past voting behavior -- Obama 's lead is a slightly narrower seven points , 51 % to 44 % .
This assumes that about 60 % of the voting age population will vote , slightly higher than the 55 % who turned out in 2004 .
Among a more broadly defined likely voter group that only takes into account current voting intentions -- not past voting behavior -- Obama 's lead is the same 10 points as among all registered voters , 53 % to 43 % .
This group represents approximately two - thirds of the general public , a significantly higher proportion than has turned out in any recent election .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 10 - 12 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,783 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on this sample of 2,133 likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention and past voting behavior ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on this sample of 2,284 likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Conservationists often speak of restoring landscapes as erasing the “ hand of man . ”
But sometimes the job of undoing decades of human manipulation requires wielding an even heavier hand .
It took eight years of planning , of which two were spent bulldozing and excavating to knock down levees and redirect creeks , to re-create the “ naturalness ” of the Giacomini Wetlands , one of the most extensive restoration projects of its kind undertaken by the National Park Service .
The project comes more than 60 years after one of the largest estuary systems on the Central Coast was obliterated to make way for dairy cattle providing milk and butter during World War II .
Today , after the last levee is breached and high high tide is restored to most of the 560 acres of former pasture , the Giacomini Wetlands at Point Reyes National Seashore will begin to perform their natural function : restoring the health of Tomales Bay .

The new estuary system is integral to a 200 - square - mile watershed , where it filters pollutants .
It also serves as a habitat and nursery for a menagerie of marine life and birds .
As some water has seeped in during the last months , park rangers have reported rare sightings : rays and leopard sharks gliding into the shallows of the former pasture .
“ We could n’t get it back to what it looked like in 1860 , and that ’s OK , ” said park service hydrologist Brannon Ketcham , standing atop an 8 - foot - high berm that was about to be scraped away .
“ The idea is to return the natural hydraulics , and the habitat will come back .
In a year , no one will know we did anything . ”
The new wetlands are at the south end of Tomales Bay , a shallow 12 - mile - long finger slicing inland from the Pacific , much of it over the San Andreas fault .
The wetlands were first squeezed at the turn of the century when a levee was built at the south end to allow a road .
Then the system was blocked off from the bay and drained in 1946 to accommodate west Marin County ’s burgeoning dairy industry .

Over the years , farmers created a network of channels and ditches that redirected and managed the freshwater flow .
Without the flushing action from the exchange of freshwater and saltwater , the bay stagnated , became heavy with sediment and ran afoul of the federal Clean Water Act .
Much of the wildlife abandoned the site .
After the restoration began in 2000 , cattle were gradually phased out of the property .
By the beginning of last year , they were mostly gone .
Park biologists were amazed to discover an immediate bounty of rare species : Tidewater goby , small fish thought to be eliminated from the area , were found in Tomasini Creek , on the property ’s east side .
Elsewhere , biologists found western pond turtles and California red-legged frogs .
To accommodate the protected species , project planners created separate refuges .

Birds already throng to Point Reyes , which is on the Pacific Flyway .
Roughly 45 % of North American bird species can be found in the area .
But now in the wetlands , rarely seen shorebirds such as greater yellowlegs and the red-necked phalarope have made themselves at home , as have clapper rails , California black rails and northern harriers , also known as marsh hawks .
Otters and seals are becoming more common in Lagunitas Creek , a popular destination for kayakers .
White sturgeon , steelhead , chinook and coho salmon thrive in the waters .
In fact , the state ’s largest recorded coho , 22 pounds , was pulled from Lagunitas Creek in 1959 .
About 15 % of California ’s coho are found in this watershed .
Restoring the wetlands will do more than help fish , said Lorraine Parsons , a wetlands ecologist with the park service .
The project should help protect a small group of homes at the south end of the property that are regularly flooded .
“ When they leveed this , they took out about 50 % of the Tomales Bay watershed , ” she said .
“ It no longer served as a filtering tool for the water here ; it did n’t help in flood control . ”

The project was jump - started by $ 4 million from a California Department of Transportation mitigation fund that allowed the park service to acquire the land from the Giacomini family in 2000 .
After that , the Point Reyes National Seashore Assn. , a nonprofit group that funds park projects , scrounged to find $ 6 million to finance the complicated restoration .
“ It ’s funny .
You ’d think that it would be easy to take down levees , ” Parsons said .
“ Just come in and mow them down .
But actually it has to be given a lot of thought . ”
After barns , fences and irrigation material were removed , heavy - equipment operators followed precisely drawn plans to shave and reshape the berms over months .
Lighter equipment with special treads was used in boggy areas , and many of the trucks removing soil operated on bio - diesel fuel .
Most federal projects of this size can be expected to draw opposition , but the Giacomini Wetlands effort has garnered surprisingly wide approval , in part because the public will have access to much of the site once it ’s fully restored .

The park , established in 1962 , draws about 2.2 million visitors a year , many from the San Francisco Bay Area 40 miles to the south .
“ Park service restoration projects often take place in wilderness or in backcountry , ” Parsons said .
“ No one sees them .
This is a project that is happening in front of everyone .
“ People are excited .
A local woman called me and we talked about the project .
She said her whole family was following it .
Her 3 - year - old was beginning to identify the yellow excavator and the orange one , and the bulldozers .
Meanwhile , her 17 - year - old was outside with a spotting scope identifying different birds .
That ’s pretty cool . ”

Finance experts say that having Washington take stakes in United States banks now  like government interventions in the past  would be a promising move to address an economic emergency .
The plan by the Treasury Department , they say , could supply banks with sorely needed capital and help restore confidence in financial markets .
Elsewhere , government bank - investment programs are routinely called nationalization programs .
But that is not likely in the United States , where nationalization is a word to avoid , given the aversion to anything that hints of socialism .
In past times of war and national emergency , Washington has not hesitated .
In 1917 , the government seized the railroads to make sure goods , armaments and troops moved smoothly in the interests of national defense during World War I .
After the war ended , bondholders and stockholders were compensated and railways were returned to private ownership in 1920 .
During World War II , Washington seized dozens of companies , including railroads , coal mines and , briefly , the Montgomery Ward department store chain .
In 1952 , President Harry S. Truman seized 88 steel mills across the country , asserting that unyielding owners were determined to provoke an industrywide strike that would cripple the Korean War effort .
That nationalization did not last long , though , because the Supreme Court ruled the move an unconstitutional abuse of presidential power .
In banking , the government took an 80 percent stake in the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust in 1984 .
Continental Illinois failed in part because of bad oil - patch loans in Oklahoma and Texas .
As the nation ’s seventh - largest bank , Continental Illinois was deemed “ too big to fail ” by federal regulators , who feared wider turmoil in the financial markets .
In the end , the government lost an estimated $ 1 billion on the bad loans it bought as part of the takeover of Continental , which eventually became part of Bank of America .
The nearest precedent for the Treasury plan , finance experts say , are the investments made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in the 1930s .
The agency , established in 1932 , not only made loans to distressed banks , but also bought stock in 6,000 banks , at a cost of $ 1.3 billion , said Mr. Sylla , the N.Y.U. economist .
A similar effort these days , in proportion to today ’s economy , would be about $ 200 billion .
Mr Putin remains de facto leader of the world 's largest country after stepping down as president , a role he held for eight years , in May .
The magazine notes he enjoys 80 percent approval ratings at home in part thanks to his revival of Russia 's economy and his efforts to rebuild the nation 's military , pride , and global standing .
What is it with plumbers , anyway ?
Before Joe the Plumber , the latest celebrity of the U.S. presidential campaign , we had the Polish plumber , star of the 2005 French referendum that sent a much - heralded European Union constitution into the toilet .
Jozef the Plumber  actually he never got a name  was the mythical Polish worker who was going to exploit European integration by moving to France and stealing jobs .
Mais non !
The French nixed that by a 55 percent majority .
I ’m not sure what effect Joe Wurzelbacher of Holland , Ohio , is going to have on the American vote , but one thing ’s now certain : you do n’t need a plumber ’s license to gain national fame .
In time , sociology departments at the Sorbonne and Stanford will complete studies on this Gallo - American plumbing thing .
Meanwhile , it ’s clearly time for everyone to start searching for his inner plumber .
( A new employee informs me that she spotted a little boy sneaking some candy in his pants .
I confront the boy and an older woman about it . )
Me : “ Excuse me , ma’am .
Hey , kiddo , what ’s in your pocket ? ”
Boy : “ Nothing ! ”
Granny : “ Oh , h*** , again ?!
Boy , if you do n’t put that d***ed candy back , that lady ’s gonna call the police on you !
And I ai n’t gonna stop her none . ”
( The boy , crying , hands me two candy bars and a handful of suckers .
I thank the lady , and get back to work .
A few minutes later , the boy ’s mother comes up to me . )
Mama : “ Is that the b****? ”
Me : “ Excuse me ? ”
Mama : “ Ain’t talking to you . ”
Boy : “ Yes , mama . ”
Mama : “ Girl , you being rude to my son ? ”
Me : “ No , ma’am . ”
Mama : “ So why you take away his candy ? ”
Me : “ Because it was n’t paid for . ”
Mama : “ Says who ?
I got him that candy ! ”
Me : “ Ma’am , it ’s at least 100 degrees outside , and your boy had unmelted chocolate in his pocket .
He did n’t bring that in with him .
Besides , he was seen taking the candy off the shelf . ”
Mama : “ What ?
Who said that ? ” * turns to the other cashiers *
“ Which one of you a ** holes told on my boy ? ”
Me : “ Excuse me , but that ’s not important . ”
Mama :
“ What ’s your point , then ? ! ”
Me : “ The point is , your boy was caught stealing . ”
Mama : “ Forget about the d***ed candy , you nosy b****!
Ain’t none of your business ! ”
Me : “ Ma’am , your son was spotted shoplifting , which is a crime .
You ’re lucky I do n’t report him . ”
Mama : “ You stupid b****!
I do n’t give a flying f*** about the candy ! ”
( She raises her hands as if to hit me . )
Me : * to Coworker *
“ Call the manager ; he should be in by now . ”
( Just then , Granny appears out of nowhere and smacks her daughter with her handbag . )
Granny : “ WHAT THE H*** ARE YOU DOING , GIRL ? ” * continues to smack and berate her daughter *
“ Upsetting people like that !
No common sense !
S***!
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT ! ”
Mama : “ But , Ma – ”
Granny : “ SHUT YOUR MOUTH GIRL !
GET IN THE D*** ED CAR ! ” * turns to me *
“ I ’m so sorry about that .
She ’s crazy , I swear to God .
She ’ll never come back in here ; I promise . ”
Me : “ … ”
Granny : * to Mama * “ CAN ’T TAKE YOUR CRAZY A** NOWHERE ! S***! ”
( She walked out like nothing happened , and true to her word , I ’ve not seen that lady since . )

The waiting is over and the verdict is in on the Sarah Palin , Troopergate Scandal .
A legislative committee investigating Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has found she unlawfully abused her authority in firing the state ’s public safety commissioner .
The investigative report concludes that a family grudge was n’t the sole reason for firing Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan but says it likely was a contributing factor .
The Republican vice presidential nominee has been accused of firing a commissioner to settle a family dispute .
Palin supporters have called the investigation politically motivated .
The investigation revealed that Palin ’s husband , Todd , has extraordinary access to the governor ’s office and her closest advisers .
He used that access to try to get trooper Mike Wooten fired , the report found .

California ’s gay marriage drama goes deep !
Most of us think of Proposition 8 as an elimination of same - sex marriage rights , but Biotech executives there see far more complex dimensions .
You may not know this , but California and gay - marrying Massachusetts are in a bit of competition over scientists who work in the Biotech field .
And insiders in the Golden State are worried that if Proposition 8 passes , then their bent talent may move over to Massachusetts , especially since Massachusetts sweetened their pot by passing a $ 1 billion package for the industry .
So , in an effort to save their hides – and homos – a coalition of California ’s biotech firms are now joining the fight against Proposition 8 .
The San Diego biotechnology executives are trying to persuade the local industry trade group , Biocom , to join in opposing it .
Fischer and 21 other executives sent letters to Biocom and their friends and family , outlining how the proposition would hurt California .
“ Our industry is vitally important to San Diego and we cannot allow other states become more appealing to our talented work force , ” the executives said .
“ In today ’s economy we can not afford to lose the potential of a single job or company . ”
The executives gave the letter to Biocom leaders last week , after the trade group ’s policy committee had met to determine which candidates the organization would support in Tuesday ’s election .
Biocom did not take a stance on any ballot initiatives .
We do n’t care if they ’re simply worried about a brain drain to the Bay State , we ’re happy these Californian science geeks are on our side .
The Vatican yesterday defended Pope Benedict 's decision to avoid direct condemnation of organised crime during a trip to a southern area of Italy infested by the Camorra -- one of the country 's most ruthless criminal organisations .
The Pope made a day - long trip to Pompeii to say Mass and pray the rosary at a sanctuary in the modern section of the city whose adjacent ancient ancestor was buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD .
In his speeches , Benedict did not use the words ' organised crime ' or ' Camorra ' , as the local mafia is known .
His only reference to crime came when he said prayer was " a spiritual weapon in the struggle against evil and every form of violence . "
A Vatican spokesman said the Pope had intentionally avoided mentioning the Camorra .
" The trip has a strictly spiritual dimension and it was out of respect for the fact that most people from this area are honest and not members of organised crime , " he said .
Modern Pompeii is one of a string of bleak , run -down towns where the crime group has a strong presence .
The Camorra , which makes its money in extortion rackets , drug trafficking , and smuggling , was recently the subject of a hit movie , ' Gomorra ' -- based on the bestselling book of the same name by Roberto Saviano .
Last week , Mr Saviano said that he would flee Italy to try to lead a normal life after reports emerged that the mob has ordered him to be killed by Christmas .
With apologies to Churchill ( who owed a few of his own ) :
Never have so many been so wrong about so much .
There are few things you ’d less rather be right now than a conservative / regressive , and that is why .
It ’s like the old Firesign Theater bit : Everything You Know Is Wrong .
" Dogs flew spaceships !
The Aztecs invented the vacation !
Men and women are the same sex !
Our forefathers took drugs !
Yes !
That 's right !
Everything you know is wrong ! "
And , what ’s worse , everybody knows it except you .
America is turning decisively away from its tragic thirty - year experiment with Reaganism - Bushism , and for very good reason .
Regressives have ruled the country more or less unabated ( Democrats , the supposed carriers of the liberal torch , were during these last three decades either frightened , centrist or irrelevent – and usually all three at once ) .
Moreover , during the last years especially – the Cringe Decade – the right was particularly forceful , particularly unfettered , particularly successful at having its way , and particularly arrogant in the self - righteous belief in its authority on all things .
Once small problem , though .
If you sat down with a pen and paper and tried to invent a more thorough litany of failure on the right ’s watch , you ’d be hard pressed to top what they ’ve actually done .
I suppose inadvertently nuking all the major cities of the United States would be worse , but I ca n’t think of much else .
The simple truth is that the regressive movement took a great and proud and prosperous country and ran it into the ditch at 130 miles an hour .
Worse yet , for them – and unlike the bad old years of Willie Horton , or invading Panama , or Clinton ’s faux scandals – the public is n’t fooled anymore .
They had already caught on to the game , in large part , a few years back , which is why Bush has been moribund in the absolute cellar of job approval ratings for almost the entirety of his second term .
Things were already tough for the black hats , but then this economic crisis came and walloped people severely , right in the wallet .
One thing about Americans – they ’re seriously selfish .
You take away their reputation and their liberties and their democracy and they might – might !
– vote against you .
You take away their money , they ’ll rip your f*cking lungs out , Bro .
And if John McCain seems particularly short on breath of late , that ’s why .
There ’s nothing quite like the total absence of breathing organs to put a crimp in your respiratory function .
But this crackup is way , way bigger than the righteously deserved toilet training of one John Sidney McCain the Third .
This is the end of an era , and not a moment too soon .
It now looks like Democrats will win a 1932 - style landslide , a realigning election ( as I predicted one year ago ) , smashing McCain in both the popular vote and the Electoral College , picking up double - digit seats in the House , and possibly even gaining a filibuster - proof majority of 60 in the Senate .
Even Mitch McConnell , a smug horror story of a minority leader for his decrepit party , looks like he ’ll be losing his seat , along with such smarmy dreaded incumbents such as Elizabeth Dole and Norm Coleman .
This has all the makings of a serious and even perhaps lethal spanking for the hated GOP .
That would leave wishy - washy sometime - conservative Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy as the sole remaining bulwark of regressivism in the American government .
Which is to say none at all .
It used to be said that ‘ justices read election results too ’ , and never was that more true of anyone than of Kennedy , well before this year , but especially now .
Even as we speak ( and as I also predicted ) , we ’re seeing many on the right scrambling now to reinvent themselves as progressives ( for some , like David Brooks or Coleman , who had been lefties back when that was trendy , this represents a reconversion conversion ) .
Anthony Kennedy will surely be on that list .
In the 1930s , this same scenario developed , and a troglodyte majority on the Supreme Court started striking down New Deal legislation in a time of massive duress , only to have an angry public , Congress , and highly popular president turn on them .
Kennedy wo n’t make that mistake .
He ai n’t gonna sacrifice his personal legacy to keep Clarence Thomas pure , that much we can guarantee .
Can you imagine , for example , a Democratic Congress vigorously moving national health care , or jobs legislation , and a Democratic president ceremoniously signing it into law , only for Kennedy to provide the swing vote on the Court striking it down as unconstitutional ?
Fat chance .
The guy ’s not suicidal , and he does n’t want 300 million angry Americans trying to Google his address .
The trajectory of the regressive movement over the last thirty years has led us to this horrid place .
At least you could say that their little mini-revolution began with some ideas , however disastrous those were , and however much they always masked the true kleptocratic purpose of the movement .
Reagan had his Cold Warrior shtick , along with some notions of political economy he was peddling .
Greedy and stupid Americans , their post - war prosperity already perceptibly beginning to slip away in the late 1970s , foolishly bought the whole package – anything to keep the wallet stuffed and the bloated car out of the hands of the repo man .
Reagan surely did not win the Cold War , but he surely did exacerbate the steady unraveling of the middle class .
The national debt was tripled , while the burden of taxes was shifted from the rich to the non-rich , and organized labor was undermined at every turn .
Surprise , surprise – the rich got a lot richer , the poor got poorer , and the middle class stood still .
By the time we got to 2004 , the bogus ideas were no longer even bothered with , as the regressive electoral appeal was reduced down to pure lies and a patent appeal to fear .
The marketing genius Karl Rove managed to fool all of the people some of the time , and turned war hero John Kerry into someone to be feared and doubted , while war avoider George Bush became GI Joe .
That ’s a hell of a lot of political detergent to move off of supermarket shelves , but – along with some old - fashioned electoral fraud in Ohio , of course – it worked one last time .
Bush bragged about winning political capital to spend in his second term , but you ’d have to be as stupid and disingenuous as the little toad himself ( the same guy who declared the Iraq war over before it actually began , and who said " You ’re doing a heckuva job , Brownie " ) to have believed that nonsense .
The truth was that 2004 was the last gasp of the old black magic , and it just barely worked .
Use lies , racism , homophobia , xenophobia and national security bogeymen to scare pathetically ill - informed Americans , and in non-recessionary times you could win another election .
Back then , at least .
That game is over now , exhausted for a generation or more , though a shamefully and embarrassingly desperate John McCain is still trying to play it .
And why would n’t he ?
If he does n’t care about his honor and integrity and reputation – and he evidently does n’t , at least compared to how much he cares about winning the presidency – what else is there for him to do ?
He ca n’t run on issues , he ca n’t run on solutions , he ca n’t run on his wonderful VP choice , and he ca n’t run on the peace and prosperity his party has delivered .
Indeed , he has to run from all those things .
That leaves only one other option , which is for McCain and his team of Rove proteges to do to Obama what Rove himself did to Kerry – that is , sow enough doubt about his trustworthiness in the minds of voters to make them hold their noses and default to the seemingly ( but not really ) safe choice of the seemingly ( but not really ) known quantity .
But it ’s just not working anymore .
In fact , so much is it not working anymore , that nowadays you have regressive politicians and pundits renouncing their own team for trying it .
Where were these folks back in 1998 when a group of serious and serial philanderers impeached a president for lying about a blow job ?
Where were they when Rove and Bush told South Carolinians that McCain had fathered a child with a black mistress , or ridiculed Al Gore for supposedly having claimed to have invented the Internet ?
Where were they in 2002 , when Saxby Chambliss , another Vietnam war avoider , ran ads morphing the face of triple - amputee Vietnam vet Max Cleland into those of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein ?
And where were they when Rove and Bush were swift - boating Kerry in 2004 ?
I ’ll tell you where .
They were cheering it all on .
Not so much now .
Dylan once said you do n’t have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows , but in 2008 you ’d have to be an inter- galactic astronaut or the doorkeeper for Cheney ’s underground bunker to not know .
And so the regressive right blovitoriate is splitting before our very eyes , into two camps .
One is the unreconstructed Neanderthal set , like William Kristol and Victor Davis Hanson , who ca n’t quite believe what they ’re seeing ( " But this ca n’t be right – we own the presidency ! " ) , who thought the Sarah Palin pick was just plain inspired , and who are encouraging McCain to stop pussyfooting around already .
Kristol , for example , watching it all just melt away , has been furiously trying to find a gambit to keep the regressive dream alive .
First he advised McCain to go all Rove on Obama , which McCain did , sending Palin out to describe That One as having ‘ palled around with terrorists ’.
Unreal .
You know you ’re in deep sh*t when Sarah Palin is your voice of moral authority ( her best line yet has been her claim this week to be relieved that she has been fully exonerated by the Alaska legislature ’s corruption probe , which in fact flat - out accused her of breaking the law by abusing power for personal gain ) .
Anyhow , having realized that Ayers accusations are actually diminishing McCain ’s popularity rather than enhancing it , Kristol is now calling for McCain to fire everyone on the staff and for the " competent " McCain and Palin to just do constant press conferences until election day .
Nevermind that allowing Palin to talk to the press or public in any unstructured environment would put McCain in danger of being on the ugly side of a fifty - state sweep right now .
( You think I ’m kidding ?
McCain is up a whopping six percent in Georgia at the moment , eight percent in Mississippi , and one percent in North Carolina , home of Jesse Helms .
He ’s currently losing by two points in that bastion of leftist fomentation , that revolutionary hotbed , the People ’s Republic of North Dakota . )
Perhaps the most amusing line of this entire election cycle came from the McCain campaign staff , ( perhaps slightly miffed by the suggestion that they all lose their jobs ) , who claimed that Kristol , of all people , has now drunk from the cup of Obamania .
Wow .
Who needs a dictionary definition for paranoia when you ’ve got that to work with ?
The other great line that Kristol floated as a rationale for voters to choose McCain , and a theme of late among the drowning right - wing punditocracy , is that McCain should argue for votes by saying that he will be there to block what is sure to be a Democratic and – wait for it now – liberal ( oooooooh ! ! )
Congress .
Let ’s leave aside the obvious and traditional solution to such a quandary , which is that McCain could instead simply encourage voters to choose Republicans all up and down the ticket ( could there be something toxic about the R - word in 2008 ? ) .
But even apart from that rather obvious bit of logical lunacy , what sort of frighteningly vapid bonehead do you have to be to think that divided government is a winning notion in 2008 ?
I mean , raise your hand if you think that what Americans want right now , in the middle of multiple crises , including one which is destroying their retirement savings and threatening their jobs , is a gridlocked government in which Congress passes legislation shot down by the president ’s veto pen , and the president proposes solutions ignored by a Congress controlled by the other party .
Do they really pay these guys big bucks to pen this sort of drivel ?
These morons are the pundicratic equivalents of Wall Street ’s equally brilliant masters of the universe , only in six figures instead of nine .
Take , for example , Victor Davis Hanson , who says that , since the campaigns of previous GOP nominees – ranging from the racism of the Willie Horton project to the swiftboating of war heroes – were worse than the present transgressions , therefore " McCain as a vicious campaigner is a complete fabrication , but , again , a brilliant subterfuge on the part of Team Obama that , in fact , has run , via appendages , the far more vicious race " .
Yeah , Cindy McCain said that too , arguing that Obama has run " the dirtiest campaign in American history " .
I suppose if you find trouncing her husband to be dirty politics , she ’s right .
But the notion that a campaign which is trying to win by tying the other guy to an unknown former radical who blew stuff up when the candidate was eight years old is somehow not running a vicious campaign is so big a stretch that not even a lot of regressives will make it anymore .
Nevermind that the education commission that both Obama and Ayers served on was a project of the Annenberg family , huge supporters of Reagan and , yes , one John McCain .
And nevermind that that means that the Annenbergs , and McCain , and all the conservative members of the commission have , by the same logic , palled around with terrorists at least as much Obama .
Oops .
But , for my personal favorite , there ’s that famous political philosopher , Ted Nugent ( better know to some as a horrid screaming shred - metal rock singer , or an enthusiastic murderer of animals ) , who advises McCain to go all Reagan and tell the people once again that government is the problem , not the solution .
Yep , just as every American is scrambling for a lifeboat in an economic Category 5 , and even the Bush administration is doing its very best impression of V. I. Lenin by plunging the government deep into economic interventions , he literally advises McCain to " Tell us the federal government has no business in the home loan industry and that you will take our economy away from the Treasury Department bureaucrats and give it back to the bankers , stockbrokers and company leaders that have made our economy thrive since Alexander Hamilton served at Treasury . "
Hey , Ted , you forgot pedophiles and serial murderers on your list of popular people right now !
Stockbrokers ?
Yes !
CEOs ?
Yes !
Oh please , John McCain , please .
Please sing their praises in the closing weeks of the campaign .
Just because Ted Nugent seems like the very antithesis of a thoughtful political theorist , just because he seems like a metal - headed rocker who has turned it up to eleven once too many times , I guarantee you , John , that he is not .
Your can win the presidency if you ’ll just follow his advice and talk incessantly about all the heroic stockbrokers and CEOs you ’ll put in your cabinet !
This will really resonate with American voters right now !!
Maybe you could even pardon some of those Enron guys and put them to work running the country .

Engineers from the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) have created a “ plug - and - play ” synthetic RNA device–a sort of eminently customizable biological computer –that is capable of taking in and responding to more than one biological or environmental signal at a time .
In the future , such devices could have a multitude of potential medical applications , including being used as sensors to sniff out tumor cells or determine when to turn modified genes on or off during cancer therapy .
A synthetic RNA device is a biological device that uses engineered modular components made of RNA nucleotides to perform a specific function –for instance , to detect and respond to biochemical signals inside a cell or in its immediate environment .
Created by Caltech ’s Christina Smolke , assistant professor of chemical engineering , and Maung Nyan Win , postdoctoral scholar in chemical engineering , the device is made up of modules comprising the RNA - based biological equivalents of engineering ’s sensors , actuators , and information transmitters .
These individual components can be combined in a variety of different ways to create a device that can both detect and respond to what could conceivably be an almost infinite number of environmental and cellular signals .
This modular device processes these inputs in a manner almost identical to the logic gates used in computing ; it can perform AND , NOR , NAND , and OR computations , and can perform signal filtering and signal gain operations .
Smolke and Win ’s creation is the first RNA device that can handle more than one incoming piece of biological information .
“ There ’s been a lot of work done in single - input devices , ” notes Smolke .
“ But this is the first demonstration that a multi- input RNA device is possible . ”
Their work was published in the October 17 issue of the journal Science .
The modular–or plug - and - play–nature of the device ’s design also means that it can be easily modified to suit almost any need .
“ Scientists wo n’t have to redesign their system every time they want the RNA device to take on a new function , ” Smolke explains .
“ This modular framework allows you to quickly put a device together , then just as easily swap out the components for other ones and get a completely different kind of computation .
We could generate huge libraries of well - defined sensors and assemble many different tailored devices from such component libraries . ”
Although the work in the Science paper was done in yeast cells , Smolke says they have already shown that they can translate to mammalian cells as well .
This makes it possible to consider using these devices in a wide variety of medical applications .
For instance , ongoing work in Smolke ’s laboratory is looking at the packaging of these RNA devices –configured with the appropriate sensor modules–in human T cells .
The synthetic device would literally be placed within the cell to detect certain signals–say , one or more particular biochemical markers that are given off by tumor cells .
If those biomarkers were present , the RNA device would signal the T cell to spring into action against the putative tumor cell .
Similarly , an RNA device could be bundled alongside a modified gene as part of a targeted gene therapy package .
One of the problems gene therapy faces today is its lack of specificity –it ’s hard to make sure a modified gene meant to fix a problem in the liver reaches or is inserted in only liver cells .
But an RNA device , Smolke says , could be customized to detect the unique biomarkers of a liver cell–or , better yet , of a diseased liver cell–and only then give the modified gene the go - ahead to do its stuff .

As Election Day approaches , many musicians are stepping up efforts to rally voters to the polls come November 4 .
The latest to vote with their instruments ?
Hip - hop luminaries the Beastie Boys , staunch Obama supporters who just unveiled a handful of “ Get Out and Vote ” shows .
“ This election is too important to stay at home , ” the rap trio told Billboard.com .
“ We hope that you can come out , have a nice night , dance , sing , get your freak on , and then wake up the next morning and geteveryone that you possibly can to get out and vote . ”
The mini - tour — set to hit three swing states decisive to the election — kicks off October 28 in Richmond , VA , and is followed by shows in St. Paul , MN , and Milwaukee , WI , Nov. 1 - 2 , respectively .
The shows will also feature performances by such artists as Norah Jones , Sheryl Crow , Santogold , Ben Harper , and Tenacious D.
Beastie Boys ’ “ Get Out and Vote ” dates :
10/28 , Richmond , VA ( Richmond Coliseum ) ( w/ Sheryl Crow , Norah Jones , Jack Johnson , and Santogold )

TOYAKO , Japan ( Reuters ) - The United States formally apologized to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Tuesday for distributing to reporters an " insulting " biography of him that said he was " hated by many " .
The description was included in a thick press kit distributed to reporters traveling with U.S. President George W. Bush from Washington to the Group of Eight summit in Japan that Berlusconi was also attending .
The four - page biography , pulled from the Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement , refers to Berlusconi as " hated by many but respected by all at least for his bella figura ( personal style ) and the sheer force of his will " .
Berlusconi was said to be " regarded by many as a political dilettante who gained his high office only through use of his considerable influence on the national media ...
" It also said Berlusconi was " one of the most controversial leaders in the history of a country known for governmental corruption and vice " .
When Bush travels abroad , the White House typically distributes to reporters a press kit with the president 's schedule , details of places he will visit , transcripts of remarks and biographies of officials he plans to meet .
" A biography of Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi included in the press package used language that is insulting both to Prime Minister Berlusconi and to the Italian people , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement .
"
The sentiments expressed in the biography do not represent the views of President Bush , the American government , or the American people , " he said .
" We apologize to Italy and to the prime minister for this very unfortunate mistake .
" Bush , during a visit with Berlusconi in Rome last month , described them as " good friends " .
The two have been so friendly that Bush treated Berlusconi to a visit to his Texas ranch in 2003 , a rare privilege granted to only a few leaders .

Is OPEC its own worst enemy these days ?
Crude oil prices hovered around $ 63 on Tuesday , after a dismal report on consumer confidence .
The market has n’t reacted to Friday ’s production cut the way OPEC hoped .
Now , before last week ’s cut has even gone into effect , the oil cartel ’s heavyweights are already talking up the next round of production cuts — giving more grist to oil bears who figure a global recession will kneecap demand for oil .

Engineers have begun inspecting the damaged plane in Manila
Qantas boss Geoff Dixon has denied corrosion caused a hole in the body of the plane that was forced to make an emergency landing in Manila .
Safety engineers have begun examining the plane to establish the cause .
More than 360 people were on board the flight when it was forced to land .
They have since arrived back in Australia .
Possible causes include corrosion or accidental external damage but Mr Dixon said preliminary checks showed corrosion was not the problem .
The Qantas chief executive said he was " horrified " after seeing pictures of the hole .
" Our preliminary checks on this indicate there was no corrosion anywhere near where this hole occurred in the aircraft , " he told ABC news in Australia .
" We really can't speculate on how this happened or causes , but certainly there 's going to be a very thorough investigation . "
The passengers , en route to Melbourne , described hearing a loud bang mid-flight , which was followed by a rapid decompression of the cabin .
' Fingers crossed '
In an online planespotters ' forum in February , participants referred to the detection of " serious corrosion issues " in the 17 - year - old Boeing 747- 438 Longreach during a maintenance check at Avalon airport in March .
Aviation experts say corrosion could have been enough to have caused the 2.5 - 3 m hole in the fuselage - if even a small section of the plane 's aluminium skin was able to break free , the enormous pressures generated at cruising altitude could have done the rest .
WHY QF30 DESCENDED 20,000FT
Planes are pressurised as cruising altitudes are freezing and lack sufficient oxygen to breathe
Hole causes decompression , rapidly reducing air pressure and risking exposure Oxygen masks are deployed and pilot makes emergency descent to breathable altitude
What went wrong on the plane ?
Other possible causes might include accidental external damage to the plane on the ground , or something inside the plane which had not been properly secured and slammed into the fuselage at some point .
Investigators will want to rule out the presence of any explosives .
A Qantas spokeswoman has confirmed that the plane did go through maintenance checks at the facility mentioned on the forum , but that " nothing out of the ordinary was detected during the checks " .
" The most recent maintenance check on this aircraft were for a ' D ' [ most thorough ] check in Qantas 's Sydney facility in 2004 and two ' C ' [ regular ] checks in Qantas 's facility in 2006 and 2008 , " she said .
Investigators , including four officers from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau , would also closely examine the maintenance regime of the aircraft , which was registered in 1991 , Qantas said .
They would also focus on what happened at Hong Kong 's Chek Lap Kok airport before the flight departed , it added .
A similar Qantas 747-438 Longreach flew Benedict XVI to Rome last week following his historic visit to Australia .
' Lot of emotion ' Passengers described hearing a large bang and feeling a rush of wind and debris through the cabin about an hour after Flight QF30 left Hong Kong at 0900 local time ( 0100 GMT ) on Friday .

Advertisement The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said the aircraft made an emergency descent from 29,000 ft to 10,000 ft before stabilising .
It said initial information indicated that a section of the fuselage had separated in the area of the forward cargo compartment .
Passenger Olivia Lucas told the BBC everyone was " pretty scared for a few moments " .
" Then everyone focused on getting their oxygen masks on , " she said .
Phill Restall , from the UK , said the pilot then told passengers that they were going to land in Manila to have a look at the damage .
" Everyone was fairly calm , partly because they did n't realise the extent of it , " he said .
" After we disembarked it started to dawn on people that this was a major incident .
There were 350 people up there who were very lucky .
" Seeing the hole caused a lot of emotion .
People were physically shaking .
Many realised how close they were to their own mortality . "
Dr David Newman , of Flight Medicine Systems , said forcing the plane into a rapid descent after a sudden loss of pressure was a standard emergency procedure .

Here are VF 's estimates :
Laura Bush
Oscar de la Renta suit : $ 2,500
Stuart Weitzman heels : $ 325
Pearl stud earrings : $ 600 –$ 1,500
Total : Between $ 3,425 and $ 4,325 Cindy McCain

Clearly , McCain thinks the red carpet leads to the White House .
But with foreclosures galore and that pesky recession ever nipping at our Louboutin heels , is n't it time to cut back on the glitz ?
And does she really need four strands of pearls ?-- Monica Corcoran

More than a million Britons will be out of work and on the dole by next month as the toxic fallout from Black October filters down to ordinary families , economists are warning .
A bleak Christmas lies ahead for many as the City turmoil spreads into the so - called real economy .
Companies are now being squeezed on two vital fronts , with shoppers abandoning the high street and bank lending drying up , making it almost impossible for smaller businesses to get credit to stay afloat .
Geoff Hoon , the new Transport Secretary , yesterday warned that there were ' potentially serious consequences for small business , for employment ' from the current crisis , reflecting private warnings to the Prime Minister 's new economic ' war cabinet ' that job losses and business collapses later this year are now virtually inevitable .
Official unemployment figures for September , due on Wednesday , are expected to show another increase in job losses - although this will not yet be the sharp upward spike which is expected as the full consequences of last week 's stock - market crash filter through .
Some forecasts suggest that unemployment will hit two million by Christmas .
Some government officials warned that those slipping into unemployment could find themselves much more isolated than in the last recession .
They pointed out that unemployment benefits had slipped relative to earnings and there were now fewer council houses available .
Senior Tories this weekend called for a freeze on new employment rights , in a shift away from David Cameron 's previous enthusiasm for measures like extra parental leave , arguing that the priority was to save jobs by reducing business red tape .
Alan Duncan , the shadow business secretary , will host an emergency summit this week on ways of preventing small businesses from going bust .
Chris Grayling , the shadow work and pensions secretary , told The Observer it would become ' more difficult ' to make the case for flexible working in the darkening economic climate and called for deregulation to take the pressure off employers :
' The one thing government must recognise is that it can't keep piling regulation on small business when that could ( determine ) the decision whether to keep somebody in a job or not . '
Ministers are now under similar pressure to defend jobs , with some Labour MPs reporting a backlash from constituents furious that billions have been spent rescuing bankers while factory workers ' jobs go to the wall .
The British Retail Consortium will release figures this week showing another fall in sales on the high street last month , with director general Stephen Robertson warning that sales for non-food retailers such as electrical stores had ' fallen off a cliff ' .
Some retailers are reducing opening hours to save costs .
Shoppers are also cutting back on ' big ticket ' purchases like cars , with the number of new registrations in September down by a fifth on August , according to the SMMT , the motor vehicle manufacturing body .
Car plants have already axed thousands of temporary staff and put others on four - day weeks or halted overtime .
' If there is no pick - up in demand for cars , there are bound to be more job losses next year , ' said Roger Madison , national automotive officer for the Unite union .
Others at risk include the aviation industry - Willie Walsh , the British Airways chief executive , is predicting that up to 30 airlines worldwide will go bust - while further losses are likely in the City .
Unemployed bankers are being advised to seek work in Shanghai or Mumbai amid warnings that the Square Mile will be permanently reshaped by the crisis .
' City people I speak to are despairing because they may not get another job for a year , ' said Shaun Springer , chief executive of the City headhunting firm Napier Scott .
' For the first time in 30 years in the City , I 'm scared . '
With charitable donations falling , even the voluntary sector is also cutting jobs .
Oxfam needs to shave its budget by up to 15 per cent because of falling income , while the National Council of Voluntary Organisations expects some smaller charities to go under .
Alan Clarke , economist from the bank BNP Paribas , said the number of those claiming unemployment benefit was due to break the one million mark by the end of next month at the latest , with up to two million looking for work by December : he is forecasting unemployment to hit 7 per cent by the middle of next year and carry on rising until 2010 .
Philip Shaw , economist at Investec , said it was difficult to be optimistic : ' The sentiment is one of widespread doom and gloom .
Businesses are now being affected by the credit squeeze .
The economy has shuddered to a halt . '
At the height of the 1980s recession , three million were unemployed .
The question now is how far the pain will spread .
As one boss told a senior CBI official : ' We know there is a tsunami coming , but we do not know if it 's going to knock us over or just wet our feet . '
The speed with which the bubble burst is one of the most striking factors of this crisis , and could help determine what happens next .
Consumer confidence is now lower on some indices than in the 1980s slump or even the mid-1970s , according to the pollster Peter Kellner , suggesting that Britons unused to tough times are quicker to panic than in previous slumps - leading to a more sudden fall in sales , and consequently a more severe immediate threat to jobs .
' It may be that paradoxically because it 's been so good for the last 16 years people are not used to the idea ( of bad times ) whereas in previous times the boom and bust rolled around so regularly that it was less of a shock to the system , ' he argues .
No wonder Labour MPs ' celebrations after last week 's banking bailout package were shortlived .
' The big picture is obviously deeply worrying , ' said one Cabinet aide .
' But at least Gordon is playing a blinder : he looks so comfortable in his own skin for the first time in a long time . '
The Prime Minister has indeed been revitalised by the crisis , his confidence visibly soaring : he trounced David Cameron at the dispatch box last week over City bonuses , and is now seeing his stance vindicated as other world leaders rush to copy his banking bailout .
Finally , he is in his political element , leading international debate .
Nonetheless , Labour 's long - term prospects , with an election in 2010 , are unclear .
Brown could survive the crash , as John Major did with re-election in 1992 , or be forced from office .
Brown 's argument today that his banking plan will reduce the pain felt by Britain will be critical .
' If there is a slight blip but nothing too serious , and Gordon is seen to have played a major role in pulling Britain through , then I 'm not saying Labour will definitely win , but it 's game on , ' says Kellner .
' Alternatively , if it is a disaster we could have a Conservative landslide . '
There are fears across all three parties that the British National Party may profit from rising unemployment .
Grayling argues that healthy employment levels among foreign nationals have masked the loss of 250,000 jobs in the last years among British men : around half of new jobs created under Labour have gone to overseas workers .
Widespread job losses among unskilled , working - class Britons could provide dangerous ammunition for extremist parties and fuel the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment .
Unions are warning that the government must use its stake in the banks to free up lending , keeping businesses afloat and protecting jobs .
Hugo Sellert , head of economic research at the online recruitment firm Monster , which has seen the number of employers recruiting fall dramatically , says the biggest fear is of business lending drying up .
' We have yet to see the full impact of the financial crisis and the recent dramatic events spill over into the jobs market , ' he said .
' The worst is still to come . '
Which would mean tough decisions not just for employers but for government .
The Treasury 's forecasts of a 4.8 per cent growth in tax receipts - including money raked in from corporate tax and VAT on consumer goods - now looks wildly optimistic , yet revising them would threaten its spending plans for public services .
So what happens when the sums no longer add up ?
If you are reading this on a Northern Line London Tube train , you may owe your journey to the last great recession .
The extension of the Tube north to High Barnet and east into Essex in the 1930s was part of a massive programme of government spending designed to save jobs in construction and stimulate the economy after the Great Depression .
Rather than balancing its books by slashing spending or hiking taxes , could Labour try to spend its way through the recession by unleashing another era of job - creating public works ?
Rail and bus operators are usually among the first casualties of rising unemployment , as redundant commuters tear up their season tickets .
But Stephen Joseph , of the Campaign for Better Transport , argued the pain could be eased now by pushing ahead with expensive projects such as Crossrail .
' Because of commitments in the transport sector some of the downturn wo n't be as bad , because there is a level of spending through the recession , ' he said .
The last few days have , he argues , seen an outbreak of cross-party Keynesianism with even the Tory Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , warning against halting investment .
Similarly , ministers are being lobbied to snap up land at bargain prices as the property market crashes and use it to build social housing , keeping construction workers in jobs .
The prospect of a spending spree funded by borrowing worries the Tories , who fear winning the next election only to pick up the bill for what the shadow cabinet minister Michael Gove calls a ' party on David Cameron 's credit card ' .
This weekend , the shadow chancellor George Osborne published an analysis suggesting that , if government borrowing rises by £ 40 billion to plug the gap caused by a shrinking economy , government debt will rise to £ 80 billion by next year .
By 2009 - 10 , the government could be spending more on servicing debt than on grants to schools .
Whitehall is tightening its belt ahead of a pre-budget report this autumn expected , as one Cabinet minister admits , to be ' very tough ' .
The Treasury has not yet even set a date for its publication , as Alistair Darling rips up plans left outdated by the global crisis .
Downing Street has identified health , education and transport as priorities to be ringfenced but the outlook for other departments in the next three - year spending round - due to be settled next summer - appears grim .
Discussions have already begun over the Queen 's Speech , ditching planned legislation that does not address bread - and - butter issues .
Ironically , one of the flagship bills was intended to be James Purnell 's welfare reforms , bringing in private sector firms to find work for the jobless , details of which will be published in December .
By then , if the gloomier forecasts are right , two million Britons could be needing the newly privatised Jobcentre services - but if Brown is vindicated , the economy could have stepped back from the brink .
For millions whose homes and livelihoods depend on his economic stewardship , he was right yesterday to say the stakes could not be higher .
· This article was amended on Tuesday October 14 2008 .
The headline of this article ' Two million Britons on the dole by Christmas ' did not accurately reflect the figures used in the story .
This has been corrected .
Whatever money you may need for the next five years , please take it out of the stock market right now , this week .
I do not believe that you should risk those assets in the stock market right now . "
-- Jim Cramer , Oct. 6 , 2008 , S&P 500 at 1,056.89
With that statement , I now consider Jim Cramer a menace to investors .
He used to be a subject of cocktail - hour conversation -- " Did you hear what Cramer did on his show the other day ? " -- but after his recent melodramatic meltdown on the Today show , he 's the closest thing to a walking , talking hazard I can think of .
Why ?
Let me count the ways .
Seriously ?
I fully applaud Cramer 's stated goal -- to help people make money by investing in the stock market .
But I 'm generally one of the people with a drink in my hand , shaking my head over stories of the latest episode .
You see , when someone issues panic - inducing market calls -- instead of long - term strategies to buy and hold good companies -- the average investor simply gets crushed .
Cramer 's Today show plea was grounded in a sound reality -- Fools should never have money they need during the next five years in the market .
But by advising people to indiscriminately sell , he 's just helping to decimate their portfolios .
Chances are , most viewers were petrified before Cramer even spoke -- because the market 's been up and down ( and mostly down ) more times than a yo - yo lately .
Which means even a very small push was likely more than enough to help investors join the terrified herds pulling their money out of the market .
That 's right -- at the end of last week , investors pulled a whopping $ 52.1 billion out of U.S. managed funds .
Based on what these funds were holding , they were indirectly pulling out of mutual fund mainstays like ExxonMobil ( NYSE : XOM ) , Procter & Gamble ( NYSE : PG ) , Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE : JNJ ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , and General Electric ( NYSE : GE ) -- many of which had already been hammered .
And so , instead of holding onto the steady blue - chip stocks that have historically provided investors with some of the strongest long - term returns , panicked investors are likely to sell low … thereby ignoring the sound and sage advice from names like Buffett , Lynch , Graham , Munger , and Bogle .
You do n't need a weatherman …
No one can consistently forecast the direction of the market .
I repeat :
No one can consistently forecast the direction of the market .
It moves completely randomly and unpredictably over the short - term -- and therefore trying to make a " call " on the market wo n't do you much good .
Pick a direction ( up or down ) , and there 's a 50 % chance of being right -- even though the prediction would be meaningless .
Do n't be like poor Puxatawney Phil .
The furry little bugger climbs out and either sees his shadow or he does n't , but the result has nothing to do with whether winter is over -- just like a stock market prediction has nothing to do with the market 's movements .
Because the short - term movement of the stock market is random .
Cramer , for his part , has flip - flopped more often than John Kerry , calling the bottom several times this year .
Then there was his theory that 2008 would be the year of natural gas .
Ouch .
The talking heads on TV get paid to attract viewers .
Education is a secondary priority ( or worse ) .
As investors , we can't let their predictions catalyze us with fear -- as it probably has for less - sophisticated investors who do n't have much money to play with in the first place .
And that 's why I think the Today show gaffe is even worse than his usual performances .
Regular CNBC viewers are used to wild , gaseous monologues .
Last week 's prediction was on network TV !
Whether Cramer turns out to be right or wrong in the end is n't the point .
The point is , no one can claim to predict the markets -- no one .
If you follow the advice of those that say they can , it 's likely to cost you thousands ( if not more ) in costs , fees , and missed opportunity .
Here 's the real problem
In the real world , there are commission costs , taxes , and opportunity costs -- and they have a pretty big effect on the real returns investors get .
The combined result of this , I suspect , is that the average investors playing along with Mad Money have been seriously burned multiple times .
Worse yet , they 're sends a whopping portion of their hard - earned money to the IRS and their brokers .
Take a hint from someone who actually understands these matters : John Bogle , the founder of Vanguard Investments .
He writes : " No matter how efficient or inefficient markets may be , the returns earned by investors as a group must fall short of the market returns by precisely the amount of the aggregate costs they incur .
It is the central fact of investing . "
Think about that the next time you hear " Buy , Buy , Buy " or " Sell , Sell , Sell . "
The Foolish bottom line
If you want to make money in the stock market , you need to tune out the panic -- or the euphoria .
You need to remember that no one has any idea where the market is going in the near or medium term .
You need to buy shares of great , built - to - last businesses .
You need to hold for the long term .
You need to keep as much money as you can from the tax man or your broker .
That 's what we do at Motley Fool Stock Advisor , and it 's paying off .
Take two of our best stocks , Marvel Entertainment ( NYSE : MVL ) and Costco ( NASDAQ : COST ) .
We recommended buying shares of these stocks more than six years ago .
Both have outperformed the market by incredible margins .
I bet we 'll continue to hold these two for a long time to come .
The cost of doing all this ?
Probably $ 24 in broker fees and $ 0 in taxes .
That 's a perfect example of what I 'm talking about .
In fact , our whole scorecard is beating the S&P 500 by 29 percentage points .
As for Cramer … he 's undoubtedly a smart stock guy , and he puts on a rambunctious and entertaining show .
But what he sorely lacks -- and what you must never forget in your investing days -- is temperament .
It was Warren Buffett who once said that " the most important quality for an investor is temperament , not intellect . "

Using Gmail with IMAP to Receive Email in Rails
The number one article suggestion thus far is how to receive email in a rails app .
Ask and you shall receive .
What I am about to present is just a first run at it and I am not going to promise that it scales . :)
That said , I fooled around with it a bit and found it relatively easy .
I will post more on the topic as I play more with receiving email , but what follows is enough to at least get you up and running .
The email address I used for this is actually a Gmail address , so using this method does not involve postfix or some other mail server configuration .
The Project
The project that I added email receiving functionality to was YardVote , a weekend project by my friends at Collective Idea .
YardVote allows people to record a “ yard ” with the political signs that were present in said yard and displays them on a google map .
I was immediately enamored with the idea but found entering signs on my iPhone to be a bit tedious .
Giving that everyone seems to be interested in receiving email , that it would be handy for yardvote , and that yardvote was open source , I decided to take a crack at it .
The Process
The path to success in summary form was this :
Check for new emails Create new or update existing location from each email Archive emails that have been processed to avoid duplicates
Turn process of checking and processing email into daemon
bin/mail_receiver.rb
For whatever reason , I created a bin directory and a mail_receiver.rb script inside of that .
Actually , it was for a reason .
I think bin seems like a good place for stuff like this .
I could have used the script directory , but I figured I would leave that for Rails and plugins .
I will over comment the code below to help with any parts of it that may raise questions .
# default rails environment to development ENV[ ' RAILS_ENV ' ] ||= ' development ' # require rails environment file which basically " boots " up rails for this script require File.join ( File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , '..' , ' config ' , ' environment ' ) require ' net / imap ' require ' net / http ' # amount of time to sleep after each loop below SLEEP_TIME = 60 # mail .yml is the imap config for the email account ( ie : username , host , etc. ) config = YAML.load( File.read( File.join( RAILS_ROOT , ' config ' , ' mail.yml ' ) ) ) # this script will continue running forever loop do begin # make a connection to imap account imap = Net:: IMAP.new ( config [ ' host ' ] , config [ ' port ' ] , true ) imap.login(config [ ' username ' ] , config [ ' password ' ] ) # select inbox as our mailbox to process imap.select ( ' Inbox ' ) # get all emails that are in inbox that have not been deleted imap.uid_search ( [ " NOT " , " DELETED " ] ) . each do |uid| # fetches the straight up source of the email for tmail to parse source = imap.uid_fetch( uid , [ ' RFC822 ' ] ) .first.attr [ ' RFC822 ']
# Location #new_from_email accepts the source and creates new location location = Location.new_from_email ( source ) # check for an existing location that matches the one created from email source existing = Location.existing_address( location ) if existing # location exists so update the sign color to the emailed location existing .
signs = location .
signs if existing .
save # existing location was updated else # existing location was invalid end elsif location .
save # emailed location was valid and created else # emailed location was invalid end # there is n't move in imap so we copy to new mailbox and then delete from inbox imap.uid_copy ( uid , " [ Gmail ] / All Mail " ) imap.uid_store( uid , " + FLAGS " , [ : Deleted ] ) end # expunge removes the deleted emails imap.expunge imap.logout imap.disconnect # NoResponseError and ByResponseError happen often when imap'ing rescue Net:: IMAP::NoResponseError => e # send to log file , db , or email rescue Net : : IMAP ::ByeResponseError => e # send to log file , db , or email rescue => e # send to log file , db , or email end # sleep for SLEEP_TIME and then do it all over again sleep ( SLEEP_TIME ) end
Location#new_from_email
The only piece of code that you might need to help what I showed above make sense is the Location # new_from_email method .
class Location < ActiveRecord :: Base def self.new_from_email( source ) attrs , email = {} , TMail :: Mail.parse( source ) # set signs attribute equal to subject in proper form attrs [ : signs ] = email.subject.blank ? ? '' : email.subject.downcase.strip.titleize # set street equal to the body with email signatures stripped attrs [ : street ] = parse_address(email.body ) # create new location from the attributes new ( attrs ) end def self.parse_address ( body ) body.split ( "
" ) . first end end
Location#new_from_email
Specs
While working on the new_from_email method , I created an emails directory inside fixtures that had several ways an email could be sent to YardVote .
Then , I created a few specs to make sure that new_from_email was actually working .
describe Location do describe " #new_from_email " do it " should be subject " do location = Location.new_from_email(email_fixture(:red_no_subject ) ) location .
should have_error_on( :signs ) end it " should require body " do location = Location.new_from_email(email_fixture(:red_no_body ) ) location.valid ?
location.errors.full_messages.should include ( " We can't find a precise enough address match . " ) end it " should set street to email body " do location = Location.new_from_email(email_fixture ( :red ) ) location .
street .

Now that I could check for new email and process that email , it was time to daemonize the script .
The benefit of daemonizing is that you get nice and easy start , stop and restart commands , along with a PID .
The PID makes monitoring your script possible , which is needed because it is bound to crash or begin sucking up to much memory .
require ' rubygems ' require ' daemons ' dir = File.dirname(__FILE__ ) Daemons.run( dir + '/mail_receiver.rb ' )
What , you wanted more ?
Now you can run commands like ruby bin/mail_receiver_ctl.rb start to start your script and ruby bin/mail_receiver_ctl.rb stop to stop it .
Very handy .
config/mail.god
The whole setup was running fine for a while , but sure enough , a few days later , I noticed that a few of my emails were still sitting in the inbox .
This was because the script had crashed .
I fiddled around with god a little bit and came up with the following script , mostly stolen from Ryan Bates Railscast on god .
RAILS_ROOT = File.expand_path(File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , '..' ) )
God. watch do |w| # script that needs to be run to start , stop and restart script = " ruby # {RAILS_ROOT}/bin/mail_receiver_ctl.rb " # attaching rails env to each script line to be sure the daemon starts in production mode rails_env = " RAILS_ENV=production " w.name = " mail - receiver " w.group = " mail " w.interval = 60. seconds w.start = " #{script} start # {rails_env} " w.restart = " #{script} restart # {rails_env} " w.stop = " #{script} stop # {rails_env} " w.start_grace = 20.seconds w.restart_grace = 20.seconds w.pid_file = " #{RAILS_ROOT}/log/mail_receiver.pid " w.behavior(:clean_pid_file ) w.start_if do | start| start.condition (:process_running ) do |c| c.interval = 10.seconds c.running = false end end w.restart_if do |restart| restart.condition ( : memory_usage ) do |c| c.above = 100. megabytes c.times = [ 3 , 5 ] end restart.condition ( : cpu_usage ) do |c| c.above = 80. percent c.times = 5 end end w.lifecycle do |on| on.condition ( : flapping ) do |c| c.to_state = [ : start , : restart ] c.times = 5 c.within = 5. minute c.transition = :unmonitored c.retry_in = 10.minutes c.retry_times = 5 c.retry_within = 2.hours end end end
Conclusion
Two hours , three files and a few extra methods later , YardVote could receive email .
Before too long , I will be adding custom email addresses per person into an application such as Flickr and Highrise .
I will be sure to post on that here , but , for now , I hope this helps people get started .
Also , you can see the code actually implemented in the app on github .
I think we need to get more knowledge share on how to do things like this in Rails .
If you have added receiving emails into your Rails app , how did you do it ?
Post a comment or link to an article that you wrote or used .
Below are a few of the articles I have seen around the interwebs .
Receiving Email in Rails links
As John noted below , in the latest installment of “ The Blithering Idiot talks to Katie Couric , ” Sarah Palin could n’t name a single Supreme Court , other than Roe , with which she disagreed .
Could n’t name one .
But , in June of this year , Governor Palin expressed outrage over the Exxon Valdez case , which was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court JUST FOUR MONTHS AGO .
A case affecting Alaska .
And a case about energy , her signature issue , her BEST issue , McCain keeps telling us .
From Gov. Sarah Palin : “ I am extremely disappointed with today ’s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court , ” Palin said .
“ While the decision brings some degree of closure to Alaskans suffering from 19 years of litigation and delay , the court gutted the jury ’s decision on punitive damages . ”
She ’s a blithering idiot .
This was an Alaska case .
And , at its core , the case is about energy , which is her supposed expertise – remember , John McCain said she knows more about energy than anyone in America .
Wow .
Author : Military intelligence spied on Americans David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday October 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Spying on Americans is n't always about gathering information about terrorist organizations like al - Qaeda .
Sometimes it 's about other important matters of national security .
Like phone sex .
Two military linguists who listened to overseas phone calls for U.S. intelligence spoke out against their former profession this week , lamenting their eavesdropping on the personal conversations of Americans , the Associated Press reported .
" I was told , hey , check this out , there 's some good phone sex or there 's some pillow talk , pull up this call it 's really funny , " one of the operatives said in an interview with ABC .
The interceptors admitted to spying on hundreds of American soldiers , journalists and aid workers stationed in the Middle East , Rachel Maddow reported for MSNBC .
" Basically , the Bush administration has used the Constitution to line its proverbial kitty - litter box , " Maddow said .
A new book claims the accusations from the operatives - turned - whistleblowers are only a few of the many complaints that can be leveled against U.S. intelligence and how it conducts spy programs .
Investigative journalist James Bamford reported on the shady dealings of the National Security Agency 's wiretapping program in his new book " The Shadow Factory , " which includes the information from the two operatives who went to the press this week .
In an interview with Maddow , Bamford said one of the whistleblowers protested to her superiors and even complained to Sen.
Patrick Leahy of the Congressional Committee , but no one took her complaints seriously .
" They were very angry that they were eavesdropping on average Americans instead of going after terrorists , which is what they went into the military to do in the first place , " Bamford said .
Bamford also said the operatives were not allowed to eliminate the personal calls once they were received .
" Every time a person called their spouse , every time a journalist called his source or called the editor or called his wife or husband , they [ the conversations ] were collected and transcribed and also stored , " he said .
It is difficult to know if the eavesdropping is even illegal with the amount of Senate modifications to FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) , Bamford said .
He added that the NSA is building " an enormous facility in Texas " to store the conversations .
Before her interview with Bamford , Maddow showed clips of a two - year - old speech of President Bush reassuring Americans they would be safe from spy programs .
" We 're not mining or trolling through the personal lives of millions of Americans , " Bush said .
" Our efforts are focussed on links to al - Qaeda and their known affiliates . "
A Senate panel is investigating the claims against the NSA .

Consider a PHP - MySQL application where the information of 1000 users is being retrieved from the database by running a for loop :
for( $i = 1 ; $ i <= 1000 ; $ i++ ) {
$ query = " SELECT * FROM user WHERE user_id = $ i " ;
//run the query and fetch data
}
In each iteration , the first thing the MySQL engine does is to parse the query for syntax check .
Then it sets up the query and runs it .
Since the query remains unchanged during each iteration ( except for the value of user_id ) , parsing the the query each time is definitely an overhead .
In such cases use of prepared statements is most convenient .
A prepared statement is just like a typical query , except that it has ‘ placeholders ’ that are supplied values at run time .
The prepared statement in this case will look like this :
" SELECT * FROM user WHERE user_id = ? "
Notice the placeholder (‘?’ ) for the value of user_id in the query .
Now MySQL engine needs to parse the query only once , then execute it 1000 times by binding the placeholder with PHP script supplied value for user_id .
This pre-parsing of the query results in a significant performance boost .
The MySQL Improved extension in PHP , more commonly known as MySQLi , provides an API to work with prepared statements .
The documentation at the online PHP manual is good enough to get you started on how to use them on your PHP application , so I ’ll not go through it .
Instead , I am going to share the results of my personal experiments on comparing performances of traditional and prepared SQL statements .
I conducted the experiment on a demo project which has large amount of data .
I wrote two separate scripts on our development server , both of which performed the same operation : joining two related tables ( one of which has over 150,000 records , the other has 350,000 ) and fetching some data .
One script used regular SQL statement , the other employed prepared statement techniques .
Each script was executed three times and the time required to fetch the data was measured at each pass .
The First script : traditional SQL statement
// Get the Database link
$ dbLink = getDBLink ( ) ;
$ timeStart = microtime ( true ) ;
for( $i = 0 ; $ i < 162038 ; $ i++ ) {
$ query = " SELECT article_id , article_name , username as author FROM articles a LEFT JOIN user u ON ( a.author_id = u.user_id ) WHERE article_id = $ i " ;
if ( $result = $ dbLink - > query ( $ query ) )
$ obj = $ result -> fetch_object ( ) ;
else die ( " Failed to execute query : $ dbLink - > error " ) ;
$ result -> close ( ) ;
}
$ timeEnd = microTime ( true ) ;
$ dbLink -> close ( ) ;
// measure the time difference
$ timeDiff = $ timeEnd - $ timeStart ;
echo " Total time : $ timeDiff seconds " ;
Output :
First Pass ->
Total time : 25.5793459415 seconds
Second Pass ->
Total time : 25.1708009243 seconds
Third Pass ->
Total time : 25.2259421349 seconds
Average : 25.32536300023 seconds
The Second Script : using prepared statement
$ dbLink = getDBLink ( ) ;
$ query = " SELECT article_id , article_name , username as author FROM article a LEFT JOIN user u ON ( a.author_id = u.user_id ) WHERE article_id = ? " ;
$ stmt = $ dbLink -> stmt_init ( ) ;
if (!$ stmt ->prepare ( $ query ) )
die ( " Failed to prepare statement : " .$dbLink - > error ) ;
$ timeStart = microtime ( true ) ;
for( $i = 0 ; $ i < 162038 ; $ i++ ) {
// bind the parameter
$ stmt->bind_param ( ' i ' , $i ) ;
//execute the statement
$ stmt ->execute ( ) ;
// bind the result , fetch it , then free it
$ stmt->bind_result ( $ articleId , $ articleName , $ author ) ;
$ stmt -> fetch ( ) ;
$ stmt->free_result ( ) ;
}
$ timeEnd = microTime ( true ) ;
$ stmt ->close ( ) ;
$ dbLink -> close ( ) ;
// measure the time difference
$ timeDiff = $ timeEnd - $ timeStart ;
echo " Total time : $ timeDiff seconds " ;
Output :
First Pass ->
Total time : 20.1434290409 seconds
Second Pass ->
Total time : 20.182309866 seconds
Third Pass ->
Total time : 20.6448199749 seconds
Average : 20.32351962726 seconds
The task takes 20 % less time for prepared statement , a significant performance boost .
Other than performance , it can also improve application security by guarding against SQL Injections .
Check out this informative blog post on that topic .
Harrison Fisk at MySQL AB wrote a very good article on MySQL prepared statements .
Do n’t forget to check out the section ‘ When should you use prepared statement ? ’ if you read it .
New groups of species have appeared on the IUCN red list for the first time , increasing the diversity and richness of the data .
Indian tarantulas , highly prized by collectors and threatened by the international pet trade , have made their first appearance on the list .
They face habitat loss due to new roads and settlements .
The Rameshwaram parachute spider ( Poecilotheria hanumavilasumica ) has been listed as critically endangered as its natural habitat has been almost completely destroyed

It ’s true that you ca n’t always win , but I have a feeling that it ’s quite possible to always lose .
Slogging through a bit of a losing streak myself , it certainly seems that way at least .
My apricot ice cream lost , although I ’m not the least bit surprised , having watched first - hand as the tally of my competitors ’ votes swelled into impressive numbers , while my own inflated temporarily only to burst and collapse like a cheap inflatable pool toy .
I ’ve given up on entering blog raffles , as the suspense kills me and by the time some one else ’s name is announced , you ’re just beating a dead horse over here .
Nope , I have better things to pin my hopes to .
Even though I have n’t officially heard back from the lovely folks at Whole Foods about the most recent contest of theirs that I entered , I have no doubt that a gentle letter of rejection is sure to arrive any moment .
The premise for this contest was simple enough ;
Make a healthy meal for $ 4 or less per serving .
No problem , that ’s pretty much the norm around here anyways .
Savories still are n’t my forte though , so taking the safer route , I whipped up a tasty tofu dish and an easy pilaf .
Admittedly , the tofu was rather forgettable - Delicious , yes , but nothing to write home about .
It was that pilaf , a bulgur pilaf to be exact , that really got my appetite going .
I even contemplated sending in an entry of only the pilaf , since it ’s a good balance of protein , grains , and veg if you ask me , and I ’m all for one - dish meals as well .
Ginger , garlic , and miso make up a flavorful broth , which toothsome whole grain bulgur is only too happy to soak up .
Rounded out by some nutty almonds and bright green peas , it ’s a simple yet comforting dish that is agreeable to just about every palate .
It might not win any awards , but it ’s a keeper in my book .

Miso Bulgur Pilaf Print Ginger , garlic , and miso make up a flavorful broth , which toothsome whole grain bulgur is only too happy to soak up .
Rounded out by some nutty almonds and bright green peas , it ’s a simple yet comforting dish that is agreeable to just about every palate .
Prep Time 5 minutes Cook Time 25 minutes Additional Time 5 minutes Total Time 35 minutes Ingredients 1 Cup Bulgur Wheat
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
2 Cloves Garlic , Finely Minced
1/2 Teaspoon Ground Ginger
1/2 Teaspoon Lemon Zest
1 Teaspoon Soy Sauce
2 Tablespoons Brown Rice Miso Paste
1 3/4 Cups Water
1/4 Cup Frozen Peas ,
Thawed
1/2 Cup Whole Almonds , Toasted
1 Tablespoon Chopped Chives Instructions
Heat a dry skillet over the stove and toss in the bulgur .
Toast for about 10 minutes , shaking the pan occasionally to keep the bulgur moving , until it smells nutty and turns slightly darker brown .
Pour the grains out onto a plate , and place the emptied skillet back over the heat .
Add in the oil , garlic and ginger , and cook for just a minute or two until the spices have browned a bit .
Stir in the lemon zest , soy sauce , and miso paste , breaking up any lumps that may form .
Stand back a bit while slowly pouring in the water , as it may hiss and splash slightly .
Scrape everything off the bottom if it ’s sticking , and add your toasted bulgur into the mix , along with the peas .
Turn down the heat , cover , and let simmer for 15 minutes .
If all of the liquid has n’t been absorbed by then , simply continue to cook over low heat , uncovered , until it has all evaporated .
Let stand for 5 minutes off the heat , and stir in the almonds and chives .

" To help veterans who live far from VA hospitals or need specialized care the VA can't provide , McCain proposed giving low - income veterans and those who incurred injury during their service a card they could use at private hospitals .
The proposal is not an attempt to privatize the VA , as critics have alleged , but rather , an effort to improve care and access to it , he said .
Joe Violanti , legislative director of the Disabled American Veterans , a nonpartisan organization , said the proposal would increase costs because private hospitals are more expensive .
The increased cost could lead to further rationing of care , he said . "

" But the fact is I think we could go in with much smaller numbers than we had to do in the past .
But I do n't believe it 's going to be nearly the size and scope that it was in 1991 . "
( CBS News , Face the Nation , 9/15/02 )
· McCain said winning the war would be " easy . "
" I know that as successful as I believe we will be , and I believe that the success will be fairly easy , we will still lose some American young men or women . "
( CNN , 9/24/02 )
· McCain also said the actual fighting in Iraq would be easy .
" We 're not going to get into house - to - house fighting in Baghdad .
We may have to take out buildings , but we 're not going to have a bloodletting of trading American bodies for Iraqi bodies . "
( CNN , 9/29/02 )
· Continuing his pattern , McCain also said on MSNBC that we would win the war in Iraq " easily . "
" But the point is that , one , we will win this conflict .
We will win it easily . "
( MSNBC , 1/22/03 )
· McCain argued Saddam was " a threat of the first order . "
Senator McCain said that a policy of containing Iraq to blunt its weapons of mass destruction program is " unsustainable , ineffective , unworkable and dangerous . "
McCain : " I believe Iraq is a threat of the first order , and only a change of regime will make Iraq a state that does not threaten us and others , and where liberated people assume the rights and responsibilities of freedom . "
( Speech to the Center for Strategic & International Studies , 2/13/03 )
· McCain echoed Bush and Cheney 's rationale for going to war .
McCain : " We 're going to win this victory .
Tragically , we will lose American lives .
But it will be brief .
We 're going to find massive evidence of weapons of mass destruction . . .
It 's going to send the message throughout the Middle East that democracy can take hold in the Middle East . "

· March 2003 : " I believe that this conflict is still going to be relatively short . "
( NBC , Meet the Press , 3/30/03 )
McCain echoed Bush and Cheney 's talking points that the U.S. would only be in Iraq for a short time .
McCain : " It 's clear that the end is very much in sight . . .
It wo n't be long . . . it 'll be a fairly short period of time . "

STAUNCH DEFENSE OF THE IRAQ INVASION
· McCain maintained that the war was a good idea and that George W. Bush deserved " admiration . "
At the 2004 Republican National Convention , McCain , focusing on the war in Iraq , said that while weapons of mass destruction were not found , Saddam once had them and " he would have acquired them again . "
McCain said the mission in Iraq " gave hope to people long oppressed " and it was " necessary , achievable and noble . "
McCain : " For his determination to undertake it , and for his unflagging resolve to see it through to a just end , President Bush deserves not only our support , but our admiration . "
( Speech , Republican National Convention , 8/31/04 )
· Senator McCain : " The war , the invasion was not a mistake .
( Meet the Press , 1/6/08 )
· McCain said the war in Iraq was " worth " it .
Asked if the war was a good idea worth the price in blood and treasure , McCain : " It was worth getting rid of Saddam Hussein .
He had used weapons of mass destruction , and it 's clear that he was hell - bent on acquiring them . "
( Republican Debate , 1/24/08 )
· When questioned about Osama bin Laden after the 1998 U.S. missile strikes in Afghanistan , McCain surmised that the terrorist leader was n't as " bad " as " depicted . "
" You could say , Look , is this guy , Laden , really the bad guy that 's depicted ?
Most of us have never heard of him before . "
( Interview with Mother Jones magazine , 11/1998 )
· McCain was unaware of previous Sunni-Shia violence before the Iraq War .
" There 's not a history of clashes that are violent between Sunnis and Shias .
So I think they can probably get along . "
( MSNBC , Hardball , 4/23/03 )
· McCain said our military could just " muddle through " in Afghanistan .
While giving a speech , McCain was asked about Afghanistan and replied , " I am concerned about it , but I 'm not as concerned as I am about Iraq today , obviously , or I 'd be talking about Afghanistan .
But I believe that if Karzai can make the progress that he is making , that in the long term , we may muddle through in Afghanistan . "
( Speech to the Council on Foreign Relations , 11/5/03 )
· McCain stated that Sunni al Qaeda was " supported " by the Shia Iranians .
( 2/2008 )
· McCain again confused Sunni Muslim al Qaeda operatives with Shi'a Muslim insurgents .
The Washington Post reported of McCain : " He said several times that Iran , a predominately Shiite country , was supplying the mostly Sunni militant group , al - Qaeda .
In fact , officials have said they believe Iran is helping Shiite extremists in Iraq .
" Speaking to reporters in Amman , the Jordanian capital , McCain said he and two Senate colleagues traveling with him continue to be concerned about Iranian operatives ' taking al - Qaeda into Iran , training them and sending them back . '
" Pressed to elaborate , McCain said it was ' common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al - Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran , that 's well known .
And it 's unfortunate . ' "
( Press conference , Amman , Jordan , 3/18/2008 )
· Yet again , McCain demonstrated that he did n't know whether al Qaeda was a Sunni or Shiite organization .
While questioning General David Petraeus during a Senate hearing , the following exchange occurred :
But it is also true that people like Mr. Savage , who are demonstrably not bad guys , find themselves in Google ’s doghouse and then ca n’t even get the company to respond to them .
Is it any wonder that they feel treated unfairly by a ruthless monopolist ?
What makes it worse is that Google simply refuses to acknowledge that its algorithms could ever be wrong .
Could Google really treat its own customers so shabbily if it faced true competition ?
So what is Google ’s problem with Sourcetool ?
One likely possibility is that Google views Sourcetool as an example of a practice called ad arbitrage , which it frowns upon .
Those are sites that bid on search terms not to provide a service , but simply to con people into clicking through the ads on its site .
Though nobody at Google would say so directly , I got the distinct impression that Google thought Mr. Savage was practicing a form of ad arbitrage with his site .
He did , after all , bid on search terms and make his money on advertisements on his site .
But Mr. Savage is clearly offering a real service : his directory .
Indeed , in many ways , the look and feel of his site resembles that of Google ’s partner business.com .
The ways Sourcetool differs from business.com are what Mr. Savage views as his competitive advantages .
They include the way he ranks companies , and a directory page that gives information about each company .
When I pressed Mr. Fox about Sourcetool , he refused to tell me why the algorithm had problems with the site .
When I asked him why the business.com site was in the algorithm ’s good graces but Sourcetool ’s was n’t , he would n’t tell me that , either .
All I got were platitudes about the user experience .
It was n’t long before I was almost as exasperated as Mr. Savage .
How can you adapt your business model to Google ’s specs if Google wo n’t tell you what the specs are ?
Google also told me that it never made judgments of what was “ good ” and “ bad ” because it was all in the hands of the algorithm .
But that turns out not to be completely true .
Mr. Savage shared with me an e-mail message from a Google account executive to someone at another company who had run into the same kind of landing page problem as Sourcetool .
The Google account executive wrote back to say that she had looked at the site and found that “ there seems to be a wealth of valuable information on the site . ”
Consequently , her team overruled the algorithm .
The problem with monopolists , of course , is that they just ca n’t help acting like monopolists , even supposedly benign monopolists like Google and even when they are not consciously trying to rub out the competition .
They are always right and everybody else is wrong .
They have disdain for their own customers , knowing those customers have nowhere else to turn .
They tell small fry like Mr. Savage to stop bugging them .
That is how Microsoft acted a decade ago , and that , increasingly , is how Google is acting .
Half the time , the company does n’t even realize how egregious its behavior has become , which is why it feels so misunderstood when it is criticized .
Transcend yesterday introduced a capacity - barrier - smashing monster called the JetFlash V20 USB flash drive .
With the same capacity as the MacBook Air ’s costly add - on SSD , this new thumb drive is quite a marvel .
The drive measures 88 mm ( 3.4 ″ ) x 33 mm ( 1.3 ″ ) x 15 mm ( 0.6 ″ ) which is quite long compared to what we ’re used to , but for 64GB is just smashing , baby !
It weighs in at 24 grams , works with Windows , Mac and Linux over USB 2.0 ( as you ’d expect ) and features a compression and / or password protection function to keep all your classified documents … well … classified .
The JetFlash should be available shortly from Transcend ( they have the product page set up ) .
No word on pricing as yet .

The Chinese authorities last night came under fire from the United States government for their lack of tolerance after an American gold medallist was banned from visiting Beijing for the Olympic Games , which open tomorrow .
The White House press secretary , Dana Perino , said the US would complain after Joey Cheek , a speedskater who won gold in Salt Lake City in 2002 , was informed yesterday morning that his visa had been revoked , hours before he was due to travel .
Cheek is a co-founder of Team Darfur , which has encouraged 73 athletes to use the platform provided by the Olympics to protest at China 's support for the Sudanese government , which is accused of sponsoring genocide in the region .
" I did n't see it coming , " said Cheek .
" I figured once they gave me a visa , I would n't imagine they would n't allow me to come in later .
That was a big shock .
I was n't expecting to get a call the evening before I was leaving for Beijing .
I do n't begrudge them the Olympics , I think they 'll do well with them , but there are so many of their government 's policies that I find repulsive , especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else . "
The decision by a host city to stop an Olympic champion attending the Games is highly unusual , but the International Olympic Committee notably failed to censure China or offer any support for Cheek yesterday .
Giselle Davies , the IOC 's spokeswoman , said : " The Olympic Games are about the athletes , the active athletes that are competing .
Joey Cheek had no formal role and is not accredited in any capacity , so in that sense he is a normal citizen who requires a visa like any other .
As such this is really a matter for the Chinese government to respond to , not the IOC . "
Earlier in the day four US cyclists apologised to the Beijing organising committee after arriving in the city on Tuesday wearing masks .
The athletes ' statement was acutely embarrassing to the Chinese as they have been at pains all week to stress the absence of any threat to public health from pollution .
The US Olympic Committee 's chief executive , Jim Scherr , said the four cyclists had been " overly cautious " , but confirmed that the masks had been issued by his officials to around a third of the team .
President Bush angered Beijing by hosting five Chinese dissidents at the White House last week and his presence here this weekend is hugely sensitive .
Bush , who criticised China 's human rights record yesterday , is planning to cycle on the mountain bike course tomorrow before attending the opening ceremony .
The Beijing organising committee attempted to divert attention from the controversies by revealing its plans for the launch of the Games at the Bird 's Nest stadium .
More than 15,000 performers , 5,000 of them drawn from the military , will take part in a three - and - a - half hour ceremony that organisers promise will steer clear of references to recent Chinese history and focus instead on " the best of modern China " and cultural aspects of the country .
Among the performers will be the British singer Sarah Brightman , who will sing the official Beijing anthem for the first time .
The 313 - strong British team will be led into the stadium by the swimmer Mark Foster , who is competing in his fifth Games .
Foster , the first swimmer since Anita Lonsborough to carry the flag , was selected for the honour by his fellow athletes , who for the first time voted for who they would like to head the team .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Rising acidification of the ocean could reduce fertilization of marine invertebrates and might eventually wipe out colonies of sea urchins , lobsters , mussels and oysters , according to a study .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Scientists knew that ocean acidification was eating away at the shells of marine animals , but the new study has found that rising acidity hindered marine sperm from swimming to and fertilizing eggs in the ocean .
Climate change and the subsequent acidification of the world ’s oceans will significantly reduce the successful fertilization of certain marine species by the year 2100 , said the report by Australian and Swedish scientists .
“ If you look at projected rates ( of acidity ) for the year 2100 , we are finding a 25 percent reduction in fertilization , ” lead - scientist Jane Williamson from Macquarie University told Reuters on Friday .
“ We were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals , but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non-calcified structures , like a sperm or an egg , ” she said .
The surface of the ocean absorbs up to 30 percent of the world ’s yearly emissions of carbon dioxide .
Absorbed carbon dioxide forms a weak acid that is gradually increasing the acidity of the oceans .
The study of sea urchins around southeast Australia found a link between increased ocean acidity and a reduction in swimming speed and motility of sea urchin sperm .
The researchers measured sperm swimming speed , sperm motility , fertilization success and larval developmental success in sea urchins in normal seawater with a pH 8.1 and also in water with a pH 7.7 , which is projected to be the level of acidification by 2100 .
The experiment found that in water with acidity at 7.7 , the sperm swam much more slowly and began failing to meet the eggs .
fertilization fell by 25 percent and in almost 26 percent of cases where eggs were fertilized they did not survive to develop into larvae , said the study published in “ Current Biology ” .
“ It is widely believed that seawater is chemically well - buffered , but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species , ” Williamson said .
She said acidity levels of 7.7 were already occurring in patches of ocean off the west coast of the United States .
She said that when acidification rose to 7.4 , which is projected by 2300 , sea urchins failed to fertilize eggs and died .
“ The paper has looked at the projected rates within the next 80 years , but we have actually looked at higher acidification values and we have had mortality of the animals , ” she said .
“ What we have now is evidence that the world ’s marine life is far more sensitive to ocean acidification than first suspected , and that means our oceans may be very different places in the not - too - distant future , ” Williamson said .
The US military has been using drones armed with missiles in Afghanistan
At least four people have died in a suspected US missile attack on a Pakistani tribal region near the Afghan border , local officials say .
They say two unmanned US aircraft were spotted above the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan before the strikes .
There has been no comment from the Pentagon on the reports .
The United States has launched several missile strikes against suspected militant targets in the border region with Afghanistan in recent weeks .
On Thursday , a suspected US missile strike killed at least eight people in another North Waziristan village .
The United States rarely confirms or denies such attacks .
American military commanders blame militants based in the tribal areas for the increase in attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan .

The accidental governor has some bad news for New York .
It 's going to be severely indebted in the near future .
And there will be no jobs .
NY Post : New York Gov. David Paterson said Tuesday that the recession , overspending by the state and Wall Street 's meltdown will result in a record $ 47 billion deficit over the next four years .
He says the current budget 's shortfall is $ 1.5 billion and the next fiscal year beginning April 1 will include a $ 12.5 billion deficit .
A month ago , the current deficit was estimated at $ 1.2 billion .
" New York is at the epicenter of an extraordinary financial crisis on Wall Street , " Paterson said in releasing the state 's mid-year financial reports during a New York City news conference .
" We will have no choice but to take bold and aggressive action to reduce state spending . "
He said his administration projectsmore than 160,000 New Yorkers will lose their jobs during this downturn and the unemployment rate , now 5.8 percent , will reach 6.5 percent .
He said every sector of New York 's economy is expected to lose jobs , and those still employed will see weaker wages .
He said personal income is projected to decline 1 percent in 2009 and wages will drop 2.1 percent .
By comparison , he said personal income rose 6.5 percent and wages grew 8.6 percent in 2007 .

The ethanol industry owes its existence to government subsidies , and now producers of the alt - fuel want more tax dollars .
DomesticFuel.com : Ethanol plants that have been hurt by dramatic fluctuations in commodity prices this year could be eligible for assistance from the US Department of Agriculture .
Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer told reporters after an address to the World Food Prize breakfast in Des Moines Friday that “ some plants are under pressure because they ’ve been speculating on corn . ”
Really ?
Some ethanol companies , most notably VeraSun , speculated on corn prices during the summer and locked in prices when corn was at $ 7 per bushel and now cash prices are about $ 3.50 per bushel , causing some significant losses .
“ There is going to have to be some credit applied to companies to buy some lower - priced corn to blend with their higher - priced corn obligations , ” Schafer said .
This is nonsense .
A good thing to come out of the economic slowdown , at least for consumers , has been the drop in commodity prices .
Now taxpayers are being asked to bail out companies that have been hurt by the fall .
You can tell taxpayers are getting hosed , by looking at the response from those in the industry , commenting on the above article :
Exclusive Baidu is renowned as China ’s glittering internet success story , and as the start - up that gave Google a bloody nose .
It dominates the web in the world ’s second biggest economy with 70 per cent market share , and on Wall Street carries a market cap of almost $ 12bn .
But Baidu ’s success comes at a price , for the legitimate music business , for the development of China and of its intellectual property ( IP ) law , and for any internet company wishing to do business in China .
Baidu owes its success to its MP3 Search service , which takes surfers directly to music .
It ’s known as “ deep linking ” , and early this year , sound recording owners represented by IFPI filed a copyright infringement case against Baidu , claiming damages worth $ 9 m .
Baidu ’s MP3 Search means downloads too
Yet the scale of Baidu ’s operation , uncovered by a forensic six - month investigation conducted in China for The Register , has surprised the music business .
“ Although we already had some doubts about Baidu mp3 search , when we saw the investigation results presented , it was really a shock , " Susanna Ng , EMI Music Publishing Managing Director , Asia Pacific told China ’s Fortune Times .
Music searches using Baidu return results that are heavily skewed in favour of unlicensed music , while they rarely return search results for licensed music sites .
Meanwhile , the unlicensed MP3s appear to systematically move around a complex network of domains in response to infringement notices .
Chinese web surfers may be forgiven for missing the news .
Baidu fails to link to news stories critical of the company , including some of the findings below ; these have been covered only by a handful of publications within China .
It ’s a chilling reminder of the ability of a web search engine to control and shape public discourse .
We ’ll explain what Baidu does , and why it ’s in trouble .
And the grim prospects for anyone hoping to build an internet business in China — with an unstoppable Baidu .
According to the Census Bureau report , New Home Sales in August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 460 thousand .
Sales for July were revised up slightly to 520 thousand .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The first graph shows monthly new home sales ( NSA - Not Seasonally Adjusted ) .
Notice the Red columns for 2008 .
This is the lowest sales for August since 1982 .
( NSA , 39 thousand new homes were sold in August 2008 , 36 thousand were sold in August 1982 ) .
As the graph indicates , sales in 2008 are substantially worse than the previous years .
The second graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions for the last 45 years .
New Home sales have fallen off a cliff .
Sales of new one - family houses in August 2008 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 460,000 , according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
This is 11.5 percent below the revised July rate of 520,000 and is 34.5 percent below the August 2007 estimate of 702,000 .
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of August was 408,000 .
This represents a supply of 10.9 months at the current sales rate .
And one more long term graph - this one for New Home Months of Supply .
" Months of supply " is at 10.9 months .
Note that this does n't include cancellations , but that was true for the earlier periods too .
Sales are falling quickly , but inventory is declining too , so the months of supply is slightly lower than the peak of 11.2 months in March 2008 .
The all time high for Months of Supply was 11.6 months in April 1980 .
And on inventory : Inventory numbers from the Census Bureau do not include cancellations and cancellations are falling , but are still near record levels .
Note that new home inventory does not include many condos ( especially high rise condos ) , and areas with significant condo construction will have much higher inventory levels .
As I noted last month , I now expect that 2008 will be the peak of the inventory cycle ( in terms of months of supply ) and could be the bottom of the sales cycle for new home sales .
But the news is still grim for the home builders .
Usually new home sales rebound fairly quickly following a bottom ( see the 2nd graph above ) , but this time I expect a slow recovery because of the overhang of existing homes for sales ( especially distressed properties ) .
If the recession is more severe than I currently expect , new home sales might fall even further .
This is a very weak report , but as grim as the news is for new home sales , I remain more pessimistic about existing home sales , and existing home prices , than new home sales .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has suspended consular services , such as issuing visas , in Pakistan in response to a worsening security situation there , the State Department said on Thursday .
“ I think we are taking the steps in response to the security environment in Pakistan , ” State Department spokesman Robert Wood said .
A State Department official said that there had been “ a number of threats ” against American interests in the country but did not elaborate .
“ There ’s a lot of chatter going on and we ’re obviously very worried about it , ” he said .
Security has deteriorated alarmingly in Pakistan over recent months , with the military attacking al Qaeda and Taliban strongholds in the northwest , while the militants have responded with a string of bomb attacks .
A previously unknown group that claimed responsibility for a suicide truck bomb attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad last Saturday that killed 54 people said the Pakistani government should stop cooperating with the United States .
Wood said there was no connection between the suspension of U.S. consular services on Thursday and an incident on Thursday in which the Pentagon said U.S. helicopters in Afghanistan were fired on from a Pakistani military checkpoint along the border .
“ We just had the attack on the Marriott Hotel ... it ’s of great concern , ” Wood told reporters .
“ Therefore we have to look at our security posture and take those measures that we think are necessary . ”
“ I do n’t want to get into the details as to what kind of security threats we are facing out there , ” Wood said .
He said the suspension of consular services was temporary , and that emergency services for American citizens in Pakistan would continue .
In addition to its embassy in Islamabad , the United States has consulates in Lahore , Karachi and Peshawar .

When Sean Tevis decided to run for a seat in the Kansas Legislature , he faced a serious problem : money .
Local political advisors warned the campaign novice that he would need a war chest of at least $ 26,000 to compete against his entrenched Republican rival .
It seemed like a fortune to the 39 - year - old Democrat .
Everyone he knew here was either on a fixed income , worried about losing a job or fretting that the nation ’s stumbling economy could spread to this southwestern suburb of Kansas City , Kan .
So Tevis created a droll online cartoon strip to appeal to potential supporters wherever they might be , using stick figures to represent himself , his GOP opponent and others .
In one panel , a stick - figure Tevis greets a constituent by rattling off a stream of personal facts he ’s found online about her -- including her birthdate , voting pattern , divorce , paycheck , credit card balances and medical history -- to illustrate his interest in protecting individual privacy .

When she slams the door in his face , the cartoon Tevis muses , “ Maybe I should rethink my approach . ”
“ I figured I ’d raise a few thousand dollars , at most , ” for his bid to become a state representative , said Tevis , a computer systems manager who works for an industrial manufacturing company .
In fact , before he created the comic strip , Tevis spent weeks asking cash - strapped friends and family for help and walking door - to - door in the district .
He raised $ 1,525 .
The comic strip -- at www.seantevis.com/3000 -- was first posted online July 16 .
Today , when he files his campaign finance forms with the Kansas secretary of state ’s office , Tevis will report that he has raised $ 95,162.76 in donations through PayPal , the online service that allows payments and money transfers via the Internet .

Sen .
Barack Obama ’s presidential bid has transformed the way presidential candidates use the Internet to reach volunteers and donors -- particularly donors who give relatively small amounts .
Now Tevis ’ success underscores how such online grass - roots efforts are also revolutionizing down - ticket races .
“ This shows how all political races could be done in the future : drawing support across state lines and around a community of common interests , instead of just where people vote , ” said Julie Barko Germany , director of the Institute for Politics , Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University ’s Graduate School of Political Management .
“ But for something like this to work , you have to be the right counter - political candidate -- a cool maverick , ” Barko Germany said .
“ And Sean is that . ”
The strip is the antithesis of the typical campaign mailer .

It is peppered with online geek - speak , with references to “ downmodding ” ( voting down anything not considered worthwhile ) and “ forum troll ” ( someone who intentionally riles up a Web - based social group or conversation ) and gives a nod to “ Rickrolling ” ( an Internet bait - and - switch prank where people are misdirected to a Rick Astley music video ) .
It is drawn in a style similar to xkcd , a popular Web - based comic .
And its message is barely concealed exasperation with his opponent ’s social conservatism and a political process where the candidate with the most money often wins .
“ Relax , ” a bearded stick figure consoles the Tevis figure .
“ You just need 52 people who can donate $ 500 . ”
Tevis ’ character replies , “ I know two . ”

The solution , Tevis says , is simple :
If 3,000 people donated $ 8.34 each , he ’d reach his goal .
Those who gave $ 60 would get a handwritten thank - you note .
Donors who gave $ 500 , the legal limit , would get a DVD of Tevis ’ mom thanking them .
It was a long shot at best .
Seasoned Democrats in Olathe ( population about 115,000 ) , located about 20 miles southwest of Kansas City , Kan. , advised Tevis to drop his online efforts and stick with asking local residents and state political action groups for financial help .
The average state representative race rarely pulls in donations from more than a couple hundred people or PACs , according to the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission .

“ These state seats are not big - money races being run by professional politicians with dreams of higher office .
These are citizen legislators who are trying to get to Topeka because they are trying to make a change in their community , ” said Joseph Aistrup , head of the political science department at Kansas State University in Manhattan , Kan .
“ Besides , the idea of anyone outside of Kansas being interested enough in a state legislative race here to give money is unfathomable , ” Aistrup said .
Tevis initially shared the strip with a group of friends and asked them to share it with their friends if they thought it was funny and believed in his bid for office .
The comic quickly spread to social networking websites -- and the donations poured in .
In less than 24 hours , Tevis said , he reached his goal .
More than half of the funds were donations of $ 8.34 or less .

His opponent , Arlen Siegfreid , a 61 - year - old grandfather and semi-retired real estate agent , said he had raised about $ 12,000 the old - fashioned way -- offline .
He ’s proud of his approach .
“ This is a race you win by getting out and walking , not sitting in front of a computer , ” said Siegfreid , a three - term incumbent whose website offers information on how people can physically mail a check for his reelection bid .
Indeed , the strategy could backfire on Tevis , particularly if voters are put off by the idea of outsiders paying for a candidate ’s campaign , said Martin Hawver , a longtime Kansas politics - watcher who publishes Hawver ’s Capitol Report .
“ Arlen is fairly popular and a pretty conservative old - boy who represents a pretty conservative district , ” Hawver said .
“ All those people supporting Sean wo n’t be able to vote for him .
He could e-mail his heart out and still get stomped . ”

Still , Tevis ’ fundraising success had Siegfreid nervous enough to print out a copy of the comic strip and show it to a group of fellow state GOP officials .
“ I told them , ‘ If he ’s successful and wins in November , this is what you ’re going to see from every Democrat in Kansas -- and everywhere -- in two years , ’ ” Siegfreid said .
As of Saturday , 5,703 people had made online donations to Tevis ’ campaign .
The majority live outside of the state .
Fans from other countries even sent more than $ 1,700 -- which Tevis refunded , in compliance with federal election rules .
Staffers for two political candidates in Kansas and eight out - of - state campaigns -- Democrats and independents running for state or congressional seats -- have contacted Tevis in recent days to ask for help and advice .
And the money has continued to pour into Tevis ’ campaign , along with fan e-mails cheering on his campaign platform of boosting teacher pay , eliminating food taxes and protecting an individual ’s right to privacy .

“ Hilarious and awesome ! ” wrote one woman from Portland , Ore . “ I only wish my $ 10 could be more . ”
Mark Davis , a donor from West Virginia , said he was crushed by debt and had been unemployed for nearly six months .
“ Despite this , I sent my first - ever political donation to your campaign , ” he wrote .
“ My [ significant other ] and I are attempting to find jobs so that we can move to Kansas .
I can only hope I end up in your district , and can also offer you my vote . ”
Tevis sheepishly broke the news to his mother last week that she needed to step in front of a camera :
Four people so far have given enough to get the DVD .
“ All I could think was , ‘ Gosh , we still have months to go before November , and more people will probably donate money , ’ ” said Claudia Tevis Schindel .
“ That ’s a lot of thank - you cards to send out , let alone the videos .
I hope we have enough time to get it all done before people actually go vote . ”

But sometimes I want to grab just the image URL so that I could freely and easily add custom classes or ids to the image .
If you have this in mind , add the following code in your functions .
php :
function get_avatar_img_url ( ) { $ user_email = get_the_author_meta( ' user_email ' ) ; $url = ' http://gravatar.com/avatar/' . md5 ( $ user_email ) ; $url = add_query_arg ( array ( 's ' => 80 , ' d ' => ' mm ' , ) , $url ) ; return esc_url_raw ( $url ) ; }
Then somewhere in another file – perhaps single .
php or page .
php – use the following code to show the image .
$ avatar_url = get_avatar_img_url ( ) ; echo ' < img src= " ' . $ avatar_url . ' " >';
Here ’s a more detailed post to break it down for you .

This will reduce the switching of back and forth between the editor and the content output .
function my_editor_styles ( ) { add_editor_style ( ' editor-style.css ' ) ; } add_action ( ' admin_init ' , ' my_editor_styles ' ) ;
Creating Plugin Welcome Screen

Customize Jetpack Mobile
Theme

It is a special theme that is used when the website is viewed on mobile devices .
And like any other theme , we can customize it .

Display Hidden “ All Settings ”
A WordPress easter egg , this code snippet will add all settings in the WordPress database into one page .

Add Thumbnail In Post / Page Edit List
This code will display featured images you have assigned to post in the Post column .
A useful trick to see which post has a thumbnail and which does not .
Note that your theme should support post thumbnails .
Sharpening Images
Honestly , I did not know that we could sharpen images in WordPress as we are uploading the image .
Here ’s how you can , but bear in mind that it only works for JPG images .
Remove Superfluous info In The Head
WordPress adds a bunch of things in the < head > such as WordPress version , RSD Link , and Shortlink , info that ’s not all that useful .
To remove these bits of info , use this :
function remove_header_info( ) { remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' rsd_link ' ) ; remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' wlwmanifest_link ' ) ; remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' wp_generator ' ) ; remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' start_post_rel_link ' ) ; remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' index_rel_link ' ) ; remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' adjacent_posts_rel_link ' ) ; // for WordPress < 3.0 remove_action ( ' wp_head ' , ' adjacent_posts_rel_link_wp_head ' ) ; // for WordPress >= 3.0 } add_action ( ' init ' , ' remove_header_info ' ) ;
Remove either one of remove_action from the above snippet of which you want to retain .
Smart WP_Debug
Ideally you should not enable the WP_Debug in a live site as it will expose critical information .
But if you need a trick to do so safely , here it is :
if ( isset ( $ _GET [ ' debug ' ] ) && $ _GET [ ' debug ' ] == ' 1 ' ) { // enable the reporting of notices during development - E_ALL define ( ' WP_DEBUG ' , true ) ; } elseif ( isset ( $ _GET [ ' debug ' ] ) && $ _GET [ ' debug ' ] == ' 2 ' ) { // must be true for WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY to work define ( ' WP_DEBUG ' , true ) ; // force the display of errors define ( ' WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY ' , true ) ; } elseif ( isset ( $ _GET [ ' debug ' ] ) && $ _GET [ ' debug ' ] == ' 3 ' ) { // must be true for WP_DEBUG_LOG to work define ( ' WP_DEBUG ' , true ) ; // log errors to debug.log in the wp- content directory define ( ' WP_DEBUG_LOG ' , true ) ; }
With the above code added , you can enable debugging by adding ?
debug=2 , ? debug=1 , ? debug=3 at the end of the URL to see the error that occurs in your website .
Enable Shortcode In Widget
The following is a useful piece of code if you want to embed Youtube or SoundCloud in the widget area with a shortcode .
Set Default Editor ( Visual / Text )
Set the default type of editor your users can use .
Change the $ editor either to html or tinymce .
Of course , user would still be able to opt out of the default .
Prolong Auto - logout
WordPress allows one to remain logged in for 48 hours , plus an extension of 14 days if we check the “ Remember Me ” option at login .
If however you are sure your computer will not be breached by a second or third party , you can add this code to keep yourself logged in for up to a year .
You will only be prompted for a login once a year .
Always Use Figure
WordPress will wrap img with a p tag .
If you are an HTML semantic purist , you can add this code to force WordPress to wrap image with the figure element .
Change Default Role Name
“ Administrator ” , “ Author ” , and “ Subscriber ” are the names given for WordPress users at the administrative level .
To change these default names to something that sounds more apt for your website , add the following code , then make the change to the names to what you prefer :
Default Attachment Settings
Here ’s a snippet that lets you specify the default size , alignment , and the link for images you want to embed in the editor .
Custom Image Size In Media Uploader
add_image_size is the WordPress function that allows us to crop and display custom image size .
If you want to allow users to add image within this custom size , add the following codes to show the “ custom image size ” option in the WordPress media uploader .
Load Script Only If A Particular Shortcode Is Present
In a previous post we have shown you how to create a custom shortcode .
If your shortcode requires a JavaScript function , follow The Jedi Master way by Silviu - Cristian Burcă ( famously known as Scribu ) to ensure that you only load the JavaScript when the shortcode is applied .
Menu Description
When you add in a menu through Appearance >
Menu , you will see an input to add “ Description ” .
But you wo n’t find it anywhere in the front - end as we have to customize the WordPress default menu template to include the description .
Here is an elegant way to do so .
Using Dashicons
You can now use WordPress ’s very own crafted font icon , Dashicons , to add icons to the wp - admin menu .
Check out our tutorial on how to start using Dashicons .
Customize “ Howdy ” Message
Follow our previous tutorial to change the WordPress nonsensical “ howdy ” message that appears at the admin bar to something more personalized .
Exclude Post From The Jetpack Popular Widget
Jetpack comes with a widget that allows you to show the most viewed or popular posts and pages .
But sometimes your most popular pages could be the home page or a page that you do not want to include in the most viewed pile .
Add the following code to remove that page or post :
function jeherve_remove_post_top_posts ( $ posts , $ post_ids , $ count ) { foreach ( $ posts as $k => $ post ) { if ( ' 1215 ' == $ post [ ' post_id ' ] ) { unset ( $ posts [ $k ] ) ; } } return $ posts ; } add_filter ( ' jetpack_widget_get_top_posts ' , ' jeherve_remove_post_top_posts ' , 10 , 3 ) ;
Replace the ID shown in the snippet with the ID of the post or page you want to remove .
Truncate Post Title
The following snippet controls the maximum title length .
Add the following snippet in functions .
php .
Then use the function customTitle ( ) in the template to output the title in place of the WordPress the_title ( ) method .
function customTitle ( $ limit ) { $ title = get_the_title ( $ post -> ID ) ; if ( strlen ( $ title ) > $ limit ) { $ title = substr ( $ title , 0 , $ limit ) . '...'; } echo $ title ; }
If you build a WordPress
Theme with a tiled layout where the tile height has to be equal , you might want to specify the limit of the title length .
This snippet should come in handy in that case .
Remove WordPress Logo
WordPress 3.1 adds an admin bar , which includes a handful of links and the WordPress logo .
If you are going to handout websites to a client and you want it to be brandless , here is the function to remove that WordPress logo .

WASHINGTON --
With losses on bad U.S. assets alone expected to top $ 1.4 trillion , the International Monetary Fund urged global policy makers to coordinate a response to the spreading financial crisis .
The latest estimate of losses in the IMF 's Global Financial Stability Report is well above the IMF 's April prediction of $ 945 billion , which some economists considered high at the time .
It also tops the $ 1.3 trillion forecast given by Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn two weeks ago .

The latest AP - Yahoo News poll was released today and it confirms what many election watchers already know .
John McCain ’s negative campaign against Barack Obama has completely backfired .
Carrying out a negative campaign when McCain is n’t well liked has resulted in Obama ’s favorables going up , and McCain ’s going down .
This poll is a tracking poll of the responses of a 873 people whose attitudes about the election are being monitored which means that it is n’t a good barometer of who is winning or losing , because the sample was selected more based on characteristics than voting .
What this poll is useful for is getting a glimpse of the reactions of the public .
When asked about to measure the personal characteristics of the candidates , 64 % said that Barack Obama was likable compared to 49 % for John McCain .
Fifty five percent of respondents said that Barack Obama was compassionate , compared to 54 % who said that John McCain was n’t .
One of the big problems that McCain seems to have is that he does n’t inspire people .
Fifty seven percent of those surveyed that said that Barack Obama was somewhat to very inspiring .
In contrast , 61 % of those asked said that McCain is somewhat to very uninspiring .
The term refreshing was rejected by 68 % of respondents when applied to McCain , but 53 % found Obama refreshing .
It is pretty clear that these people do n’t like McCain ’s personality .
Advertisements
Obama also connects with these people better on the issue of values .
Fifty six percent said that Obama shared their values , and 61 % said that McCain does n’t share their values .
McCain still polls well on the issues leadership , experience , and terrorism , but unfortunately for him , these issues are n’t what the election is about .
I think that it is easy to laugh off this kind of poll .
It is a focus group picking which candidate they like better .
The problem for McCain is that close election tend to be decided by casual voters who make their decision based which candidate they like and connect better with .
McCain has failed to connect with people , and make them feel like he understands and cares , while Barack Obama ’s entire campaign operation revolves around connecting with the individual and making them feel like they are a part of something bigger .
John McCain ’s personality numbers look like those of Al Gore and John Kerry .
Voters are choosing which man they want to see in their homes for the next four years .
It is logical that they would pick someone that they like and feel connected to .
A liked candidate can run a negative campaign and get away with it with a smile and a wink .
For a candidate , who is not personally liked such as John McCain , a negative campaign usually backfires and hurts the attacker .
This is what ’s currently happening to John McCain .
I think every negative attack serves only to push voters away from him .
If he keeps this up , Obama will cruise to victory .

After seeing some discussion about Kernel Tracing tools in the recent Linux Kernel Summit … I found this great tech - talk .
Dtrace is like ‘ TiVo for the Kernel ’ … its been included in FreeBSD and Solaris , but Linux is unlikely to embed it directly due to the incompatibility of the GPL with Dtrace ’s licence .
Great Dtrace google talk video by one of the developers Bryan Cantrell [ his blog here ] …
Hilarious discussion of seeing into all the abstract layered levels that is software , nice demo tracing into both kernel and user space programs .
At the end he talks a while about how to view into scripting languages – normally you ’d just see rbeval [ for ruby ] or the JVM implementation – but he decribes how to extend further to Dtrace into scripting Environments .
Superb !
He makes some frank comments about the political situation of porting Dtrace to Linux .
Perhaps solution is to make a clean room GPL impl from the external API .. watch this space .
Whats immediately apparent from this talk is how useful Dtrace is for developers and sysadmins .
[ fyi , Im working on an ‘ attolisp ’ scripting implementation for vfuncs .. hmm .. now how to instrument it ?
Can you believe nanolisp , picolisp and femtolisp project names were taken !
what an embarrassment of riches ! :]
The Political Argument for Fixing VAWA Now
The difference between policy and politics is not always well understood .
Policy are the laws and strategies that politicians put in place that actually affect people .
Politics is what politicians say and do to get your vote .
It is often said good policy is good politics but this is not always true , because sometimes good policies are hard to explain to voters .
Over the past several years we having been winning the policy debate among people primarily concerned with policy , including think tanks and talk radio .
But we have made less progress with politicians , who have to think about politics to win elections .
One way to convince politicians that the politics is on their side is to show them the votes they will get by supporting a given policy .
We have calculated that 16.5 million voters , or 13.5 % of likely voters , have suffered from the abusive misuse of the Violence Against Women Act ( VAWA ) or have a loved one who has , and will vote based on that experience .
The nationwide and state by state calculations are shown below .
Further people adversely affected by VAWA , and their family members , represent a cross section of the electorate and very often feel so strongly about what happened to them that any recognition of the ways in which VAWA is misused would override all other issues , and they may very well switch their vote .
The next obvious question is how many votes will be lost by opposing the egregious flaws in the current version VAWA .
This number is harder to calculate , but based on a National Organization for Women claimed membership of 500,000 , that would leave them with less than 1/2 % of likely voters .
1 % or 2 % of likely voters would be a very generous estimate because not all NOW members support VAWA 's gender - discriminatory policies .
This small group projects an inflated image of their numbers by influencing the 85 % of likely voters who have had no direct experience with the system , and so are unfamiliar with the injustices caused by our domestic violence policies .
No one is in favor of domestic violence , and those who do n't really know anything about how our domestic violence system actually works naively believe the policies truly help domestic violence victims and do n't harm innocent citizens .
Looking at the plusses and minuses of addressing the harm caused by the loopholes and other flaws in VAWA , it seems clear that Republicans would face no loss of voters because it is unlikely these voters would ever vote for a Republican .
But even for Democrats who might consider addressing VAWA 's flaws , the politics still works in their favor .
As noted above , our calculations show that 13 .
5 % of voters have either been seriously harmed by VAWA 's flawed policies , or have had someone they love harmed by those policies .
The number of voters for whom this issue is a top priority greatly outnumbers the generous estimate of the number of voters who think the current system is just fine .
But all politicians , Democratic or Republican , must be concerned with how the message is received by the 85 % of voters who have no direct experience with DV .
In a nut shell , the truth , fair and just policies , and the numbers are all on our side .
What the other side has is an overly - simple analysis of a complex problem .
So their message , although wrong , is easier for the public to understand .
So , we too must craft a simple message for politicians , but one based on truth and justice .
One example of such a message is : " VAWA inspired DV laws clog our courts with false claims of domestic violence , which prevents true victims from getting help . "
Once a politician has been convinced that fixing VAWA will result in a net gain of votes , they will need simple and truthful messages for use in their campaigns .
Nationwide calculation People issued Protective Orders each year1 2,000,000 Percentage of false protective orders2 50 % Percentage of voting age population that votes in presidential elections3 55 % Number of close family members affected4 3 Number of years of harmful impact5 10 Total likely voters directly impacted by unjust domestic violence laws6 16,500,000 Total actual voters in 2004 presidential election 7 122,293,548 U.S. % of likely voters adversely affected by intrusive DV laws 13.5 % 1 http://www.mediaradar.org/docs/RADARreport-VAWA-Restraining-Orders.pdf, pg. 9 , estimates that 2 - 3 million temporary restraining orders are issued each year in the United States .
The low estimate was used in these calculations to account for cases in which multiple restraining orders were issued against a single individual .

The Washington Post endorses Obama
By Alex Lantier
18 October 2008
The Washington Post endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama yesterday .
Such an endorsement — by the second - most influential liberal paper after the New York Times , headquartered in the nation 's capital , and which obtained widespread support in the 1970s for uncovering the Nixon administration 's role in the Watergate affair — carries immense weight in the US political establishment .
The Post editorial explained that on two fundamental class questions — US economic and military policy — Obama could be safely trusted with the presidency .
The reasons it gave are especially significant as the Post , in line with the general drift of American politics since the 1970s , has moved far to the right , notably with its unrelenting support to the US occupation of Iraq .
On the economy , the Post saw Obama as a conservative candidate , who would " respond to the economic crisis with a healthy respect for markets " and oppose more left - leaning elements in his own party .
The Post noted the fact that Obama " has surrounded himself with top - notch , experienced , centrist economic advisers [ is ] perhaps the best guarantee that ... Mr. Obama will not ride into town determined to reinvent every policy wheel . "
According to Obama 's comments at the October 15 presidential debate , these advisers include multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett and ex-Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker .
The paper was pleased that Obama raised no protest over the Bush administration 's bitterly unpopular , multitrillion - dollar bailouts of Wall Street .
It wrote , " the country will want in its president a combination of nimbleness and steadfastness — precisely the qualities Mr. Obama has displayed during the past few weeks .
When he might have been scoring political points against the incumbent , he instead responsibly urged fellow Democrats in Congress to back Mr. Bush 's financial rescue plan . "
The Post added , " A silver lining of the financial crisis may be the flexibility it gives Mr. Obama to override some ... in his own party who oppose open trade , as well as to pursue the entitlement reform that he surely understands is needed . "
In other words , the Post calculates that Obama would use the crisis to justify cuts in social programs like Medicare and Social Security .
In foreign policy , the Post concluded " the best evidence suggests that he would seek to maintain US leadership and engagement . "
It wrote that on " most policies , such as the need to go after al - Qaeda , check Iran 's nuclear ambitions , and fight HIV / AIDS , [ Obama ] differs little from Mr. Bush or Mr. McCain . "
Its treatment of Obama 's Iraq policy is particularly significant , as Obama based his primary campaign on appeals to mass opposition to the Iraq war and criticism of the support given to it by other Democrats , such as Hillary Clinton .
The Post writes , " Mr. Obama 's greatest deviation from current policy is also our biggest worry : his insistence on withdrawing US combat troops from Iraq on a fixed timeline .
Thanks to the surge Mr. Obama opposed , it may be feasible to withdraw many troops during his first two years in office . "
The Post was clearly not overly worried , however : " if it is n't [ possible to withdraw US troops ] — and US generals have warned that the hard - won gains of the past 18 months could be lost by a precipitous withdrawal , " the Post said , it could " assume that Mr. Obama would recognize the strategic importance of success in Iraq and adjust his plans . "
Coincidentally , on the very same day the leading conservative columnist for the New York Times , David Brooks , issued his own appraisal of Obama .
In his column " Thinking about Obama , " Brooks praised Obama for being " reassuring and self - composed , " writing , " He may be liberal , but he is never wild .
His family is bourgeois .
His instinct is to flee the revolutionary gesture in favor of the six - point plan . "
Such judgments pour cold water over the panegyrics to Obama written in left - liberal circles , where the Nation and various left intellectuals present Obama as holding out the prospect of fundamental change .
Which are more realistic : their hopes , or the assessments of Brooks , Buffett , and the Washington Post ?
With less than three weeks to go before Election Day , John McCain and Barack Obama met tonight for their third and final debate , this time on the campus of Hofstra University on Long Island .
Here ’s an account of how it went down .
Wrapping It Up | 11:23 p.m .
This debate was a lot more confrontational than the first two , with Mr. McCain repeatedly taking jabs at Mr. Obama .
Whether it was enough to reverse Mr. McCain ’s sagging fortunes remains to be seen .
Mr. McCain did n’t hammer home the theme he had highlighted in the earlier debates — that Mr. Obama does n’t understand the complex and dangerous world out there .
Instead , Mr. McCain hit him , relentlessly and aggressively , with specifics , on everything from his support for abortion rights to his desire to “ spread the wealth ” around ( Robin Hood is coming ! ) .
Several of his statements also stretched the truth ; see our section for details .
Mr. Obama often turned the other cheek .
He passed up the chance to say that Gov. Sarah Palin , Mr. McCain ’s running mate , was not qualified to be president , which , polls show , many Americans believe .
And while he passed up chances to respond to some of Mr. McCain ’s attacks , he did respond to others , which seemed to lead him away from the points he wanted to make .
The cumulative effect of his three debate performances clearly suggested that he is someone who likes to play it safe .
That has not seemed to hurt him ; if anything , it has helped define who he is .
Hillary Clinton popped up on CNN after the debate , giving her review of Mr. Obama ’s performance ( “ great ” ) .
Mrs. Clinton , who had outperformed him in most of the Democratic debates during the primary season , said he was “ very steady ” and had been “ cool , calm , collected . ”
CNN asked her what it was like to sit in the audience , knowing that she had been so close to being the nominee and could have been up there on the stage herself ?
She laughed , and blew off the question .
But Mrs. Clinton was not the star of this show .
Tonight ’s Oscar goes to … Joe the Plumber !
His name cropped up almost two dozen times ( eight times as “ Joe the Plumber ” and 15 more times as Joe ) .
Read more here ( and , no doubt , in the days to follow ) .
Then get ready to watch a slugfest for the next 20 days .
p.s. : MSNBC is reporting that Joe has gone to bed .
It ’s always hard to find a plumber at this time of night .
Interactive Video and Transcript
Locating Joe | 10:44 p.m. Looks like The Associated Press reached Joe the Plumber , er , Joe Wurzelbacher , who lives near Toledo , Ohio .
He did not say who he was voting for , but did say he was surprised that he was called “ Joe the Plumber ” repeatedly during the debate .
“ It ’s pretty surreal , man , my name being mentioned in a presidential campaign , ” he is quoted as saying .
Closing Statements | 10:35 p.m. Mr. McCain says these are difficult times and then tries to co-opt the Obama campaign theme , saying , “ America needs a new direction . ”
He says he has a record of differing with his ( unnamed ) party .
He also notes there has been “ a long line of McCains ” who has served this country in war and peace .
He is trying to emphasize his family ’s service , but it ’s a surprisingly aristocratic approach to take to the presidency .
Mr. Obama also says these are tough times and Washington has been unwilling to tackle the tough problems “ for decades . ”
And he takes a page from Mr. McCain ’s playbook , applying the word “ risk ” to Mr. McCain .
“ The biggest risk we could take now , ” Mr. Obama says , would be to adopt “ the same failed policies and same failed politics ” of the last eight years .
And then it ’s over .
They shake hands .
Mr. McCain says repeatedly to Mr. Obama : “ Good job , good job , good job . ”
He then seems caught in not being able to decide which route to take to the stage from behind the desk , throwing up his hands and making a face .
Their wives now join them on stage , Mrs. McCain in Republican red , Mrs. Obama in Democratic blue .
Smoothing Things Over | 10:31 p.m. Mr. Obama ’s mode in this debate has been to try to smooth things over — he applauded Mr. McCain on torture ; he said he sought “ common ground ” on abortion ; he agreed with some of Mr. McCain ’s views on education .
This makes it harder for him to draw bright lines of distinction with his opponent .
On this topic of education , for example , Mr. McCain takes the opportunity — again — to criticize Mr. Obama , lecturing him on the subject of vouchers and then admonishing him for not having paid attention to it .
Mr. Obama comes back to say , “ Senator McCain is absolutely right ” that the school system in Washington , D.C. , is terrible , and then gets around to disagreeing with him on vouchers .
On the Attack , Again | 10:24 p.m. Mr. McCain is taking every opportunity to attack Mr. Obama .
This distracts Mr. Obama from making his own points about the economy ( or answering Mr. Schieffer ’s questions ) .
Example : Mr. McCain says Mr. Obama voted to withhold life - saving treatment from an infant ; Mr. Obama says that if it sounds “ incredible ” that he would vote that way , that ’s because it is n’t true .
The Plumber Debate | 10:20 More from Adam Nagourney :
We have had the “ you ’re no JFK ” debate .
We have had the “ are you better off ” debate .
And this one will assured be known as “ Joe the Plumber ” the debate .
The man in question is a voter who confronted Mr. Obama in Ohio about his proposal to let Mr. Bush ’s tax cut for people making over $ 250,000 a year expire in an uncomfortable conversation that got caught on videotape .
And thing is clear in this debate : Mr. McCain came in here with a plan for making Joe the Plumber the fourth character in the debate , joining Mr. Obama and Mr. Schieffer for the night .
He mentioned him 10 times in the first 15 minutes of the debate , as he sought to portray Mr. Obama as someone who was going to raise taxes on small businesses .
Mr. McCain brought him up again when the topic turned to health care , turning to the camera to address .
Even Mr. Obama addressed him .
Count on seeing a lot of coverage of Joe the Plumber over the next few days .
How that will actually play with voters and opinion - makers is another question .
This could be the defining moment Mr. McCain was looking for to portray Mr. Obama as a big - spending liberal .
On the other hand , as Mr. McCain invoked his friend again and again , it seemed just as possible that he is tonight providing new glorious videotape for Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to use in spoofing Mr. McCain in the day ’s ahead .
Litmus Test ? | 10:12 p.m. Could you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagreed with your view on abortion ?
Mr. McCain says he would n’t have a litmus test and would consider anyone and their qualifications .
But , he says , he does n’t believe that anyone who supported Roe v.
Wade would be qualified .
Mr. Obama also says he would have no litmus test .
He goes on to say he supports
Roe but does n’t say whether he would support someone who opposes it .
Reviewing the Transcript | 10:01 p.m.
Back here quickly to that earlier exchange , probably the most heated of all three debates .
Mr. Schieffer had asked : “ Are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say , toeach other ’s face , what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other ? ”
MCCAIN : Well , this has been a tough campaign .
It ’s been a very tough campaign .
And I know from my experience in many campaigns that if Senator Obama had asked — responded to my urgent request to sit down and do town - hall meetings and come before the American people , we could have done at least 10 of them by now .
When Senator Obama was first asked , he said anyplace , anytime — the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas .
So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different .
And the fact is , it ’s gotten pretty tough , and I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns .
But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable .
One of them happened just the other day , when a man I admire and respect —
I ’ve written about him — Congressman John Lewis , an American hero — made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history : segregation , deaths of children in church bombings , George Wallace .
That — that , to me , was so hurtful .
And Senator Obama , you did n’t repudiate those remarks .
Every time there ’s been an out - of - bounds remark made by a Republican , no matter where they are , I have repudiated them .
I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis .
They ’re very unfair and totally inappropriate .
( More on this exchange in Check Point ) So I want to tell you , we will run a truthful campaign .
This is a tough campaign .
And it ’s a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history , and I can prove it .
And Senator Obama , when he said — and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did .
That was back when he was a long - shot candidate .
You did n’t keep your word .
And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said , “ I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision , ” you did n’t tell the American people the truth , because you did n’t .
And that ’s — that ’s — that ’s an unfortunate part .
Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama ’s campaign than any time — OBAMA : All right .
Well , look , you know , I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough .
I think that if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people —
Bob , your network just did a poll showing that two - thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain ’s running a negative campaign versus one - third of mine .
And 100 percent , John , of your ads — 100 percent of them — have been negative .
MCCAIN : That ’s not true .
OBAMA : A hundred — it — it absolutely is true .
And — and — now , I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply .
And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate , like we ’re having tonight , about health care , about energy policy , about tax policy .
That ’s the stuff that campaigns should be made of .
The notion , though , that because we ’re not doing town - hall meetings , that justifies some of the ads that have been going up not just from your own campaign directly , John , but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations — well , I do n’t mind being attacked for the next three weeks .
Drill , Baby … or Not | 9:55 p.m. Mr. McCain is clearly trying to get under Mr. Obama ’s skin and has an easy way of slamming him .
In a discussion of foreign oil , Mr. McCain says , “ I admire his eloquence ” but you have to pay attention to his words .
He accuses Mr. Obama of equivocating about offshore drilling , by saying he would “ look at ” it .
Mr. McCain supports offshore drilling .
He also notes that Mr. Obama has “ never been south of the border . ”
Mr. Obama does n’t address the issues that Mr. McCain has raised .
A Relentless McCain | 9:50 p.m. Mr. Obama seems kind of astounded at Mr. McCain ’s repetitions of things that he thought he had put to rest — Mr. Ayers , tax increases .
Mr. Obama keeps looking at Mr. Schieffer with eyes wide , as if to say , can you believe it ?
Palin vs. Biden 9 : 46 p.m. Q :
Why would your running mate be a better president than the other guy ’s running mate ?
Mr. Obama says that Joe Biden has experience .
Mr. McCain says that Sarah Palin is a reformer .
Is she qualified to be president ?
Mr. Obama says that ’s up to the American people , but obviously she ’s a capable politician and has excited the Republican base .
Mr. McCain is asked if Mr. Biden is qualified to be president .
Mr. McCain says he is qualified “ in many respects ” but has been wrong on many foreign policy issues , like voting against the first Gulf War .
And he had a “ cockamamie idea ” about dividing Iraq into three countries .
Getting Attention , Fast | 9:43 p.m .
Our colleage , Adam Nagourney , just offered this observation :
One rule of presidential debates is , if you have what you consider a grabby line attack , try to get it out at the beginning of the night .
The idea is that is when you have the biggest audience that is paying the closest attention and newspapers writers pay more attention to the beginning of a debate than the end , as deadlines approach .
Mr. McCain clearly had that in mind at the debate tonight .
Twenty minutes into the debate , Mr. Obama began talking about the explosion of spending and the deficit under President Bush – part of his ongoing effort to link Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush – Mr. McCain began fidgeting in his seat .
He clearly had a line he wanted to deliver and nothing is going to get in his way .
The moderator , Bob Schieffer , had a question .
“ Can you balance the budget in four years , ” he asked
“ Sure I do , ” Mr. McCain said immediately and , without elaborating , delivered his sound - bite that you pretty likely will see repeated on the air over the next few days .
“ Senator Obama , I am not President Bush , ” he said .
“ If you wanted to run against President Bush you should have run four years ago . ”
Mr. Obama was not flustered .
“ Essentially , what you are proposing is eight more years of the same thing – and it has n’t worked , ” he said .
“ And the American people know it has n’t worked . ’
The Negative Campaigning | 9:30 p.m .
Will you sit here and repeat , face to face , the nasty things your campaigns are saying about each other ?
Mr. McCain says he was hurt when Representative John Lewis complained that Mr. McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin , were sowing the seeds of hatred and evoked George Wallace .
He says Mr. Obama did n’t repudiate this , but Mr. Obama did .
Mr. Obama says that Ms. Palin had prompted audiences to yell out things like “ terrorist ” and “ kill him ” and that she did n’t stop them or repudiate them .
Mr. Obama finally addresses the point about Mr. Lewis , saying he thought he inappropriately drew a comparison with Mr. Wallace .
Mr. Obama notes that he put out a statement saying the comparison was not apt and that Mr. Lewis put out a statement saying he had perhaps gone over the line .
Whose Party Is This ?
| 9:26 p.m. Mr. McCain asks Mr. Obama to say when he has stood up to Democratic leaders .
Mr. Obama points to tort reform , not popular with trial lawyers , a major constituency of the Democratic party , and says he supports clean coal , which does n’t make him popular with environmentalists .
He says Mr. McCain has been “ a vigorous supporter ” of President Bush .
“ You ’ve shown some commendable independence , on issues like torture , ” he tells him , but not on economics , and he ’s proposing eight more years of the same thing .
Mr. McCain :
Your argument for standing up to the leaders of your party is n’t very convincing .
Paying for the Deficit | 9:20 p.m .
Wo n’t you have to cut some of your proposals because of the soaring deficit ?
Mr. Obama does n’t answer the question .
Mr. McCain goes to the matter of home ownership .
Mr. Schieffer tries to reel him back in .
He says he would cut subsidies for ethanol , repeats his call for a spending freeze and again brings up that overhead projector that Mr. Obama wants for a planetarium .
Mr. Obama agrees that earmarks are bad and now , 20 minutes into the debate , links Mr. McCain to George Bush .
Mr. McCain : “ Senator Obama , I ’m not President Bush .
If you want to run against President Bush , you should have run four years ago . ”
Well - delivered line , with some anger , but he is stumbling over a lot of other words .
Maybe he ’s over - rehearsed ?
Joe the Plumber | 9:17 p.m. Mr. Obama was seen on video yesterday telling Joe Wurzelbacher that he wants to take the profits of small - business owners and “ spread the wealth around ” to those with lesser incomes .
Mr. McCain repeats this and persists in saying that Mr. Obama wants to raise taxes , and keeps referring to Joe , who in these first few minutes of the debate has become the universal middle - class taxpayer .
It ’s the Economy ….
| 9:11 p.m .
Why is your economic plan better than his ?
Mr. McCain first makes a nod to Nancy Reagan , who is in the hospital .
As for the American people , he says , “ they ’re hurting , they ’re angry , ” and they ’re innocent victims of greed on Wall Street .
He says “ angry ” several times in this first answer .
He does n’t exactly answer the question .
Mr. Obama describes a bit of his plan but also makes this point in answering the question : both he and Mr. McCain agree on easing mortgage payments but he says Mr. McCain ’s “ could be a giveaway to banks . ”
Mr. McCain comes back by bringing up a plumber named Joe Wurzelbacher who met Mr. Obama recently in Ohio .
Mr. McCain is using Joe as a vehicle to say that Mr. Obama wants to raise taxes .
Mr. Obama says he provides three times the tax cuts as Mr. McCain does .
And what he told Joe is that he wants to make sure he gets a tax break now .
The Candidates | 9:04 p.m .
And they ’re out on stage , striding toward each other .
Mr. McCain adopts Mr. Obama ’s habit of clutching his opponent ’s upper arm with his left hand while they shake hands .
The Moderator | 9:01 p.m. Bob Schieffer of CBS is coming out on the stage now .
He ’s clutching a black notebook stuffed with papers .
He pays homage to the late Tim Russert and says he regrets he is n’t there .
He says Mr. Russert would say to him , “ Can you believe it , can you believe this campaign ? ”
And Mr. Schieffer says he would answer , “ No . ”
Greetings | 8:49 p.m.
Hi everybody .
We ’re trying to prepare for life without debates , which will be the cold reality after tonight .
After all , we ’ve had about 50 of them since April of last year .
So we ’re going to savor this last face - to - face encounter between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama — and looking for some answers about the economy , which , as you probably know , took another turn for the worse today as Wall Street suffered through a huge selloff late in the day .
Even Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Fed , warned that a recovery “ will not happen right away . ”
Tune in with us at nytimes.com and watch live video , read the live blogs , see the facts checked quickly , and join the chatter .
Members of the Commission on Presidential Debates are addressing the live audience at Hofstra University now ( message : be quiet ! ) .
Among the notables in the audience : Hillary Clinton , Caroline Kennedy , Nancy Pelosi , Gov. David Patterson of New York , all on the Democratic side ; and on the Republican side , Mitt Romney and former Senator John Danforth of Missouri .
And check out Ed Koch , the former New York mayor , who got there pretty early , judging by all the empty seats around .
In 1998 , Kellogg 's briefly changed the name of Coco Pops to Choco Krispies in the United Kingdom , Republic of Ireland , and South Africa so that they could be in line with Germany and Spain , where it is known by this name .
However , after falling sales and a telephone poll in which the British public voted , its name was reverted in 1999 .
Vote Vets mailings hit McCain
The Democratic independent group Vote Vets has a harsh new trio of mailers out , going to voters in Ohio .
They feature young veterans attacking McCain for allegedly betraying their cause on education funding , funding for equipment , and the economy .
The one above hits McCain for opposing Jim Webb 's bill to increase funding for sending veterans to college , which McCain warned would reduce their incentive to become non-commissioned officers .

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday , during questioning by the Senate 's special committee on aging , that he does not believe that a housing price bubble exists on a national level in the United States .
" The notion of a bubble bursting and the whole price level coming down seems to me as far as a national nationwide phenomenon , is really quite unlikely , " Greenspan said .
He does say that it is unrealistic to believe that housing prices will increase at the current rate , but as for a bubble , he says no way .
Is he right ?
To provide an answer to this one needs to establish , or define , exactly what a bubble is .
We can define a bubble as activities that spring up on the back of loose monetary policy of the central bank .
In other words , in the absence of monetary pumping these activities would not emerge .
Since bubble activities are not self - funded , their emergence must come at the expense of various self - funded or productive activities .
This means that less real funding is left for productive activities , which in turn undermines those activities .
In short , monetary pumping gives rise to the misallocation of resources , which as a rule manifests itself through a relative increase in non-productive activities against productive activities .
When new money is created , its effect is not felt instantaneously across all market sectors .
The effect moves from one individual to another individual and thus from one market to another market .
Monetary pumping generates bubble activities across all markets as time goes by .
Once , however , the central bank tightens its monetary stance , i.e. reduces monetary pumping , this undermines various bubble activities .
The bubble bursts .
Since monetary pumping generates bubble activities across all markets , obviously the eventual bursting of the bubbles will permeate all markets — including the housing market .
As a rule the act of bursting bubbles , or the liquidation of nonproductive activities , is set in motion by a tighter monetary stance of the central bank .
A tighter stance purges various nonproductive activities thereby eliminating past excesses , which in turn lowers the ratio of nonproductive - to - productive activities , so to speak .
In short , a tighter stance brings harmony to the structure of production and sets the foundation for a sustainable economic revival .
A situation however , can occur where the bursting of bubbles takes place despite an easy stance by the central bank .
This can emerge when the pool of real funding begins to shrink .
Historically , between 1970 to 1994 there was a 12 - month lag between changes in the federal funds rate and its effect on industrial production ( see chart ) .
Since 1995 onward , the inverse correlation between the lagged fed funds rate and industrial activity ceased to exist .
We suggest that this has something to do with the possibility that the pool of real funding is in trouble .
In other words , as long as the pool of real funding is growing the loose monetary policies of the central bank appear to " work " .
This is because the nonproductive activities supported by loose monetary policies masquerade as wealth generating activities .
However , this illusion is shattered once the pool of real funding stops growing .
There is the possibility that this is what may be taking place at present .
Despite the aggressive lowering of the fed funds rate since the end of 2000 , industrial activity in relation to its long term trend has remained depressed ( see chart ) .
We suspect that the prolonged monetary abuses of the Fed may have severely undermined the ability of the economy to generate sustainable real production in the future .
In short , loose monetary policy sets in motion consumption that is not supported by a corresponding production and thereby dilutes the pool of real funding .
A major increase in US monetary pumping began in the early 80's with the advent of financial deregulation , which , for all its merits in permitting financial entrepreneurship , also removed various restrictions on banks ' lending " out of thin air . "
The quantity of money AMS in relation to the trend between 1959 – 1979 ; i.e. , the trend prior to financial deregulation , can assist in assessing the magnitude of monetary pumping since 1980 onwards .
Thus in December 2002 , money AMS stood at 181 % above the trend ( see chart ) .
This massive monetary expansion has been accompanied by a steep downtrend in the federal funds rate .
From 17.61 % reached in April 1980 , the federal funds rate had collapsed to 1.25 % as of February this year ( see chart ) .
If the pool of real funding is in trouble at present then this is likely to undermine various markets including the housing market .
Moreover , the more aggressive the Fed 's loose stance is , the worse it is for the productive capacity of the economy .
This in turn raises the likelihood that the liquidation of past excesses is likely to be imposed in earnest this time around .
Observe that the likely burst of the housing market bubble is on account of the decline in the pool of real funding and not a tighter stance on the part of the Fed .
This contradicts the popular view , which holds that as long as the Fed keeps interest rates at low levels the housing market will remain strong .
The magnitude of the housing price bubble is depicted in the following chart in terms of the median price of new houses in relation to the historical trend between 1963 –1979 .
In this regard the median price stood at 73 % above the trend in December 2002 ( see chart ) .
There are already signs that the housing market may not be far from its peak .
Purchases of new homes dipped to their lowest level in a year in January .
The Commerce Department said new home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 914,000 units in January , the slowest pace since January 2002 .
The percentage drop , at 15.1 percent , was the biggest one - month decline in nine years .
Our monetary analysis raises the likelihood that the cyclical component of home sales is likely to remain under pressure ( see chart ) .
Furthermore , year - on - year , the median price of new houses fell by 2.6 % in January after rising by 6.7 % in the previous month ( see chart ) .
Although commercial bank real estate loans remain buoyant , the likely weakening of the housing market will put a brake on the growth momentum of these loans ( see chart ) .
This in turn is likely to weaken the growth momentum of money AMS and further undermine various nonproductive activities .
There are some indications that demand for mortgages may be weakening .
The MBA mortgage applications index fell by 7.5 % in the week ending February 21 from the previous week ( see chart ) .
Moreover in the week ending February 19 commercial bank real estate loans fell by almost $ 10 billion from the previous week .

Last night , Google added Google Earth to its arsenal of iPhone / iPod Touch - invading apps and all we can say is wow .
We imagine 99 % of BGR readers have at least played with Google Earth on a computer at some point but for those few who are n’t familiar , it ’s an application that lets you look at …
The Earth .
You know , like satellite view on Google Maps but waaay more intense .
The video above is from Google ’s release announcement and it goes through a variety of cool functions that are accessible .
The movement and zoom are insanely smooth and clear on the iPhone ’s display and that tilt feature is pretty sweet as well .
Even if it is just a novelty for most , it ’s still one of those must - have apps for when people annoy you with , “ what ’s so cool about the iPhone anyway ? ”
The app is free of course and you can snag it in iTunes by hitting this link ( phobos / iTunes link alert ) or by searching Google Earth on your device .

By Roger Bolton
What is probably the oldest known Bible is being digitised , reuniting its scattered parts for the first time since its discovery 160 years ago .
It is markedly different from its modern equivalent .
What 's left out ?
The world 's oldest surviving Bible is in bits .
For 1,500 years , the Codex Sinaiticus lay undisturbed in a Sinai monastery , until it was found - or stolen , as the monks say - in 1844 and split between Egypt , Russia , Germany and Britain .
Now these different parts are to be united online and , from next July , anyone , anywhere in the world with internet access will be able to view the complete text and read a translation .
FIND OUT MORE Roger Bolton presents the Oldest Bible on Radio 4 on Monday , 6 October , at 1100 BST For those who believe the Bible is the inerrant , unaltered word of God , there will be some very uncomfortable questions to answer .
It shows there have been thousands of alterations to today 's bible .
The Codex , probably the oldest Bible we have , also has books which are missing from the Authorised Version that most Christians are familiar with today - and it does not have crucial verses relating to the Resurrection .
Anti-Semitic writings
The fact this book has survived at all is a miracle .
Before its discovery in the early 19th Century by the Indiana Jones of his day , it remained hidden in St Catherine 's Monastery since at least the 4th Century .
The monastery at the base of Mt Sinai
It survived because the desert air is ideal for preservation and because the monastery , on a Christian island in a Muslim sea , remained untouched , its walls unconquered .
Today , 30 mainly Greek Orthodox monks , dedicated to prayer , worship there , helped as in ages past by the Muslim Bedouin .
For this place is holy to three great religions : Judaism , Christianity and Islam ; a land where you can still see the Burning Bush where God spoke to Moses .
The monastery itself has the greatest library of early manuscripts outside the Vatican - some 33,000 , and a collection of icons second to none .
Not surprisingly , it is now a World Heritage Site and has been called a veritable Ark , bringing spiritual treasures safely through the turbulent centuries .
In many people 's eyes the greatest treasure is the Codex , written around the time of the first Christian Emperor Constantine .
When the different parts are digitally united next year in a £ 1 m project , anyone will be able to compare and contrast the Codex and the modern Bible .
Firstly , the Codex contains two extra books in the New Testament .
One is the little - known Shepherd of Hermas , written in Rome in the 2nd Century - the other , the Epistle of Barnabas .
This goes out of its way to claim that it was the Jews , not the Romans , who killed Jesus , and is full of anti-Semitic kindling ready to be lit .
" His blood be upon us , " Barnabas has the Jews cry .
Discrepancies
Had this remained in subsequent versions , " the suffering of Jews in the subsequent centuries would , if possible , have been even worse " , says the distinguished New Testament scholar Professor Bart Ehrman .
The suffering of Jews in the subsequent centuries would , if possible , have been even worse had the Epistle of Barnabas remained
Professor Bart Ehrman
And although many of the other alterations and differences are minor , these may take some explaining for those who believe every word comes from God .
Faced with differing texts , which is the truly authentic one ?
Mr Ehrman was a born again Bible - believing Evangelical until he read the original Greek texts and noticed some discrepancies .
The Bible we now use can't be the inerrant word of God , he says , since what we have are the sometimes mistaken words copied by fallible scribes .
" When people ask me if the Bible is the word of God I answer ' which Bible ? ' "
The Codex - and other early manuscripts - omit some mentions of ascension of Jesus into heaven , and key references to the Resurrection , which the Archbishop of Canterbury has said is essential for Christian belief .
Other differences concern how Jesus behaved .
In one passage of the Codex , Jesus is said to be " angry " as he healed a leper , whereas the modern text records him as healing with " compassion " .
Also missing is the story of the woman taken in adultery and about to be stoned - until Jesus rebuked the Pharisees ( a Jewish sect ) , inviting anyone without sin to cast the first stone .
Nor are there words of forgiveness from the cross .
Jesus does not say " Father forgive them for they know not what they do " .
Fundamentalists , who believe every word in the Bible is true , may find these differences unsettling .
But the picture is complicated .
Some argue that another early Bible , the Codex Vaticanus , is in fact older .
And there are other earlier texts of almost all the books in the bible , though none pulled together into a single volume .
Many Christians have long accepted that , while the Bible is the authoritative word of God , it is not inerrant .
Human hands always make mistakes .
" It should be regarded as a living text , something constantly changing as generation and generation tries to understand the mind of God , " says David Parker , a Christian working on digitising the Codex .
Others may take it as more evidence that the Bible is the word of man , not God .
Below is a selection of your comments :
It never ceases to amaze me that people can take what has been written by man , and altered by man , over the centuries , as being the ' inerant ' word of God .
People copy manuscripts .
People are fallible , and people make mistakes .
Surely , if there is any ' word of God ' around , it should not be possible to make any mistakes when transcribing what is there , it should not be possible to change it in anyway , and the latest version should therefore the be same as the first version .
Anne Boyce , Halifax , England A rather mocking piece .
Why does n't Roger Bolton lay his cards on the table first rather than weave them into a BBC article on the Bible ?
His final sentence summarises his opinions ; the subject and story becomes irrelevant .
Cynicus , Glasgow
This is an interesting article , but I would object to the BBC 's use of the term " fundamentalists " when you write of people who " believe every word of the Bible is true " in this article .
As a person who is a Christian and believes the message of the Bible I am of course both open and interested to read this article , but I am deeply unhappy that such a term has been used due to its modern day pejorative nature .
There are plenty of other terms that the BBC could use for this type of people which avoid the pejorative connotations of ' fundamentalist ' .
How about - evangelical Christians / Christians with a traditional understanding of the authority of Scripture ?
Bible Believing Christian , Cambridge , UK Unfortunately the Bible has always been altered by the hand of man .
The Reformation decided to leave out entire books of the Bible including Tobit , Judith , Wisdom , Ecclesiasticus , Baruch , Maccabbees 1& 2 .
Large chinks of Esther and Daniel also made it to the " cutting room floor . "
Paddy , Liverpool " ... a land where you can still see the Burning Bush where God spoke to Moses . "
Or perhaps , a bush exists which is claimed to be the one where the biblical god is alleged to have spoken to someone ( for whom there is also not a shred of evidence ) .
Sion Hughes , Northampton , UK " For those who believe the Bible is the inerrant , unaltered word of God , there will be some very uncomfortable questions to answer . "
I doubt it .
The topic has been dealt with many times through the centuries .
The best discussion IMO is in St Augustine 's ' Confessions ' ; it boils down to the argument that the contemporary bible is the true and only bible .
The fact that older ones were different is irrelevant .
bob , london
Would it be too much to ask for a balancing voice in this article ?
The codex has been studied for years and globally the evangelical church is growing faster than ever so there must be a response .
My understanding is that this codex was compiled by a Christian sect who even then was considered unorthodox and whilst it is the oldest complete bible many earlier copies of the gospels predate this codex .
It is these gospels from which modern bibles are translated .
They are both more numerous and closer in age to the events describe in the New Testement .
Frank Hill , Bristol I welcome this ( and any other ) compilation and comparison of ancient texts .
As soon as hardline views on scriptural infallibility are debunked , then Christianity will be forced to take a more organic approach to their faith , gaining some much needed credibility with agnostics in the process .
Next stop , Creationism !
Ceri Sambrook , Warwick , Great Britain Christians have known all of this for a while .
Most bibles place the story of the woman taken in adultery in brackets and state that the earliest and most reliable manuscripts do not contain the story .
They also state that the ascension account in Mark 's gospel is unreliable .
This is old news and there were other reasons why the 2 " extra " books were not passed by the council of Nicea .
Please check your facts before publsihnig the story .
Emma , Sheffield Concerning
" His blood be upon us " , the distinguished New Testament scholar Professor Bart Ehrman needs to get his facts right before making such bold assertions .
Obviously he 's never read Matthew 27:25 , which is exactly the verse he states is missing from modern versions of the Bible ( unless he 's been misquoted of course ) .
Martin Could we have a balanced article , please ?
Christians have known about these documents for over a century and yet there are still many of us , evangelicals ( not necessarily fundamentalists ) who believe the bible is God 's word .
Could we not have had a response in your article explaining some of these things ?
Robin , Winsford Asking Bart Ehrman for objective comment on Biblical matters is rather like asking Sarah Palin to provide a Presidential job appraisal for Barack Obama .
It 's long been known that the story of the woman taken in adultery was not in all copies of the Bible so why does anyone think it 's an issue ?
Professor Ehrman is doing precisely what he accuses others of doing , trying to make a point in support of his own opinion .
Philip Thomas , Merseyside Didn't they also find the missing page that says ' All characters depicted in this book are purely ficticious and any resemblence to anyone alive or dead is purely co-incidental . '
George , Maidenhead
The current Bible is God 's word .
Of course it was written by man , but it was breathed into life by God .
The way that it has over time , evolved into is present form is not important .
Only those scriptures , in the form that God intended , have presently become the Bible .
What is important is that the message that God intended is there for us all , and it has the power to change lives .

What are these ?
In the past few years I have heard more people than ever before puzzling over the 24/7 coverage of people such as Paris Hilton who are “ celebrities ” for no apparent reason other than we know who they are .
And yet we ca n’t look away .
The press about these individuals ’ lives continues because people are obviously tuning in .
Although many social critics have bemoaned this explosion of popular culture as if it reflects some kind of collective character flaw , it is in fact nothing more than the inevitable outcome of the collision between 21st - century media and Stone Age minds .
Just like flat - screen televisions , cell phones and computers , global positioning system ( GPS ) technology is becoming something people can't imagine living without .
So if such a ubiquitous system were to come under attack , would we be ready ?
It 's an uncomfortable question , but one that a group of Cornell researchers have considered with their research into " spoofing " GPS receivers .
GPS is a U.S. navigation system of more than 30 satellites circling Earth twice a day in specific orbits , transmitting signals to receivers on land , sea and in air to calculate their exact locations .
" Spoofing , " a not - quite - technical term first coined in the radar community , is the transmission of fake GPS signals that receivers accept as authentic ones .
The Cornell researchers , after more than a year of building equipment and experimenting in Rhodes Hall , presented a paper on their findings at a meeting of the Institute of Navigation , Sept. 19 in Savannah , Ga .
To demonstrate how a navigation device can be fooled , the researchers , led by Cornell professors Paul Kintner and Mark Psiaki , programmed a briefcase - size GPS receiver , used in ionospheric research , to send out fake signals .
Paper co-authors Brent Ledvina , Cornell Ph.D. '07 and now an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Virginia Tech , and first author Todd Humphreys , Cornell Ph.D. ' 07 , described how the " phony " receiver could be placed in the proximity of a navigation device , where it would track , modify , and retransmit the signals being transmitted from the GPS satellite constellation .
Gradually , the " victim " navigation device would take the counterfeit navigation signals for the real thing .

Handheld GPS receivers are popular for their usefulness in navigating unfamiliar highways or backpacking into wilderness areas .
But GPS is also embedded in the world 's technological fabric .
Such large commercial enterprises as utility companies and financial institutions have made GPS an essential part of their operations .
" GPS is woven into our technology infrastructure , just like the power grid or the water system , " said Kintner , Cornell professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of the Cornell GPS Laboratory .
" If it were attacked , there would be a serious impact . "
By demonstrating the vulnerability of receivers to spoofing , the researchers believe they can help devise methods to guard against such attacks .
" Our goal is to inspire people who design GPS hardware to think about ways to make it so the kinds of things we 're showing can be overcome , " said Psiaki , Cornell professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering .
The idea of GPS receiver spoofing is n't new ; in fact , the U.S. government addressed the issue in a December 2003 report detailing seven " countermeasures " against such an attack .
But , according to the researchers , such countermeasures would not have successfully guarded against the signals produced by their reprogrammed receiver .
" We 're fairly certain we could spoof all of these , and that 's the value of our work , " Humphreys said .
“ It ’s past time to come to the unfairly maligned white America ’s defense , ” said Frank Rich in The New York Times .
John McCain ’s campaign has pandered to what it sees as the “ real , ” or presumably racist , America .
But Obama ’s surge in the polls — he ’s now pulling even with McCain among white men — shows that Americans are not the “ easily manipulated bigots ” our “ divisive politicians ” think we are .
There is one group of Americans that remains obsessed with race , said David Boaz in the British daily Guardian : liberal journalists .
Absent any evidence , they have cited comments by a few McCain supporters as proof that the Republican campaign has been race - baiting , but racism is “ the dog that did n't bark ” in this campaign .
Racism is still around , said Andrew Sullivan in The Times of London , but it wo n’t swing the election this year .
Obama ’s whole campaign was “ deliberately crafted to cross racial and gender and geographic lines , ” and it ’s improbable success speaks , thankfully , to the decline of “ racial and identity politics ” in America .
Although some people regard C++ as the COBOL of the 21st century , it remains a force to be reckoned with in commercial development .
For example it is currently ranked fourth in the language related tags on stackoverflow.com ( despite the apparent biases of Stackoverflow owners Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky towards web and .
Net oriented languages ) :

C++ has been one of the top commercial languages for a long time .
But the world of computer software and hardware is changing fast and languages have to evolve to stay relevant .
The first major revision to the C++ standard in a decade , known as C++ 0x , is expected be finalised in 2009 ( otherwise the x will have to be hex ) .
The draft standard includes lots of additions to the language and standard libraries , including : lambdas ; closures ; static ( compile time ) asserts ; concepts ; automatic types ; variadic templates ; a regular expressions library and improved threading support .
Automatic garbage collection is notable by its absence .
For working C++ developers the new standard only really becomes important when it becomes available in mainstream compilers such as Visual C++ and Gnu C++.
As Gnu C++ already has experimental support for C++ 0 x and Microsoft released a preview of Visual Studio 2010 at PDC last month with support for some of new features it might be a good time to start paying attention to the new standard .
You do n’t want to look like an idiot next time one your colleagues starts talking about ‘ lambdas ’ , do you ?
I illustrate a few of the new features below .
I have done this mainly as a way of understanding them better myself , not because I claim any sort of expertise on the new standard .
Lambdas and closures
A ‘ lambda ’ is an unnamed function , for example :
std::vector<int> values = getValues ( ) ;
std::for_each( values.begin( ) , values.end ( ) , [ ] ( int n ) { cout << n << std::endl ; } ) ;
Lambdas can reference in - scope variables , for example :
std::vector<int> values = getValues ( ) ;
int total = 0 ;
std::for_each( values.begin( ) , values.end ( ) , [ &total ] ( int n ) { total += n } ) ;
This is known as a ‘ closure ’ .
Of course , all of this can be done with standard function calls , but lambdas are undoubtedly more compact and elegant .
I am not convinced that they will make code any clearer or easier to debug or maintain however .
Automatic types
Automatic typing allows the compiler to infer a type .
For example :
std::vector<int> values = getValues ( ) ;
for ( std::vector<int>::const_iterator it = values.begin( ) ; it != values.end ( ) ; ++it ) { f( it ) ; }
Can be re-written as :
auto values = getValues ( ) ;
for ( auto it = values . begin ( ) ; it != values.end ( ) ; ++it ) { f( it ) ; }
Automatic types seem like an excellent way to let the compiler take some of the drudgery out of programming .
Concepts
Template error messages have improved over the years , but they can still be obscure .
A ‘ concept ’ is a way to clearly define what types a templated class or function will accept .
For example :
template < typename T> requires LessThanComparable <T>
const T& min( const T &x , const T &y )
{
return y < x ? y : x ;
}
Specifies that min( ) will only accept types that support the concept LessThanComparable .
LessThanComparable can then be defined so that the type must support the < operator :
auto concept LessThanComparable < typename T >
{
bool operator <( T , T ) ;
}
Hopefully concepts will allow better defined template interfaces and clearer error messages .
Concurrency
The current C++ standard makes no real allowances for concurrency .
This is a major problem in a world where multi-core CPUs are standard .
The new standard will introduce a memory model that supports threading and a standard threading library .
Summary
C++ has many strengths .
It scores quite highly on performance , expressiveness and portability , has an extensive tool and library ‘ ecosystem ’ and a proven track record in large scale system development .
But it is also a sprawling and complex language , hobbled by many shortcomings inherited from its progenitor C ( a language dating back to the early seventies ) .
It is n’t clear to me whether the new standard will add enough features to keep C++ competitive as a commercial language for another decade .
Or whether C++ will be regarded as a legacy language , too bloated and complex to attract new developers given the choice of simpler and more elegant languages .
Time will tell .

C++ 0 x article on wikipedia
NEW YORK / HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - MidAmerican Energy Holdings
Co , a unit of U.S. billionaire investor Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N , said it would pay $ 230 million for a 10 percent stake in Chinese rechargeable battery firm BYD Co Ltd 1211 .
HK to support its ' green ' technologies .
The deal gives MidAmerican a foothold in the Hong Kong - listed company which is developing electric - hybrid cars it expects to start selling in China later this year and Europe by 2010 .
“ Mr. Wang Chuanfu has an extraordinary managerial record , and we welcome the opportunity to work with him , ” Buffett , the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire said in a statement , referring to the chairman of BYD .
David Sokol , chairman of MidAmerican , said the technologies being developed by BYD will be an integral part of the future for the care of the environment especially relating to global climate change .
Shares in BYD closed on Friday at HK $ 8.40 , valuing the stake of 225 million shares at about HK $ 1.890 billion ( $ 243 million ) at its last traded price .
The stock traded as high as HK $ 20.45 in October last year .
“ The news is positive as the investment is big , ” Frederick Wong , analyst at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong said .
Wong said BYD ’s capital expenditure had been high in the past 1 - 2 years and needed funding for development .
“ ( The investment ) will help the company ’s fundamentals , ” Wong said .
BNP had trimmed its target price of BYD , which also has a mobile phone unit , by 27 percent to HK$ 8.00 to reflect worst - than - expected macro handset demand and its bearish view on margins , it said in a note written by Wong on Sept 5 .
But BNP also believed BYD deserved a 20 percent premium over the sector average because BYD had explosive revenue growth in both the automotive and handset businesses despite earnings growth momentum being dragged down by a deteriorating gross margin .
Hong Kong - listed BYD has invested in the manufacturing of electric cars in China and plans to sell the cars to overseas markets .
Israel 's Clal Industries and Investments CII .TA , a unit of conglomerate IDB Development IDBD.TA , said on Thursday it signed a deal to import electric cars from BYD and sell them in Israel .
BYD ’s electric cars are expected in Israel and Europe by 2010 .
The firm has said the cars could travel 300 km ( 190 miles ) on a single charge .
A full charge needs nine hours using its lithium - ion batteries , although they could be charged to 80 percent capacity in 15 minutes .

Actress Bonnie Somerville Held At Gunpoint , Boyfriend Shot
Actressand her boyfriend were guests at the T - Mobile G1 launch party on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood last night .
They walked to the valet parking area to retrieve their car at 2:00 a.m. when they were held at gunpoint by two assailants who demanded money .
Somerville 's boyfriend argued with the men and Somerville was reluctant to turn over her purse .
A scuffle ensued and the boyfriend was shot in the back with a .22 caliber handgun .
The two assailants then fled in a tan colored sports utility vehicle and are still at large , reportedly without getting any money from the pair .
Somerville 's injured friend was rushed to Cedars - Sinai Medical Center where he is listed in good condition .
His identity has not been released by police .
Bonnie 's publicist says that Bonnie is fine and will issue a statement at the end of the weekend .
Bonnie made several guest appearances on the popular sitcom Friends , where she played Ross ' girlfriend Mona .
She has also appeared on NYPD Blue , Grosse Pointe and The O.C .
Bonnie is also a singer with the Band From TV , a group comprised of actors Greg Grunberg , Bob Guiney , James Denton , Hugh Laurie , Barry Sarna , Brad Savage , Rich Winer and Chris Kelley .
Check out photos of Bonnie , including those with green background that were taken at the T - Mobile G1 party prior to the robbery attempt .

C __LINE__ equivalent in Python I started using this recently .
If you do a lot of Python , you ’ll sometimes find yourself desperate for breadcrumbs , little print statements scattered throughout your code as you try to figure what you told it to do , since it ’s obviously not doing what you want it to do .
I ’d used inspect previously to unravel exception handlers ; there ’s a customized one inside the Isilon UI , so if the product fails in the field the exception will be logged to a file for later analysis , but this is a nice little routine .
It ’s basically a pythonic version of the C __LINE__ macro .
Wherever you think you might need a debugging statement , put if DEBUG : print _line ( ) , foo , bar , baz and you ’ll not only get the fields you want to see , but also the name of the function / method , and the line number of the print statement .
import inspect def _line ( ) : info = inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe ( ) . f_back ) [ 0:3 ] return '[ %s : %d ] ' % ( info [ 2 ] , info [ 1 ] )
Use as needed .

I thought f_lineno gave you the first line of the current method , not the current line .
From : tamino Date : September 24th , 2008 05:26 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Nope -- if you look at what inspect .
getframeinfo is doing , it 's getting it from f_lineno ( as well as doing a bunch of other work to assemble information that you 're discarding , and the gathering of which will slow things down )
You may be thinking of the f_lineno member of the python frame struct in C .
You 're right that that does n't get updated on every line , but if you access it from within python , yes , it 'll make sure it 's up to date before it returns the value to you .
Incidentally , in gdb , where you * do * have to worry about these issues , I use :
p ( char *)((( PyStringObject *)f->f_code->co_filename )->ob_sval )
p PyCode_Addr2Line(f-> f_code , f->f_lasti )
the latter of which does the actual magic to get the correct line number ( f -> f_lineno will likely be out of date ) .

Brokered deposits are included in this transaction .
Branches in West Virginia will reopen on Monday .
Ohio branches will reopen on Saturday .
Over the weekend , customers of the banks can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards .
Checks drawn on the banks will be processed normally .
Loan customers should continue to make loan payments as usual .
Pioneer Community Bank , Inc. , and The Citizen 's Saving Banks ' acquisition of all deposits was the " least costly " resolution for the Deposit Insurance Fund compared to all alternatives because the expected losses to uninsured depositors were fully covered by the premium paid for the banks ' franchises .
As of June 30 , 2008 , Ameribank , Inc. had total assets of $ 115 million and total deposits of $ 102 million .

I grew up with Jim Henson .
I never met him , but I watched so many episodes of Sesame Street I could n’t possibly count them , and saw every episode of The Muppet Show when I was a bit older .
Over the years I read a lot about him , enjoyed the Muppet movies , saw and loved The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth , and so was among the millions who were devastated when he suddenly died in 1990 .
I introduced my kids to The Muppet Show last year , and was thrilled when they fell as much in love with it as I had .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
I read last year about Jim Henson ’s Fantastic World , a traveling Smithsonian Institution exhibit dedicated not only to Henson ’s career but also to the imaginative process he took to come up with his innovative ideas and the way he matured those ideas into such amazing results .
When it came to the Smithsonian itself in Washington , D.C. , I made plans to go with my family .
We went this past weekend , and it was , as advertised , fantastic .
The exhibit includes quite a few Muppets , including Ernie and Bert , Rowlf , and , of course , Kermit .
There were puppets from some of the pre-Muppet commercials Henson made , which were shown on a looped movie in the exhibit , and , truthfully , except for pushing a product they are the equal of many Muppet Show sketches .
There were representatives from some of his later works , including several Fraggles and creatures from The Dark Crystal .
For me , though , the highlight of the show was the arrays of hand - drawn cartoons , mostly done by Henson himself , around the walls of the exhibit .
The cartoons showed his thought processes , how he built characters and then built stories around them .
You could see his handwritten notes for the other Muppeteers or for what became the Creature Shop .
They had a page of drawings showing the evolution of the original idea for Animal from a rough sketch to something very close to the Muppet we know and love .
I really want to go back before it leaves D.C. , because with the kids going back and forth from place to place I did n’t get as much time to look at the drawings as I would have liked .
The exhibit has an excellent resource room , with books for ( mostly ) adults to look through of information about Henson ’s life and work , and lots of stuff for kids :
A wall where they could create their own Muppet - like faces ; a table where they could draw their own storyboards ; and , most popular of all , a puppet theater with a ( heavily protected ) video camera in front of it , so the kids can see what it ’s like to be a performer and a director , and they even send the video feed to the other side of the room so the kids really feel like they ’re on TV .
Really , there were only two things I disliked about the exhibit :
That they prohibit photography in it , which I suspect is mostly to prevent the light from flashes from harming the Muppets and the paper ; and that the exhibit shop was devoted almost entirely to Sesame Street merchandise .
Jim Henson ’s Fantastic World leaves D.C. on October 5 , and heads to Atlanta .
In 2009 and 2010 it will go on to visit Orlando , Seattle ( at the Science Fiction Museum ) , Pennsylvania , Mississippi , Massachusetts , Fresno , and finally Chicago .
If it ’s going to be near enough to you that you can get to it , I highly recommend you go .
Until you get a chance to , there is an excellent podcast you can listen to that will whet your appetite .
( This is n’t directly related to the exhibit , but it goes to show just what kind of effect Henson had on people :
There are two videos after the jump , from the 1990 memorial service for Jim Henson , in which at his direction nobody wore black and there was plenty of music .
I defy anyone who enjoys the Muppets to watch these videos and not get just a bit choked up . )
SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
OSPA believes that everyone deserves to be given the information that they need to keep them and those around them safe .
The world 's turned upside down .
For generations of Americans , family homes were assets to be bequeathed to our children .
Today , instead , we are proposing to leave them billions of dollars in long - term debt issued by the federal government to prop up a housing market gone bad .
This is unfair .
Moreover , while the rescue plan may help the balance sheets of financial institutions , it does nothing to help the balance sheets of households .
Their problems must be addressed .

A friend of mine recently sent me this link for the “ color test .
” I get this or a similar link every now and then .
It is a fun little neurological game , and I am always intrigued by the pop -neuro explanations that come along with it .
Go ahead – take the test , then come back … .
This color test is an old neuro - psychological test known as the Stroop test , and the effect is known as the Stroop Effect after John Ridley Stroop who first published about the effect in English in 1935 .
As is common , the effect was first described as a neuro - psychological phenomenon and then efforts were made to explain the effect as a consequence of neuroanatomy – how the brain is hardwired and how the different parts of the brain work together .
That is where the pop -neuro comes into play .
All the sites I found that used the effect as a party game gave the same wrong explanation for the effect – that it is a demonstration of the right - brain / left - brain “ struggle ” or interaction .
This site explains the effect this way :
Actually , this test is checking your brains ability to separate the left brain functions and right brain functions .
The problem is that the left side of your brain is trying to tell you to read the word , while at the same time , the right side of your brain is trying to tell you to identify the color !!!
This makes me wonder if the author copied this explanation from another site , or just made it up because it sounds good .
The Stroop Effect does indeed represent processing that is occurring in the brain to rectify different imperatives , but it has nothing to do with the left - brain / right - brain thing .
The effect , as it is currently understood , is a matter of attention .
A better paradigm for understanding this effect rather than left / right is top - down , or the hierarchical organization of the brain .
Our brains mostly function subconsciously – you do n’t have to pay attention in order to breath , walk , or process visual input .
At the same time the highest brain functions allow us to attend to a subset of the sensory information coming in , our internal thought , and even many of our automatic functions .
You can voluntary control your breathing if you attend to it , otherwise your primitive brainstem will happily breathe on its own without your conscious control .
What is happening with the Stroop Effect is a phenomenon called interference .
You are being asked to attend to the color of the “ ink ” of the words , and not to the words themselves .
However , it is actually impossible to turn off the reading of words once you learn how to read .
The process of translating letters into words becomes so automatic that we cannot stop that part of our language center from doing it .
It is thought , in fact , that most people do not even have the pathways in the brain that would enable us to inhibit that part of language function – it is literally impossible .
This is supported by experimental evidence that the Stroop Effect – which specifically refers to the delay in naming or clicking the “ ink ” color for color words – is always present .
There are no experimental conditions that make it go away .
( As an aside , I was told by Terrence Hines that he found a small number of people who can be hypnotized to make the Stroop Effect go away – the first time this has been described – and he surmises they have a variant of hardwiring that allows this .
However , I do not have the reference for this – so take it as hearsay for now . )
In fact this effect is so reliable that it has been used to catch spies .
If a Russian agent is pretending to be American they can be tested to see if they exhibit the Stroop Effect for Russian words .
If you cannot read a language , there will be no delay ; if you can then you cannot avoid the delay .
What is happening then is that we are being confronted with conflicting stimuli – the color and the word .
We then have to consciously suppress the word and respond to the color .
But this takes an attentional effort and requires a finite amount of processing time that is unavoidable – hence the Stroop Effect .
What the test is really measuring ( assuming literacy in the language tested ) is attention , or mental effort – the highest order mental function in our brain hierarchy .
That this effect is wrongly explained on popular sites as a left - brain / right - brain conflict reflects the popularity of this concept .
It is a highly overused concept , and is simply wrong in this case .
Language is indeed typically encoded in the left temporal lobe ( although about 5 % of people are dominant for language on the right side and this is more common in left - handers ) .
But color is not a right - brain process .
Both hemispheres ( the occipital lobes specifically ) are able to see and process color information .
This common error also reflects the fact the we tend to explain phenomena with the explanatory models we have at hand .
We are always , in fact , limited by our current repertoire of explanatory models or paradigms , because our understanding of the universe will never be complete .
The history of scientific progress reflects a tendency to explain as much as possible within current paradigms .
If , however , those paradigms or insufficient eventually they will reach their limits .
New modes of explanation will then have to be created – and this is the most creative and difficult aspect of science .
The most dramatic example of this of which I am aware was the crisis of classical physics that required Einstein and others to develop the new paradigms of relativity and quantum mechanics to solve .
Often , however , explanatory models are incrementally expanded , without the drama of a crisis of impasse and a bold new theory to smash old ideas .
Also – sometimes the evidence suggests new modes of explanation before anyone realizes the inadequacy of the old modes .
For example , Mendel discovered that heredity was digital rather than analog – meaning that some genetic traits were inherited in an all - or - none fashion ( through genes ) , rather than an infinite blending of the traits from both parents .
The left - brain / right - brain notion is stuck in popular culture , but is mostly wrong .
The real interaction among various brain structures is far more complex and interesting .
But it is common for scientific concepts to trickle down to the popular culture through various imperfect media , where they are distorted and over - simplified into mostly wrong soundbites .
I have therefore come to believe , through my own experience and by observing others , that for any complex topic ( whether scientific , some other academic speciality , or any other developed set of knowledge ) which I have not studied from primary sources or experts , that whatever knowledge I have gleaned from the popular culture is almost certainly mostly wrong .
In early September , when Sarah Palin , the Republican candidate for Vice - President , announced that her unwed seventeen - year - old daughter , Bristol , was pregnant , many liberals were shocked , not by the revelation but by the reaction to it .
They expected the news to dismay the evangelical voters that John McCain was courting with his choice of Palin .
Yet reports from the floor of the Republican Convention , in St. Paul , quoted dozens of delegates who seemed unfazed , or even buoyed , by the news .
A delegate from Louisiana told CBS News , “ Like so many other American families who are in the same situation , I think it ’s great that she instilled in her daughter the values to have the child and not to sneak off someplace and have an abortion . ”
A Mississippi delegate claimed that “ even though young children are making that decision to become pregnant , they ’ve also decided to take responsibility for their actions and decided to follow up with that and get married and raise this child . ”
Palin ’s family drama , delegates said , was similar to the experience of many socially conservative Christian families .
As Marlys Popma , the head of evangelical outreach for the McCain campaign , told National Review , “ There has n’t been one evangelical family that has n’t gone through some sort of situation . ”
In fact , it was Popma ’s own “ crisis pregnancy ” that had brought her into the movement in the first place .
During the campaign , the media has largely respected calls to treat Bristol Palin ’s pregnancy as a private matter .
But the reactions to it have exposed a cultural rift that mirrors America ’s dominant political divide .
Social liberals in the country ’s “ blue states ” tend to support sex education and are not particularly troubled by the idea that many teen - agers have sex before marriage , but would regard a teen - age daughter ’s pregnancy as devastating news .
And the social conservatives in “ red states ” generally advocate abstinence - only education and denounce sex before marriage , but are relatively unruffled if a teen - ager becomes pregnant , as long as she does n’t choose to have an abortion .
A handful of social scientists and family - law scholars have recently begun looking closely at this split .
Last year , Mark Regnerus , a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin , published a startling book called “ Forbidden Fruit : Sex and Religion in the Lives of American Teenagers , ” and he is working on a follow - up that includes a section titled “ Red Sex , Blue Sex . ”
His findings are drawn from a national survey that Regnerus and his colleagues conducted of some thirty - four hundred thirteen - to - seventeen - year - olds , and from a comprehensive government study of adolescent health known as Add Health .
Regnerus argues that religion is a good indicator of attitudes toward sex , but a poor one of sexual behavior , and that this gap is especially wide among teen - agers who identify themselves as evangelical .
The vast majority of white evangelical adolescents — seventy - four per cent — say that they believe in abstaining from sex before marriage .
( Only half of mainline Protestants , and a quarter of Jews , say that they believe in abstinence . )
Moreover , among the major religious groups , evangelical virgins are the least likely to anticipate that sex will be pleasurable , and the most likely to believe that having sex will cause their partners to lose respect for them .
( Jews most often cite pleasure as a reason to have sex , and say that an unplanned pregnancy would be an embarrassment . )
But , according to Add Health data , evangelical teen - agers are more sexually active than Mormons , mainline Protestants , and Jews .
On average , white evangelical Protestants make their “ sexual début ” — to use the festive term of social - science researchers — shortly after turning sixteen .
Among major religious groups , only black Protestants begin having sex earlier .
Another key difference in behavior , Regnerus reports , is that evangelical Protestant teen - agers are significantly less likely than other groups to use contraception .
This could be because evangelicals are also among the most likely to believe that using contraception will send the message that they are looking for sex .
It could also be because many evangelicals are steeped in the abstinence movement ’s warnings that condoms wo n’t actually protect them from pregnancy or venereal disease .
More provocatively , Regnerus found that only half of sexually active teen - agers who say that they seek guidance from God or the Scriptures when making a tough decision report using contraception every time .
By contrast , sixty - nine per cent of sexually active youth who say that they most often follow the counsel of a parent or another trusted adult consistently use protection .
The gulf between sexual belief and sexual behavior becomes apparent , too , when you look at the outcomes of abstinence - pledge movements .
Nationwide , according to a 2001 estimate , some two and a half million people have taken a pledge to remain celibate until marriage .
Usually , they do so under the auspices of movements such as True Love Waits or the Silver Ring Thing .
Sometimes , they make their vows at big rallies featuring Christian pop stars and laser light shows , or at purity balls , where girls in frothy dresses exchange rings with their fathers , who vow to help them remain virgins until the day they marry .
More than half of those who take such pledges — which , unlike abstinence - only classes in public schools , are explicitly Christian — end up having sex before marriage , and not usually with their future spouse .
The movement is not the complete washout its critics portray it as : pledgers delay sex eighteen months longer than non-pledgers , and have fewer partners .
Yet , according to the sociologists Peter Bearman , of Columbia University , and Hannah Brückner , of Yale , communities with high rates of pledging also have high rates of S.T.D.s .
This could be because more teens pledge in communities where they perceive more danger from sex ( in which case the pledge is doing some good ) ; or it could be because fewer people in these communities use condoms when they break the pledge .
Bearman and Brückner have also identified a peculiar dilemma : in some schools , if too many teens pledge , the effort basically collapses .
Pledgers apparently gather strength from the sense that they are an embattled minority ; once their numbers exceed thirty per cent , and proclaimed chastity becomes the norm , that special identity is lost .
With such a fragile formula , it ’s hard to imagine how educators can ever get it right : once the self - proclaimed virgin clique hits the thirty - one - per - cent mark , suddenly it ’s Sodom and Gomorrah .
Religious belief apparently does make a potent difference in behavior for one group of evangelical teen - agers : those who score highest on measures of religiosity — such as how often they go to church , or how often they pray at home .
But many Americans who identify themselves as evangelicals , and who hold socially conservative beliefs , are n’t deeply observant .
Even more important than religious conviction , Regnerus argues , is how “ embedded ” a teen - ager is in a network of friends , family , and institutions that reinforce his or her goal of delaying sex , and that offer a plausible alternative to America ’s sexed - up consumer culture .
A church , of course , is n’t the only way to provide a cohesive sense of community .
Close - knit families make a difference .
Teen - agers who live with both biological parents are more likely to be virgins than those who do not .
And adolescents who say that their families understand them , pay attention to their concerns , and have fun with them are more likely to delay intercourse , regardless of religiosity .
A terrific 2005 documentary , “ The Education of Shelby Knox , ” tells the story of a teen - ager from a Southern Baptist family in Lubbock , Texas , who has taken a True Love Waits pledge .
To the chagrin of her youth pastor , and many of her neighbors , Knox eventually becomes an activist for comprehensive sex education .
At her high school , kids receive abstinence - only education , but , Knox says , “ maybe twice a week I see a girl walking down the hall pregnant . ”
In the film , Knox seems successful at remaining chaste , but less because she took a pledge than because she has a fearlessly independent mind and the kind of parents who — despite their own conservative leanings — admire her outspokenness .
Devout Republicans , her parents end up driving her around town to make speeches that would have curled their hair before their daughter started making them .
Her mother even comes to take pride in Shelby ’s efforts , because while abstinence pledges are lovely in the abstract , they do n’t acknowledge “ reality . ”
Like other American teens , young evangelicals live in a world of Internet porn , celebrity sex scandals , and raunchy reality TV , and they have the same hormonal urges that their peers have .
Yet they come from families and communities in which sexual life is supposed to be forestalled until the first night of a transcendent honeymoon .
Regnerus writes ,
“ In such an atmosphere , attitudes about sex may formally remain unchanged ( and restrictive ) while sexual activity becomes increasingly common .
This clash of cultures and norms is felt most poignantly in the so - called Bible Belt . ”
Symbolic commitment to the institution of marriage remains strong there , and politically motivating — hence the drive to outlaw gay marriage — but the actual practice of it is scattershot .

Among blue - state social liberals , commitment to the institution of marriage tends to be unspoken or discreet , but marriage in practice typically works pretty well .
Two family - law scholars , Naomi Cahn , of George Washington University , and June Carbone , of the University of Missouri at Kansas City , are writing a book on the subject , and they argue that “ red families ” and “ blue families ” are “ living different lives , with different moral imperatives . ”
( They emphasize that the Republican - Democrat divide is less important than the higher concentration of “ moral - values voters ” in red states . )
In 2004 , the states with the highest divorce rates were Nevada , Arkansas , Wyoming , Idaho , and West Virginia ( all red states in the 2004 election ) ; those with the lowest were Illinois , Massachusetts , Iowa , Minnesota , and New Jersey .
The highest teen - pregnancy rates were in Nevada , Arizona , Mississippi , New Mexico , and Texas ( all red ) ; the lowest were in North Dakota , Vermont , New Hampshire , Minnesota , and Maine ( blue except for North Dakota ) .
“ The ‘ blue states ’ of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic have lower teen birthrates , higher use of abortion , and lower percentages of teen births within marriage , ” Cahn and Carbone observe .
They also note that people start families earlier in red states — in part because they are more inclined to deal with an unplanned pregnancy by marrying rather than by seeking an abortion .
Of all variables , the age at marriage may be the pivotal difference between red and blue families .
The five states with the lowest median age at marriage are Utah , Oklahoma , Idaho , Arkansas , and Kentucky , all red states , while those with the highest are all blue : Massachusetts , New York , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and New Jersey .
The red - state model puts couples at greater risk for divorce ; women who marry before their mid-twenties are significantly more likely to divorce than those who marry later .
And younger couples are more likely to be contending with two of the biggest stressors on a marriage : financial struggles and the birth of a baby before , or soon after , the wedding .
There are , of course , plenty of exceptions to these rules — messily divorcing professional couples in Boston , high - school sweethearts who stay sweetly together in rural Idaho .
Still , Cahn and Carbone conclude , “ the paradigmatic red - state couple enters marriage not long after the woman becomes sexually active , has two children by her mid-twenties , and reaches the critical period of marriage at the high point in the life cycle for risk - taking and experimentation .
The paradigmatic blue - state couple is more likely to experiment with multiple partners , postpone marriage until after they reach emotional and financial maturity , and have their children ( if they have them at all ) as their lives are stabilizing . ”
Some of these differences in sexual behavior come down to class and education .
Regnerus and Carbone and Cahn all see a new and distinct “ middle - class morality ” taking shape among economically and socially advantaged families who are not social conservatives .
In Regnerus ’s survey , the teen - agers who espouse this new morality are tolerant of premarital sex ( and of contraception and abortion ) but are themselves cautious about pursuing it .
Regnerus writes ,
“ They are interested in remaining free from the burden of teenage pregnancy and the sorrows and embarrassments of sexually transmitted diseases .
They perceive a bright future for themselves , one with college , advanced degrees , a career , and a family .
Simply put , too much seems at stake .
Sexual intercourse is not worth the risks . ”
These are the kids who tend to score high on measures of “ strategic orientation ” — how analytical , methodical , and fact - seeking they are when making decisions .
Because these teen - agers see abstinence as unrealistic , they are not opposed in principle to sex before marriage — just careful about it .
Accordingly , they might delay intercourse in favor of oral sex , not because they cherish the idea of remaining “ technical virgins ” but because they assess it as a safer option .
“ Solidly middle - or upper - middle - class adolescents have considerable socioeconomic and educational expectations , courtesy of their parents and their communities ’ lifestyles , ” Regnerus writes .
“ They are happy with their direction , generally not rebellious , tend to get along with their parents , and have few moral qualms about expressing their nascent sexuality . ”
They might have loved Ellen Page in “ Juno , ” but in real life they ’d see having a baby at the wrong time as a tragic derailment of their life plans .
For this group , Regnerus says , unprotected sex has become “ a moral issue like smoking or driving a car without a seatbelt .
It ’s not just unwise anymore ; it ’s wrong . ”
Each of these models of sexual behavior has drawbacks — in the blue - state scheme , people may postpone child - bearing to the point where infertility becomes an issue .
And delaying child - bearing is better suited to the more affluent , for whom it yields economic benefits , in the form of educational opportunities and career advancement .
But Carbone and Cahn argue that the red - state model is clearly failing on its own terms — producing high rates of teen pregnancy , divorce , sexually transmitted disease , and other dysfunctional outcomes that social conservatives say they abhor .
In “ Forbidden Fruit , ” Regnerus offers an “ unscientific postscript , ” in which he advises social conservatives that if they really want to maintain their commitment to chastity and to marriage , they ’ll need to do more to help young couples stay married longer .
As the Reverend Rick Marks , a Southern Baptist minister , recently pointed out in a Florida newspaper , “ Evangelicals are fighting gay marriage , saying it will break down traditional marriage , when divorce has already broken it down . ”
Conservatives may need to start talking as much about saving marriages as they do about , say , saving oneself for marriage .
“ Having to wait until age twenty - five or thirty to have sex is unreasonable , ” Regnerus writes .
He argues that religious organizations that advocate chastity should “ work more creatively to support younger marriages .
This is not the 1950s ( for which I am glad ) , where one could bank on social norms , extended ( and larger ) families , and clear gender roles to negotiate and sustain early family formation . ”
Evangelicals could start , perhaps , by trying to untangle the contradictory portrayals of sex that they offer to teen - agers .
In the Shelby Knox documentary , a youth pastor , addressing an assembly of teens , defines intercourse as “ what two dogs do out on the street corner — they just bump and grind awhile , boom boom boom . ”
Yet a typical evangelical text aimed at young people , “ Every Young Woman ’s Battle , ” by Shannon Ethridge and Stephen Arterburn , portrays sex between two virgins as an ethereal communion of innocent souls : “ physical , mental , emotional , and spiritual pleasure beyond description . ”
Neither is the most realistic or helpful view for a young person to take into marriage , as a few advocates of abstinence acknowledge .
The savvy young Christian writer Lauren Winner , in her book “ Real Sex : The Naked Truth About Chastity , ” writes , “ Rather than spending our unmarried years stewarding and disciplining our desires , we have become ashamed of them .
We persuade ourselves that the desires themselves are horrible .
This can have real consequences if we do get married . ”
Teenagers and single adults are “ told over and over not to have sex , but no one ever encourages ” them “ to be bodily or sensual in some appropriate way ” — getting to know and appreciate what their bodies can do through sports , especially for girls , or even thinking sensually about something like food .
Winner goes on , “ This does n’t mean , of course , that if only the church sponsored more softball leagues , everyone would stay on the chaste straight and narrow .
But it does mean that the church ought to cultivate ways of teaching Christians to live in their bodies well — so that unmarried folks can still be bodily people , even though they ’re not having sex , and so that married people can give themselves to sex freely . ”
Too often , though , evangelical literature directed at teen - agers forbids all forms of sexual behavior , even masturbation .
“ Every Young Woman ’s Battle , ” for example , tells teen - agers that “ the momentary relief ” of “ self - gratification ” can lead to “ shame , low self - esteem , and fear of what others might think or that something is wrong with you . ”
And it wo n’t slake sexual desire : “ Once you begin feeding baby monsters , their appetites grow bigger and they want MORE !
It ’s better not to feed such a monster in the first place . ”
Shelby Knox , who spoke at a congressional hearing on sex education earlier this year , occupies a middle ground .
She testified that it ’s possible to “ believe in abstinence in a religious sense , ” but still understand that abstinence - only education is dangerous “ for students who simply are not abstaining . ”
As Knox ’s approach makes clear , you do n’t need to break out the sex toys to teach sex ed — you can encourage teen - agers to postpone sex for all kinds of practical , emotional , and moral reasons .
A new “ abstinence - plus ” curriculum , now growing in popularity , urges abstinence while providing accurate information about contraception and reproduction for those who have sex anyway .
“ Abstinence works , ” Knox said at the hearing .
“ Abstinence - only - until - marriage does not . ”
I just sent the following message to OpenMCL - Devel :
Hello CCL Users –
I ’m happy to officially announce our pledge drive to raise funds to improve the CCL IDE .
Now is your chance to help us build a development environment that is worthy of the great CCL compiler and runtime that we already have .
Our goal is to raise $ 20,000 in pledges .
This will allow us to put substantial dedicated effort into the CCL IDE .
We want to take it from its current wobbly alpha state and turn it into a solid stable development environment for Common Lisp .
The priorities for our work will be set by the people who fund the project .
So far these priorities include :
Improving and stabilizing the editor .
( Think Fred . )
Completing the other existing IDE tools ( Processes , Apropos , Inspect , Search Files ) .
Adding additional features and tools to the editor and the IDE ( e.g. multiple - font support ) .
Simplifying the installation and build process to make CCL available to more users , including Lisp newbies .
Reorganizing the source code to encourage future development by the CCL community .
We currently have $ 6,000 in pledges .
Our goal is to reach $ 20,000 by November 15th .
To keep this effort manageable , we are seeking pledges of $ 500 or more .
Please consider making a pledge .
If you ’re on this e-mail list , there ’s a good chance you use Clozure CL .
As Free Open - Source Software , we do n’t make any money from sales of CCL or licensing fees for applications written in CCL .
We ’re able to fund some development ourselves .
But to get beyond that — as we ’d like to do with the IDE — we need your help .
If you ’d like to make a pledge , please contact me ( alms@clozure.com ) and we can set up a time to talk about your priorities and the amount you ’d like to pledge .

The award for crook of the year goes to the as - of - yet - uncaptured robber who not only " wrested a bag of cash from an armored truck guard and escaped down a creek with an inner tube . "
He used " decoys summoned from a
Craigslist ad to distract witnesses , " too , ABC News reports .
Oh , and pepper spray .
The robbery happened went down in tiny Monroe , Washington .
The thief wore a ventilator mask , and sprayed the armored truck guard , outside a Bank of America branch .
Then he dashed for a creek running into the Skyomish River .
He got in an yellow inner tube , and took off .
Meanwhile , " at least a dozen unsuspecting decoys " were standing around to confuse any potential pursuers .
They were all recruited on Craigslist .
" I came across the ad that was for a prevailing wage job for $ 28.50 an hour , " KING - TV quotes a " Mike , who saw a Craigslist ad last week looking for workers for a road maintenance project in Monroe . "
He said he inquired and was e-mailed back with instructions to meet near the Bank of America in Monroe at 11 a.m. Tuesday .
He also was told to wear certain work clothing .
" Yellow vest , safety goggles , a respirator mask … and , if possible , a blue shirt , " he said .
Mike showed up along with about a dozen other men dressed like him , but there was no contractor and no road work to be done .
He thought they had been stood up until he heard about the bank robbery and the suspect who wore the same attire .
FBI spokeswoman Robbie Burroughs tells the Seattle Times that she 'd never heard of anyone using an inner tube as a getaway vehicle .
" I do remember one time we had a bank robbery in Olympia , and the guy got into scuba gear and dove into the water , " Burroughs said .
" I
thought that was the most bizarre thing I 'd ever heard until today . "
The scuba guy , Charles Everett Coma , of Olympia , was sentenced last year to 16 years in prison .

Remember back in March when Goldman Sachs called for oil to hit $ 200 barrel ?
The forecast was based on the analysts ' so - called " super - spike " theory , and they specifically downplayed the risk of a global recession .
To be fair , they were n't the only ones who failed to anticipate the severity of the economic downturn .
Anyway , so much for oil $ 200 .
Today the firm is out with a new report , a mea culpa of sorts , suggesting that $ 50 oil could be in the offing .
The National ( Abu Dhabi ) : “ We clearly underestimated the depth and duration of the global financial crisis and its implications ( for ) economic growth and commodity demand , ” a team of Goldman commodity analysts led by Jeffrey Currie and Giovanni Serio , wrote today in a research report .
“ Should the financial and evolving economic crisis cut deeper into ( oil ) demand , the market could fall as low as $ 50 a barrel .
” The analysts predicted that $ 50 oil could become a reality as early as December .
It is currently trading at $ 81 a barrel .
One thing we 're wondering is what happened to the authors of the original report ?
The oil $ 200 call was led by Arjun Murti , along with Kevin Koh and Michele della Vigna .
Not it 's a couple of new names .
Any ideas what 's going on ?
Of course , oil is actually up today , on a glimmer of hope for the global economy .
Do n't miss the earlier Goldman calls :
Do n't Get Used To $ 90 Oil , Prices Going Right Back To Moon

A fast - moving brush fire atop Angel Island shot flames high in to the air and glowed so brightly Sunday night that it could be seen for miles around San Francisco Bay by residents in several counties .
Residents in San Francisco , Marin , Contra Costa and Alameda counties - from the hills in San Francisco , Berkeley , Oakland and El Cerrito to the shorelines along Richmond , Tiburon , Sausalito and San Francisco described the fire as spectacular and massive .
" We are seeing a silhouette of the island in flames , " said Jacqueline McCrath , who was watching the fire from Telegraph Hill in San Francisco .
" It 's been spreading really fast - we saw a vigorous blaze at the top of the hill at first , and now it has spread across a lot of the island .
It appeared very suddenly - the first thing we saw was a blazing hilltop . "
The fire , reported about 9 p.m. Sunday , grew quickly and had consumed up to 100 acres on the east side of the island by 11:15 p.m. , fire officials said .
At 740 acres , Angel Island is the largest island in San Francisco Bay .
" We are dealing with some real heavy vegetation and some very active flames kicking up , " said Marin County Fire Battalion Chief Mike Giannini .
" It is challenging not only because of the heavy vegetation but in getting crews up there .
First they have to be brought in by boat .
And once they get over there , they have to get up to the top of the island . "
There were about 30 firefighters on the island by about 11:30 p.m. and another 70 were expected to arrive by midnight , he said .
While no structures were immediately threatened , Giannini said , there are a lot of historic buildings on the island , he said .
About 40 campers were evacuated , he said .
" It is a pretty big fire , " Giannini said .
" It is going to be a long night . "
The U.S. Coast Guard was transporting firefighters to the island .
One fire engine is stationed on the island , and another was transported there by barge .
Another two were on their way late Sunday night .
The engines have water , and there is some water on the island to fight the fire , Giannini said .
He said the cause of the fire was not yet known .
U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Amy Marrs said the wind appeared to be driving the fire .
At the Paradise Bay Restaurant in Sausalito , manager Eliza Grassy described what she saw : " Flames have come over the side of the island .
It is quite an amazing sight , seeing the flames consuming the island that quickly . "
The island 's highest point is Mount Livermore at 781 feet , and it appeared to be involved in the blaze .
The fire was facing the city , burning on the east side of the island , near the reservoir .
" It is just massive .
You can see the orange flames from the bridge , " Mark Crawford , an Orinda resident , said after driving across the Bay Bridge and seeing the fire .
A woman on a Hornblower Cruise right next to the island described the fire as " a shocking sight . "
" The fire is on the city side of the island .
It is really high up on two ridges .
The flames are 25 feet to 30 feet high , " said the woman whose cell phone cut off before she could provide her name .
McCrath said the yellow , orange , and red flames were rising high into the sky .
" We 've been watching the fire for about half an hour and for the first time we are seeing red lights that look like firefighting equipment , " he said at 10:30 p.m .
Angel Island , a state park that was once a fort and later an immigration station , is reachable by ferry from San Francisco and Tiburon , and is a popular picnicking and camping spot .
Palin expands on her positions with Katie Couric Nick Cargo and David Edwards

This " I am an open book , " Alaska Governor and vice presidential hopeful Sarah Palin told CBS ' Katie Couric .
" My record is out there and my life is out there . "
In an interview aired Tuesday night , Governor Palin elaborated on energy , reproductive rights , climate change , feminism and homosexuality with Couric .
" I'm a feminist , " Palin said , " who ... believes in equal rights and I believe that women certainly today have every opportunity that a man has to succeed , and to try to do it all , anyway .
And I 'm very , very thankful that I 've been brought up in a family where gender has n't been an issue . "
On tapping the nation 's national resources , Couric asked if " drill , baby , drill " could be construed as misleading given that domestic oil drilling would take 10 years to impact the market .
" It 's why we should have started 10 years ago , " Palin said .
" Alaska has billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean , green natural gas onshore and offshore . "
When Palin and presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain were asked about their differing views on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( McCain against , and Palin for ) , McCain asked , " Did you expect two mavericks ... to agree on everything ? "
After a speech at Capital University , Couric asked Palin about a comment she made on how long Senator Joseph Biden , her opponent , had been in the Senate .
" I 'm looking forward to meeting him , " she told the audience .
" I 've never met him before , but I 've been hearing about his Senate speeches since I was in , like , second grade . "
" When you have a 72 - year - old running mate , " Couric asked , " is that kind of a risky thing to say , insinuating that Joe Biden 's been around a while ? "
Biden , Palin told Couric , has the " years of experience " in the Senate , while she is the " new energy ; the new face ; the new ideas . "
" If a 15 - year - old is raped by her father , " Couric asked , " do you believe it should be illegal for her to get an abortion , and why ? "
Palin called herself " unapologetic " in her pro-life stance .
" I would counsel to choose life .
I would also like to see a culture of life in this country .
But I would also like to take it one step further .
Not just saying I am pro-life and I want fewer and fewer abortions in this country , but I want them , those women who find themselves in circumstances that are absolutely less than ideal , for them to be supported , and adoptions made easier . "
On being pressed by Couric on whether she would force a victim of incest or rape to have the child , Palin said , " ... personally , I would counsel the person to choose life , despite horrific , horrific circumstances that this person would find themselves in .
And , if you 're asking , though , kind of foundationally here , should anyone end up in jail for having an ... abortion , absolutely not .
That 's nothing I would ever support . "
After repeated questioning about her position on the morning - after pill , Palin repeated her views and said that she would " not choose to participate in that kind of contraception . "
Palin also supported the teaching of evolution as an " accepted principle , " while also saying that she sees the " hand of God in this beautiful creation that is Earth . "
" I say that also as the daughter of a school teacher , a science teacher , who has really instilled in me a respect for science , " she added .
" It should be taught in our schools . "
" I am not going to judge Americans and the decisions that they make in their adult lives , " Palin said .
Palin recently faced criticism for her membership in the Wasilla Bible Church , which supported the " Love Won Out " conference in Anchorage , whose participants were of the belief that homosexual inclinations could be controlled or eliminated using religion .
" I have one of my absolute best friends for the last 30 years happens to be gay , and I love her dearly .
And she is not my ' gay friend , ' she is one of my best friends , who happens to have made a choice that is n't a choice that I have made .
But I am not going to judge people . "
On asking what publications she has read to form her worldview and verse herself on the issues , Palin said , " I 've read most of them ... with a great appreciation for the press -- for the media ... all of them , any of them that have been in front of me all these years . "

Author , How To Score - Science And The Beautiful Game
Adidas 's Teamgeist World Cup ball has already been criticised by Germany and Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann for its unpredictability , but is there any scientific basis for perennial concerns over swerving balls ?
In the early 1950s a young Brazilian midfielder nicknamed Didi invented the swerving free kick .
He realised that a ball kicked with spin would deflect significantly in flight .
It is no accident that the technique emerged first in the South American game .
The leather ball of that era was very prone to water absorption and the weight increase made it much less responsive to the aerodynamic forces caused by the spin .
This was seldom a problem in the warm , dry conditions of Brazil but a serious drawback in Europe 's winter game .
GRAPHIC 1 Ball travelling under 12 mph suffers considerable turbulence
Not until a ball with a synthetic , impermeable surface was introduced in the 1960s could the technique catch on .
European players then became as adept as their Brazilian masters and a long line of expert free - kickers stretches from Didi to the present day .
Few can forget David Beckham 's marvellous last - gasp equaliser against Greece in 2001 .
This wickedly swerving and dipping shot took England to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and Korea and England 's recent warm - up games against Hungary and Jamaica show that Beckham is back to top form .
GRAPHIC 2 Turbulence moving backwards creates a thin layer of air flow next to the ball With air flow clinging more closely , turbulence is reduced and drag plummets
This is called " tripping " the boundary layer
It took the modern science of fluid dynamics to understand exactly what happens in a swerving free kick .
When a football moves through the air at low speed the air flow separates from its surface at characteristic points - see graphic 1 .
A sphere is not a very efficient aerodynamic shape and when this early separation occurs turbulence is created behind the ball .
Turbulence always causes drag and if things remained like this a football would be a very sluggish object when kicked .
Above a certain speed - about 12 mph for a football - a miraculous thing happens .
Turbulence begins to move backwards , producing a boundary layer - a layer of very thin flow very close to the ball 's surface - and this has the effect of causing the air flow to cling more closely to the ball 's surface - graphic 2 .
GRAPHIC 3 Spinning ball distorts air flow around ball
Turbulence is reduced and the drag plummets .
When this happens we say that the boundary layer is " tripped " and since most of footballs ' actions such as kicking or throwing take place above the critical speed the ball can be moved around in a pacey manner .
When the ball rotates - see graphic 3 - the boundary layer remains tripped but the air flow separation around the ball is distorted .
Separation occurs earlier on the side rotating against the flow and later on the side rotating in the same sense as the flow .
This causes a pressure differential and a deflecting force which is responsible for moving the ball in the air in a free kick .
A baseball has only two panels
It was not realised for many years that the boundary layer was tripped by surface " imperfections " , in fact by the slight indentations where the ball 's panels are joined together .
More panels means more seams and greater aerodynamic stability but panel designs have varied enormously over the years .
For example , the familiar hexagon - pattern ball has 32 , the classic English model 26 .
The new World Cup ball , Adidas ' Teamgeist , has only fourteen panels , however .
Might this be the factor behind the disquiet expressed by Jens Lehmann ?
To see why this might be so we can take a look at a very simple object , the baseball which has only two panels separated by a continuous seam .
TEAMGEIST BALL
When it rains it 's not going to be very comfortable for us , it gets very slippery - it also moves a lot in the air
Jens Lehmann
Baseball pitchers conventionally swerve the ball by throwing it with spin .
This " curveball " is very similar to a swerving free kick and the rotating seam trips the boundary layer in much the same way as a football does .
Occasionally though , pitchers serve up a wicked delivery known as the " knuckleball " .
This bobs about randomly in flight and is very disconcerting for batters .
It happens because pitchers throw the ball with very little spin .
Then , as the limited seam rotates lazily in the air flow , it trips the boundary layer at certain points on the surface .
This causes an unpredictable deflection which may be completely reversed when another portion of the seam rotates into the critical position .
The key , of course , is to ensure a very low spin rate , easier to achieve in a baseball throw than a kick .
But this does occasionally happen in football and then the panel pattern can have a big influence on the trajectory .
Mitre ball with 26 panels
The Teamgeist ball with its 14 panels is aerodynamically closer to the baseball than either English ball with 26 panels or the 32 panel hexagon pattern .
So no problem when the Teamgeist spins but watch out if it is kicked with a very slow rotation rate .
Goalkeepers are often criticised for punching or palming away balls which are moving unpredictably , rather than catching them cleanly , but they can be forgiven if they are facing football 's equivalent of a knuckleball .
There will be plenty of spectacular scoring free kicks at the forthcoming World Cup and elite performers like David Beckham , Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho must be itching to get the ball at their feet .
Watch the slow motion replays for the tell - tale movement of the markings on the ball , the best indicator for revealing the kind of spin applied in the shot : sidespin for players like Henry and Ronaldinho but a vital component of topspin when Beckham unleashes his special delivery .
International ball with 32 panels
Most of all look for the rare occasions when the shot produces little or no rotation and the frantic efforts of the poor goalkeeper struggling to come to terms with the ball 's chaotic , meandering flight path .
We are in for an enthralling four weeks of football .
Dr Ken Bray will be taking part in Material World : Science of Football on Radio 4 on Thursday 8 June at 1630 BST .
