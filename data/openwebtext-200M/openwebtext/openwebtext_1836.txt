Anyone who has been on a farm , or driven past one , or hell even read about one in a book knows that , one they have lots of cute little farm animals , and two that they smell bad .
Reason one being the cause of reason two .
Animals ( including ourselves ) eat a lot and poop a lot .
Poop is made up of plant matter ( the fibrous stuff that cant get digested ) and waste .
Why , you may be asking yourself , are we talking about the contents of animal droppings ?
Well for the simple reason that this “ brown gold ” can be used to create energy .
Waste not , want not .
Lucky for us the Texas Cooperative Extension ( pdf ) has put together a nifty little report outlining a simple and easy way to incorporate a manure to energy plan .
Energy from Feed to Manure
Manure containing undigested and partially digested dietary nutrients is a resource that benefits plant growth and adds organic matter to improve soil structure .
Nutrients in animal feed that are sources of energy include carbohydrates â€ ” comprised of carbon ( C ) , hydrogen ( H ) and oxygen ( O ) â€ ” from forage and cereal grains , for example .
Other nutrients are proteins
( in the form of amino acids ) and fats ( or lipids ) , comprised primarily of C , H , O as well as phosphorus ( P ) and Nitrogen ( N ) .
The energy content of animal feed is expressed in calories .
One calorie is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1 degree Celsius ( Â°C ) from a standard initial temperature and pressure at sea level .
Not all of the energy in the feed is utilized by the animal .
The energy in feed can be portioned into net energy and lost energy .
Energy losses during the digestion process include the energy lost in manure ( feces and urine ) , in gases produced by fermentation in the gastrointestinal ( digestive ) tract of animals and through heat .
Several processes have the potential to transform the energy in manure to usable bio energy .
They go on to outline several ways in which this waste can be turned into sweet sweet natural gas ready to be used in our power plants .
Biological Process
Methane production is the biological process that generates energy from animal manure .
The process , which is called anaerobic digestion , is the treatment of manure with naturally occurring microorganisms ( bacteria ) in the absence of air ( especially oxygen ) to produce biogas .
Biogas , which is produced from degradation of organic matter in manure by the bacteria , contains primarily methane ( CH4 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
Other gases , such as nitrogen ( N2 ) , hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) and trace organic components are also present in relatively small quantities .
Typically , 60 - 65 percent of the biogas is CH4 .
Methane and CO2 represent
more than 90 percent of the biogas .
Virtually all N , phosphorus ( P ) and potassium ( K ) remain in the digested manure .
Methane produced from anaerobic digestion and utilized as a source of energy also reduces its natural emission , which has much greater global warming potential than CO2 .
The heating value ( energy released from a given mass of a fuel of biogas containing 65 percent CH4 ) is approximately 600 BTU / ft3 .
The British Thermal Unit ( BTU ) is the heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit ( Â°F ) .
There are 252 calories per BTU .
For comparison , 1,000 ft3 of biogas with 65 percent CH4 will be an approximate equivalent of 600 ft3 of natural gas , 6.6 gal of propane and 4.7 gal of gasoline .
Information on types of biogas digesters and their function is available from the USEPA website at www.epa.gov/agstar.
The most important part about that is the energy density .
Manure presents a significant energy source waiting to be utilized .
This stuff is literally just “ lying around ” waiting for us to turn into energy .
You might be wondering just how much umm , of this “ resource ” is available in the United States .
Well I ca n’t answer for the whole country but I was able to find some numbers for Texas .
To sum it up , A Lot .
My friends and I have been saying Shit Tonne for years to indicate “ a lot of something ” .
If manure as a fuel source takes off , it could come to mean so much more .

Preface : DON'T PANIC !
Recent experiences from a few of my fellow C++/ Java programmers indicate that they read various Haskell tutorials with " exponential speedup " ( think about how TCP / IP session starts up ) .
They start slow and cautious , but when they see that the first 3 - 5 pages do not contain " anything interesting " in terms of code and examples , they begin skipping paragraphs , then chapters , then whole pages , only to slow down - often to a complete halt - somewhere on page 50 , finding themselves in the thick of concepts like " type classes " , " type constructors " , " monadic IO " , at which point they usually panic , think of a perfectly rational excuse not to read further anymore , and happily forget this sad and scary encounter with Haskell ( as human beings usually tend to forget sad and scary things ) .
This text intends to introduce the reader to the practical aspects of Haskell from the very beginning ( plans for the first chapters include : I/O , darcs , Parsec , QuickCheck , profiling and debugging , to mention a few ) .
The reader is expected to know ( where to find ) at least the basics of Haskell : how to run " hugs " or " ghci " , that layout is 2 - dimensional , etc .
Other than that , we do not plan to take radical leaps , and will go one step at a time in order not to lose the reader along the way .
So DON'T PANIC , take your towel with you and read along .
In case you 've skipped over the previous paragraph , I would like to stress out once again that Haskell is sensitive to indentation and spacing , so pay attention to that during cut -n - pastes or manual alignment of code in the text editor with proportional fonts .
Oh , almost forgot : author is very interested in ANY feedback .
Drop him a line or a word ( see Adept for contact info ) or submit patches to the tutorial via darcs ( repository is here ) or directly to this Wiki .
Chapter 1 : Ubiquitous " Hello world ! " and other ways to do IO in Haskell
Each chapter will be dedicated to one small real - life task which we will complete from the ground up .
So here is the task for this chapter : in order to free up space on your hard drive for all the Haskell code you are going to write in the nearest future , you are going to archive some of the old and dusty information on CDs and DVDs .
While CD ( or DVD ) burning itself is easy these days , it usually takes some ( or quite a lot of ) time to decide how to put several GB of digital photos on CD - Rs , when directories with images range from 10 to 300 Mb's in size , and you do n't want to burn half - full ( or half - empty ) CD - Rs .
So , the task is to write a program which will help us put a given collection of directories on the minimum possible amount of media , while packing the media as tightly as possible .
Let 's name this program " cd-fit " .
Oh .
Wait .
Let 's do the usual " hello world " thing , before we forget about it , and then move on to more interesting things :
-- Taken from ' hello.hs ' --
From now on , a comment at the beginning of the code snippet -- will specify the file which contain the full program from -- which the snippet is taken .
You can get the code from the darcs -- repository " http://adept.linux.kiev.ua:8080/repos/hhgtth " by issuing -- command " darcs get http://adept.linux.kiev.ua:8080/repos/hhgtth " module Main where main = putStrLn " Hello world ! "
Run it :
$ runhaskell ./hello.hs
Hello world !
OK , we 've done it .
Move along now , nothing interesting here :)
Any serious development must be done with the help of a version control system , and we will not make an exception .
We will use the modern distributed version control system " darcs " .
" Modern " means that it is written in Haskell , " distributed " means that each working copy is a repository in itself .
First , let 's create an empty directory for all our code , and invoke " darcs init " there , which will create subdirectory " _darcs " to store all version - control - related stuff there .
Fire up your favorite editor and create a new file called " cd- fit.hs " in our working directory .
Now let 's think for a moment about how our program will operate and express it in pseudocode :
main =
Read list of directories and their sizes .
Decide how to fit them on CD - Rs .
Print solution .
Sounds reasonable ?
I thought so .
Let 's simplify our life a little and assume for now that we will compute directory sizes somewhere outside our program ( for example , with " du - sb * " ) and read this information from stdin .
Now let me convert all this to Haskell :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-1-1.hs ' module Main where main = do input <- getContents putStrLn ( " DEBUG : got input " ++ input ) -- compute solution and print it
Not really working , but pretty close to plain English , eh ?
Let 's stop for a moment and look more closely at what 's written here line - by - line
Let 's begin from the top :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-1-1.hs ' input <- getContents
This is an example of the Haskell syntax for doing IO ( namely , input ) .
This line is an instruction to read all the information available from the stdin , return it as a single string , and bind it to the symbol " input " , so we can process this string any way we want .
How did I know that ?
Did I memorize all the functions by heart ?
Of course not !
Each function has a type , which , along with function 's name , usually tells a lot about what a function will do .
Let 's fire up an interactive Haskell environment and examine this function up close :
$ ghci ___ ___ _ / _ \ /\ /\/ __(_ ) / /_\// /_/ / / | | GHC Interactive , version 6.4.1 , for Haskell 98 . / /_\\/ __ / /___| |
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

/_/\____/|_|
Type :? for help .
Loading package base - 1.0 ... linking ... done .
Prelude > : type getContents getContents :: IO String Prelude >
We see that " getContents " is a function without arguments , that will return " IO String " .
Prefix " IO " meant that this is an IO action .
It will return String , when evaluated .
Action will be evaluated as soon as we use " < - " to bind its result to some symbol .
Note that " < - " is not a fancy way to assign value to variable .
It is a way to evaluate ( execute ) IO actions , in other words - to actually do some I/O and return its result ( if any ) .
We can choose not to evaluate the action obtained from " getContents " , but rather carry it around a bit and evaluate later :
let x = getContents -- 300 lines of code here input <- x
So , as you see , IO actions can act like an ordinary values .
Suppose that we have built a list of IO actions and have found a way to execute them one by one .
This would be a way to simulate imperative programming with its notion of " order of execution " .
Haskell allows you to do better than that .
The standard language library ( named " Prelude " , by the way ) provides us with lots of functions that return useful primitive IO actions .
In order to combine them to produce an even more complex actions , we use a " do " :
c = do a <- someAction b <- someOtherAction print ( bar b ) print ( foo a ) putStrLn " done "
Here we bind " c " to an action with the following " scenario " :
evaluate action " someAction " and bind its result to " a "
action " someAction " and its result to " a " then , evaluate " someOtherAction " and bind its result to " b "
" someOtherAction " and its result to " b " then , process " b " with function " bar " and print result
then , process " a " with function " foo " and print result
then , print the word " done "
When will all this actually be executed ?
Answer : as soon as we evaluate " c " using the " < - " ( if it returns result , as " getContents " does ) or just by using it as a function name ( if it does not return a result , as " print " does ) :
process = do putStrLn " Will do some processing " c putStrLn " Done "
Notice that we took a bunch of functions ( " someAction " , " someOtherAction " , " print " , " putStrLn " ) and using " do " created from them a new function , which we bound to symbol " c " .
Now we could use " c " as a building block to produce an even more complex function , " process " , and we could carry this on and on .
Eventually , some of the functions will be mentioned in the code of function " main " , to which the ultimate topmost IO action any Haskell program is bound .
When will the " main " be executed / evaluated / forced ?
As soon as we run the program .
Read this twice and try to comprehend :
The execution of a Haskell program is an evaluation of the symbol " main " to which we have bound an IO action .
Via evaluation we obtain the result of that action .
Readers familiar with advanced C++ or Java programming and that arcane body of knowledge named " OOP Design Patterns " might note that " build actions from actions " and " evaluate actions to get result " is essentially a " Command pattern " and " Composition pattern " combined .
Good news : in Haskell you get them for all your IO , and get them for free :)
Exercise : Consider the following code :
-- Taken from ' exercise - 1- 1.hs ' module Main where c = putStrLn " C ! " combine before after = do before putStrLn " In the middle " after main = do combine c c let b = combine ( putStrLn " Hello ! " ) ( putStrLn " Bye ! " ) let d = combine ( b ) ( combine c c ) putStrLn " So long ! "
Notice how we carefully indent lines so that source looks neat ?
Actually , Haskell code has to be aligned this way , or it will not compile .
If you use tabulation to indent your sources , take into account that Haskell compilers assume that tabstop is 8 characters wide .
Often people complain that it is very difficult to write Haskell because it requires them to align code .
Actually , this is not true .
If you align your code , compiler will guess the beginnings and endings of syntactic blocks .
However , if you do n't want to indent your code , you could explicitly specify end of each and every expression and use arbitrary layout as in this example :
-- Taken from ' exercise - 1- 2.hs ' combine before after = do { before ; putStrLn
" In the middle " ; after ; } ; main = do { combine c c ; let { b = combine ( putStrLn " Hello ! " ) ( putStrLn " Bye ! " ) } ; let { d = combine ( b ) ( combine c c ) } ; putStrLn " So long ! " } ;
Back to the exercise - see how we construct code out of thin air ?
Try to imagine what this code will do , then run it and check yourself .
Do you understand why " Hello ! " and " Bye ! " are not printed ?
Let 's examine our " main " function closer :
Prelude > : load cd-fit.hs Compiling Main ( ./cd-fit.hs , interpreted )
Ok , modules loaded : Main .
* Main > : type main main :: IO () * Main >
We see that " main " is indeed an IO action which will return nothing when evaluated .
When combining actions with " do " , the type of the result will be the type of the last action , and " putStrLn something " has type " IO ( ) " :
* Main > : type putStrLn " Hello world ! " putStrLn " Hello world ! " :: IO () * Main >
Oh , by the way : have you noticed that we actually compiled our first Haskell program in order to examine " main " ? :)
let 's celebrate that by putting it under version control : execute " darcs add cd- fit.hs " and " darcs record " , answer " y " to all questions and provide a commit comment " Skeleton of cd- fit.hs "
Let 's try to run it :
$ echo " foo " | runhaskell cd- fit.hs DEBUG : got input foo
Exercises :
Try to write a program that takes your name from the stdin and greets you ( keywords : getLine , putStrLn ) ;
Try to write a program that asks for you name , reads it , greets you , asks for your favorite color , and prints it back ( keywords : getLine , putStrLn ) .
Chapter 2 : Parsing the input
OK , now that we have proper understanding of the powers of Haskell IO ( and are awed by them , I hope ) , let 's forget about IO and actually do some useful work .
As you remember , we set forth to pack some CD - Rs as tightly as possible with data scattered in several input directories .
We assume that " du - sb " will compute the sizes of input directories and output something like :
65572 /home/adept/photos/raw-to-burn/dir1 68268 /home/adept/photos/raw-to-burn/dir2 53372 /home/adept/photos/raw-to-burn/dir3 713124 /home/adept/photos/raw-to-burn/dir4 437952 /home/adept/photos/raw-to-burn/dir5
Our next task is to parse that input into some suitable internal representation .
For that we will use powerful library of parsing combinators named " Parsec " which ships with most Haskell implementations .
Much like the IO facilities we have seen in the first chapter , this library provides a set of basic parsers and means to combine into more complex parsing constructs .
Unlike other tools in this area ( lex / yacc or JavaCC to name a few ) , Parsec parsers do not require a separate preprocessing stage .
Since in Haskell we can return function as a result of function and thus construct functions " from the thin air " , there is no need for a separate syntax for parser description .
But enough advertisements , let 's actually do some parsing :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-2-1.hs ' import Text .
ParserCombinators .
Parsec -- parseInput parses output of " du - sb " , which consists of many lines , -- each of which describes single directory parseInput = do dirs <- many dirAndSize eof :: Parser ( ) return dirs -- Datatype
Dir holds information about single directory - its size and name data Dir = Dir Int String deriving Show -- `dirAndSize` parses information about single directory , which is : -- a size in bytes ( number ) , some spaces , then directory name , which extends till newline dirAndSize = do size <- many1 digit spaces dir_name <- any Char ` manyTill ` newline return ( Dir ( read size ) dir_name )
Just add those lines to " cd-fit.hs " , between the declaration of the Main module and the definition of main .
Here we see quite a lot of new things , and several those that we know already .
First of all , note the familiar " do " construct , which , as we know , is used to combine IO actions to produce new IO actions .
Here we use it to combine " parsing " actions into new " parsing " actions .
Does this mean that " parsing " implies " doing IO " ?
Not at all .
Thing is , I must admit that I lied to you - " do " is used not only to combine IO actions .
" Do " is used to combine any kind of so - called monadic actions or monadic values together .
Think about monad as a " design pattern " in the functional world .
Monad is a way to hide from the user ( programmer ) all the machinery required for complex functionality to operate .
As you might have heard , Haskell has no notion of " assignment " , " mutable state " , " variables " , and is a " pure functional language " , which means that every function called with the same input parameters will return exactly the same result .
Meanwhile " doing IO " requires hauling around file handles and their states and dealing with IO errors .
" Parsing " requires to track position in the input and dealing with parsing errors .
In both cases Wise Men Who Wrote Libraries cared for our needs and hide all underlying complexities from us , exposing the API of their libraries ( IO and parsing ) in the form of " monadic action " which we are free to combine as we see fit .
Think of programming with monads as of doing the remodelling with the help of professional remodelling crew .
You describe sequence of actions on the piece of paper ( that 's us writing in " do " notation ) , and then , when required , that sequence will be evaluated by the remodelling crew ( " in the monad " ) which will provide you with end result , hiding all the underlying complexity ( how to prepare the paint , which nails to choose , etc ) from you .
let 's use the interactive Haskell environment to decipher all the instructions we 've written for the parsing library .
As usually , we 'll go top - down :
* Main > : reload
Ok , modules loaded : Main .
* Main > :t parseInput parseInput :: Text .Parsec.Prim.ParsecT [ Char ] u Data .
Functor .
Identity .
Identity [ Dir ] * Main > :t dirAndSize dirAndSize :: Text .Parsec.Prim.ParsecT [ Char ] u Data .
Functor .
Identity .
Identity Dir * Main >
Assuming ( well , take my word for it ) that " Text .
Parsec .
Prim.ParsecT [ Char ] u Data.Functor .Identity . Identity " is our parsing monad , we could see that " parseInput " , when evaluated , will produce a list of " Dir " , and " dirAndSize " , when evaluated , will produce " Dir " .
Assuming that " Dir " somehow represents information about single directory , that is pretty much what we wanted , is n't it ?
Let 's see what a " Dir " means .
We defined datatype Dir as a record , which holds an Int and a String :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-2-1.hs ' data Dir = Dir Int String deriving Show
In order to construct such records , we must use data constructor Dir :
* Main > :t Dir 1 " foo " Dir 1 " foo " :: Dir
In order to reduce confusion for newbies , we could have written :
data Dir = D Int String deriving Show
, which would define datatype " Dir " with data constructor " D " .
However , traditionally name of the datatype and its constructor are chosen to be the same .
Clause " deriving Show " instructs the compiler to make enough code " behind the curtains " to make this datatype conform to the interface of the type class Show .
We will explain type classes later , for now let 's just say that this will allow us to " print " instances of " Dir " .
Exercises :
examine types of " digit " , " any Char " , " many " , " many1 " and " manyTill " to see how they are used to build more complex parsers from single ones .
compare types of " manyTill " , " manyTill any Char " and " manyTill any Char newline " .
Note that " anyChar `manyTill` newline " is just another syntax sugar .
Note that when function is supplied with less arguments that it actually needs , we get not a value , but a new function , which is called partial application .
OK .
So , we combined a lot of primitive parsing actions to get ourselves a parser for output of " du - sb " .
How can we actually parse something ?
the Parsec library supplies us with function " parse " :
* Main > :t parse parse :: Text .
Parsec .
Prim .
Stream s Data .
Functor .
Identity .
Identity t => Text .
Parsec.
Prim .
Parsec s () a -> SourceName -> s ->
Either ParseError a * Main > :t parse parseInput parse parseInput :: SourceName -> [ Char ] -> Either ParseError [ Dir ] * Main >
At first the type might be a bit cryptic , but once we supply " parse " with the parser we made , the compiler gets more information and presents us with a more concise type .
Stop and consider this for a moment .
The compiler figured out type of the function without a single type annotation supplied by us !
Imagine if a Java compiler deduced types for you , and you would n't have to specify types of arguments and return values of methods , ever .
OK , back to the code .
We can observe that the " parser " is a function , which , given a parser , a name of the source file or channel ( f.e. " stdin " ) , and source data ( String , which is a list of " Char "s , which is written " [ Char ] " ) , will either produce parse error , or parse us a list of " Dir " .
Datatype " Either " is an example of datatype whose constructor has name , different from the name of the datatype .
In fact , " Either " has two constructors :
data Either a b = Left a | Right b
In order to understand better what does this mean consider the following example :
* Main > :t Left ' a ' Left 'a ' :: Either Char b * Main > :t Right " aaa " Right " aaa " :: Either a [ Char ] * Main >
You see that " Either " is a union ( much like the C/ C++ " union " ) which could hold value of one of the two distinct types .
However , unlike C/C++ " union " , when presented with value of type " Either Int Char " we could immediately see whether its an Int or a Char - by looking at the constructor which was used to produce the value .
Such datatypes are called " tagged unions " , and they are another power tool in the Haskell toolset .
Did you also notice that we provide " parse " with parser , which is a monadic value , but receive not a new monadic value , but a parsing result ?
That is because " parse " is an evaluator for " Parser " monad , much like the GHC or Hugs runtime is an evaluator for the IO monad .
The function " parser " implements all monadic machinery : it tracks errors and positions in input , implements backtracking and lookahead , etc .
let 's extend our " main " function to use " parse " and actually parse the input and show us the parsed data structures :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-2-1.hs ' main = do input <- getContents putStrLn ( " DEBUG : got input " ++ input ) let dirs = case parse parseInput " stdin " input of Left err -> error $ " Input :
" ++ show input ++ "
Error :
" ++ show err Right result -> result putStrLn " DEBUG : parsed : " ; print dirs
Exercise :
In order to understand this snippet of code better , examine ( with ghci or hugs ) the difference between ' drop 1 ( drop 1 ( drop 1 ( drop 1 ( drop 1 " foobar " ) ) ) ) ' and ' drop 1 $ drop 1 $ drop 1 $ drop 1 $ drop 1 " foobar " ' .
Examine type of ( $ ) .
Try putStrLn " aaa " and print " aaa " and see the difference , examine their types .
Try print ( Dir 1 " foo " ) and putStrLn ( Dir 1 " foo " ) .
Examine types of print and putStrLn to understand the behavior in both cases .
Let 's try to run what we have so far :
$ du - sb * | runhaskell ./cd-fit.hs DEBUG : got input 22325 Article.txt 18928 Article.txt ~ 1706 cd-fit.hs 964 cd-fit.hs ~ 61609 _darcs DEBUG : parsed : [ Dir 22325 " Article.txt " , Dir 18928 " Article.txt~ " , Dir 1706 " cd-fit.hs " , Dir 964 " cd-fit.hs ~ " , Dir 61609 " _darcs " ]
Seems to be doing exactly as planned .
Now let 's try some erroneous input :
$ echo " foo " | runhaskell cd- fit.hs DEBUG : got input foo DEBUG : parsed : *** Exception : Input : " foo
" Error : " stdin " ( line 1 , column 1 ) : unexpected " f " expecting digit or end of input
Seems to be doing fine .
If you followed advice to put your code under version control , you could now use " darcs whatsnew " or " darcs diff - u " to examine your changes to the previous version .
Use " darcs record " to commit them .
As an exercise , first record the changes " outside " of function " main " and then record the changes in " main " .
Do " darcs changes " to examine a list of changes you 've recorded so far .
Chapter 3 : Packing the knapsack and testing it with class , too ( and do n't forget your towel ! )
Enough preliminaries already .
let 's go pack some CDs .
As you might already have recognized , our problem is a classical one .
It is called a " knapsack problem " ( google it up , if you do n't know already what it is .
There are more than 100000 links ) .
let 's start from the greedy solution , but first let 's slightly modify our " Dir " datatype to allow easy extraction of its components :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-3-1.hs ' data Dir =
Dir { dir_size :: Int , dir_name :: String } deriving Show
Exercise : examine types of " Dir " , " dir_size " and " dir_name "
From now on , we could use " dir_size d " to get a size of directory , and " dir_name d " to get its name , provided that " d " is of type " Dir " .
The Greedy algorithm sorts directories from the biggest down , and tries to put them on CD one by one , until there is no room for more .
We will need to track which directories we added to CD , so let 's add another datatype , and code this simple packing algorithm :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-3-1.hs ' import Data .
List ( sortBy ) -- DirPack holds a set of directories which are to be stored on single CD .
-- ' pack_size ' could be calculated , but we will store it separately to reduce -- amount of calculation data DirPack = DirPack { pack_size :: Int , dirs :: [ Dir ]} deriving Show --
For simplicity , let 's assume that we deal with standard 700 Mb CDs for now media_size =
700 * 1024 * 1024 --
Greedy packer tries to add directories one by one to initially empty ' DirPack ' greedy_pack dirs = foldl maybe_add_dir ( DirPack 0 [ ] ) $ sortBy cmpSize dirs where cmpSize d1 d2 = compare ( dir_size d1 ) ( dir_size d2 ) --
Helper function , which only adds directory " d " to the pack " p " when new -- total size does not exceed media_size maybe_add_dir p d = let new_size = pack_size p + dir_size d new_dirs = d : ( dirs p ) in if new_size > media_size then p else DirPack new_size new_dirs
I 'll highlight the areas which you could explore on your own ( using other nice tutorials out there , of which I especially recommend " Yet Another Haskell Tutorial " by Hal Daume ) :
We choose to import a single function " sortBy " from a module Data .
List , not the whole thing .
Instead of coding case - by - case recursive definition of " greedy_pack " , we go with higher - order approach , choosing " foldl " as a vehicle for list traversal .
Examine its type .
Other useful function from the same category are " map " , " foldr " , " scanl " and " scanr " .
Look them up !
To sort list of " Dir " by size only , we use custom sort function and parametrized sort - " sortBy " .
This sort of setup where the user may provide a custom " modifier " for a generic library function is quite common : look up " deleteBy " , " deleteFirstsBy " , " groupBy " , " insertBy " , " intersectBy " , " maximumBy " , " minimumBy " , " sortBy " , " unionBy " .
To code the quite complex function " maybe_add_dir " , we introduced several local definitions in the " let " clause , which we can reuse within the function body .
We used a " where " clause in the " greedy_pack " function to achieve the same effect .
Read about " let " and " where " clauses and the differences between them .
in the " let " clause , which we can reuse within the function body .
We used a " where " clause in the " greedy_pack " function to achieve the same effect .
Read about " let " and " where " clauses and the differences between them .
Note that in order to construct a new value of type " DirPack " ( in function " maybe_add_dir " ) we have n't used the helper accessor functions " pack_size " and " dirs "
In order to actually use our greedy packer we must call it from our " main " function , so let 's add a lines :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-3-1.hs ' main = do ... -- compute solution and print it putStrLn " Solution : " ; print ( greedy_pack dirs )
Verify integrity of our definitions by ( re ) loading our code in ghci .
Compiles ?
Thought so :)
Now , do " darcs record " and add some sensible commit message .
Now it is time to test our creation .
We could do it by actually running it in the wild like this :
$ du - sb ~/ DOWNLOADS /* | runhaskell ./cd-fit.hs
This will prove that our code seems to be working .
At least , this once .
How about establishing with reasonable degree of certainty that our code , parts and the whole , works properly , and doing so in re-usable manner ?
In other words , how about writing some test ?
Java programmers used to JUnit probably thought about screens of boiler - plate code and hand - coded method invocations .
Never fear , we will not do anything as silly :)
Enter QuickCheck .
QuickCheck is a tool to do automated testing of your functions using ( semi ) random input data .
In the spirit of " 100 b of code examples is worth 1 kb of praise " let 's show the code for testing the following property :
An attempt to pack directories returned by " greedy_pack " should return " DirPack " of exactly the same pack :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-3-2.hs ' import Test.
QuickCheck import Control .
Monad ( liftM2 , replicateM ) --
We must teach QuickCheck how to generate arbitrary " Dir "s instance Arbitrary Dir where -- Let 's just skip " coarbitrary " for now , ok ? --
I promise , we will get back to it later :) coarbitrary = undefined --
We generate arbitrary " Dir " by generating random size and random name -- and stuffing them inside " Dir " arbitrary = lift M2 Dir gen_size gen_name -- Generate random size between 10 and 1400 Mb where gen_size = do s <- choose ( 10 , 1400 ) return ( s * 1024 * 1024 ) --
Generate random name 1 to 300 chars long , consisting of symbols " fubar / " gen_name = do n <- choose ( 1 , 300 ) replicateM n ( elements " fubar / " ) --
For convenience and by tradition , all QuickCheck tests begin with prefix " prop_ " .
--
Assume that " ds " will be a random list of " Dir "s and code your test .
prop_greedy_pack_is_fixpoint ds = let pack = greedy_pack ds in pack_size pack == pack_size ( greedy_pack ( dirs pack ) )
let 's run the test , after which I 'll explain how it all works :
Prelude > :r Compiling Main ( ./cd-fit.hs , interpreted )
Ok , modules loaded : Main .
* Main > quickCheck prop_greedy_pack_is_fixpoint [ numbers spinning ]
OK , passed 100 tests .
* Main >
We 've just seen our " greedy_pack " run on a 100 completely ( well , almost completely ) random lists of " Dir "s , and it seems that property indeed holds .
let 's dissect the code .
The most intriguing part is " instance Arbitrary Dir where " , which declares that " Dir " is an instance of typeclass " Arbitrary " .
Whoa , that 's a whole lot of unknown words ! :)
Let 's slow down a bit .
What is a typeclass ?
A typeclass is a Haskell way of dealing with the following situation : suppose that you are writing a library of useful functions and you do n't know in advance how exactly they will be used , so you want to make them generic .
Now , on one hand you do n't want to restrict your users to certain type ( e.g. String ) .
On the other hand , you want to enforce the convention that arguments for your function must satisfy a certain set of constraints .
That is where typeclass comes in handy .
Think of typeclass as a contract ( or " interface " , in Java terms ) that your type must fulfill in order to be admitted as an argument to certain functions .
Let 's examine the typeclass " Arbitrary " :
* Main > :i Arbitrary class Arbitrary a where arbitrary :: Gen a coarbitrary :: a -> Gen b ->
Gen b -- Imported from Test.QuickCheck instance Arbitrary Dir -- Defined at ./cd-fit.hs:61:0 instance Arbitrary Bool -- Imported from Test.QuickCheck instance Arbitrary Double -- Imported from Test.QuickCheck instance Arbitrary Float -- Imported from Test.QuickCheck instance Arbitrary Int -- Imported from Test.QuickCheck instance Arbitrary Integer -- Imported from Test.QuickCheck -- rest skipped --
It could be read this way : " Any type ( let 's name it ' a ' ) could be a member of the class Arbitrary as soon as we define two functions for it : " arbitrary " and " coarbitrary " , with signatures shown .
For types Dir , Bool , Double , Float , Int and Integer such definitions were provided , so all those types are instance of class Arbitrary " .
Now , if you write a function which operates on its arguments solely by means of " arbitrary " and " coarbitrary " , you can be sure that this function will work on any type which is an instance of " Arbitrary " !
let 's say it again .
Someone ( maybe even you ) writes the code ( API or library ) , which requires that input values implement certain interfaces , which is described in terms of functions .
Once you show how your type implements this interface you are free to use API or library .
Consider the function " sort " from standard library :
* Main > :t Data.List.sort Data.List.sort :: ( Ord a ) = > [ a ] -> [ a ]
We see that it sorts lists of any values which are instance of typeclass " Ord " .
Let 's examine that class :
* Main > :i Ord class Eq a =>
Ord a where compare :: a -> a ->
Ordering ( <) :: a -> a -> Bool (>= ) :: a -> a -> Bool ( > ) :: a -> a -> Bool ( <= ) :: a -> a ->
Bool max :: a -> a -> a min :: a -> a -> a -- skip instance Ord Double -- Imported from GHC .
Float instance Ord Float -- Imported from GHC .
Float instance Ord Bool -- Imported from GHC .
Base instance Ord Char -- Imported from GHC .
Base instance Ord Integer -- Imported from GHC .
Num instance Ord Int -- Imported from GHC .
Base -- skip * Main >
We see a couple of interesting things : first , there is an additional requirement listed : in order to be an instance of " Ord " , type must first be an instance of typeclass " Eq " .
Then , we see that there is an awful lot of functions to define in order to be an instance of " Ord " .
Wait a second , is n't it silly to define both ( <) and ( >= ) when one could be expressed via another ?
Right you are !
Usually , typeclass contains several " default " implementation for its functions , when it is possible to express them through each other ( as it is with " Ord " ) .
In this case it is possible to supply only a minimal definition ( which in case of " Ord " consists of any single function ) and others will be automatically derived .
If you supplied fewer functions than are required for minimal implementation , the compiler / interpreter will say so and explain which functions you still have to define .
Once again , we see that a lot of types are already instances of typeclass Ord , and thus we are able to sort them .
Now , let 's take a look back to the definition of " Dir " :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-3-2.hs ' data Dir =
Dir { dir_size :: Int , dir_name :: String } deriving Show
See that " deriving " clause ?
It instructs the compiler to automatically derive code to make " Dir " an instance of typeclass Show .
The compiler knows about a bunch of standard typeclasses ( Eq , Ord , Show , Enum , Bound , Typeable to name a few ) and knows how to make a type into a " suitably good " instance of any of them .
If you want to derive instances of more than one typeclass , say it this way : " deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show ) " .
Voila !
Now we can compare , sort and print data of that type !
Side note for Java programmers : just imagine java compiler which derives code for " implements Storable " for you ...
Side note for C++ programmers : just imagine that deep copy constructors are being written for you by compiler ....
Exercises :
Examine typeclasses Eq and Show
Examine types of ( == ) and " print "
Try to make " Dir " instance of " Eq "
OK , back to our tests .
So , what we have had to do in order to make " Dir " an instance of " Arbitrary " ?
Minimal definition consists of " arbitrary " .
Let 's examine it up close :
* Main > :t arbitrary arbitrary :: ( Arbitrary a ) => Gen a
See that " Gen a " ?
Reminds you of something ?
Right !
Think of " IO a " and " Parser a " which we 've seen already .
This is yet another example of action - returning function , which could be used inside " do " - notation .
( You might ask yourself , would n't it be useful to generalize that convenient concept of actions and " do " ?
Of course !
It is already done , the concept is called " Monad " and we will talk about it in Chapter 400 :) )
Since 'a' here is a type variable which is an instance of " Arbitrary " , we could substitute " Dir " here .
So , how we can make and return an action of type " Gen Dir " ?
Let 's look at the code :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-3-2.hs ' arbitrary = lift M2
Dir gen_size gen_name -- Generate random size between 10 and 1400 Mb where gen_size = do s <- choose ( 10 , 1400 ) return ( s * 1024 * 1024 ) --
Generate random name 1 to 300 chars long , consisting of symbols " fubar / " gen_name = do n <- choose ( 1 , 300 ) replicateM n ( elements " fubar / " )
We have used the library - provided functions " choose " and " elements " to build up " gen_size :: Gen Int " and " gen_name :: Gen String " ( exercise : do n't take my word on that .
Find a way to check types of " gen_name " and " gen_size " ) .
Since " Int " and " String " are components of " Dir " , we sure must be able to use " Gen Int " and " Gen String " to build " Gen Dir " .
But where is the " do " block for that ?
There is none , and there is only single call to " liftM2 " .
Let 's examine it :
* Main > :t lift M2 liftM2 :: ( Monad m ) => ( a1 -> a 2 -> r ) -> m a 1 -> m a 2 -> m r
Kind of scary , right ?
Let 's provide typechecker with more context :
* Main > :t lift M2 Dir lift M2 Dir :: ( Monad m ) => m Int -> m String -> m
Dir
Since you already heard that " Gen " is a " Monad " , you could substitute " Gen " for " m " here , obtaining " liftM2 Dir :: ( Monad Gen ) => Gen Int -> Gen String -> Gen Dir " .
Exactly what we wanted !
Consider " liftM2 " to be " advanced topic " of this chapter ( which we will cover later ) and just note for now that :
" 2 " is a number of arguments for data constructor " Dir " and we have used " liftM2 " to construct " Gen Dir " out of " Dir "
There are also " liftM " , " liftM3 " , " liftM4 " , " liftM5 "
" liftM2 " is defined as " liftM2 f a 1 a 2 = do x < - a1 ; y<- a2 ; return ( f x y ) "
Hopefully , this will all make sense after you read it for the third time ;)
Oh , by the way - do n't forget to " darcs record " your changes !
Chapter 4 : REALLY packing the knapsack this time
In this chapter we are going to write another not - so - trivial packing method , compare packing methods efficiency , and learn something new about debugging and profiling of the Haskell programs along the way .
It might not be immediately obvious whether our packing algorithm is effective , and if yes - in which particular way ?
Whether it 's runtime , memory consumption or result are of sufficient quality , are there any alternative algorithms , and how do they compare to each other ?
Let 's code another solution to the knapsack packing problem , called the " dynamic programming method " and put both variants to the test .
This time , I 'll not dissect the listing and explain it bit by bit .
Instead , comments are provided in the code :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-4-1.hs '
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --
Dynamic programming solution to the knapsack ( or , rather , disk ) packing problem -- --
Let the `bestDisk x ' be the " most tightly packed " disk of total -- size no more than `x ' .
precomputeDisksFor :: [ Dir ] -> [ DirPack ] precomputeDisksFor dirs = --
By calculating `bestDisk ' for all possible disk sizes , we could -- obtain a solution for particular case by simple lookup in our list of -- solutions :) let precomp = map bestDisk [ 0 .. ] --
How to calculate `bestDisk '?
Lets opt for a recursive definition : -- Recursion base : best packed disk of size 0 is empty bestDisk 0 = DirPack 0 [ ] --
Recursion step : for size `limit` , bigger than 0 , best packed disk is -- computed as follows : bestDisk limit = -- 1 . Take all non-empty dirs that could possibly fit to that disk by itself .
-- Consider them one by one .
Let the size of particular dir be `dir_size d'. --
Let 's add it to the best - packed disk of size <= ( limit - dir_size d ) , thus -- producing the disk of size <= limit .
Lets do that for all " candidate " -- dirs that are not yet on our disk : case [ DirPack ( dir_size d + s ) ( d : ds ) | d <- filter ( ( inRange ( 1 , limit ) ) . dir_size ) dirs , dir_size d > 0 , let ( DirPack s ds ) = precomp !!
( limit - dir_size d ) , d ` notElem ` ds ] of --
We either fail to add any dirs ( probably , because all of them too big ) .
--
Well , just report that disk must be left empty : [ ] -> DirPack 0 [ ] --
Or we produce some alternative packings .
Let 's choose the best of them all : packs -> maximumBy cmpSize packs cmpSize a b = compare ( pack_size a ) ( pack_size b ) in precomp --
When we precomputed disk of all possible sizes for the given set of dirs , solution to -- particular problem is simple : just take the solution for the required ' media_size ' and -- that 's it !
dynamic_pack dirs = ( precomputeDisksFor dirs ) !!
media_size
Notice that it took almost the same amount of text to describe algorithm and to write implementation for it .
Nice , eh ?

[ other_function local_binding | x <- some_list , x > 0 , let local_binding = some_function x ] is called a " list comprehension " .
This is another example of " syntactic sugar " , which could lead to nicely readable code , but , when abused , could lead to syntactic caries :)
Do you understand what does this sample do : let solve x = [ y | x <- [ 0.. ] , y < - [ 0.. ] , y == x * x ] ?
Could you write ( with help of decent tutorial ) de-sugared version of this ?

Notice that in order to code quite complex implementation of precomputeDisksFor we split it up in several smaller pieces and put them as a local bindings inside let clause .

to both define on case - by - case basis and to " peer into " ( ) in the line Notice how we use function composition to compose complex condition to filter the list of dirs
Before we move any further , let 's do a small cosmetic change to our code .
Right now our solution uses ' Int ' to store directory size .
In Haskell , ' Int ' is a platform - dependent integer , which imposes certain limitations on the values of this type .
Attempt to compute the value of type ' Int ' that exceeds the bounds will result in overflow error .
Standard Haskell libraries have special typeclass Bounded , which allows to define and examine such bounds :
Prelude > :i Bounded class Bounded a where minBound :: a maxBound :: a -- skip -- instance Bounded Int -- Imported from GHC .
Enum
We see that ' Int ' is indeed bounded .
Let 's examine the bounds :
Prelude > minBound :: Int -2147483648 Prelude > maxBound :: Int 2147483647 Prelude >
Those of you who are C - literate , will spot at once that in this case the ' Int ' is so - called " signed 32 - bit integer " , which means that we would run into errors trying to operate on directories / directory packs which are bigger than 2 GB .
Luckily for us , Haskell has integers of arbitrary precision ( limited only by the amount of available memory ) .
The appropriate type is called ' Integer ' :
Prelude > ( 2^50 ) :: Int 0 -- overflow Prelude > ( 2^50 ) :: Integer 1125899906842624 -- no overflow Prelude >
Lets change definitions of ' Dir ' and ' DirPack ' to allow for bigger directory sizes :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-4-2.hs ' data Dir =
Dir { dir_size :: Integer , dir_name :: String } deriving ( Eq , Show ) data DirPack = DirPack { pack_size :: Integer , dirs :: [ Dir ]} deriving Show
Try to compile the code or load it into ghci .
You will get the following errors :
cd-fit-4-2.hs:73:79 : Could n't match ` Int ' against ` Integer '
Expected type : Int Inferred type : Integer
In the expression : limit - ( dir_size d) In the second argument of `(!! ) ' , namely `( limit - ( dir_size d ) ) ' cd-fit-4-2.hs:89:47 : Could n't match ` Int ' against ` Integer '
Expected type : Int Inferred type : Integer
In the second argument of `(!! ) ' , namely `media_size '
In the definition of `dynamic_pack ' : dynamic_pack dirs = ( precomputeDisksFor dirs ) !!
media_size
It seems like Haskell have some troubles using ' Integer ' with '( !! ) '.
Let 's see why :
Prelude > :t (!! ) (!! ) :: [ a ] ->
Int -> a
Seems like definition of '(!! ) ' demands that index will be ' Int ' , not ' Integer ' .
Haskell never converts any type to some other type automatically - programmer have to explicitly ask for that .
I will not repeat the section " Standard Haskell Classes " from the Haskell Report and explain , why typeclasses for various numbers organized the way they are organized .
I will just say that standard typeclass Num demands that numeric types implement method fromInteger :
Prelude > :i
Num class ( Eq a , Show a ) =>
Num a where (+ ) :: a -> a -> a (* ) :: a -> a -> a (-) :: a -> a -> a negate :: a -> a abs :: a -> a signum :: a -> a fromInteger :: Integer -> a -- Imported from GHC .
Num instance Num Float -- Imported from GHC .
Float instance Num Double -- Imported from GHC .
Float instance Num Integer -- Imported from GHC .
Num instance Num Int -- Imported from GHC .
Num
We see that Integer is a member of typeclass Num , thus we could use from Integer to make the type errors go away :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-4-2.hs ' -- snip case [ DirPack ( dir_size d + s ) ( d : ds ) | d <- filter ( ( inRange ( 1 , limit ) ) . dir_size ) dirs , dir_size d > 0 , let ( DirPack s ds ) = precomp !!
( fromInteger ( limit - dir_size d ) ) , d ` notElem ` ds ] of -- snip dynamic_pack dirs = ( precomputeDisksFor dirs ) !! ( fromInteger media_size ) -- snip
Type errors went away , but careful reader will spot at once that when expression ( limit - dir_size d ) will exceed the bounds for Int , overflow will occur , and we will not access the correct list element .
Do n't worry , we will deal with this in a short while .
Now , lets code the QuickCheck test for this function along the lines of the test for greedy_pack :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-4-2.hs ' prop_dynamic_pack_is_fixpoint ds = let pack = dynamic_pack ds in pack_size pack == pack_size ( dynamic_pack ( dirs pack ) )
Now , lets try to run ( DON'T PANIC and save all you work in other applications first ! ) :
* Main > quickCheck prop_dynamic_pack_is_fixpoint
Now , you took my advice seriously , do n't you ?
And you did have your Ctrl - C handy , did n't you ?
Most probably , the attempt to run the test resulted in all your memory being taken by ghci process , which you hopefully interrupted soon enough by pressing Ctrl -C .
What happened ?
Who ate all the memory ?
How to debug this problem ?
GHC comes with profiling abilities , but we could not use them - they produce report after program terminates , and our does n't seem to do so without consuming several terabytes of memory first .
Still , there is a lot of room for maneuver .
Let 's see .
Since we called dynamic_pack and it ate all the memory , let 's not do this again .
Instead , let 's see what this function does and tweak it a bit to explore it 's behavior .
Since we already know that random lists of " Dir "s generated for our Quick Check tests are of modest size ( after all , greedy_pack munches them without significant memory consumption ) , the size of the input most probably is not the issue .
However , dynamic_pack_is_fixpoint is building quite a huge list internally ( via precomputeDisksFor ) .
Could this be a problem ?
Let 's turn the timing / memory stats on ( " : set +s " on ghci prompt ) and try to peek into various elements of list returned by precomputeDisksFor :
Prelude > :l cd-fit.hs Compiling Main ( cd-fit.hs , interpreted )
Ok , modules loaded : Main .
* Main > : set +s * Main > ( precomputeDisksFor [ Dir 1 " aaa " ] ) !!
0 DirPack {pack_size = 0 , dirs = [ ] } ( 0.06 secs , 1277972 bytes ) * Main > ( precomputeDisksFor [ Dir 1 " aaa " ] ) !!
10 DirPack {pack_size = 0 , dirs = [ ]} ( 0.00 secs , 0 bytes ) * Main > ( precomputeDisksFor [ Dir 1 " aaa " ] ) !!
100 DirPack {pack_size = 0 , dirs = [ ] } ( 0.01 secs , 1519064 bytes ) * Main > ( precomputeDisksFor [ Dir 1 " aaa " ] ) !!
1000 DirPack {pack_size = 0 , dirs = [ ] } ( 0.03 secs , 1081808 bytes ) * Main > ( precomputeDisksFor [ Dir 1 " aaa " ] ) !!
10000 DirPack {pack_size = 0 , dirs = [ ] } ( 1.39 secs , 12714088 bytes ) * Main > ( precomputeDisksFor [ Dir 1 " aaa " ] ) !!
100000 Interrupted .
Aha !
This seems to be a problem , since computation of 100000 fails to terminate in " reasonable " time , and to think that we have tried to compute 700 * 1024 * 1024 th element ...
Lets modify our code a bit , to allow disk size to be tweaked :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-4-3.hs ' dynamic_pack limit dirs = ( precomputeDisksFor dirs ) !! ( fromInteger limit ) prop_dynamic_pack_is_fixpoint ds = let pack = dynamic_pack media_size ds in pack_size pack == pack_size ( dynamic_pack media_size ( dirs pack ) ) prop_dynamic_pack_small_disk ds = let pack = dynamic_pack 50000 ds in pack_size pack == pack_size ( dynamic_pack 50000 ( dirs pack ) ) -- rename " old " main to " moin " main = quick Check prop_dynamic_pack_small_disk
Compute a profiling version of you code with ghc - O -- make - prof - auto - all -o cd- fit cd - fit.hs and run it like this :
$ ./cd-fit +RTS -p OK , passed 100 tests .
First thing , note that our code satisfies at least one simple property .
Good .
Now let 's examine profile .
Look into file " cd-fit.prof " , which was produced in your current directory .
Most probably , you 'll see something like this :
cd-fit +RTS
-p -RTS total time = 2.18 secs ( 109 ticks @ 20 ms ) total alloc = 721,433,008 bytes ( excludes profiling overheads ) COST CENTRE MODULE % time % alloc precomputeDisksFor Main 88.1 99.8 dynamic_pack Main 11.0 0.0
individual inherited COST CENTRE MODULE no. entries % time %alloc % time % alloc MAIN MAIN 1 0 0.0 0.0 100.0 100.0 CAF Main 174 11 0.9 0.2 100.0 100.0 prop_dynamic_pack_small_disk Main 181 100 0.0 0.0 99.1 99.8 dynamic_pack Main 182 200 11.0 0.0 99.1 99.8 precomputeDisksFor Main 183 200 88.1 99.8 88.1 99.8 main Main 180 1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
Examine column of " individual %alloc " .
As we thought , all memory was allocated within precomputeDisksFor .
However , amount of memory allocated ( more than 700 MB , according to the line " total alloc " ) seems to be a little too much for our simple task .
We will dig deeper and find where we a wasting it .
Let 's examine memory consumption a little closer via so - called " heap profiles " .
Run ./cd-fit +RTS -hb .
This produces " biographical heap profile " , which tells us how various parts of the memory were used during the program run time .
Heap profile was saved to " cd-fit.hp " .
It is next to impossible to read and comprehend it as is , so use " hp2ps cd-fit.hp " to produce a nice PostScript picture which is worth a thousand words .
View it with " gv " or " ghostview " or " full Adobe Acrobat ( not Reader ) " .
( This and subsequent pictures are not attached here ) .
Notice that most of the graph is taken up by region marked as " VOID " .
This means that memory allocated was never used .
Notice that there is no areas marked as " USE " , " LAG " or " DRAG " .
Seems like our program hardly uses any of the allocated memory at all .
Wait a minute !
How could that be ?
Surely it must use something when it packs to the imaginary disks of 50000 bytes those random - generated directories which are 10 to 1400 Mb in size ....
Oops .
Severe size mismatch .
We should have spotted it earlier , when we were timing precomputeDisksFor .
Scroll back and observe how each run returned the very same result - empty directory set .
Our random directories are too big , but nevertheless code spends time and memory trying to " pack " them .
Obviously , precomputeDisksFor ( which is responsible for 90 % of total memory consumption and run time ) is flawed in some way .
Let 's take a closer look at what takes up so much memory .
Run ./cd-fit +RTS
-h -hbvoid and produce PostScript picture for this memory profile .
This will give us detailed breakdown of all memory whose " biography " shows that it 's been " VOID " ( unused ) .
My picture ( and I presume that yours as well ) shows that VOID memory comprises of " thunks " labeled " precomputeDisksFor / pre ... " .
We could safely assume that second word would be " precomp " ( You wonder why ?
Look again at the code and try to find function named " pre . * " which is called from inside precomputeDisksFor )
This means that memory has been taken by the list generated inside " precomp " .
Rumor has it that memory leaks with Haskell are caused by either too little laziness or too much laziness .
It seems like we have too little laziness here : we evaluate more elements of the list that we actually need and keep them from being garbage - collected .
Note how we look up element from " precomp " in this piece of code :
case [ DirPack ( dir_size d + s ) ( d : ds ) | d <- filter ( ( inRange ( 1 , limit ) ) . dir_size ) dirs , dir_size d > 0 , let ( DirPack s ds ) = precomp !!
( fromInteger ( limit - dir_size d ) ) , d ` notElem ` ds
Obviously , the whole list generated by " precomp " must be kept in memory for such lookups , since we can't be sure that some element could be garbage collected and will not be needed again .
Let 's rewrite the code to eliminate the list ( incidentally , this will also deal with the possible Int overflow while accessing the " precomp " via ( !!) operator ) :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-4-4.hs ' --
Let the `bestDisk x ' be the " most tightly packed " disk of total -- size no more than `x ' . -- How to calculate `bestDisk '?
Lets opt for a recursive definition : -- Recursion base : best packed disk of size 0 is empty and best - packed -- disk for empty list of directories on it is also empty .
bestDisk 0 _ = DirPack 0 [ ] bestDisk _ [ ] = DirPack 0 [ ] --
Recursion step : for size `limit` , bigger than 0 , best packed disk is -- computed as follows : bestDisk limit dirs = --
Take all non-empty dirs that could possibly fit to that disk by itself .
-- Consider them one by one .
Let the size of particular dir be `dir_size d'. --
Let 's add it to the best - packed disk of size <= ( limit - dir_size d ) , thus -- producing the disk of size <= limit .
Lets do that for all " candidate " -- dirs that are not yet on our disk : case [ DirPack ( dir_size d + s ) ( d : ds ) | d <- filter ( ( inRange ( 1 , limit ) ) . dir_size ) dirs , dir_size d > 0 , let ( DirPack s ds ) = bestDisk ( limit - dir_size d ) dirs , d ` notElem ` ds ] of --
We either fail to add any dirs ( probably , because all of them too big ) .
--
Well , just report that disk must be left empty : [ ] -> DirPack 0 [ ] --
Or we produce some alternative packings .
Let 's choose the best of them all : packs -> maximumBy cmpSize packs cmpSize a b = compare ( pack_size a ) ( pack_size b ) dynamic_pack limit dirs = bestDisk limit dirs
Compile the profiling version of this code and obtain the overall execution profile ( with " + RTS - p " ) .
You 'll get something like this :
cd-fit +RTS
-p -RTS total time = 0.00 secs ( 0 ticks @ 20 ms ) total alloc = 1,129,520 bytes ( excludes profiling overheads ) COST CENTRE MODULE % time % alloc CAF GHC .
Float 0.0 4.4 main Main 0.0 93.9 individual inherited COST CENTRE MODULE no. entries % time %alloc % time % alloc MAIN MAIN 1 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 100.0 main Main 180 1 0.0 93.9 0.0 94.2 prop_dynamic_pack_small_disk Main 181 100 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 dynamic_pack Main 182 200 0.0 0.2 0.0 0.3 bestDisk Main 183 200 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.1
We achieved the major improvement : memory consumption is reduced by factor of 700 !
Now we could test the code on the " real task " - change the code to run the test for packing the full - sized disk :
main = quickCheck prop_dynamic_pack_is_fixpoint
Compile with profiling and run ( with " + RTS - p " ) .
If you are not lucky and a considerably big test set would be randomly generated for your runs , you 'll have to wait .
And wait even more .
And more .
Go make some tea .
Drink it .
Read some Tolstoi ( Do you have " War and peace " handy ? ) .
Chances are that by the time you are done with Tolstoi , program will still be running ( just take my word on it , do n't check ) .
If you are lucky , your program will finish fast enough and leave you with profile .
According to a profile , program spends 99 % of its time inside bestDisk .
Could we speed up bestDisk somehow ?
Note that bestDisk performs several simple calculation for which it must call itself .
However , it is done rather inefficiently - each time we pass to bestDisk the exact same set of directories as it was called with , even if we have already " packed " some of them .
Let 's amend this :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-4-5.hs ' case [ DirPack ( dir_size d + s ) ( d : ds ) | let small_enough = filter ( ( inRange ( 0 , limit ) ) .
dir_size ) dirs , d <- small_enough , dir_size d > 0 , let ( DirPack s ds ) = bestDisk ( limit - dir_size d ) ( delete d small_enough ) ] of
Recompile and run again .
Runtimes could be lengthy , but bearable , and number of times bestDisk is called ( according to the profile ) should decrease significantly .
Finally , let 's compare both packing algorithms .
Intuitively , we feel that greedy algorithm should produce worse results , do n't we ?
Lets put this feeling to the test :
-- Taken from ' cd - fit-4-5.hs ' prop_greedy_pack_is_no_better_than_dynamic_pack ds = pack_size ( greedy_pack ds ) <= pack_size ( dynamic_pack media_size ds )
Verify that it is indeed so by running quickCheck for this test several time .
I feel that this concludes our knapsacking exercises .
Adventurous readers could continue further by implementing so - called " scaling " for dynamic_pack where we divide all directory sizes and medium size by the size of the smallest directory to proceed with smaller numbers ( which promises faster runtimes ) .
Chapter 5 : ( Ab ) using monads and destructing constructors for fun and profit
We already mentioned monads quite a few times .
They are described in numerous articles and tutorial ( See Chapter 400 ) .
It 's hard to read a daily dose of any Haskell mailing list and not to come across a word " monad " a dozen times .
Since we already made quite a progress with Haskell , it 's time we revisit the monads once again .
I will let the other sources teach you theory behind the monads , overall usefulness of the concept , etc .
Instead , I will focus on providing you with examples .
Let 's take a part of the real world program which involves XML processing .
We will work with XML tag attributes , which are essentially named values :
-- Taken from ' chapter5 - 1.hs ' type Attribute = ( Name , AttValue )
' Name ' is a plain string , and value could be either string or references ( also strings ) to another attributes which holds the actual value ( now , this is not a valid XML thing , but for the sake of providing a nice example , let 's accept this ) .
Word " either " suggests that we use ' Either ' datatype :
type AttValue = Either Value [ Reference ] type Name = String type Value = String type Reference = String --
Sample list of simple attributes : simple_attrs = [ ( " xml:lang " , Left " en " ) , ( " xmlns " , Left " jabber:client " ) , ( " xmlns:stream " , Left " http://etherx.jabber.org/streams " ) ] --
Sample list of attributes with references : complex_attrs = [ ( " xml:lang " , Right [ " lang " ] ) , ( " lang " , Left " en " ) , ( " xmlns " , Right [ " ns " , " subns " ] ) , ( " ns " , Left " jabber " ) , ( " subns " , Left " client " ) , ( " xmlns:stream " , Left " http://etherx.jabber.org/streams " ) ]
Our task is : to write a function that will look up a value of attribute by it's name from the given list of attributes .
When attribute contains reference (s ) , we resolve them ( looking for the referenced attribute in the same list ) and concatenate their values , separated by semicolon .
Thus , lookup of attribute " xmlns " form both sample sets of attributes should return the same value .
Following the example set by the Data .
List.lookup from the standard libraries , we will call our function lookupAttr and it will return Maybe Value , allowing for lookup errors :
-- Taken from ' chapter5- 1.hs ' lookupAttr :: Name -> [ Attribute ] -> Maybe Value --
Since we dont have code for ' lookupAttr ' , but want -- to compile code already , we use the function ' undefined ' to -- provide default , " always - fail - with - runtime - error " function body .
lookupAttr = undefined
Let 's try to code lookupAttr using lookup in a very straightforward way :
-- Taken from ' chapter5 - 1.hs ' import Data .
List lookupAttr :: Name -> [ Attribute ] ->
Maybe Value lookupAttr nm attrs = --
First , we lookup ' Maybe AttValue ' by name and -- check whether we are successful : case ( lookup nm attrs ) of -- Pass the lookup error through .
Nothing -> Nothing --
If given name exist , see if it is value of reference : Just attv -> case attv of --
It 's a value .
Return it !
Left val ->
Just val --
It 's a list of references :( --
We have to look them up , accounting for -- possible failures .
--
First , we will perform lookup of all references ...
Right refs -> let vals = [ lookupAttr ref attrs | ref <- refs ] -- .. then , we will exclude lookup failures wo_failures = filter ( /= Nothing ) vals -- ... find a way to remove annoying ' Just ' wrapper stripJust ( Just v ) = v -- ... use it to extract all lookup results as strings strings = map stripJust wo_failures in -- ... finally , combine them into single String . --
If all lookups failed , we should pass failure to caller .
case null strings of True -> Nothing False ->
Just ( concat ( intersperse " : " strings ) )
Testing :
* Main > lookupAttr " xmlns " complex_attrs Just " jabber : client " * Main > lookupAttr " xmlns " simple_attrs Just " jabber : client " * Main >
It works , but ...
It seems strange that such a boatload of code required for quite simple task .
If you examine the code closely , you 'll see that the code bloat is caused by :
the fact that after each step we check whether the error occurred
unwrapping Strings from Maybe and Either data constructors and wrapping them back .
At this point C++/ Java programmers would say that since we just pass errors upstream , all those cases could be replaced by the single " try ... catch ... " block , and they would be right .
Does this mean that Haskell programmers are reduced to using " case "s , which were already obsolete 10 years ago ?
Monads to the rescue !
As you can read elsewhere ( see section 400 ) , monads are used in advanced ways to construct computations from other computations .
Just what we need - we want to combine several simple steps ( lookup value , lookup reference , ... ) into function lookupAttr in a way that would take into account possible failures .
Lets start from the code and dissect in afterwards :
-- Taken from ' chapter5 - 2.hs ' import Control .
Monad lookupAttr ' nm attrs = do -- First , we lookup ' AttValue ' by name attv <- lookup nm attrs --
See if it is value of reference : case attv of --
It 's a value .
Return it !
Left val ->
Just val --
It 's a list of references :( --
We have to look them up , accounting for -- possible failures .
--
First , we will perform lookup of all references ...
Right refs -> do vals <- sequence $ map ( flip lookupAttr ' attrs ) refs -- ... since all failures are already excluded by " monad magic " , -- ... all all ' Just 's have been removed likewise , -- ... we just combine values into single String , -- ... and return failure if it is empty .
guard ( not ( null vals ) ) return ( concat ( intersperse " : " vals ) )
Exercise : compile the code , test that lookupAttr and lookupAttr ' really behave in the same way .
Try to write a QuickCheck test for that , defining the instance Arbitrary Name such that arbitrary names will be taken from names available in simple_attrs .
Well , back to the story .
Noticed the drastic reduction in code size ?
If you drop comments , the code will occupy mere 7 lines instead of 13 - almost two - fold reduction .
How we achieved this ?
First , notice that we never ever check whether some computation returns Nothing anymore .
Yet , try to lookup some non-existing attribute name , and lookupAttr ' will return Nothing .
How does this happen ?
Secret lies in the fact that type constructor Maybe is a " monad " .
We use keyword do to indicate that following block of code is a sequence of monadic actions , where monadic magic have to happen when we use '< -' , ' return ' or move from one action to another .
Different monads have different magic .
Library code says that type constructor Maybe is such a monad that we could use <- to " extract " values from wrapper Just and use return to put them back in form of Just some_value .
When we move from one action in the " do " block to another a check happens .
If the action returned Nothing , all subsequent computations will be skipped and the whole " do " block will return Nothing .
Try this to understand it all better :
* Main > let foo x = do v <- x ; return ( v + 1 ) in foo ( Just 5 ) Just 6 * Main > let foo x = do v <- x ; return ( v + 1 ) in foo Nothing Nothing * Main > let foo x = do v <- x ; return ( Data .
Char . ord v ) in foo ( Just ' a ' ) Just 97 * Main > let foo x = do v <- x ; return ( Data .
Char . ord v ) in foo Nothing Nothing * Main >
Do not mind sequence and guard just for now - we will get to them in the little while .
Since we already removed one reason for code bloat , it is time to deal with the other one .
Notice that we have to use case to deconstruct the value of type Either Value [ Reference ] .
Surely we are not the first to do this , and such use case have to be quite a common one .
Indeed , there is a simple remedy for our case , and it is called either :
* Main > :t either either :: ( a -> c ) -> ( b -> c ) ->
Either a b -> c
Scary type signature , but here are examples to help you grok it :
* Main > :t either ( +1 ) ( length ) either ( +1 ) ( length ) :: Either Int [ a ] ->
Int * Main > either ( +1 ) ( length ) ( Left 5 ) 6 * Main > either ( +1 ) ( length ) ( Right " foo " ) 3 * Main >
Seems like this is exactly our case .
Let 's replace the case with invocation of either :
-- Taken from ' chapter 5 - 3.hs ' lookupAttr '' nm attrs = do attv <- lookup nm attrs either Just ( dereference attrs ) attv where dereference attrs refs = do vals <- sequence $ map ( flip lookup Attr ' ' attrs ) refs guard ( not ( null vals ) ) return ( concat ( intersperse " : " vals ) )
It keeps getting better and better :)
Now , as semi-exercise , try to understand the meaning of " sequence " , " guard " and " flip " looking at the following ghci sessions :
* Main > :t sequence sequence :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m [ a ]
* Main > :t [ Just ' a ' , Just ' b ' , Nothing , Just 'c ' ]
[ Just ' a ' , Just ' b ' , Nothing , Just ' c ' ] :: [ Maybe Char ] * Main > :t sequence [ Just ' a ' , Just ' b ' , Nothing , Just ' c ' ] sequence [ Just ' a ' , Just ' b ' , Nothing , Just ' c ' ] :: Maybe [ Char ]
* Main > sequence [ Just ' a ' , Just ' b ' , Nothing , Just 'c ' ]
Nothing * Main > sequence [ Just ' a ' , Just ' b ' , Nothing ]
Nothing * Main > sequence [ Just ' a ' , Just 'b ' ]
Just " ab "
* Main > :t [ putStrLn " a " , putStrLn " b " ] [ putStrLn " a " , putStrLn " b " ] :: [ IO ( ) ]
* Main > :t sequence [ putStrLn " a " , putStrLn " b " ] sequence [ putStrLn " a " , putStrLn " b " ] :: IO [ ( ) ]
* Main > sequence [ putStrLn " a " , putStrLn " b " ] a b
* Main > :t [ putStrLn " a " , fail " stop here " , putStrLn " b " ] [ putStrLn " a " , fail " stop here " , putStrLn " b " ] :: [ IO ( ) ]
* Main > :t sequence [ putStrLn " a " , fail " stop here " , putStrLn " b " ] sequence [ putStrLn " a " , fail " stop here " , putStrLn " b " ] :: IO [ ( ) ]
* Main > sequence [ putStrLn " a " , fail " stop here " , putStrLn " b " ]
a *** Exception : user error ( stop here )
Notice that for monad Maybe sequence continues execution until the first Nothing .
The same behavior could be observed for IO monad .
Take into account that different behaviors are not hardcoded into the definition of sequence !
Now , let 's examine guard :
* Main > let foo x = do v <- x ; guard ( v/=5 ) ; return ( v+1 ) in map foo [ Just 4 , Just 5 , Just 6 ] [ Just 5 , Nothing , Just 7 ]
As you can see , it 's just a simple way to " stop " execution at some condition .
If you have been hooked on monads , I urge you to read " All About Monads " right now ( link in Chapter 400 ) .
Chapter 6 : Where do you want to go tomorrow ?
As the name implies , the author is open for proposals - where should we go next ?
I had networking + xml / xmpp in mind , but it might be too heavy and too narrow for most of the readers .
What do you think ?
Drop me a line .
Chapter 400 : Monads up close
Read this wikibook chapter .
Then , read " All about monads " .
' Nuff said :)
Chapter 500 : IO up close
Shows that :
c = do a <- someAction b <- someOtherAction print ( bar b ) print ( foo a ) print " done "
really is just a syntax sugar for :
c = someAction >>= \ a -> someOtherAction >>= \ b -> print ( bar b ) >> print ( foo a ) >> print " done "
and explains about " > >= " and " > > " .
Oh wait .
This was already explained in Chapter 400 :)

Two Hundred Sixty
Four years ago today , one of history greatest advocates of human freedom was born .
Though he went on to live a life that , at times , contradicted the principles that he advocated , Thomas Jefferson remains one of America ’s greatest treasures .
I can think of no better way to remember him today than by remembering his legacy .
First , there is his greatest legacy of all , the Declaration of Independence :
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
And , shortly thereafter , Jefferson was instrument in passage of the Virginia Statute For Religious Freedom which provided :
[ N ] o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship , place , or ministry whatsoever , nor shall be enforced , restrained , molested , or burthened in his body or goods , nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief ; but that all men shall be free to profess , and by argument to maintain , their opinion in matters of religion , and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge , or affect their civil capacities .
But it was n’t just in official documents that Jefferson ’s greatest words can be found .
Consider this :
The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others .
But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no God .
It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg .
Or these gems from Jefferson ’s First Inaugural :
Still one thing more , fellow citizens – a wise and frugal government , which shall restrain men from injuring one another , which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement , and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned .
This is the sum of good government , and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities .
Equal and exact justice to all men , of whatever state or persuasion , religious or political ; peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations , entangling alliances with none … Freedom of religion ; freedom of the press , and freedom of person under the protection of the habeus corpus , and trial by juries impartially selected .
These principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us , and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation .
The wisdom of our sages and the blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment .
They should be the creed of our political faith , the text of civil instruction , the touchstone by which we try the services of those we trust ; and should we wander from them in moments of error or alarm , let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace , liberty , and safety .
Finally , as the American Republic was still in its infancy , Jefferson recognized that the spirit of the Revolution needed to stay alive if freedom was to survive :
God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion .
The people cannot be all , and always , well informed .
The part which is wrong will be discontented , in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive .
If they remain quiet under such misconceptions , it is lethargy , the forerunner of death to the public liberty … .
And what country can preserve its liberties , if its rulers are not warned from time to time , that this people preserve the spirit of resistance ?
Let them take arms .
The remedy is to set them right as to the facts , pardon and pacify them .
What signify a few lives lost in a century or two ?
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time , with the blood of patriots and tyrants .
It is its natural manure .
Unfortunately , the American people have not been as vigilant in protecting their freedoms as Mr. Jefferson would have liked .
And , now , there is much work to be done if the vision of Jefferson on the other Founders is to be restored .
Cigarette makers increased the amount of nicotine that smokers typically inhale by 11 % between 1998 to 2005 , perpetuating a “ tobacco pandemic ” that makes it harder for smokers to quit , according to a new study .
Manufactures have been intensifying the concentration of nicotine in their tobacco and modifying cigarette designs to increase the number of puffs per cigarette , the researchers claim .
“ The end result is a product that is potentially more addictive , ” they say .
The team at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston , US , analysed data submitted by major cigarette brands to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health , which in August 2006 released its own study showing nicotine levels steadily rising .
The amount of nicotine that smokers typically consume per cigarette regardless of brand per year rose by an average of 1.6 % between 1998 and 2005 , according to the new analysis of the state ’s health records .
Advertisement
Massachusetts has required tobacco companies to submit annual reports on cigarette nicotine yields since 1997 , longer than any other US state .
Cancer role
“ Cigarettes are finely tuned drug delivery devices designed to perpetuate a tobacco pandemic , ” says Howard Koh , the school ’s associate dean for public health practice and former Massachusetts commissioner of public health .
Nicotine yields rose in cigarettes of each of the four major manufacturers and across all major cigarette market categories – from mentholated and non-mentholated to full - flavoured , light and ultralight , the researchers found .
Nicotine is the main addictive component of tobacco , but studies have demonstrated that the chemical also plays a direct role in cancer , by speeding up the growth of tumours .
Tobacco industry officials were not immediately available to comment .
Phillip Morris , part of Altria Group Inc and the largest cigarette maker , has said nicotine levels fluctuate from year to year but there has been no steady increase .
Sales dropping
The most recent federal tobacco tax figures showed that the number of cigarettes sold in the US fell in 2005 to the lowest level in 55 years , dropping 4.2 % from 2004 , the largest one - year percentage decrease since 1999 .
That continued an eight - year decline in cigarette smoking since the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between US states and the tobacco industry that settled state lawsuits over the costs of treating smoking - related illnesses .
“ Our findings call into serious question whether the tobacco industry has changed at all in its pursuit of addicting smokers since signing the Master Settlement Agreement , ” said Gregory Connolly , director of the Harvard School of Public Health ’s Tobacco Control Research Program .
He said tobacco companies had failed to warn consumers about rising levels of nicotine since the 1998 settlement , urging US states to step up scrutiny of the industry .

Vse Poslano v Foto | |
V Kamnik je prišla skupina dijakov s Sicilije in povabili so nas , da jim predstavimo fotoaparat domače izdelave , pinhole ( nekateri ga imenujejo tudi luknjarica ) .
Glede na to , da sem imel le eno uro časa za predstavitev , sem se izdelave aparata lotil že prej .
Na spletu je kar nekaj vodičev za izdelavo , a nisem našel takega , ki bi natančno pojasnil točne mere pri mašineriji .
Očitno prilika zame , da povzamem :)
Potrebujemo :
škatlo ( po možnosti trdo in tako , ki ne prepušča svetlobe , recimo od čevljev ali kaj podobnega )
srebrno folijo ( za sendviče ! )
flomaster ali črn lepilni trak ( sprej za potuho )
šivanko ( drobno )
olfa nož ( najbrž bi šlo tudi s š karjami , če niste preveč nerodni )
meter
selotejp
fotografski papir ( pravi foto papir , ne tisti za printat fotke )
napolitanke ( optional )
Postopek
1. Ohišje
Izmerimo škatlo .
To je dokaj bistveno .
Razložim ob priliki .
Nato na sredino ene stranice ( načeloma ne pokrova ) izrežemo luknjo , cirka 1×1 centimeter .
Škatlo nato od znotraj pobarvamo s črnim flomastrom ali oblepimo s črnim trakom .
Tisti bolj lenobne sorte jo ponavadi kar posprejajo s črnim sprejem .
Zakaj tolikokrat poudarjam črno ?
Ker s tem zmanjšamo odseve svetlobe znotraj škatle .
Škatlo lahko polepimo tudi z zunanje strani , ampak to je bolj za vizualni efekt .
Ker Delamaris fotoaparat je bistveno bolj hardcore =)
Namig : če jo boste prelepili , luknjo lahko izrežete tudi kasneje , jasno .
2. Zaslonka in zaklop
Na notranjo stran škatle ( tam , kjer imamo načeloma našo dokaj oglato luknjo ) nalepimo košček srebrne folije za sendviče , ki prekrije odprtino .
Po neki teoriji bi morala biti zdaj v škatli popolna tema ( tako kot v hladilniku , ko zapreš vrata , pravijo ) .
Nato skozi to tanko srebrno folijo naredimo eno majceno luknjico s šivanko .
Ponavadi na zaženemo cele šivanke skozi , ampak le prebodemo s konico .
Luknjica naj ima premer cirka 0,4 mm .
Tam na oko :)
Kot zaklop lahko uporabimo košček črnega lepilnega traku ( ali srebrnega ali rumenega ali… pač nekaj , kar ne prepušča svetlobe ) .
Če ste špilavne volje , lahko sami izdelate tudi neke vrste zaklop in sprožilec …
Jaz sem se hecal v tej smeri , pazljivi bodite le , da ne bo light leakov .
There !
TwinLens fotoaparat , huda reč =)
3. Vstavljanje svetlobno občutljivega medija
Ali loadanje filma :)
OK , v teoriji je stvar dokaj preprosta …
Zapremo naš zaklop , da svetloba ne pride noter , nato gremo v nek silno temačen prostor ( mi mu rečemo kar temnica , go figure ) in tam vstavimo foto papir .
V takšen aparat bi načeloma lahko vstavili tudi pravi film ( recimo ČB negativ ) , ampak je lažje , če damo kar en košček papirja , v mojem primeru recimo 10×6 cm , ki ga s selotejpom pritrdimo na zadnjo ( notranjo ) stran škatle , torej vizavi naše male luknjice .
Ko je papir enkrat noter ( aha , naj še enkrat poudarim , da to ni nek print papir ala canon ali HP , ampak proper foto papir , recimo Efke , Ilford ali kaj podobnega ) , zapremo škatlico in jo zadaj dobro zalepimo .
Res , pazljivo , da ne bo kake ekstra špranje .
4. Fotkanje
Gremo ven , pazljivo izberemo motiv , natančno kadriramo in sprožimo !
Hehe , seveda …
OK , v resnici je to bolj tako , da postavimo aparat in ga usmerimo v objekt , potem pa naredimo fotko in nimamo pojma , kaj bo notri in koliko bo notri .
Glede na to , da je goriščnica relativno kratka , je tole na slikah širokokotni pinhole .
Če bi luknjico naredil na levi ali desni strani , bo dobil bolj “ tele ” varianto .
Jasno ?
Upam .
Sicer pa probajte , saj sta lahko tudi 2 luknjici na eni škatli , le med slikanjem naj bo ena zaprta .
Papir je bistveno manj občutljiv kot film , zato ponavadi traja kar nekaj minut , da napravimo posnetek .
Glede na to , da imamo fiksno zaslonko ( heh ) , je čas osvetljevanja odvisen predvsem od svetlobnih pogojev ( vremena ) .
Prav tako je pametno paziti , da ni preveč vetrovno , sicer bomo imeli na fotki kakih 17 kadrov .
Ali pa pač gor postavite en kamen , tudi zaleže , če niste ravno iz Ajdovščine .
5. Tehnikalije
To je tisto , kar pogrešam pri večini vodičev …
Kako velika slika bo , koliko časa osvetljevati , kak šno luknjico narediti …
Kdo bi vedel ?
Zato nam pride prav Camera design calculator , kjer levo zgoraj vnesemo goriščnico ( to je razdalja med luknjico in papirjem , ergo globina škatle ) , potem pa nam ( desno zgoraj ) izračuna optimalni premer luknjice .
Delamaris pinhole ( TwinLens edition ) ima goriščnico 6 centimetrov , torej ima luknjico premera švoh 0,4 mm , neka škatla za čevlje z goriščnico 29 centimetrov pa ima 0,7 mm luknjico ( to bi bil že bolj “ tele ” pinhole ) .
Zanimivo je tudi polje Image diameter , ki nam pove , približno kako velika bo projecirana slika na papirju ( načeloma bi morala biti diagonala našega koščka papirja manjša od tega premera ; v nasprotnem primeru se pojavi vinjetiranje ) .
V zadnji vrstici pa imamo še čaroben podatek glede časa osvetljevanja .
Če slikamo na film , pač vpišemo , koliko ASA ima film , če pa fotkamo na papir , potem pa je to malce bolj kavbojsko .
Načeloma velja , da je v primeru jasnega in sončnega vremena ASA okrog 8 ali celo 10 .
Če pa je oblačno ali temno ( ali če fotkamo notri , pod lučmi ) , pa je ekvivalent ASA recimo 2 ( za delno oblačno je okrog 5 , za občutek ) .
Ko vpišemo podatek o svetlobni občutljivosti medija ( ASA / ISO ) , nam na desni izračuna priporočeni čas osvetlitve .
V primeru , da slikamo na papir , je to ponavadi kar nekaj minut , v oblačnem vremenu celo do pol ure .
Zdaj je najbrž jasno , zakaj mora biti škatla pri miru ( ali pod kamnom ) .
Obstaja še en tak fleten pinhole calculator , ki daje podobne rezultate .
6. Razvijanje
Skočite v temnico , odprete škatlo , ven vzamete film in ga razvijete v kemikalijah .
V 15 minutah ste fertik in že lahko vstavite nov papir in greste delat novo fotko .
Ampak se bolj splača narediti nekaj več “ aparatov ” in z njimi slikati sočasno . =)
Zaključek
Camera obscura ( pinhole ) je preprost fotoaparat , ki ga lahko izdelamo sami v nekaj minutah .
Ko slikamo prvič , ponavadi še ne vemo natančno , kako širok kader bomo zajeli , ampak z vajo dobimo občutek in vsaka naslednja fotka je boljša , zato nikarte ne obupajte , če ne rata iz prve .
Meni ni , naslednje 3 so bile pa super :)
Hvala Dušanu , Bojanu , Jaku in Ani za pomoč pri delavnici .

Today , the arguments have switched focus to stem cells , and the research itself is beginning to change tack .
“ Scientists clone adult sheep — triumph of UK raises alarm over human use , ” ran the first headline announcing the cloning of an adult mammal ten years ago this week .
Ian Wilmut at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh and his colleagues at PPL Therapeutics in East Lothian reported on 27 February 1997 that they had produced a lamb named Dolly , born the previous July , that was the first mammalian clone created using the genetic material from an adult cell1 .
As soon as the story hit the front page ( the news was broken by a British Sunday newspaper four days ahead of Nature 's publication ) , a public and media maelstrom ensued .
“ The first press calls came from New Zealand , ” recalls Sue Charles of Northbank Communications in London , who was handling publicity for Roslin and PPL at the time .
“ They worked their way through Australia , Asia and Europe . ”
Later in the day , calls began coming in from the United States , with interest ranging from the science involved to politics and religion .
“ We even had a US chat show that wanted Dolly on , ” says Charles .
“ They offered to fly her over . ”
She remembers that her team , together with Wilmut and his colleagues , took around 2,000 calls from journalists in two weeks .
But Dolly was n't popular with everyone .
Pundits warned of a future in which armies of human clones would be created by the evil and egotistical .
Conservatives predicted the demise of the nuclear family .
Activists cautioned that fertility doctors would perfect the technique and get rich making clones for the infertile , the narcissistic and the eccentric .
US President Bill Clinton announced that the feat “ raises serious ethical questions ” and commanded his bioethics advisers to report to him in 90 days on measures he should take to prevent its abuse .
Ten years later , the ethical debate launched by Dolly , and encouraged by science - fiction stories , has changed .
It has been supplanted by one that is more complex , more rooted in reality and far more relevant to the research that scientists want to do .
“ What did n't happen was the birth of a [ cloned ] child or a widespread public demand for the use of cloning for reproduction , ” says Alta Charo , a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , who served as a bioethics adviser to Clinton .
“ What did happen was a complete shift in the ethical discussion from reproductive uses of cloning to research uses .
And a merging of the cloning debate into the debate around embryonic stem - cell research — to the disadvantage of both fields because of the attendant confusion . ”
Back in early 1997 , none of Wilmut and his colleagues , the referees who reviewed their paper , or the Nature editors who oversaw it , anticipated the huge public reaction to the cloning of Dolly .
Scientists in the field saw her birth as an incremental advance — in large part because one year earlier , Nature had published a paper from Wilmut 's group reporting the cloning of two lambs , Morag and Megan , using nuclei from embryonic cells2 .

“ I always maintained that Dolly was expected and Morag and Megan were truly surprising , ” says Davor Solter , director of the Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology in Freiburg , Germany .
Solter wrote a News & Views article in Nature about the paper on Morag and Megan , suggesting that it was time to start thinking about the implications and uses of cloning mammals from adult cells3 .
“ This is one of those areas where just trying to rein in nutty behaviour became a full - time job . ”
Philip Campbell , Nature 's editor - in - chief , also recalls that the media storm over Dolly took him by surprise .
“ Staff and referees were aware that this was the paper that in principle demonstrated how to clone mammals , including humans , ” he says .
“ But neither they nor I anticipated the furore .
We were very focused on just how much of an advance it represented on Morag and Megan a year earlier . ”
But what to scientists was one small step , built on work dating back decades , was to the public the herald of a brave — and unwelcome — new world in which human clones would become as common as test - tube babies .
The claims that soon followed ( of intentions to clone babies , or of having accomplished the deed ) from sources including Chicago physicist Richard Seed , Italian embryologist Severino Antinori and the Raelian cult , which believes that the human race was cloned from aliens , only fanned the flames of the public imagination .
At the outset , “ kooks , cultists and conmen made all the news about cloning ” , recalls Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .
“ This is one of those areas where just trying to rein in nutty behaviour became a full - time job . ”
But as the decade passed and a menagerie of other mammals was cloned ( see ' Cloning timeline ' ) , no cloned human babies appeared .
What did occur , and what moved the ethical debate in an unforeseen direction , was the isolation of human embryonic stem - cell lines by James Thomson and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin , Madison4 .

With that achievement , it became clear that broad research avenues could be opened up by cloning human embryos to extract stem cells from them .
These could then be used as disease models and drug targets , or to develop therapies involving tissue transplantation .
But as quickly as scientists recognized the potential of such opportunities , political and ethical opponents seized on the notion that allowing cloning in research would only ensure that it would one day be used for reproductive purposes .
What 's more , they argued , research cloning was a fundamental assault on human dignity , because it creates , manipulates and destroys human embryos for scientific ends .
“ What really took place is that the stem - cell debate replaced the cloning debate , ” says Caplan .
“ Because there was — and is — a tremendous interest in trying to clone embryos , not people . ”
The South Korean scandal of Seoul National University 's Woo Suk Hwang , whose claims to have derived stem - cell lines from cloned human embryos were proved to be fraudulent in 2006 , generated plenty of bad press for the field .
But there are signs that the new debate is taking a different course from that on reproductive cloning because of the potential of stem - cell research to improve human health .
In the United States , for example , opposition to cloning babies has remained firm through a decade of polling , at about 90 % , but polls in recent years have shown that 60 – 70 % of the public supports research using stem cells obtained from discarded embryos in fertility clinics .
“ As people learn about the possibilities for new approaches to disease , they see the embryonic stem - cell issue in a different framework , ” says Jonathan Moreno , a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania , who co-chaired a committee that crafted 2005 research guidelines for the US National Academies .
“ They see it as medical research that could help them or their families . ”
The notion of cloning embryos to be a source of stem cells — as opposed to using embryos left over from fertility treatment that are slated for destruction anyway — is much more controversial .
It remains a touchy political issue in many countries , including the United States , and is approached gingerly by public and private funders alike .
In the near term , “ I rather doubt that we will see very much [ cloning ] in the context of embryonic stem - cell research in the United States ” , says Moreno .
But he thinks advances are likely to come in countries where the work is seen as more acceptable , such as Britain , where groups led by Wilmut at the University of Edinburgh and Alison Murdoch at the International Centre for Life in Newcastle upon
Tyne have been given permission to pursue it .
( Murdoch 's group has already cloned at least one human embryo , but has had no luck extracting stem - cell lines . )
As embryonic stem - cell research allows the genetic contributions to complex disease to be teased out , Charo believes that the ethical debate will shift again .
Rather than focusing on the moral implications of cloning itself , she says , questions of an individual 's responsibility for their known predisposition to disease will come to the fore : “ If we move towards genetics research , we will have a new set of issues that Time and Newsweek can put on their covers . ”

Drill - down on Three Major New Modules in Python 2.5 Standard Library
The freshly minted 2.5 version of Python has lots of goodies , but the three in this article are the cream of the crop .
Find out how ctypes , pysqlite , and ElementTree can save you time and aggravation in this extensive article with a ton of great sample code .

Python has a vibrant community that produces lots of useful packages and modules .
The best ones the ones that have proven themselves in the field sometimes get included in the standard Python library .
This is important for several reasons :
High availability People who deploy large Python - based systems that rely on standard modules only have it easy when it comes to installation , deployment , and upgrades .
High visibility Being included in the standard library means that the module will be documented in the official Python documentation as well as in Python books .
Example programs and articles are more likely to use standard modules because they do n't require special installation ( see point 1 ) .
Blessed status If there are multiple modules that provide some functionality then the module picked for inclusion in the standard library obviously has been deemed better .
There are three modules recently included in the standard library that I 'll discuss in this article : ctypes , pysqlite , and ElementTree.
ctypes allows calling C functions in dynamic / shared libraries without writing extensions .
Pysqlite is a great embedded database package .
ElementTree is a pythonic and efficient set of XML processing tools .
Arguably , these modules are the most important for the majority of Python users .
I 'll discuss the hashlib and wsgiref modules , which are also important , in a third article ( coming soon ) .

Module No. 1 : ctypes
Python is slow .
Most of the time that does n't matter .
You might use it simply to write small scripts that finish before you even blink , or you might use it to glue together some tools .
You can even write decent games in Python that perform well using a library like PyGame .
However , if you develop core parts of a large - scale system in Python you might find out that Python is too slow .
In this case you can always write the critical parts in C or C++ and wrap them with an extension module .
But of course , this process is not slick and streamlined like pure Python development .
There are many ways to automate it and make it less painful ( e.g. SWIG and Boost : : Python ) .
ctypes offers a simpler approach .
It allows you to call C functions in dynamic libraries directly .
Dynamic libraries use platform - specific mechanisms .
ctypes tries very hard to operate at a higher abstraction level , but in some cases it is just impossible .
Some libraries may be available only on a certain platform and the library itself may have a different name .
In this article , I will use libc for all the examples because it is so ubiquitous .
I use Mac OS X , but the examples should work on every Linux / Unix OS .
I will also refer to Windows from time to time because there are important capabilities that are available on Windows only .
Finding and Loading Libraries
Before you can start calling those great C functions , you need to locate and load the dynamic library that contains them .
There are two ways to locate a library : You can call the ctypes.util.find_library ( ) function
You can just know where it is
In both cases you end up with a path to the dynamic library .
In both cases you end up with a path to the dynamic library .
Here is how to use find_library to find the path to the libc library : Python 2.5 ( r25:51918 , Sep 19 2006 , 08:49:13 ) [ GCC 4.0.1 ( Apple Computer , Inc. build 5341 ) ] on darwin Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>> >>> from ctypes.util import find_library >>> find_library ('c ' ) '/usr/lib/libc.dylib '
In this code , find_library ( ) is doing its best to shield you from OS - specific details .
Note that I did n't have to specify the extension ( .dylib on Mac ) or the ' lib ' prefix .

Note that I did n't have to specify the extension ( .dylib on Mac ) or the ' lib ' prefix .
Once you locate the dynamic library you can load it .
There are different ways to do it , but for the most part they all depend on the dynamic library type , the calling convention , the platform , and interaction with the Python C API .
On Linux / Mac OSX you should use the CDLL class to load a dynamic library with the C calling convention .
On Windows you should use the WINDLL for dynamic libraries that use the standard ( Pascal ) calling convention and OLEDLL for COM objects .
Here is how to load libc on Linux / Mac OSX : >>> from ctypes import CDLL >>> from ctypes.util import find_library >>> libc = CDLL ( find_library ('c ' ) ) >>> libc < CDLL '/usr/lib/libc.dylib ' , handle 100470 at 796f0 >
Calling Functions
Python has support for random number generation ( well , pseudo random numbers ) .
The random module provides a bunch of functions to generate anything you want .
The problem is that there is no simple way to generate a random integer between 0 and X , which is almost always what I want .
You can use random . randint ( min , max ) but you will have to provide two numbers for min and max and then you will need to know that the random number you will get is in the range [ min , max ] , which means min <= x <= max .
This not intuitive to me because in computers ( and often in math , too ) half open ranges are the norm [ min , max ) , which means min <= mix < max .
Even Python 's own range function returns the half open range .

Even Python 's own range function returns the half open range .
Here is what I have to do to get a random number in the range [ 0,4 ) : >>> import random >>> random.randint(0 , 3 ) 2 So , I do n't like random.randint ( ) .
Luckily , ctypes comes to the rescue with its rand ( ) function .
rand ( ) takes no arguments and always returns a random integer between 0 and max_int .
Converting it to the range [ 0 , 4 ) is as simple as this : >>> libc.rand ( ) % 4 1 Ok , let 's try some math .
What is the square root of 1 ? >>> libc.sqrt(1) 1 Cool , that works .
Let 's try some more : >>> libc.sqrt(4) 1 Oops .
That 's not good .
As I recall the square root of 4 should be 2 .
What happened ?
So , CDLL objects assume that all functions return an int unless you tell them otherwise .
That means that the return value of sqrt that happens to be a double precision floating point number will be coerced automatically to a Python int type ( types. IntType ) .
For some reason everything I tried to feed to sqrt returns 1 ( or overflow error ) .
So , I do n't like .

For some reason everything I tried to feed to sqrt returns 1 ( or overflow error ) .
The way to fix it is to tell the sqrt function that it should return a double and not an int.
ctypes provides a bunch of type factories designed to make it easy to map native C types to Python types .
The full list can be found here : http://docs.python.org/dev/lib/node452.html.
Here is how to tell sqrt to return double : from ctypes import c_double >>> libc.sqrt.restype = c_double Now , sqrt also expects a double parameter .
You probably think that you can pass in a Python double just like you passed an int but you would be wrong .
Only the following types are converted automatically to C types : None becomes a NULL pointer
int and long become the default C int type ( exact type depends on platform )
strings and unicode strings become char * or wchar_t * respectively .
In order to call a C function that accepts a double you must use one of ctypes type constructors .
It 's as simple as calling a function and passing a Python value : >>> ctypes.c_double( 8.65 ) c_double ( 8.6500000000000004 )
The small error is an artifact of the way floating point numbers are represented in modern computers and is not a bug .
Do n't be alarmed .

What happens if you try to pass a raw Python double ?
Nothing good , that 's for sure : >>> libc.sqrt( 4.0 )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in < module > ctypes.ArgumentError : argument 1 : < type ' exceptions .
TypeError '>:
Do n't know how to convert parameter 1 ctypes .
ArgumentError is the exception ctypes raises if it can't convert the object you passed in .
Yay , it works .
What happens if you try to pass a raw Python double ?
Nothing good , that 's for sure : ctypes .
ArgumentError is the exception ctypes raises if it can't convert the object you passed in .

From China to Ukraine , this president has acted at odds with American foreign policy .
Imagine what he could do with four more years .
By Alexander Vindman and
Blackholes all gobble up matter in the same way , whatever their size , new research has found .
UK astronomers say that the same processes are at work inside all black holes : the only difference is that of scale .
The researchers , led by Professor Ian McHardy , from the University of Southampton , began by looking for similarities between ordinary , stellar - sized Galactic black hole systems , and the supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei ( AGN ) .
Their idea was that if certain similarities could be established , then the shorter - lived and faster acting " small " blackholes could give them clues about how the supermassive black holes would behave on cosmic timescales .
Professor McHardy comments , " By studying the way in which the X - ray emission from black hole systems varies , we found that the accretion or ' feeding ' process - where the black hole is pulling in material from its surroundings - is the same in black holes of all sizes and that AGN are just scaled - up Galactic black holes .
" We also found that the way in which the X - ray emission varies is strongly correlated with the width of optical emission lines from black hole systems . "
McHardy explained that the observations have important implications for the overall understanding of the different types of active galactic nuclei , which are classified by the width of their emission lines .
For example , Seyfert galaxies , which have very narrow emission lines , are often regarded as unusual .
Now that the correlation between emission line width and X - ray emission has been identified , astronomers can see that Seyfert galaxies are not so different from other active galactic nuclei : " they just have a smaller ratio of mass to accretion rate " .
McHardy and his colleagues have shown that the so - called characteristic timescale - that is the period over which the mass accretion rate will change appreciably - varies linearly with the mass of the black hole , but inversely with accretion rate .
That is to say , the more massive a black hole , the more matter it can consume , but the longer it takes for the rate of accretion to increase noticeably .
This means that the mass of a black hole can be determined simply by measuring its accretion rate and characteristic timescale .
Very useful when you are dealing with an obscured supermassive black hole at the centre of a dusty galaxy , for instance .
As a black hole accretes matter , it emits X - rays in a distinctive way , known as an X - ray light curve .
Professor McHardy concludes : " It has been known for over two decades that characteristic timescales can be seen in the X - ray lightcurves of Galactic black hole systems .
The timescales are short ( < second ) and so can be found in short observations .
However to find the equivalent timescales in AGN is much harder as we must observe for months or years . "
The research is published in the current ( December 7 ) edition of Nature . ®
In a last act of defiance Saddam Hussein refused to wear a hood
Iraqi TV images
Iraqi state TV showed images of Saddam Hussein going to the gallows before dawn in a building his intelligence services once used for executions .
However the moment of his execution was not shown .
Pictures of his body wrapped in a shroud were later broadcast on TV .
A representative of the prime minister and a Sunni Muslim cleric were among a group of Iraqis present .
Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death by an Iraqi court on 5 November after a year - long trial over the killings of 148 Shias from the town of Dujail in the 1980s .
In a statement , Iraq 's Prime Minister , Nouri Maliki , said the execution had closed a dark chapter in Iraq 's history .
" Justice , in the name of the people , has carried out the death sentence against the criminal Saddam , who faced his fate like all tyrants , frightened and terrified during a hard day which he did not expect , " it read .
Holding Koran
A small group of Iraqis witnessed the execution in a spartan concrete - lined chamber at an Iraqi compound known by the Americans as Camp Justice in the suburb of Khadimiya .
We took him to the gallows and he was saying some few slogans .
He was very , very , very , broken
Mouwafak al - Rubaie
Iraq National Security Adviser
Saddam 's last moments
In pictures : Execution reaction
They watched as a judge read out the sentence to Saddam Hussein , 69 .
The former Iraqi leader was carrying a copy of the Koran and asked for it to be given to a friend .
Footage broadcast later on Iraqi state TV showed a subdued Saddam Hussein being led to gallows by a group of masked men .
He was dressed in a white shirt and dark overcoat , rather than prison garb .
Saddam Hussein was led up onto the gallows platform and a dark piece of cloth placed around his neck , followed by the noose .
When the hangman stepped forward to put the hood over his head , Saddam Hussein made it clear he wanted to die without it .
The hanging itself was not broadcast .
The execution procedure took just a few minutes .
Iraqi National Security Adviser Mouwafak al - Rubaie , who witnessed the execution , told the BBC that the former leader went to the gallows quietly :
" We took him to the gallows and he was saying some few slogans .
He was very , very , very , broken . "
In other developments :
US troops and Iraqi security forces are put on high alert and security is increased at US embassies around the world
Three car bombs go off in quick succession in a mainly Shia Baghdad district , killing at least 37 people and injuring 76 others , Iraqi officials say
A bomb explodes in a market place in the mainly Shia city of Kufa , in southern Iraq , killing at least 31 people and injuring 58
The US military says that a US soldier was killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad on Friday and three marines died from wounds suffered in combat in Iraq 's western Anbar province
Images of Saddam Hussein 's body were also broadcast on Iraqi TV , still dressed in his overcoat and wrapped in a white sheet .
His body is reported to have been flown by helicopter to an unknown location .
Sources close to the Iraqi prime minister said the body would be buried in Iraq , but would not reveal where .
Saddam Hussein 's daughters Raghad and Rana had earlier asked that their father be buried temporarily in Yemen .
According to their spokeswoman , Rasha Oudeh , the two women watched their father 's final moments on TV .
" They felt very proud as they saw their father facing his executioners so bravely , standing up , " Ms Oudeh said .
" They pray that his soul rests in peace . "
Mixed reaction
News of Saddam Hussein 's execution was announced on state - run Iraqiya television , as patriotic music and images of national monuments were played out .
It is an important milestone on Iraq 's course to becoming a democracy that can govern , sustain , and defend itself
US President George W Bush
It initially said his half - brother Barzan al - Tikriti and Iraq 's former chief judge Awad Hamed al - Bandar were also hanged , but Mr Rubaie later said only Saddam Hussein was hanged .
The others will be executed some time after the Eid festival ends next week , he said .
Other Arab TV stations aired live footage of the sunrise over Baghdad 's Firdous Square , where US Marines pulled down a statue of Saddam Hussein , after he was deposed in April 2003 .
There were jubilant scenes in the Baghdad Shia stronghold of Sadr City , with people dancing in the streets and sounding their car horns , and in the southern city of Basra .
But in Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit , where a curfew was imposed , the news sparked protests from supporters .
Protests were also reported in Samarra and Ramadi .
' Held to account '
US President George W Bush hailed the execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an Iraqi democracy , but warned it would not end the deadly violence there .
I feel saddened by the death of Saddam , not because he deserved to live but because it is taking place under US occupation of Iraq
Nafeesa Zafar , Pakistan
Saddam death : Your reaction
He said : " It is a testament to the Iraqi people 's resolve to move forward after decades of oppression that , despite his terrible crimes against his own people , Saddam Hussein received a fair trial .
" It is an important milestone on Iraq 's course to becoming a democracy that can govern , sustain , and defend itself , and be an ally in the War on Terror . "
UK Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett welcomed the fact that Saddam Hussein had been tried by an Iraqi court " for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed " and said " he has now been held to account " .
France called on Iraqis to " look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity " .

Estimates of radiation damage to materials have been too low .
The atomic order of a ceramic is muddled into a glassy mess by radiation .
Storing high - level nuclear waste without any leakage over thousands of years may be harder than experts have thought , research published in Nature today shows .
Ian Farnan of Cambridge University , UK , and his co-workers have found that the radiation emitted from such waste could transform one candidate storage material into less durable glass after just 1,400 years — much more quickly than thought1 .
Current plans for disposal of some of the most dangerous material generated in nuclear power plants , such as radioactive elements extracted from spent fuel rods , differ from one country to another .
A common strategy being explored is to encase the waste in a hard , crystalline ceramic material — a kind of synthetic rock — and then put it in steel canisters and bury them in cavities excavated underground .
Because many radioactive substances continue emitting radiation for a very long time , the containment must persist for an awesome duration .
Plutonium - 239 , one of the most deadly by - products of nuclear power , has a half - life of 24,000 years , meaning that only half of any initial batch has decayed over this time .
Ideally it should stay put for about ten times as long : a quarter of a million years .
Candidate ceramic
Farnan and colleagues have investigated one candidate material hoped to do the job , called zircon ( zirconium silicate ) .
The plan is that this ceramic material will hold on fast to the radioactive atoms and stop them from finding their way into the environment — for example by being dissolved and dispersed in ground water .
The problem is that the radioactive waste damages the matrix that contains it .
Many of the waste substances , including plutonium - 239 , emit alpha radiation , which travels for only very short distances ( barely a few hundredths of a millimetre ) in the ceramic , but creates havoc along the way .
A fast - moving alpha particle knocks into hundreds of atoms in its path , scattering them like skittles .
Worse still , the radioactive atom from which the particle comes is sent hurtling in the other direction by the recoil .
Even though its path is even shorter than that of an alpha particle , the atom is much heavier , and can knock thousands of atoms out of place in the ceramic .
All this disrupts the crystalline structure of the ceramic matrix , jumbling it up and turning it into a glass .
That can make the material swell and become a less secure trap .
Farnan says that some zircons that have been heavily damaged in this way by radiation have been found to dissolve hundreds of times faster than undamaged ones .
So if the ceramic gets wet , there could be trouble .
Hit and run
Previous estimates of the radiation damage to waste - storage ceramics have relied largely on calculations and computer simulations .
Now Farnan and colleagues have measured it directly .
They used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy — similar to the method of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) used in biomedicine — to measure the relative amounts of crystalline and glassy material , both in artificial zircon containing plutonium and in naturally occurring mineral zircon , which commonly contains radioactive uranium .
They estimate that each alpha - decay event of a radioactive atom displaces around 5,000 atoms in the zircon - between 2.5 and 5 times more than predicted previously .
" There 's more damage than we thought , " says Rod Ewing , a specialist in nuclear - waste disposal at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .

There are other materials that may fare better than zircon , including other zirconium minerals .
But Farnan 's work implies that we probably do n't yet fully understand how well any of these materials might stand up to the battering of radiation .
He thinks the findings should encourage engineers to think very carefully about the matrix encasing the radioactive waste , rather than focusing on the geological characteristics of the burial site .
Ideally , the best material would be able to heal itself , with the atoms displaced by alpha decay moving back slowly into their crystalline positions .
Ewing notes that the technique used in this study could be used to investigate these alternative materials , hopefully to find a longer - lived candidate .

I 've just finished reading Micheal Pollan 's New York Times Magazine article " Unhappy Meals " .
The first line of the article is , " Eat food .
Not too much .
Mostly plants . "
I could n't agree more with his advice to " Eat Food " , food being defined as anything your great - great - grandmother would have recognized as food .
And it 's probably good advice to not eat too much .
But the last line , " Mostly Plants " , irks me .
I am , unabashedly , a meat and dairy eater .
I do not agree that " meat is bad " based on what I consider to be sound scientific evidence as well as some fairly convincing circumstantial evidence .
( See my prior entries . )
Pollan simply states that meat is bad and uses it as a truism throughout the article .
His evidence is based on the findings of a 1977 senate subcommittee that was apparently swayed by the arguments that " while rates of coronary heart disease had soared in America since World War II , other cultures that consumed traditional diets based largely on plants had strikingly low rates of chronic disease .
Epidemiologists also had observed that in America during the war years , when meat and dairy products were strictly rationed , the rate of heart disease temporarily plummeted . "
Is that the best he 's got ?
He wants me to base my diet on the findings of a senate subcommittee ??
One who based their findings on circumstantial evidence ???
I 'll give you circumstantial evidence :
In Russia , following the collapse of communism , heart disease rates have exploded while meat and dairy consumption have declined .
In Japan , heart disease rates have dropped for fifty years while beef and pork consumption are on the increase .
And in Japan , they eat their beef and pork as fatty as they can get them .
There are cultures with strikingly low rates of chronic disease whose diets are high in milk , meat and fat , like the Masai of Africa , the Inuit , traditional native american cultures like the Cree , and the Chinese citizens of Tuoli county .
Not to mention the French , Swiss and Italians .
I can name more .
He later states that " populations that eat diets high in meat have higher rates of coronary heart disease and cancer than those that do n’t . "
Really ?
Which ones ?
I 've already named a handful for which this is not true .
His lack of evidentiary support gets him into trouble when he 's trying to explain the findings of the Women 's Health Initiative , a large , recently published study that failed to find any evidence that women who reduced their fat intakes as a percent of calories were protected against heart disease or breast cancer .
He cites two scientists who think that the " culprits " in meat and milk might not be fat at all , but animal proteins or steroids .
And here 's the irony .
The two scientistst are T. Colin Campbell , whose China Health Study failed to find any link between meat consumption and heart disease and Walter Willett , whose recently published " Low - Carbohydrate Diet Score and the Risk of Coronary Heart Disease in Women , " failed to show any connection between a high meat , high fat diet and heart disease .
OK , I 'm going to restate that point in it 's own paragraph for effect .
In order to explain why a recent study failed to show any benefit associated with a low fat diet , Pollan offers us the OPINIONS of two scientists whose studies failed to show any connection between diets high in meat and animal fat with heart disease and zero scientific evidence .
Pollan also claims that the Womens Health Initiative is poorly controlled .
I agree , but Dr. Campbell 's and Dr. Willett 's studies are much better and had the same result .
Let 's not pretend that the Nurses Health Initiative is the ONLY one to have failed to show the link between meat and chronic disease .
Other than my point about meat consumption , I agree with Pollan entirely .
I particularly agree with his concluding point number seven :
Eat more like the French .
In particular , enjoy " communal meals — and the serious pleasure taken in eating . "
As Nicole mentioned yesterday , Democratic Caucus chairman Rahm Emanuel has asked freshman Congressman to steer clear of Stephen and The Colbert Report .
To refresh our memories , Keith put together a little montage last night of Stephen 's funniest " nailings . "

Let 's not forget this one -- perhaps the best of all - time .
While it 's true a Congressman could say something on the show that might offend someone without a sense of humor , I think going on The Report is a good idea -- it shows you 're a good sport and can help court young voters .

N.H. N.H. finds no evidence in Buckley porn allegations CONCORD , N.H. -- Citing a " complete lack of evidence , " state prosecutors said Thursday they wo n't file criminal charges against top Democrat Raymond Buckley over child pornography accusations brought forward by his former friend and housemate .
Manchester Rep. Steve Vaillancourt , a Democrat - turned - Republican , made the allegations in a letter to Gov. John Lynch , saying that while Buckley lived in his house , he smuggled child porn from Europe , left kiddie porn strewn about his bedroom and trawled the Internet for the images .
Buckley had been the heavy favorite to win the election for state Democratic Party chairman , but dropped out after the letter went public in January .
He said from the beginning the allegations were false .
Buckley , 47 , is openly gay .
He and Vaillancourt , 55 , lived in the same house for 16 years before Vaillancourt evicted him in 1999 .
With Vaillancourt watching and videotaping Thursday , Attorney General Kelly Ayotte said at a news conference that a two - month investigation uncovered nothing to support Vaillancourt 's accusations .
" Simply put , Mr. Vaillancourt 's allegations that Mr. Buckley was involved in the possession of child pornography are unsubstantiated and unfounded , " she said .
Police interviewed 14 witnesses , many of whom were recommended by Vaillancourt .
Ayotte said none corroborated the accusations .
Police never found any child porn and said they could n't find a computer that Vaillancourt said Buckley used to browse for the images .
Ayotte said even Vaillancourt 's police interviews were fruitless .
" When Steve Vaillancourt was interviewed and pressed about the allegations he made to the governor , he could not describe observing any material in Mr. Buckley 's room that would meet the definition of child pornography , " she said .
" In fact Mr. Vaillancourt admitted to police that he exaggerated in the letter that he wrote to Gov. John Lynch . "
Ayotte said she had seriously considered charging Vaillancourt with making a false report , but decided it would be too difficult to prove because he went to the governor , not police .
The law requires evidence that a person knowingly made a false report to law enforcement .
Later , at a news conference of his own , Vaillancourt insisted his accusations are true .
" Absolutely everything I wrote in the letter to Gov. John Lynch is correct , " he said .
" Absolutely everything I said to police is correct . "
He did not deny exaggerating , then said " I do n't think exaggerating is lying . "
Vaillancourt previously acknowledged he had little to no evidence to support his accusations .
The state report said that during a police interview , Vaillancourt claimed he 'd seen Buckley using a computer to search for child porn , then corrected himself .
" I assumed it was ... I mean , did I see any five - year - old boys that I particularly recall ?
Absolutely not , " the report said .
Vaillancourt said the state 's investigation was flawed , and complained that police never accepted his offer to take a polygraph test .
To reporters , he distributed a list of proposed polygraph questions -- including answers -- and said he also was willing to be hypnotized and drugged to help investigators get to the truth .
He said the state investigation upset him , comparing it to the O.J. Simpson case -- " not since then has an investigation been so botched as this one , " he said .
Buckley said he was happy to be cleared and considers the matter closed .
" I 'm gratified by the attorney general 's determination , " he said .
" I 'm just pleased that this is all behind me . "
Other questions still loom .
Unrelated to Ayotte 's investigation , state Democrats last month hired a lawyer to investigate an anonymous letter accusing Buckley of sexually harassing male staffers in the Senate Democratic caucus .
Party chairwoman Kathy Sullivan and lawyer James Donchess did not return calls seeking comment Thursday .
Buckley also is deciding whether to renew his bid for the party chairmanship and whether to sue Vaillancourt .
Lawyer John Kacavas said they 've discussed a defamation lawsuit .
" Accusing someone baselessly of ( a ) crime is the definition of defamation , but to accuse someone of this kind of crime is human savagery , " he said .
" This was a personally motivated political assassination .
It was done at a time that was crucial for Mr. Buckley in achieving his goal of becoming the Democratic Party chair . "
As for politics , Democrats now are looking to the party elections on March 24 with interest .
Cornish Sen. Peter Burling suggested Buckley consider getting back in the chairmanship race .
" This is time to rally around Ray , " Burling said .
" I do n't understand how the Democratic Party can stand to lose its candidate for a leading office on the basis of unfounded charges by someone who clearly has an ax to grind . "
When Buckley dropped out , former House Democratic Leader Jim Craig announced he would run for the chairman 's job , with the governor 's support .
Manchester Sen. Lou D'Allesandro said that means the party should take its lead from Lynch .
" The governor called Jim Craig and asked him to run for chairman of the party .
I think the governor has to play a role , " he said .
Lynch was out of town Thursday .
His spokesman , Colin Manning , said Lynch endorsed Craig , " who stepped up when the party needed him , " but had n't yet spoken to Buckley on Thursday afternoon .
Craig was not in his office Thursday afternoon and did not immediately return a message .
Buckley himself said has n't decided .
" I 've had my life back for an hour and ten minutes now , " he said .
" I 'm not going to be making any of those determinations at this time . "

BETHLEHEM , West Bank ( Reuters ) - Despairing of life under Israeli occupation , many Palestinian Christians are moving abroad , threatening their ancient links to Bethlehem and the land where Jesus was born .
Maher Rabie , a Palestinian Christian , stands in his pizzeria in the West Bank town of Beit Jala March 1 , 2007 .
Despairing of life under Israeli occupation , many Palestinian Christians are moving abroad , threatening their ancient links to Bethlehem and the land where Jesus was born .
Rabie says he may return to the United States , where he lived for 12 years , if the summer does not bring better times .

“ There is a real fear that 50 years down the road , the Holy Land will be without Christians , ” said Mitri Raheb , 45 - year - old pastor of the Lutheran Church in Bethlehem .
Pressures on majority Muslims are just as daunting -- and many of them also leave -- but dwindling Christian communities look more precarious as the young and dynamic pull up roots .
Christians have migrated from Bethlehem and nearby Beit Jala and Beit Sahour for over a century , mainly to Latin America , the United States and Canada , to escape successive wars and crises .
Bethlehem governor Salah al - Tamari said there was no way of tracking accurately how many Christians and Muslims had left since the eruption of Israeli - Palestinian violence in 2000 .
“ There is no business , no freedom of movement , ” he said .
“ We depend on tourism , which is being demolished .
Sometimes we receive 1,500 tourists a day but none of them stay the night .
They visit the Nativity Church and leave , so we do n’t benefit . ”
A towering concrete wall is closing in on Bethlehem as part of a barrier that Israel is erecting , which it calls a defense against suicide bombers from the occupied West Bank .
Much of it has been built on Palestinian land .
“ Once it ’s finished there will be only three gates leading in and out of Bethlehem , ” said Raheb .
“ Bethlehem will basically be a four - square - mile ( 10 - square - km ) open prison . ”
“ This wall has separated many people from each other , ” said Hiyam Abu Dayyeh , a Christian social worker .
“ What kind of life is this if you ca n’t feel free or move in your own country ? ”
PRESSURE CAULDRON
Now unemployed , she hopes to leave Beit Jala for Germany , which she visited often when she was working for the church .
“ Many people are without work and without hope , ” she said .
“ People are completely exhausted .
If it stays like this , Palestine will be a big psychiatric hospital . ”
About 50,000 Christians live in the territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war -- east Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Another 110,00 reside in Israel .
The aid - dependent Palestinian economy took a devastating hit when international donors decided to boycott a Hamas government formed after the Islamists won an election in January 2006 .
Violent infighting between Hamas and the once - dominant Fatah faction has driven Palestinians closer to breaking point .
Two - thirds of the population now live in poverty , according to the British charity Oxfam , with more than half unable to meet their families ’ daily food requirements without assistance .
Palestinian Christians are generally better off than other segments of society , but they too have felt the pinch .

“ We used to be six people working in the restaurant and we were always busy .
Now we are two and we sit here doing nothing , ” said Maher Rabie , who runs a small pizzeria in Beit Jala .
He took a loss of 30,000 shekels ( $ 7,000 ) last year to keep it open .
He says he might return to the United States , where he lived for 12 years , if the summer does not bring better times .
“ Actually we do n’t have an economy any more .
It ’s finished , ” he said .
“ The last five years were hell on earth .
Sometimes we say if we go to hell in future , we already know what it ’s like . ”
Rabie and his wife Rania have three boys in school aged 8 , 14 and 16 .
“ We think of what kind of future we can provide for them if this situation persists , ” the 47 - year - old father said .
LOSS OF HOPE
Christian leaders say they face no religious persecution from the Palestinian Muslim majority or from Israel .
Bernard Sabella , a Palestinian sociologist at Bethlehem University , estimates that 50 to 75 Christian families a year are leaving Jerusalem or the West Bank for new lives abroad , down from a peak of 200 to 250 families in 2002 and 2003 .
He said most cited similar motives to Muslim migrants -- political conditions , unemployment and lawlessness , although discomfort with rising Muslim militancy was a factor for some .
“ As Christians we want to be part of this society , ” he said , pointing to the cultural richness , variety and ancient roots of the church communities living in the cradle of Christianity .
The median age of Palestinian Christians is now 37 , against 19 in the general population .
“ If our young people leave , we are in a disaster , ” Sabella said .
Many Christians have languages , educational skills , money and family links abroad -- factors that make migration easier .
But church leaders want to anchor them in their homeland .
“ We are asking the world to help Palestinian Christians stay in their country , ” said Lutheran Bishop Munib Younan , pleading for assistance with education , job creation and housing and with Christian institutions that could serve Palestinians in general .
Christian entrepreneurs who returned from lives in exile in the 1990s -- when it seemed that the Oslo interim accords with Israel might bring peace , prosperity and Palestinian statehood -- are now losing hope .
“ It ’s getting tougher and tougher every day , ” said Elias Samaan , a 45 - year - old who set up a carpentry business after moving to Beit Jala from the United States in 1992 .
“ We ’re really thinking about leaving again , leaving everything -- our house , our work , our business , our land . ”
Photo and Video : Giant Camel Spiders in Iraq
The photo below of giant Iraqi camel spiders reportedly comes from a soldier , stationed in the desert near Baghdad , Iraq , who was bitten by a giant camel spider that was hiding in his sleeping bag .
Fortunately , the giant desert camel spiders in Iraq are n't venomous ... ( they 're not really even giant spiders at all ) but they 're BIG and FAST ( giant camel spiders can run around 10MPH , as shown in the video below the photo ) .
The photo shows two giant Iraqi desert camel spiders attached together , and the camera angle makes the giant spiders look a tad larger than they really are ( giant camel spiders from the Iraq desert are about the size of an adult 's hand ) .
They also tend to seek out shade during the daytime , so it 's not terribly unusual to see giant spiders charging across the Iraqi desert at you -- only to come to a screeching halt when they reach your shadow .
Below the photo is a video of the camel spider in action .
Increasingly anxious to appear competent and in control , the Bush gang is reportedly looking for a “ war czar ” who would oversee the United States ’ role in Iraq and Afghanistan .
There are , of course , a few problems with this , not the least of which is the fact that no one actually wants the job .
The White House wants to appoint a high - powered czar to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with authority to issue directions to the Pentagon , the State Department and other agencies , but it has had trouble finding anyone able and willing to take the job , according to people close to the situation .
At least three retired four - star generals approached by the White House in recent weeks have declined to be considered for the position , the sources said , underscoring the administration ’s difficulty in enlisting its top recruits to join the team after five years of warfare that have taxed the United States and its military .
“ The very fundamental issue is , they do n’t know where the hell they ’re going , ” said retired Marine Gen. John J. “ Jack ” Sheehan , a former top NATO commander who was among those rejecting the job .
Sheehan said he believes that Vice President Cheney and his hawkish allies remain more powerful within the administration than pragmatists looking for a way out of Iraq .
“ So rather than go over there , develop an ulcer and eventually leave , I said , ‘ No , thanks , ’ ” he said .
On the surface , shaking up the chain of command like this reeks of desperation .
The whole endeavor seems geared towards creating a White House photo op , where the president can say , “ See ?
I ’m doing something . ”
Except he really is n’t .
Even if Bush could find someone for this very bizarre job , what , exactly , would the person do ?
As Kevin Drum explained , “ We already have Secretaries of State and Defense , we already have a military chain of command , and we already have an NSC that ’s supposed to coordinate all this stuff .
Does anyone truly think that a shiny new White House staffer with no budgetary authority , no bureaucratic support , and little in the way of institutional levers of control is going to be able to magically get everyone on the same page sometime in the next few months ?
It ’s a suicide mission . ”
This made made me reflect on one night last month , just after the Gordon and Baghdad briefing articles , when an e-mailed memo arrived in my inbox .
At least one news editor had seen enough .
That night , the first part of the PBS Frontline series on the media was aired , with distressing reminders of newspapers ' complicity in the Iraq invasion .
It showed Bob Woodward on Larry King 's CNN show back then saying there was " almost zero " chance WMD would not be found in Iraq .
In a new interview , Judith Miller said she did nothing wrong in her reporting back then , even if the reporting itself was wrong .
A few minutes after that , the e-mail landed in my " new messages " box .
It came from KSFR , a public radio station in Santa Fe , N.M.
I do n't know anything about the station , although I have been to Santa Fe a couple of times .
It seems that the surge in " unnamed officials " had finally pushed News Director Bill Dupuy to take action .
He wrote that " until further notice , it is the policy of KSFR 's news department to ignore and not repeat any wire service or nationally published story " about Iran , North Korea , and other sensitive foreign areas if it quotes an " unnamed " U.S. official .
" What we have suspected and talked about at length before is now becoming clear .
' High administration officials speaking on the condition of anonymity , ' ' Usually reliable Washington sources , ' and others of the like were behind the publicity that added credibility to the need to go to war against Afghanistan and Iraq .
" This is a small news department with a small reach .
We cannot research these stories ourselves .
But we can take steps not to compromise our integrity .
We should not dutifully parrot whatever comes out of Washington , on the wire or by whatever means , no matter how intriguing and urgent it sounds , when the source is unnamed .
I am also calling on our colleagues in other local news departments -- broadcast and print -- to take the same professional approach . "
Last week , I offered some practical suggestions about how to try to stop the drive toward an attack on Iran ; today , I noted astory about the widening Walter Reed scandal that proves once again that government will very rarely take strong , legitimately required action in any area until and unless public outrage becomes too powerful a force to ignore Greg Mitchell discusses the recent coverage of administration claims about Iran 's purported actions in Iraq , and then notes this development :
Very , very well done , Mr. Dupuy .
Exceptionally well done , and please allow me to extend my deep gratitude .
And that , my friends , is how you fight the bastards .
Web Application Development Using web.py and Jython
Given the recent discusion on the Jython - dev list of getting popular CPython applications ported to run on Jython I took a look at whether it was possible to get the increasingly poplar web.py web appplication ( anti ) framework to work on the Jython platform .
It turned out it was relatively easy to get it running , particularly with the release of Jython 2.2 on 24/08/07 .
Potentially this provides a rapid and pythonic way to develop web applications , whilst providing all the advantages that a Jython / Java platform gives , and a possible alternate hosting solution for web.py based solutions .
The web .
py / Jython combination can either be run using either web. py 's builtin web server as a quick way to develop web applications without needing the typical Java web stack , or using it 's wsgi component in combination with modjy and a Java application server , in this example Tomcat .
The software used :
jython 2.2 , web.py 0.22 , tomcat 5.5.20 , java 1.5.0_07
Some minor modifications to web.py are required as it is written for CPython 2.4 and above .
The patch updates the database module so it uses zxJDBC and adds support for Oracle , but omits pooled connection support , although it should be possible to use a Java library for this if required .
web.py uses flup for session functionality , I have n't looked at whether this will work on Jython as yet .
1 ) Patch web.py
Download web.py and copy the source directory ( web ) from the web.py distribution into your Jython installations Lib directory .
The following changes are then required to support database connectivity on Jython 2.2 :
#################### db.py : 20a21,25 > import sys > sys.add_package('com.ziclix.python.sql ' ) > sys.add_package('oracle.jdbc.driver ' ) > sys.add_package('org.gjt.mm.mysql ' ) > 250c255 < def connect ( dbn , ** keywords ) : --- > def connect (** keywords ) : 257a263 > dbn = keywords [ ' dbn ' ]
259,265c265 < try : < import psycopg2 as db < except ImportError : < try : < import psycopg as db < except ImportError : < import pgdb as db --- > from com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC as db 273c273 < import MySQLdb as db --- > from com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC as db 275c275,285 < keywords [ ' passwd ' ] = keywords [ ' pw ' ] --- > keywords [ ' password ' ] = keywords [ ' pw ' ] > del keywords [ ' pw ' ] > if ' db ' in keywords : > keywords [ ' database ' ] = keywords [ ' db ' ] > del keywords [ ' db ' ] > db. paramstyle = ' qmark ' # it 's both , like psycopg > > elif dbn == " oracle " : > from com.ziclix.python.sql import zxJDBC as db > if ' pw ' in keywords : > keywords [ ' password ' ] = keywords [ 'pw ' ]
277c287,290 < db.paramstyle = ' pyformat ' # it 's both , like psycopg --- > if ' db ' in keywords : > keywords [ ' database ' ] = keywords [ ' db ' ] > del keywords [ ' db ' ] > db.paramstyle = ' numeric ' 325c338,339 < web.ctx.db = db.connect (** keywords ) --- > web.ctx.db = db.connect(keywords.get ( ' database ' ) , keywords.get ( 'user ' ) , keywords.get ( ' password ' ) , keywords.get ( ' driver ' ) )
616a631,633 > elif web.ctx.db_name == " oracle " : > web.ctx.db_execute( db_cursor , sql_query ) > sql_query = SQLQuery ( " SELECT " + seqname + " . currval from dual " ) #################### form.py : 22c22,23 < o = copy.deepcopy( self ) --- > # not sure about this ... throws error with deepcopy ( ) . > o = copy.copy ( self )
2 ) Using web.py builtin web server :
Once patched you should be able to run a web.py application as follows :
webapp.py :
import web from web import form urls = ( ' /' , ' index ' , '/ myselect ' , ' myselect ' ) class index : def GET ( self ) : print " Home " class myselect : def GET ( self ) : tst = web.select ( ' user ' , what= '*' , where =" nid=4 " ) for ts in tst : print ts [ ( ' name ' ) ] web.config.db_parameters = dict( dbn='mysql',user='me ' , pw='you ', db='jdbc:mysql://localhost/db',driver='org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver' ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : web.run ( urls , globals ( ) )
To run:sh > jython webapp.py 80
3 ) Using wsgi , modjy and tomcat .
Follow the instructions at http://www.xhaus.com/modjy to install and configure modjy in your Tomcat installation , ensure you modify the web.xml python .home attribute to point correctly at your local Jython installation , and create the test web application ( modjy_webapp ) as per instructions .
I had to put the jython files in the modjy distribution in my local Jython installs Lib directory and modify modjy_impl.py as there is a bug , as per http://henkenotes.blogspot.com/search/label/jython.
Thanks to Henke Eriksson for this .
Modify your web.py application as below and place it in the root of the modjy_webapp context ( webapps/modjy_webapp / ) .
import web urls = ( ' /' , ' index ' , '/ myselect ' , ' myselect ' ) class index : def GET ( self ) : print " Home " class myselect : def GET ( self ) : tst = web.select ( ' user ' , what= '*' , where =" nid=4 " ) for ts in tst : print ts [ ( ' name ' ) ] web.config.db_parameters = dict( dbn='mysql',user='me ' , pw='you ', db='jdbc:mysql://localhost/db',driver='org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver ')
###Replace orig main line with wsgi handler : handler = web.wsgifunc(web.webpyfunc(urls , globals ( ) ) )
You should now be able to access your web.py application using Tomcat , e.g .
http://localhost:8080/modjy_webapp/myselect .
I 've also noticed a performance improvement when using the first full release of Jython 2.2 .
Cheers Colin

In the space of about a decade , China 's tech development has raced ahead to catch up with some of the most advanced countries in the West .
But there are still stark differences , finds Richard Taylor .
China 's censorship machine blocks information in various ways
Somewhere along the way the idea that the Chinese people should be allowed to inform and be informed appears to have been lost .
China is proof that the net can be developed and strangled all at once .
Being online here is a distinctly hit and miss experience - fine if you want to access mundane content , but try to get into anything considered even remotely sensitive by the government and it soon starts grinding to a halt .
I tried accessing the BBC News website but to no avail .
A government official told me there must be what he called " a technical problem " .
In truth , those " technical problems " are afflicting more and more information sites in China , for example the open source encyclopaedia Wikipedia , perhaps because it has fallen foul of the government 's recent declaration that news and information in today 's China should only be what it calls " healthy " and " in the public interest " .
One official from the internet publishing department , Kuo Xiao Wei , admitted the authorities consider the net a mixed blessing .
He said it abounds with pornography and gambling sites , and while it can be a source of good information , it also carries with it the possibility of spreading rumour and misinformation .
" With 56 ethnic minorities , we can't risk one slandering another " , he added .
Amnesty International is aware of at least 64 cyber dissidents who are imprisoned right now just for peacefully expressing their opinions online , whether it's on an e-mail or a website
Steve Ballinger , Amnesty International
There is now an estimated 30,000 - strong internet police force which , with the aid of Western - provided technology , is dedicated to monitoring websites and e-mails .
On a technical level the five gateways which connect China to the global internet filter traffic coming into and going out of the country .
Keyword blocking technology - much of it provided by western companies - is used to prevent access to offending sites .
Even the country 's 110,000 internet cafés are now highly regulated and state - licensed , and all are equipped with standard surveillance systems .
Self - censorship
Increasingly , though , the authorities are relying on individuals to censor themselves or risk harsh and well publicised penalties if they dare to challenge the establishment .
All of China 's internet cafes have surveillance systems
" Some of the offences they 're accused of are signing an online petition , sending information to a foreign organisation , or disseminating information about the SARS virus . "
Corporate China is also expected to play an active part in this self - censorship , keeping a close eye on content .
One website forum administrator was willing to talk to me , but did not want to be identified .
Suffice to say , he is in no doubt what his job entails .
He said : " If you say anything against the government we 've got to delete it , no exception , because it 's a forum , it 's a public place .
If the government finds anything against them in the forum , that will jeopardise the company . "
Finding a way

New system , available in early 2006 , to have lubricating strips on both the front and back sides .
The manual version of Gillette 's new Fusion razor NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Gillette has escalated the razor wars yet again , unveiling a new line of razors on Wednesday with five blades and a lubricating strip on both the front and back .
The razor , known as the Fusion , has blades spaced 30 percent closer than Gillette 's current MACH3 Turbo system .
It also has a single blade on the back of the cartridge for shaving sideburns or trimming under the nose .
The move renews an ongoing blade battle with Schick , the shaving unit of Energerizer ( Research ) , which launched a four - blade razor , the Quattro , last year .
The move ate into Gillette sales and sparked a legal battle between the two companies .
Schick is adding a battery - powered Quattro to its lineup this month , while Gillette 's Fusion -- in both manual and battery - powered models -- wo n't hit North American stores until early next year .
" The Schick launch has nothing to do with this , it 's like comparing a Ferrari to a Volkswagen as far as we 're concerned , " Chairman , President and Chief Executive James Kilts , told Reuters .
Razors accounted for nearly half of the company 's $ 2.8 billion net sales in its most recent quarter , according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The razor and blade industry has annual sales of $ 2.4 billion in the U.S. and $ 10 billion globally , according to Gillette .
The Fusion will also be available in a power version and features a micro-chip that regulates the voltage and blade action .
Other high - tech features include a low battery indicator light and a safety switch that shuts the razor down after eight minutes of continuous operation .
The manual version will be available in North America in the first quarter of 2006 and has a retail price of $ 9.99 with two cartridges .
The power model hits stores at the same time and comes with a one cartridge and a AAA battery for $ 11.99 .
Gillette ( Research ) is in the process of being acquired by Procter & Gamble ( Research ) , a $ 57 billion dollar deal announced in January 2005 .

The F - 16 GCAS is a modified block 25 F - 16D to perform flight tests of an automatic ground collision - avoidance system .
This system has demonstrated that the use of advanced computing technology can significantly reduce the number of accidents attributed to controlled flight into terrain ( CFIT ) .
The U.S. Air Force has lost 4 - 5 aircraft per year to CFIT since the early 1990s , and the Swedish air force has a CFIT rate about twice that .
However , the GCAS system now being developed could reverse those trends .
A USAF , Lockheed Martin , NASA and Swedish air force Advanced Fighter Technology Integration ( AFTI ) team completed flight tests of an automatic ground collision - avoidance system or Auto - GCAS on an upgraded USAF Block 25 F - 16D in the fall of 1998 .
In 29 flights , the team conducted more than 350 test maneuvers - such as diving at the ground and the side of mountains - to fulfill two key objectives of the program :
Demonstrate that an Auto - GCAS could significantly reduce critical fighter - aircraft mishaps resulting from pilot spatial disorientation , loss of situational awareness , G - induced loss of consciousness ( G - LOC ) and gear - up landings .
could significantly reduce critical fighter - aircraft mishaps resulting from pilot spatial disorientation , loss of situational awareness , G - induced loss of consciousness ( G - LOC ) and gear - up landings .
Identify any areas where an Auto - GCAS might impede a pilot 's performance of standard tactical missions .
During a dramatic 1 - hr. demonstration flight for this it became clear that these objectives essentially have been satisfied .
The system is not mature enough to install in production fighters yet , but it 's about 95 % ready .
There is no funded program in place now , but the Air Force will probably field some type of Auto - GCAS on the F - 16 , F - 22 and Joint Strike Fighter .
Air Combat Command is developing a formal requirement , and there appears to be enough top - level interest in curtailing perennial CFIT accidents that the AFTI team 's research wo n't be relegated to a dusty shelf , a senior USAF officer said .
The Swedish air force , which routinely flies missions down to 100 ft. above mountainous terrain , could be the first to install a production Auto - GCAS on their JAS 39 Gripens .
Sweden 's Forsvarets Materielverk ( FMV ) and Saab participated in Auto - GCAS development and flight tests , and cofunded the program with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory under a collaborative agreement .
Four Swedish air force pilots have flown Auto - GCAS demonstration profiles at Edwards AFB , and their assessment of the system 's viability was very positive .
I found the system to be a sophisticated and complex -- but quite robust and effective -- last - ditch method to save an " unaware " or unconscious pilot 's life .
LMTAS and Saab engineers blended GPS / inertial navigation inputs , a digital terrain database , a radar altimeter , and the AFTI F - 16s autopilot with an Aircraft Response Model ( ARM ) to create a full - envelope , automatic ground collision avoidance system .
The block 50 F - 16 Terrain - Referenced Navigation System provides a " position " input to help a new algorithm decide what nearby terrain could present a hazard to the aircraft .
Based on the fighter 's maneuvering attitude at any given moment , a specific area of the terrain database is " scanned , " and elevation information is compressed into a 2D model .
The ARM is a sophisticated simulation of the F - 16 , running at a real - time rate .
" It 's a fairly complicated algorithm that tracks fuel - burn , takes information from the stores management system [ about weapons weight and drag ] , and even accounts for system processing delays , " said Mark A. Skoog , USAF 's AFTI F - 16 test director .
" Using the aircraft 's current state , the ARM computes a full six - degree - of - freedom simulation during a roll to wings - level .
At wings - level , [ ARM switches ] to a 2D - type recovery - - a second - order modeling of the jet 's pitch response .
It calculates how much [ kinetic ] energy it can trade for altitude until the jet reaches a desired zoom - climb speed , then holds that speed . "
Ultimately , the computer determines how much time is available before the aircraft will break through a pilot - selected minimum descent altitude ( MDA ) , then triggers an autopilot - commanded protective maneuver .
Typically , two chevrons (>
At that instant , the Auto - GCAS commands some of the most aggressive , eye - watering maneuvers this ex-USAF flight test engineer and civil pilot has ever experienced .
If inverted ( bank angle greater than 90 deg . ) and somewhat nose - down , a negative 1g push throws the pilot " up " into his shoulder straps and lap belt to get the aircraft 's nose headed skyward .
Immediately , a 180 - deg./sec. roll is commanded , bringing the aircraft to wings - level , right - side - up .
Somewhere after passing the 90 - deg .- bank point , a 5g pull - up is initiated at an approximately 4g / sec. rate .
The system commands a maximum angle - of - attack recovery , if flight conditions will not sustain a 5g pull - up .
When the flight path is pointed above threatening terrain , the Auto - GCAS disengages and announces , " You got it ! "
If aircraft speed is insufficient to climb adequately during a pull - up , the system also will announce , " Power ! Power ! " , urging the pilot to push the throttle forward and gain airspeed .
Skoog 's system briefing prior to my flight emphasized the speed of these autopilot - performed lifesaving maneuvers , and the reason for their aggressiveness .
" The roll has a very rapid onset .
It 'll impress a spot on the side of your head .
Pilots will get their heads banged against the canopy .
But for a sole - purpose Auto - GCAS , there 's no reason to be delicate about the roll [ rate ] .
Let 's get to wings - level as quickly as we can , " he said .
" The roll onset rate is faster than any pilot can command , " Prosser added .
" There 's no way you can move your hand that fast to command a sharp onset .
It 's so fast that you get the impression the roll rate is much higher than it is . "
Because pilots are adamant about having final authority over their aircraft , the AFTI test team initially gave the pilot an ability to always override the Auto - GCAS .
Extensive testing , plus discussions with F - 22 test pilots , changed that attitude .
" During all - terrain testing , we found that even the slightest override of the GCAS autopilot in the wrong direction would blast you through the [ MDA ] floor , " Skoog said .
" Trying to do elevated - g fly - ups , we saw hundreds of feet of additional altitude loss due to a 0.3 - sec. override .
We came out of the program knowing that we'd have less protection by giving the pilot total autopilot override [ authority ] .
So , we lock - out the pilot in roll and yaw .
He can add pitch up to the angle - of - attack limits , " and can always deactivate the Auto - GCAS by hitting a " paddle " switch at the base of the control stick , or pushing with 19 lb. of force .
For our flight , Prosser set the Auto - GCAS in " Active " or " Low - Level " modes , with " Standby " appearing on the HUD only when the landing gear handle was moved to the gear - down position .
He activated the system shortly after our takeoff from Edwards AFB in F - 16D serial no .
# 83-1176 , a Block 25 aircraft that had its avionics updated to a Block 40 /50 configuration .
As the first digital F - 16 testbed , this airframe was operated under several structural limitations that restricted maneuvering somewhat .
Prosser initially demonstrated GCAS response rates by setting up a shallow dive , then pulling the gun-trigger on the F - 16s sidestick controller to initiate a pilot - activated fly - up ( PAFU ) .
I repeated the PAFU check from a near - inverted , 30 - deg .
nose - down attitude , verifying that depressing the back - seat gun-trigger also would command a fly - up maneuver .
This PAFU technique was used throughout the Auto - GCAS flight - test program to command an immediate pull - up for any safety - related reason .
A team of engineers in a mobile ground station monitored airspeed , dive angle , bank angle , Auto - GCAS status , time - to - fly - up , and distance - from - terrain data telemetered from the jet .
Special computer displays in that control room enabled an immediate " abort " call if engineers saw any aircraft parameter exceed preset limits .
The test pilot also could initiate a PAFU if he " exceeded his comfort level , " Prosser said .
Extensive testing has shown that pilots typically initiated a pull - up about 1.5 sec. before they would hit the ground .
" We had to have pretty tight tolerances for these test runs , " Prosser said .
For one that simulated a blacked - out pilot in a steep dive , " that meant we only had a 10 - deg . dive , 20 - deg. bank and 50 - kt. airspeed [ tolerance ] .
When you 're pointing straight down , that 's pretty hard to nail . "
During Prosser 's final demonstration of an aggressive PAFU - commanded recovery from an initial 120 - deg .
bank , 17 - deg .
nose - down attitude , our spare digital data transfer cartridge ( stowed in the front cockpit ) smashed through the map case cover due to the sharp negative 1g push - up .
The cartridge -- slightly larger and much heavier than a VHS videotape cassette -- hit the canopy , flew aft toward me , then , during the positive - g pull - up , slammed onto a panel between our cockpits .
It was an unexpected and graphic illustration of the high accelerations and forces commanded by the AFTI F - 16 autopilot .
After moderate checks of the system at shallow dive angles and an aborted run or two , Prosser simulated several fatal mishaps .
The first replicated a pilot flying on night - vision goggles ( NVG ) and losing situational awareness .
With Auto - GCAS minimum descent altitude set at 500 - ft. AGL ( a medium - risk test condition ) , Prosser rolled into a partially inverted 5g turn , then back to a 90 - deg .
bank before relaxing his grip on the stick .
The mishap pilot had lost the night horizon and , thinking he was approximately wings - level , let the nose fall .
He was unknowingly diving toward the ground .
Similar NVG - related accidents have killed F - 16 and A - 10 pilots .
While the flat Rosamond Dry Lake raced upward at us , filling my out - the - canopy field - of - view , I glanced at my back - seat HUD repeater and saw two large chevrons moving toward the center of the display .
Their arrow - points touched , and we immediately snap - rolled to wings - level and pulled sharply to about 10 deg .
nose - up .
When the " You got it ! " annunciation sounded , we were climbing at about 317 kt .
and 2,940 ft. , roughly 600 + ft. above the lakebed -- an artificially high altitude established for safety reasons .
" [ Auto - GCAS ] just saved your life , " Prosser said .
USAF F - 16D block 25 , # 83-1176 , used for the combined US - Swedish GCAS trials , held in 1998 ( USAF photo )
The next mishap simulation depicted a pilot dropping a low - drag bomb in a 20 - deg .
dive , then pulling up at 5g , rolling into a 135 - deg .
left bank and looking over his shoulder to watch the bomb 's impact .
Instead of climbing to downwind , however , the unwary pilot allowed the aircraft nose to drop about 20 deg .
below the horizon .
We initiated the test run from a base altitude of 8,300 ft. , simulated a bomb release at 375 kt.
CAS and 5,500 ft. , and started a 5g pull - up .
Prosser rolled 135 - deg .
left and let the nose drop .
However , our dive angle rapidly increased to 28 deg , prompting an abort call from the ground - based control room and a pilot - initiated fly - up via the PAFU switch about 1 sec. early .
Local air - traffic conflicts precluded a repeat run .
Prosser reset the Auto - GCAS MDA to 50 ft. , selected " ground speed " for display on the HUD and descended into a preplanned low - level tactical course .
To avoid unnecessary distractions , he eliminated the chevrons from the HUD , as well .
We flew about 200 ft. above the ground at 520 - 560 kt. , popping over high - tension power lines , hills and small ridges .
Slipping through cuts in the desert mountains , rolling inverted to pull down the backside of ridges , and carving around the sides of rocky hills , Prosser demonstrated that a pilot could fly a normal , low - level tactical mission without experiencing a single nuisance fly - up .
" So far , [ Auto - GCAS ] has not impeded our mission at all , " he noted .
When we were inverted , the system lost radar altitude information , which double - checks aircraft location by comparing the ground 's contours along the flight path with those stored in the digital terrain database .
However , the sophisticated Auto - GCAS algorithms compensated appropriately , relying on inertial system - derived altitude information when necessary .
The test pilot reset our MDA to 200 ft. and flew at a constant altitude across a peak to demonstrate the slight " speedbump " effect of grazing that minimum - descent altitude .
The Auto - GCAS " fly - up " was very brief and docile -- just enough to let a pilot know he was close to the protective altitude band separating his aircraft and the terrain .
Prosser had restored the chevrons to their normal 5 - sec. prefly - up appearance schedule , which warned us of an impending " bump " as the peak approached .
Because Fremont Peak was just beyond , we experienced a second brief " Fly - up ! Fly - up ! " call when Fremont came into the system 's scan pattern a second or so after getting the first " speedbump " fly - up .
The second one was almost imperceptible , though .
Before the next two runs -- directly at the steep slopes of what the test team dubbed " GCAS Mountain " -- Prosser explained the euphemism , " pilot comfort level . "
" We 'll have the flight path marker in the dirt , so [ these ] will engage my [ personal ] comfort level , " he said .
A test pilot 's judgment about how long to wait before squeezing the PAFU trigger was a significant factor in Auto - GCAS development , and personal differences had to be accounted for in the data processing .
Our first run was a wings - level , 465 - kt. approach to GCAS Mountain with a 700 - ft. MDA set .
The HUD 's flight path marker was aimed about 2/3 up the peak , and the desert rocks , dirt and scrub brush raced rapidly at our windscreen .
About the time I would liked to have suggested " Pull NOW ! " , the system took over and the 5g - plus pull - up drove me down in the seat .
The g- onset was so rapid , then sustained , that the oxygen mask threatened to slide over my nose , and the g- suit tried to compress my lower body to half its normal size , it seemed .
The aircraft nose reared up to a 28 - deg . - high deck angle before the " You got it ! " call sounded .
The radar altimeter showed we were 1,040 ft. above the mountain , and our speed had dropped to about 400 kt .
" That one was pretty close to my comfort level , " Prosser quipped .
" I would n't have gone , maybe , 2 more seconds , " which was about 2 sec. beyond the Aviation Week guy 's comfort level .
The next run was one of the most - impressive -- a 30 - deg. dive directly at the side of GCAS Mountain .
Prosser set the Auto - GCAS MDA to 2,000 ft. ( considered a low - risk test MDA ) , climbed to 7,500 ft. , rolled inverted and pulled the nose down to - 25 deg .
He snapped the fighter back to wings - level and pushed the nose further down to hold a 30 - deg .
dive angle , aiming at the rock - strewn mountain .
The fly - up annunciation came at 2,750 ft. AGL and around 400 kt. , triggering a long , 5.3g pull - up .
Even test pilots met their match when flying this test point during the development effort .
None of the program 's pilots would go lower than a 100 - ft.
MDA .
Next , Prosser set a 50 - ft. MDA and descended to 100 - 150 - ft.
AGL for a low - level run over fairly smooth terrain at about 500 KTAS .
Again , there were no nuisance fly - ups as we raced across the desert floor along Cords Road .
Prosser pointed our flight path marker at the base of Desert Butte , a lone mountain north of Edwards AFB .
The jagged mountain filled our windscreen -- and extended well above it -- before we heard " Fly - up ! Fly - up ! "
Just as the high -g pull - up relaxed , another fly - up was triggered , possibly because Prosser had hit the PAFU trigger almost coincidentally with the Auto - GCAS activation .
Prosser concluded the mishap demonstrations with a simulated G - LOC situation , emulating a pilot who pulled enough gs to pass out .
Its pilot unconscious , the fighter eventually would fall nose - down and accelerate .
With a conservative 6,000 - ft. test MDA set , our first attempt was aborted when airspeed exceeded test limits .
On the second try , Prosser rolled into a 120 - deg . - bank , 5g turn at 20,250 ft. , then relaxed , letting the nose drop .
Even with speedbrakes extended and power at idle , we hit 530 KTAS and were 55 deg .
nose - down in a roughly 110 - deg .
bank when the Auto - GCAS triggered a fly - up around 12,200 - ft. MSL .
The system then had to overcome our approximately 900 - ft./sec. descent rate .
A data check indicated our recovery bottomed out 280 ft. above the MDA .
" We were milliseconds away from hitting the ' ground , ' " when the Auto - GCAS took over , rescuing the unconscious pilot , Prosser said .
On final approach for landing at Edwards , the Auto - GCAS switched to " Standby " as soon as the gear handle was lowered .
If we had made a touch - and - go , the system would have automatically reactivated at gear - up .
For safety reasons , it also is automatically deactivated when the air refueling door is opened , or alternate flaps are selected .
About the only key improvement that needs to be made to the Auto - GCAS tested here is installation of faster microprocessors and , possibly , an alternate navigation " solution , " Skoog said .
Even then , no processor - related problems were noted during flight evaluations until the F - 16 approached 800 KTAS , well beyond where most missions would be flown in proximity to hazardous terrain .
The Air Force and its Swedish partners are laying out follow - on efforts , but those familiar with the recent test program agree this AFTI F - 16 team has completed the necessary development , and done it safely .
Without question , they have lived up to the program 's Swedish motto : " Du Kan Inte Flyga Lagre , " which translates to " You Can't Fly Any Lower . "

で、そこで、プログラミング言語の話になったのだが、GoogleでJavaを使っていることにずいぶん驚いていた。たしかに、Googleといえば言語はPython、ファイルシステムはGoogle File System ( GFS ) 、DBはBigTable、分散環境としてMapReduceというイメージがある。なので、「きっと速度が必要なところはCかC++で書いてるんだろうなー」と考えると思う。しかし、今日のニュースにもなった以下の記事にも書いているとおり、ミッションクリティカルな部分で採用している言語はJavaである。
このバランス感覚、さすが - Google のDIフレームワー ク" Guice " を使ってみ る
http://journal.mycom.co.jp/articles/2007/03/14/googleguice/
Guiceが依存性注入できるのはコンストラクタ、フィールド、メソッドなど。セッターメソッドにかぎらず、複数の引数をとるメソッドに対しても適用できる。そのほかの特徴としてカスタムスコープ、環状依存への対応、スタティックメンバーのインジェクション対応、Spring Frameworkとの統合、AOP
Allianceメソッドインターセプションなどがある。
Guiceはすでに数カ月にわたり、Googleにおけるミッションクリティカルアプリケーションにおいて採用されている。Google最大のアプリケーションであるAdWordsもGuiceを利用したものだ。
たし かAmazonもミッションクリティカルな部分ではJavaを採用しており、ほぼPerl+Javaで組まれているはずだ。Javaがミッションクリティカルな部分で採用される理由は、実行速度とチームでの開発スピードのバランスが優れているからだと思う。また、スレッドを言語としてサポートしているのも、大規模システムを利用する場合心強い。ページの生成にはCで書かれたテンプレートエンジンを叩けばいいし、DBはBigTableのAPIを叩くだろうから、それを支える言語として最も重要なのはビジネスロジックを的確に実装できることになると思う。その開発スピードを支えるのが上に紹介したDIコンテナであり、こいつにJavaの開発スピードはかなり支えられてると思う。DIコンテナ自体の説明は、Web各所にあるので置いておくとして、それを自作できるのがGoogleの力ということか。
あと、次 に 「今サイトを構築するなら、どんな言語かねー」という話題になり、Ruby on Railsかなーって言っていたが、個人的にはああいうタイプの中身がよく見えないものを採用するよりならPython + MySQL + ClearSilverでいいんじゃないかなーと思うのだが、時代遅れくさいので言うのを止めました。

PARIS , Feb .
19  European governments are preparing legislation to require companies to keep detailed data about people ’s Internet and phone use that goes beyond what the countries will be required to do under a European Union directive .
In Germany , a proposal from the Ministry of Justice would essentially prohibit using false information to create an e-mail account , making the standard Internet practice of creating accounts with pseudonyms illegal .
A draft law in the Netherlands would likewise go further than the European Union requires , in this case by requiring phone companies to save records of a caller ’s precise location during an entire mobile phone conversation .
Even now , Internet service providers in Europe divulge customer information  which they normally keep on hand for about three months , for billing purposes  to police officials with legally valid orders on a routine basis , said Peter Fleischer , the Paris - based European privacy counsel for Google .
The data concerns how the communication was sent and by whom but not its content .
For a man intent on moving into the White House , Rudy Giuliani carries a lot of baggage – but it ’s his draft - dodging past that may prove the biggest drag in the campaign , prominent veterans tell New York magazine in tomorrow ’s issue .
Speaking about terrorism and the Iraq war last week , Giuliani boasted , “ It is something I understand better than anyone else running for president . ”
But it was draft deferments that kept Giuliani , 62 , out of Vietnam while he attended law school .
He was granted a 2 - A occupational deferment for his job as a law clerk in 1969 after his boss , the late Manhattan federal Judge Lloyd MacMahon , wrote a letter to the local draft board – a move criticized years later as rare and questionable .
Law clerks were not on the 1968 list of critical jobs that qualified for occupational deferments .
When the deferment expired in 1970 , Giuliani became susceptible again – but lucked out with such a high draft number that it would have been unnecessary to attempt to continue his exemption .
He was never called .
Giuliani “ has made it clear that if he had been called up , he would have served , ” Giuliani spokeswoman Katie Levinson told New York magazine .
He was opposed to the war in Vietnam on “ strategic and tactical ” grounds , ” she added , although she would n’t offer specifics .
“ Voters will choose the next commander - in - chief based on their whole record , and we believe the mayor ’s record speaks for itself . ”
Opponents told the magazine they see a chink in the warrior - mayor ’s armor , and intend to aim for it .
“ If Giuliani is the nominee , we ’re going to hammer him with ads , and it ’s going to be easy because the issue is simple :
He ’s a draft dodger , ” Jon Soltz , an Iraq vet who served as a captain and runs VoteVets.org , a left - leaning version of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , told the magazine .
“ Giuliani gets a zero- zero , ” added Gen. Wesley Clark , an adviser to the group .
“ He was n’t willing to risk his life for his country , and he has no relevant experience that ’s in any way useful to be commander - in - chief .
He hosted the U.N. and had a large police force . ”
And although an AP - Ipsos poll last month indicated leadership traits or experience are far less important to voters than character attributes such as honesty , a sense that a candidate can handle the role of commander - in - chief remains important to most Americans .
“ I think that the voters in this post - 9/11 era will take into account everything about candidates , ” Dayton Duncan , who was an insider on the presidential campaigns of Democrats Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis told the AP , “ and part of that filter is , ‘ Are you capable of protecting us ? ’ “
" You can use these trends to say that the percentage is slowing , the numbers have leveled off or they are dropping .
They tell us what is happening right now , " Heaton says .
" But to try and tell us about the future is risky business .
What if all of a sudden China or India lets us in and the [ missionary ] work takes off ? "

Carl Bergstrom presented his work on why scientists chase big problems at the Modeling Science , Technology & Innovation Conference at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington , DC .
Video of the talk is now available , as are the slides
Images of women such as Kelly Brook can be distracting to men
The more testosterone he has , the stronger the effect , according to work by Belgian researchers .
Men about to play a financial game were shown images of sexy women or lingerie .
The Proceedings of the Royal Society B study found they were more likely to accept unfair offers than men not been exposed to the alluring images .
The suggestion is that the sexual cues distract the men's thoughts , preventing them from focusing on their task - particularly among those with high natural testosterone levels .
The University of Leuven researchers gave 176 heterosexual male student volunteers aged 18 to 28 financial games to test their fair play .
They are looking for opportunities to pass on their genes
Dr George Fieldman , Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College
But first , half of the men were shown sexual cues of some kind .
One group of 44 men were given pictures to rate ; some were shown landscapes while the rest were shown attractive women .
Another group , of 37 men , were either asked to assess the quality , texture and colour of a bra or a t - shirt .
And a third group of 95 were shown either pictures of elderly women or young models .
Each group was then paired up to play a game where the men had $ 10 , a proposer had to suggest a split , and the other man accepted or rejected the offer .
If the second man accepted the offer , the money was distributed in agreement with the offer .
If he rejected it , neither partner got anything .
The game is designed as a lab model of hunting or food sharing situations .
' Vulnerable '
The men's performance in the tests showed those who had been exposed to the " sexual cues " were more likely to accept an unfair offer than those who were not .
The men's testosterone levels were also tested - by comparing the length of the men's index finger compared to their ring finger .
If the ring finger is longer , it indicates a high testosterone level .
The researchers found that men in the study who had the highest levels performed worst in the test , and suggest that is because they are particularly sensitive to sexual images .
Dr Siegfried DeWitte , one of the researchers who worked on the study , said : " We like to think we are all rational beings , but our research suggests ... that people with high testosterone levels are very vulnerable to sexual cues .
" If there are no cues around , they behave normally .
" But if they see sexual images they become impulsive . "
He added : " It 's a tendency , but these people are not powerless to fight it .
" Hormone levels are one thing , but we can learn to deal with it . "
The researchers are conducting similar tests with women .
But so far , they have failed to find a visual stimulus which will affect their behaviour . "
Dr George Fieldman , principal lecturer in psychology at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College , told the BBC News website : " The fact men are distracted by sexual cues fits in to evolutionary experience .
It 's what they are expected to do .
" They are looking for opportunities to pass on their genes . "
He said the study confirmed what had been suspected by many .
" If a man is being asked to choose between something being presented by an attractive woman and an ugly man , they might not be as dispassionate as they could be . "
Parents who are of different races , such as a white father and an Asian - American mother , spend more time and money on their kids than parents who are both of the same race , new research shows .
So - called biracial ( aka interracial or multiracial ) parents are more likely than their " monoracial " counterparts to provide their children with a home computer , private schooling and educational books and CDs and to make sure they participate in reading activities , dance , music or art lessons outside of school and get trips to the zoo , library and other cultural venues .
The " biracial advantage " only holds for comparisons with same - race couples from the two racial groups represented by the parents — for instance , if a Latino and white couple is compared with a Latino - Latino couple or a white - white couple .
The finding disappears if all biracial couples , regardless of racial pairing , are compared with the entire pool of same - race couples ( combining all couples that are white - white , black - black , Latino - Latino and so forth ) .
The advantage , or higher investment , can be explained as a counterweight or response to the social challenges faced by interracial couples , who only gained legal acceptance in the United States in 1970 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a state law in Virginia that prohibited whites from marrying non-whites , said study author Brian Powell at Indiana University Bloomington .
The ruling invalidated similar bans in 15 other states .
The number of biracial couples has since more than tripled , yet many couples still face disapproval and prejudice , Powell said .
" They face challenges in being a couple , " he said in a prepared statement .
" They 're aware of the challenges their children will be facing .
In turn , they try to compensate for this . "
Powell said he was not surprised by the finding that the biracial nature of families may represent a source of advantage , rather than hardship , for children .
" What we find is pretty similar to the findings for other families that are not seen as your typical family — older parents are seen as selfish , adoptive parent are seen as people who have no quote ' biological ' connection to the children , interracial couples are said to ignore the challenges the child has by being interracial , " Powell told LiveScience .
" In all cases , those claims are completely wrong in terms of what we are finding . "
The study , detailed in the American Journal of Sociology , examined data collected in 1998 – 1999 as part of a large national survey of U.S. families , with a focus on those with kindergarteners .
A total of 1,599 couples were part of the new analysis .
Powell and his colleague Simon Cheng at the University of Connecticut found one exception to the " biracial advantage . "
Black father / white mother families tend to invest fewer resources into kids than do black monoracial couples and white monoracial couples .
This could be because families in which one of the parents is black likely experience greater prejudice and disapproval from their extended families than do non-black interracial couples , Powell and Cheng wrote .
Also , there seem to be greater social challenges faced by couples in which a non-white man is involved with a white woman , they wrote .
The study also highlighted the great variation in U.S. biracial couples .
Couples with one black parent and one white parent made up the smallest set — just 143 couples , compared to 601 in which one parent was Latino and the other white .
There were 174 white and Asian couples and 191 couples who were white and " other , " which referred to Native Americans among others .
The paradox is that despite the de-Baathification efforts under way , we are doing exactly what the Baath Party always did : we have simply changed " execute and then argue " to " do what you are told and discuss it later . "
It is obvious that the Iraqi Islamic Party , a leading Sunni coalition , was given great assurances by Shiite leaders and American officials last week before it advocated a " yes " vote .
The party officials apparently believed they could fool the masses with their rhetoric .
They have actually shot themselves in the foot ( and time will prove to the Americans that a weak ally is a burden rather than a help ) .
No matter how the vote ends up , the constitution will eventually be thrown into an open fire .
This fire is spontaneously combusting across the nation right now , and it will burn the green and the dry .
Rather than unifying Iraqis , this constitution would only increase the rift between our ethnic and religious groups .
It could also lead to the Balkanization of the nation , as the 18 states coalesce into three superstates , with the Sunnis trapped between Shiites to the south and Kurds to the north .
Hatred toward those Iraqis who returned to Iraq on the backs of the American tanks will be nurtured .
Inevitably this would lead to more hatred towards the United States , since even though it is the American troops that are preserving Iraq 's unity , it was the invasion that has lead to this chaos .
I , and millions of other Iraqis , Sunnis and Shiites , sincerely hope that this constitution has been voted down .
The next National Assembly is going to be of a much more democratic composition , and would be well suited for writing a more effective constitution , one that would better reflect the patriotic desires of all Iraqis .
This would also give the Sunnis who now have taken the political path a sign that there is a light at the end of the tunnel .
But if the constitution has been passed , many more Iraqis are going to feel that no matter what they do in the political sphere , it would not make a difference , and that the only way out of this is to take up armed struggle .
In any case , after the votes have been counted , a constitution is only a piece of paper .
Even if the country does not fly apart because of it , or we get a better one down the road , there are many steps that need to be taken if we are going to achieve any sort of political stability .
First , we need a new government whose officials are in power based on qualifications rather than loyalty to a certain sect , political party or ethnic group .
This government needs to give the ordinary Iraqi a tangible positive change : better electricity ; more jobs ; more security .

' Godfather of Soul ' James Brown died today : December 25th , 2006 .
His music will live on , so here 's the song that made him famous and everyone should remember : I feel good .

For starters , it 'll actually make consumers more likely to buy music and sign up for subscription services like Napster To Go and Rhapsody To Go .
This sounds counterintuitive , but it 's not .
Being able to strip out the DRM on a file actually makes it more useful – and thus more valuable – for the consumer .
Shortly after posting the news , we got a slew of messages from readers and friends telling us they were signing up with a PlaysForSure service provider because they were no longer worried about being able to play the songs they 've downloaded on their MP3 player .
Since you can already get the same music for free if using P2P networks , all DRM does is make it harder for honest consumers to enjoy the music they 're paying for .
It 's difficult to justify paying for a less useful version of a song when with a little effort you can find it elsewhere in a non-copy protected format .
We 're big fans of the subscription services , here at Engadget , but let 's face facts : the damn things do n't work very well .
It 's pretty easy to download tracks , but it 's a serious pain in the ass to successfully transfer them to a portable device .
The only way for DRM to be successful is if it 's painless and seamless , and we get tons of emails from consumers complaining about how hard it is to get Napster , Rhapsody , Yahoo Music Unlimited , etc. tracks on to their players , or , god forbid , Macs .
Are a lot of people going to pay $ 15 to sign up for a subscription service , download a ton of music , and then cancel a month later ?
Absolutely , but that 's not a big deal .
Those people were never , ever going to sign up for a service that offers locked down music anyway , so be happy that you squeezed any money out of them at all .
( Yeah , this does make it tougher to offer free , unlimited trials , but that 's not the end of the world . )
Could those same people then put all the music they 've just downloaded up on the P2P networks ?
Sure , but all that music is available there anyway , so it should n't make a bit of difference in the grand scheme of things .
So just try and look the other way this time .
We 've been on the verge of canceling our subscription services for a couple of months now ( too many snafus involving DRM licenses and device syncing ) , but FairUse4WM has changed our minds now that we can actually download music with the confidence that we 'll be able to enjoy it .
Does the fact that we could quit and " keep " the music that we 've been " renting " a problem ?
Theoretically , but what 's going to keep consumers paying those monthly fees is n't the threat of losing access to their collection ( though that 's part of it ) ; what keeps them paying is the continuing access to a large , frequently updated catalog of new releases and older tunes .
DRM makes paying for music less attractive than stealing it ; FairUse4WM flips that around and makes paying for music more attractive since you can more easily play the music you 've purchased on the device of your choice .
Without a doubt you guys in Redmond are getting an earful from the record labels .
You promised them a secure system , and you failed .
They might already be threatening to withdraw their licenses for their music , but here 's where you have to stand up and explain to the labels why they need to chill .
Send Steve or Bill or J or whomever to smooth things over .
We are n't assuming this is going to be an easy thing to make happen , but c'mon , you guys are / Microsoft / , if any company has the clout to make this happen and drag the entertainment industry into the 21st century , it 's you .
The music industry needs to accept that there is always going to be a certain amount of piracy , and then just get on with the business of selling digital .
Let 'em keep the DRM in place if they want – we can all pretend that it still works -- just make it possible for anyone who really wants to get rid of it to take that extra step .
Besides , whether the RIAA likes it or not ( or realizes it or not ) , you 'll be doing the right thing for both consumers and the music business .
( And is n't that the point of all this ? )
FairUse4WM means that all our PlaysForSure tracks will actually play for sure , so please do n't go and spoil it .
Sincerely ,
Your friends at Engadget

He discusses an interesting phenomenon with respect to energy futures prices , that long dated futures are limited in how much they can go up ( but not down ) based on arbitrage principles .
Because the price of distant oil futures quickly rise alongside spot market prices when spot markets are moved by short - term events , we can infer that major producers such as Saudi Arabia think that the future price of oil will be much higher than the price at which distant futures are currently trading .
This provides further support to the theory that they do n’t believe their own statements on their future production or on the future price band for crude oil .

NYMEX Futures Strip for Light Sweet Crude 3/29/07 ( Click to Enlarge )
Financial Intelligence : How Arbitrage Forensics Provide Insight into Saudi Knowledge
There has been quite a bit written recently about what is “ really ” happening to Saudi oil production , as opposed to what the Saudis are telling us .
Comparison of rig-count to oil production levels , or analysis of published seismic readings of water encroachment on a reservoir provide good insight , as Stuart Staniford has shown in several , recent , articles .
This article is to suggest that additional , complementary information about Saudi oil production can be gleaned through forensic analysis of the related financial markets .
Just as reservoir analysis is quite complex , this financial analysis will be fairly challenging — please bear with me , I will do my best to explain the financial principles at work in this analysis ( and please do n’t be offended if you already understand arbitrage ! ) .
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY : Because the price of distant oil futures quickly rise alongside spot market prices when spot markets are moved by short - term events , we can infer that major producers such as Saudi Arabia think that the future price of oil will be much higher than the price at which distant futures are currently trading .
This provides further support to the theory that they do n’t believe their own statements on their future production or on the future price band for crude oil .
One of the basics principles of finance is the “ Law of One Price . ”
This states that , for any fungible and definable good ( such as oil ) , all future prices flow from the spot price .
Say , for example , that the spot price of NYMEX Sweet Light Crude is $ 60 / barrel .
The Law of One Price says that the future price of that same barrel of oil in one year is not an independent price , but rather is dependent on the spot price : it is $ 60 / barrel + “ risk - free ” cost of money over 1 year + cost of carry ( storage ) for one year .
If the future contract is trading at higher than this predetermined cap , then arbitrageurs can make risk - free profit — they sell the future contract , buy the spot oil , and store it until the future contract matures , collecting the excess as profit .
This represents an upper limit , an “ arbitrage cap ” — the price of oil for delivery one year from today cannot exceed a set amount above the spot price , or arbitrageurs will act to correct this price distortion .
It should be noted that arbitrage price cap can actually be lower than the spot price — this happens when the cost of money is negative over the time period ( either due to general deflation or specific yield - curve environments ) .
In contrast , there is no limit to how much lower the future price of a good can be from the present price because arbitrage cannot act to correct such a disparity .
If oil is trading at $ 60 / barrel today , there is no reason why a future contract for delivery in one year ca n’t be trading at $ 30 / barrel .
A trillion barrel oil field could be discovered in upstate New York — not very likely , but we just do n’t know .
The point is , it is theoretically possible for traders to find some good reason to price oil much lower one year from now than today ’s spot price .
Arbitrage has no mechanism to correct this disparity — you ca n’t buy a future contract to cover a sale of oil today .
Returning to the upper limitation on future pricing : what happens when future prices push up against this arbitrage cap ?
Arbitrage acts to bring the prices in line with each other .
But in doing so , does the future price come down , or does the spot price go up ?
Let ’s look at the mechanics .
An arbitrageur looking to exploit a future price that is too high relative to the spot price must buy oil on the spot market and sell oil on the future market — this increases current demand ( relative to current supply ) and increases future supply ( relative to future demand ) .
As a result , both the future price comes down , and the spot price goes up .
However , the volume on the future market is invariably much lower than the volume on the spot market , so the arbitrage trades bring the future price down much more than the spot price goes up .
As we ’ve discussed , the spot price of oil cannot “ push up ” the future price via arbitrage .
The spot price does set the psychological expectations of traders ( as humans tend to extrapolate the present when predicting the future ) , but there is no arbitrage mechanism that forces short - term , supply - based price increases ( such as the shut - in production following Hurricane Katrina ) to push up prices in the distant future .
Why , then , do actual price changes seem to contradict these accepted principles ?
Now things get interesting …
When there are short - term , supply - driven increases in the spot price of oil — such as the recent increase that can be partially attributed to the capture of British sailors by Iran ( see chart below ) — this price increase should not also increase the price of a future nearly four years out .
And yet it did … the price of the December 2012 contract increased right alongside the spot price over the past few days .
Why ???
Because of the limits imposed through arbitrage , the price of oil ( based on the future contract price ) in 2010 can’t greatly exceed today ’s spot price of oil .
The future price of oil can , however , be significantly lower than the spot price — and when short term events push up the spot price significantly , this might be normal occurrence .
After all , an incident in the Persian Gulf , or a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico have little bearing on the supply / demand picture for crude oil five years from now .
But in the past few years , as soon as short - term spot price movements create space under the arbitrage imposed future price cap , the future price seizes the opportunity to move upwards .
The explanation for this is that the future supply / demand equilibrium is at a price significantly higher than the future is actually trading , because that future price is constrained by the arbitrage cap .
Whenever space is made available under the arbitrage cap , such as by current events , the future price will quickly rise to fill that space .
Figure 1 : Illustration of distant future market closely following short - term spot market price movement to fill available space under the arbitrage cap . ( click to enlarge )
If the future price of oil were significantly below the arbitrage price cap , then this would be highly significant to the Peak Oil debate — it would represent the market intentions of major producers who , with full access to their internal data , believed that the future price would not be significantly higher than the present price .
Conversely , because there appears to be zero space available under the arbitrage cap — even when events temporarily increase the spot price — we can discern that these major producrs believe that the future price will be significantly higher .
In reality , this calculus applies primarily to only one producer — as Saudi Arabia is the worlds largest exporter , and as most future hopes for oil supply increase seem predicated on their claims , then they are the only market player whose future production has a high likelihood of setting future prices .
If Saudi ARAMCO actually believed that it would be producing 12 + million barrels of oil a day in 2012 , and that prices would still be trading in a band of roughly $ 60 / barrel , then it would have significant motivation to sell oil futures for delivery in 2012 .
Why ?
If it can get $ 68 today for oil to be delivered in 2012 , and it honestly expects oil to be trading in the $ 60s in 2010 , it would be crazy not to sell the future today and invest the money in a bond or other financial instrument .
Even at a 3 % rate of return above inflation , selling a Dec. 2012 contract today for $ 68 / barrel is the same as selling that same oil in Dec. 2010 for $ 81 / barrel ( in 2007 dollars ) .
If Saudi ARAMCO did believe what it publicly states it believes , then it would be happy to sell oil for delivery in 2012 at $ 68 / barrel ( today ’s future price ) .
Or at $ 67 / barrel .
Or at $ 66 / barrel — this motivation to sell even at prices below where the future is currently trading would bring the future price down — it would n’t jump to fill space created under that arbitrage cap by short - term influences .
Because this is not what is happening — in fact , because the opposite is happening and future prices rise immediately to fill any available room under the arbitrage cap — we gain a very valuable insight into the inner thinking of the Saudis .
What insight ?
Because the future price jumps to fill space created under the arbitrage cap , we can infer with high confidence that the Saudis do n’t believe their own rhetoric .
They do n’t believe that they ’ll actually be producing 12 + million barrels of oil per day in 2010 , they do n’t believe that the price of oil will be less than $ 80 in 2010 .
If they believed anything close to this , they would happily sell 2012 futures now for $ 60 / barrel or less — far less than the current price — and this would bring down market prices .
This is , in my opinion , highly significant because their access to their own data puts them in the best position to make assessments of the future of global oil markets .
If actions speak louder than words , then this is the real Saudi press release : “ We ’ve peaked … ”
In the last little while we started to receive the same error / bug report coming through the Error Reporting functionality within LandlordMax .
The error coming back was :
Error refreshing logo image javax.imageio.IIOException : Unsupported Image Type
Now this seemed weird to us , because we had all kinds of validations on which types of images to accept within LandlordMax .
Before I proceed , to give you some context , LandlordMax has the ability to import pictures ( jpg ’s and gif ’s only ) into it ’s database for 2 things .
You can import an image for your logo / letterhead which will appear at the top of all your reports , which is great for the property management companies that purchase LandlordMax ( about 50 - 65 % of our customer base ) .
The other area where you can add pictures is for your tenants , buildings , and units .
This is a new feature that many people requested and that we added with version 2.12 .
Getting back to this bug , we added all kinds of validation checks when you import images , such as the file extension ( does it end with .gif , .jpg , .jpeg , etc . ) .
We also added validations where it tries to first read the file , in case someone tried to manually change the file extension .
And so on .
Basically a lot of validation checks !
Initially we received some error reports such as the one listed above , and we found that we had missed a few potential validation checks , which we added with one of the patches ( version 2.12a ) .
That did significantly reduce the number of error reports , but they did n’t fully go away .
Of course not everyone upgrades right away , but with time it seemed to dwindle down very significantly to just a few random ones .
However , like I had just said , it did n’t completely go away which we do n’t like to see .
Yesterday , we were finally fortunate enough to have someone also send us their email address ( an optional parameter in the Error Reporting Dialog Window ) along with the Error Report .
This was great for us in that we finally had a repeatable test case for this very elusive bug that we could n’t replicate , and that was extremely rare .
We immediately contacted this customer and had her send us the image she used for the logo / letterhead as we tracked it down to a specific line in the code .
We got the image , saved it , and added it to our test database .
No problems , no errors , no issues !
What ?
That did n’t make sense .
We then contacted her saying we could n’t reproduce the error and we would be very appreciative if she could send us her database so that we could investigate it in detail .
She obliged us and when we immediately tried it we got the exact error .
It did n’t make any sense …
So the next step was to manually extract the image from her database into an image file and try that .
I know she already sent us the image , but you never know .
We extracted the image and opened it up with an image viewing tool without any issues .
Very confusing …
This image opens up in our image viewing software but not in LandlordMax .
So we dug deeper .
Nothing .
I personally spent several hours looking at this issue with no luck .
So onto the internet and Google Search .
After another hour or two , I found a weird bug report from Sun ( Bug ID # 5100094 ) .
This was the key to the issue .
It appears that the Java language does n’t support JPG images that were saved in CMYK mode and threw this exact exception .
Like most people , I know what a JPG image is , but I do n’t know the details of how it ’s encoded , nor do I really want to know .
Now I was forced to find out more about this .
Without getting into too many technical details , it appears that JPG ’s can be encoded from a number of modes , with RGB being the most common by far , or at least that ’s my understanding .
CMYK mode exist , but it ’s not very commonly used .
Therefore I quickly checked the images , and low and behold , the image I had extracted from the database was encoded in CMYK !
But what about the image she had sent me before ?
Well I did some further investigation , and to show you just how prevalent RGB mode is , the image she had sent me was in RGB mode .
I do n’t know if it ’s the browser that converted the image or what , but when I did “ Save image as … ” it saved it in RGB mode .
I did some further testing , and when I saved the image in CMYK mode , both browsers were n’t always happy with the image ( depending on how exactly I saved it ) .
That was very surprising to me .
So it was n’t only LandlordMax that had difficulties with this image mode sometimes , the major internet browsers also did !
As soon as I converted the image to RGB mode , everything went smoothly and with no issue .
This was probably the most brutal bug I ’ve ever encountered ( omitting concurrency issues and such and just limiting it to straight bugs ) .
It was n’t an issue with the software , so it was n’t possible to track down in the code .
It was an issue with the image file and the programming language ’s support of the image type .
The error message was n’t very indicative of the error as it usual is .
And I also ca n’t blame the Java language either if both the major internet browsers had difficulties with this image mode .
So now what are the options for LandlordMax ?
This particular mode is not supported by the programming language .
Do we look for a third party component and buy it ?
This is a very expensive solution , it costs a lot of money , not to mention the integration time ( which is probably going to cost more than the component ) ?
Will it have other bugs ?
Testing costs …
For the percentage of users , I do n’t think this is a viable solution .
Right now I ’m personally leaning towards doing an extra validation and trying to invisibly render it from the file directly before accepting it .
I ’m leaning towards it , I ’m not satisfied with it yet as it will have a lot of performance overhead , every new image will have to be rendered before being accepted …
Imagine if you add 100 pictures for your building unit and each one has to be rendered .
Rather than take a few seconds to a minute to import , it could now take 5 - 10 or more minutes easily .
Is it worth it ?
Could I do a check after the fact , when trying to render it ?
That ’s a possible solution also but it opens up a whole other can of worms …
The reality is that we do n’t yet have a solution to this issue .
We ’re going to further investigate our options and definitely solve it for the next major upgrade , which is now expected to be out next month rather than this month .
This is probably the most challenging bug I ’ve encountered simply because it was absolutely unobvious what the issue was , there was no way to track it down in the code , and there is no real , or obvious , solution to it .
For those of you who do n’t program , I hope this gives you an idea of the effort that goes into producing a software like LandlordMax Property Management Software .
And although this is probably the most challenging bug I ’ve ever encountered , it ’s also one of the most interesting because of its difficulty !
Story Highlights • Zimbabwe ambassador to U.S. calls eating rodents " a delicacy "
• Resident : " There 's no relief in sight "
• Critics blame President Robert Mugabe for deteriorating conditions
• Archbishops says if Mugabe stays in power , country will head into " abyss "

( CNN ) --
Twelve - year - old Beatrice returns from the fields with small animals she 's caught for dinner .
Her mother , Elizabeth , prepares the meat and cooks it on a grill made of three stones supporting a wood fire .
It 's just enough food , she says , to feed her starving family of six .
Tonight , they dine on rats .
" Look what we 've been reduced to eating ? " she said .
" How can my children eat rats in a country that used to export food ?
This is a tragedy . "
( Watch as Beatrice digs for rodents in the fields of Zimbabwe )
This is a story about how Zimbabwe , once dubbed southern Africa 's bread basket , has in six short years become a basket case .
It is about a country that once exported surplus food now apparently falling apart , with many residents scrounging for rodents to survive .
According to the CIA fact book , which profiles the countries of the world , the Zimbabwean economy is crashing -- inflation was at least 585 percent by the end of 2005 -- and the nation now must import food .
Zimbabwe 's ambassador to United States , Machivenyika Mapuranga , told CNN on Tuesday that reports of people eating rats unfairly represented the situation , adding that at times while he grew up his family ate rodents .
" The eating of the field mice -- Zimbabweans do that .
It is a delicacy , " he said .
" It is misleading to portray the eating of field mice as an act of desperation .
It is not . "
Western journalists are n't allowed in Zimbabwe .
CNN gained access via a cameraman who operated under the radar of the Zimbabwean government .
Mapuranga said that there are news agencies allowed to film there but that the country was " under siege " by media outlets like CNN and the BBC , " which have shown themselves to be hostile to the people of Zimbabwe . "
Critics : Mugabe rules with iron fist
Critics point to one man for the nation 's downfall -- 82 - year - old President Robert Mugabe , one of the longest - serving rulers in Africa .
They say he rules with an iron fist and has reduced Zimbabwe to a nation of beggars .
On Friday , Mugabe downplayed the situation in the country .
" I know we are in difficult times ; it 's hard times that we are going through .
You are bearing a fair share of the burden , we know that [ but ]
Zimbabwe will never collapse , " he told a meeting of his ruling political party , the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front , or ZANU - PF , according to Reuters .
But Shadrack Gutto , of the Center for International Political Studies , said Zimbabwe is on the verge of collapse .
" The reality is it 's really grinding down and not improving , " he said .
The downslide began , critics say , in 2000 when the government crippled the country 's prime commercial farms by running off white farmers and redistributing the land to Mugabe 's cronies .
At least a dozen white farmers were killed and dozens were injured and hospitalized .
Thousands more fled the country and the land .
Most of that land now lies empty and abandoned .
Mapuranga said the program was " the greatest thing that has happened to Zimbabwe . "
The ambassador said the Africans who had been marginalized by whites before can now own land and control natural resources .
" This generation may suffer , but we are actually laying the foundations of prosperity and Zimbabwean control , " he said .
Mugabe 's political rivals have been neutralized .
The official opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change , has been fractured by infighting and disunity .
Its leader , former trade unionist Morgan Tvasngirai , just barely survived being convicted of treason after a video was released showing him discussing plans for the supposed " elimination " of Mugabe .
Last year , a few months after the presidential election , the government of Zimbabwe bulldozed homes and businesses in the capital of Harare .
It was called " Operation Murambatsvina , " which in the local Shona language means " Drive Out Rubbish . "
The United Nations said more than 700,000 people were left homeless , and critics say they were targeted for their political views .
' We live like animals '
In the midst of the rubble that litters the once - scenic capital , Winnie Gondo , a mother of five , uses any means available to survive .
She lives in a burned - out vehicle .
Gondo told CNN she lost not only her home but a twin son , who died from the squalid conditions .
" I 've lost everything , " she said .
" We live like animals here and there 's no relief in sight . "
Zimbabwe has been reduced to a nation of beggars , Archbishop of Bulawayo Pious Ncube said .
" Life has become extremely difficult in Zimbabwe and a lot of depression ... people are very much depressed and they can no longer think idealistically .
They 're looking all the time for food -- ' Where do I get my next meal , ' " he said .
Ncube traveled to Johannesburg , South Africa , to show a video that he says details numerous cases of police brutality and illegal clamping down on anyone who opposes Mugabe .
The archbishop said that Mugabe wants to hold on to power , in part to avoid the same fate as Charles Taylor , who once ruled Liberia .
After being forced from office in 2003 , Taylor now is in a prison awaiting trial at The Hague , charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Ncube believes that if Mugabe keeps control , Zimbabwe will continue to sink into an " abyss , " and experts agree the only way the nation will eventually get off its knees is when a new president is elected .
" The key will be when Robert Mugabe moves out of the picture as a leader of Zimbabwe , " Gutto said .
Until such time , Zimbabwe seems set to remain as a nation of food lines and fuel queues , of shacks and squatters , of rats and rat-eaters -- a nation fast grinding to a halt .
" I can't remember the last time I ate real food , " says Elizabeth , the mother feeding her family .
" We can't afford anything anymore .
We 're now just eating these rats to survive . "
Any drunken photog knows that a perfectly timed toss and self - timer firing makes for some interesting snaps .
In fact , we 've seen product concepts dedicated to the idea already .
Still , it 's a bit surprising to find HP recommending that you " Toss your camera in the air " for " experimental aerial " photography .
" Try this several times and you 'll end up with a photo unlike all the rest . "
Yeah , and a busted cam .
Still , what better advice to keep the consumption crunch in full grind . :
Presumably after consultation with legal , HP has removed their recommendation from the site .
Toss at your own risk kids .

© Abraham Lincoln Online Lincoln's Patent On May 22 , 1849 , Abraham Lincoln received Patent No. 6469 for a device to lift boats over shoals , an invention which was never manufactured .
However , it eventually made him the only U.S. president to hold a patent .
Shown here is a replica of his scale model at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C .
Lincoln 's Love of Inventions
Lincoln displayed a lifelong fascination with mechanical things .
William H. Herndon , his last law partner , attributed this to his father , saying , " he evinced a decided bent toward machinery or mechanical appliances , a trait he doubtless inherited from his father who was himself something of a mechanic and therefore skilled in the use of tools . "
Henry Whitney , another lawyer friend of Lincoln 's , recalled " While we were traveling in ante- railway days , on the circuit , and would stop at a farm - house for dinner , Lincoln would improve the leisure in hunting up some farming implement , machine or tool , and he would carefully examine it all over , first generally and then critically ; "
Lincoln also delivered lectures on discoveries and inventions before he became president .
" Man is not the only animal who labors ; but he is the only one who improves his workmanship , " he noted in 1858 .
In 1859 he praised the patent laws for having " secured to the inventor , for a limited time , the exclusive use of his invention ; and thereby added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius , in the discovery and production of new and useful things . "
Lincoln and River Navigation
Lincoln learned river navigation early in life and took a flatboat down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers as a teenager .
As he explained in his 1860 autobiography , " When he was nineteen , still residing in Indiana , he made his first trip upon a flatboat to New Orleans .
He was a hired hand merely , and he and a son of the owner , without other assistance , made the trip . "
A few years later , Lincoln moved to Illinois and made a second flatboat trip to New Orleans .
He recalled , " Abraham , together with his stepmother 's son , John D. Johnston , and John Hanks , yet residing in Macon County , hired themselves to Denton Offutt to take a flatboat from Beardstown , Illinois , to New Orleans ; and for that purpose were to join him -- Offutt -- at Springfield , Illinois , so soon as the snow should go off .
When it did go off , which was about the first of March , 1831 , the county was so flooded as to make traveling by land impracticable ; to obviate which difficulty they purchased a large canoe , and came down the Sangamon River in it .
This is the time and the manner of Abraham 's first entrance into Sangamon County .
They found Offutt at Springfield , but learned from him that he had failed in getting a boat at Beardstown .
This led to their hiring themselves to him for twelve dollars per month each , and getting the timber out of the trees and building a boat at Old Sangamon town on the Sangamon River , seven miles northwest of Springfield , which boat they took to New Orleans , substantially upon the old contract . "
What Lincoln omitted from this account was a story of his ingenuity .
Before the flatboat could get to the Illinois River , it became stranded on a milldam at New Salem , a small pioneer settlement along the Sangamon .
As the boat took on water , Lincoln sprang to action .
He had part of the cargo unloaded to right the boat , then secured an auger from the village cooper shop .
After drilling a hole in the bow , he let the water run out .
Then he plugged the hole , helped move the boat over the dam , and proceeded to New Orleans .
In 1832 , as a candidate for the Illinois General Assembly from Sangamon County , Lincoln published his first political announcement , in which he stressed , not surprisingly , the improvement of navigation on the Sangamon River .
© Abraham Lincoln Online Lincoln 's Patent Idea Lincoln started work on his invention between sessions of Congress in 1848 .
On his way home to Illinois his boat became stranded on a sandbar .
As Herndon told the story , " The captain ordered the hands to collect all the loose planks , empty barrels and boxes and force them under the sides of the boat .
These empty casks were used to buoy it up .
After forcing enough of them under the vessel she lifted gradually and at last swung clear of the opposing sand bar . "
Herndon observed , " Lincoln had watched this operation very intently .
It no doubt carried him back to the days of his navigation on the turbulent Sangamon , when he and John Hanks had rendered similar service at New Salem dam to their employer the volatile Offut .
Continual thinking on the subject of lifting vessels over sand bars and other obstructions in the water suggested to him the idea of inventing an apparatus for this purpose . "
Lincoln created a scale model of his invention with the help of Walter Davis , a Springfield mechanic , who provided tools and advice .
Herndon recalled , " Occasionally he would bring the model in the office , and while whittling on it would descant on its merits and the revolution it was destined to work in steamboat navigation .
Although I regarded the thing as impracticable I said nothing , probably out of respect for Lincoln 's well - known reputation as a boatman . "
With some relief Herndon said , " the invention was never applied to any vessel , so far as I ever learned , and the threatened revolution in steamboat architecture and navigation never came to pass . "
Lincoln took the scale model with him to Washington and hired attorney Z. C. Robbins to apply for the patent .
Part of his application read , " Be it known that I , Abraham Lincoln , of Springfield , in the county of Sangamon , in the state of Illinois , have invented a new and improved manner of combining adjustable buoyant air chambers with a steam boat or other vessel for the purpose of enabling their draught of water to be readily lessened to enable them to pass over bars , or through shallow water , without discharging their cargoes ...

Here are some of the great quotes about software development that I have found from around the internet .
In software , we rarely have meaningful requirements .
Even if we do , the only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the customer 's shifting idea of what their problem is .
Son , better to do lots of mediocre things than one thing that 's really good .
That way , people will know you were trying , even if you are a little dumb .
You ’ll never go broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public . a
Netscape engineer who shan't be named once passed a pointer to JavaScript , stored it as a string and later passed it back to C , killing 30 I 'd like free CPU cycles too .
I just happen to care much more about free developer cycles and am willing to trade the former for the latter .
Most developers who work with MSSCCI eventually turn to recreational pharmaceuticals in a futile effort to cope .
A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part .
It 's _the_ single worst way to write software , because it by definition means that the software was written to match theory , not reality .
The best way to predict the future is to implement it .
Test takes full responsibility for paper balls in the office and ruthless acts of paper ball terrorism will continue until our demands are met .
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place .
Therefore , if you write the code as cleverly as possible , you are , by definition , not smart enough to debug it .
They want everyone to learn and use CORBA !
That should provide us all with many years of entertainment .
Ironically , after a series of pay cuts , mandatory overtime , and benefits slashing , the email did n't help improve employee morale .
Good judgment comes from experience , and experience comes from bad judgment .
Identify a real need , figure out how to solve it with a minimum number of moving parts and without writing any unnecessary code , and execute it with talent and professionalism .
Our marketing professionals are constantly coming up with new ways to make you feel inferior and stupid .
Because you are .
And we 're not .
So , Microsoft has relaxed the NDA on Office 12 somewhat - enough that it 's safe to say I 've had a chance to play with the new user interface and I frankly detest it .
When people use the term Web 2.0 , I always feel a little bit stupider for the rest of the day .
This is not to say that design is unnecessary .
But after a certain point , design is just speculation .
No matter how slick the demo is in rehearsal , when you do it in front of a live audience the probability of a flawless presentation is inversely proportional to the number of people watching , raised to the power of the amount of money involved .
Most machines do n't improve with use .
Old pickup trucks do n't gradually become Ferraris just by driving them fast , and a pocket calculator wo n't change into a supercomputer by crunching lots of numbers .
The human body is different .
As weightlifters know , the more that people use their muscles , the stronger they become .
And unused muscles do not remain preserved ; neglect causes them to waste away , or atrophy .
It 's a remarkable response , one that scientists do n't fully understand .
Somehow , muscle cells " sense " how they 're being used and then remodel themselves to better fit the task .
How does this happen ?
And what exactly is it about exercise that triggers the changes ?
NASA needs to know the answers .
Astronauts in space exercise furiously to keep fit .
Even so , their muscles tend to weaken .
Normally , people 's muscles do a lot of work that they 're hardly aware of -- lifting their bodies and maintaining posture against gravity .
In space , that constant muscular work is removed .
There 's a danger of atrophy , " explains Kenneth Baldwin , a professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of California , Irvine .
With NASA support , Baldwin is researching the inner workings of muscles and plumbing the fundamental mystery :
Why do workouts work ?
NASA has a special interest in isometric exercises -- i.e. , non-moving exercises where an astronaut pushes hard against a fixed surface .
Motionless exercises allow for simple lightweight equipment less expensive to launch and less prone to break during a mission .
But are they effective ?
To find out , Baldwin 's group gave laboratory rats a workout by activating the rodents ' leg muscles with painless electrical stimulation .
They tested three types of exercise : muscle contraction , muscle lengthening , and isometric , where the muscle exerts a force while remaining the same length .
( Just think of doing push - ups : muscle contraction occurs in the " up " part of a push - up , muscle lengthening during the " down " part , and isometric while holding a push - up midway . )
After the sessions , the scientists performed tests to see how the rats ' muscles responded .
" What we found , " says Baldwin , " was that after 12 sessions , all three types of workout tended to provide about the same amount of muscle growth , " even the isometric exercises that involved no motion .
This was nothing new .
Other scientists had come to the same conclusions before .
But Baldwin 's group took their analysis a step further :
In addition to measuring overall muscle mass -- how " buff " were the rats ?-- they also measured the amount of contractile proteins within the muscle cells .
Contractile proteins are what actually cause a muscle to contract .
They are what give a muscle its strength .
To their surprise , Baldwin 's team found that while isometric exercises did prevent leg muscles from withering , they did not stop a decline in the amount of contractile proteins in those muscles .
The muscle was actually degrading on the molecular level .
No one knows why this is so , but one thing seems clear : Isometric exercise might not be the best way to maintain astronaut muscles .
Baldwin plans to investigate further with just - renewed funding from NASA .
A more unconventional possibility is that astronauts could stave off muscle atrophy by taking a pill .
Anti-atrophy pills are only speculative right now , Baldwin says , but there are reasons to believe that they might be possible .
That 's because when atrophy sets in , the muscle is n't just withering away passively -- it 's actively breaking itself down !
A complex network of enzymes within the muscle 's cells disassembles muscle proteins molecule by molecule .
" In order to chop those proteins up , you use a lot of energy , " notes Baldwin .
If scientists could pinpoint a key " lynchpin " enzyme in this network , they may be able to design a drug to block its action , thus slowing the breakdown of the muscle .
This active breakdown of muscle protein is going on all the time in everybody 's muscles , as is the constant assembly of new proteins .
Whether a muscle grows , shrinks , or stays the same size depends on the balance between these rates of destruction and construction , a bit like the water level in a bathtub that 's both filling and draining at the same time .
Baldwin is taking a look at the mechanisms behind the " construction " half of this balance .
In particular , his group is focusing on a hormone called Insulin - like Growth Factor 1 ( IGF - 1 ) .
Muscles produce IGF - 1 in response to strenuous exercise , and this hormone in turn activates enzymes in the muscle cells that cause the cells to grow .
Indeed , Baldwin found that levels of IGF - 1 in the rats ' muscles were higher just after exercising .
" Some people think that it 's the mechanical stress that turns the gene ( for IGF - 1 ) on , but we really do n't understand that process yet .
What we do know is that IGF - 1 triggers muscle growth , " Baldwin explains .
Might supplements of IGF - 1 be used to ensure that construction of muscle proteins keeps pace with protein destruction in astronauts ?
Baldwin says they 're entertaining the idea and are already discussing ways in which that might be done .
If they 're successful , it will be good news for more than just astronauts .
After all , we 're all owners of that incredible , self - adapting machine called the human body .
In nearly every case , it 's not worth the extra money when buying electronics and appliances
Subversion ( svn ) is a truly great replacement for CVS .
I 've never really been able to get branching to work in CVS , even after reading the documentation on it I have limited success .
I know that the Python developers were able to make it do the right thing , but I always seemed to run into problems where CVS just would n't let me commit something on a branch I made .
I 've found that it 's much easier to convert a CVS repository from CVS to Subversion and do a branch in svn , than to deal with branches in CVS .
That 's the big reason for me to convert from CVS to svn .
I lasted a long time without branches because CVS made it so painful .
However , now that svn makes branching so easy , I 've been using them and have found that there 's another significant pain - point that 's come up that makes svn branching unusable for me .
I 've been switching to darcs over the weekend …
The problem is that there 's no really good way to have changes from one branch flow to other branches .
I ended up just manually building patches that describe each branch and applying them to the other branches where I 'd do another commit .
In some simple cases I could just “ svn rm ” files or directories in the destination and then “ svn cp ” from the modified branch to the new branch .
That requires that the changes to one branch be entirely independent ( on a file level ) from what is happening on the other branch .
I have two use - cases for branches .
One is where I 've gone on to do significant development on some code , but have to go back and make an emergency patch to a release .
I can't just make the fix to the head , because I have significantly untested code in there .
Another way to deal with this is to have a “ trunk ” and then a “ development branch ” .
This solves the same problem , where experimental or significant changes are done in the “ devel ” branch , or a branch created for this particular work .
In subversion , this works great if I create a new branch , do the development and complete it , with no changes made to the other branch .
You can merge back into the other branch / trunk by just doing “ svn rm ” and then “ svn cp ” of the top - level directory of the branch .
If changes are made to both , it then becomes problematic to merge them .
I had experimented with saving off a copy of the revision created when I did the branch , and then doing a “ svn diff ” from that revision to create a patch I could apply to the other tree .
However , that does n't solve the problem of propagating in changes from the other branch .
If I change the trunk , I probably want to pull those changes into the development tree ASAP .
Darcs is a distributed version control system , which manages patches between the branches itself .
By distributed , I mean that if you do a check out you have a full copy of the archive ( unless you are pulling from a “ partial ” repository ) .
You can make local changes and commit them , without needing commit privileges being granted on the source repository .
This can also be done without network connectivity .
When you have changes you want to share with another repository , you can either “ push ” them to that repository ( using SSH , for example ) , or you can “ send ” them via e-mail .
The latter should be great for for public repositories , because others can pull the repository , work on changes , and then send e-mail that the project maintainer can easily integrate .
On the down side , this does mean that if you are working with a central repository and other developers , a commit will always be a two - step process .
First you do “ darcs record ” which builds a patch of the changes you have made locally .
Then you “ darcs push ” to send patches since the last push .
The equivalent of “ svn update ” is “ darcs pull ” .
Also note that “ darcs push ” and “ darcs pull ” by default will ask you to very every patch that you push or pull , so it can require some thinking .
However , this means that “ cherry picking ” of changes is the default in darcs – you do n't have to accept all patches .
If you have trusted developers , you can probably always just accept all the patches .
One thing that bugs me about darcs is that it does n't yell about conflicts .
Unless you 're paying pretty close attention , reading all the output that a set of “ darcs pull ” commands generate , it 's fairly easy to miss that there are conflicts that need resolution .
I would prefer that it yelled about it , preferably surrounded with lines of Nathan Hales around it .
I 've been using darcs since Thursday or Friday , and so far it 's been working quite nicely .
My largest pain - point has been fully resolved .
I 'll write more about that shortly .

Google plans to use trucks equipped with lasers and digital photographic equipment to create a realistic 3D online version of San Francisco , and eventually other major US cities .
The move would trump Amazon 's A9 service , which offers two - dimensional photos of buildings on US city streets .
The trucks would drive along every San Francisco street using the lasers to measure the dimensions of buildings , to create a 3D framework onto which digital photos can be mapped .
This would complement the mostly top - down view of San Francisco available through Google 's Keyhole satellite photo application .
The goal is to create similar 3D online versions of other cities in the US and overseas .
There have been several test runs of the specially equipped truck along San Francisco streets .
One problem is that vehicles and people can block the automated laser and digital photo systems .
This could be eliminated with a second pass , but Google wants to achieve results with a single run .
Researchers at Stanford university are working on this and other city related projects .
For example ,
here is another Google - funded Stanford project .
The Google 3D project would be used to highlight and distinguish the company 's push into local business listings — the next big opportunity in online advertising .

After dancing around a laundry list of issues , the cause behind the firing of the eight US attorneys has come back again and again to a single issue : the Republican obsession with voter fraud conspiracies .
Today 's NYT article focuses on the case of David Iglesias .
State Republican leaders demanded a criminal investigation .
And with the television cameras rolling , the United States attorney , David C. Iglesias , a boyish - looking Republican , promised a thorough one ...
The inquiry he began , however , never resulted in charges , so frustrating Republican officials here that they began an extraordinary campaign to get rid of him that reached all the way to President Bush .
What was the nature of the complaints ?
A voter - registration group , ACORN , had paid workers to register voters .
Rather than paying a simple hourly rate , ACORN had paid , in part , by the number of names produced .
Not surprisingly , this resulted in some workers getting the brilliant idea of drawing their names from the phone book .
In Missouri , other ACORN workers registered dead relatives , pets , and an array of characters from films and even cartoons .
In both states , Republicans seized on these registration follies as incidents of massive voter fraud .
ACORN became " Democratic operatives , " and every twelve - year - old and animated dog scribbled down on a page sent back to ACORN was trumpeted as further evidence of an attempt by Democrats to subvert the election .
When Iglesias , and other US attorneys , failed to validate this great central tenet of Republican mythology -- that Democrats are out to stuff the ballot boxes -- the hue and cry went out for his dismissal .
Ignored in all this is that there has never been any evidence that a single one of these false registrations appears to have been made for the purpose of casting an illegal vote .
Mr. Iglesisas said , prosecutors would have had to prove that the [ ACORN registrar ] , who had been fired for other reasons , had falsified the applications with the intent of influencing the election .
Mr. Iglesias said " it appeared she was just doing it for the money . "
The great majority of such false registrations never reach the rolls , because states have mechanisms in place to filter out just such false registrations .
No evidence has ever been presented that these registrations have ever been the cause of any illegal votes .
Someone walking into a polling place and claiming to be Daffy Duck is likely to be met with a bit of skepticism , and a pre-pubescent waving a registration card will get nothing but a pat on the head -- which makes all these false registrations of highly questionable value
But if these false registrations do n't lead to false votes , and do n't affect elections one whit , why do Republicans bring them up again and again ?
What makes this political urban legend worth firing US attorneys ?
Why would they rather see Alberto Gonzales ' neck on the chopping block than give up this favorite belief ?
Because they need it .
Without the false flag of voter fraud , Republicans would have no cover for their own extremely direct and well - documented efforts in voter suppression .
They want to keep groups like ACORN from registering thousands of minority voters , so what better way than to show that a handful of workers for these groups have engaged in " fraud ? "
They want to justify restrictions that would make it much harder for people to vote .
How can they do this unless they generate evidence that such restrictions are required ?
To see how Republicans use these examples as means for supporting their argument , take a look at this editorial from the Utah Deseret News .
Several years ago , newspaper investigations found that people were using mail - in forms to register names they had invented out of thin air , or even their dogs and cats , all so they could obtain absentee ballots and vote more than once .
The student paper at Marquette University surveyed 1,000 students and found that 174 willingly admitted to voting at least twice , thanks to Wisconsin 's lax registration laws .
Notice that the first group of incidents , the " people using mail - in forms , " has no specifics , no way to check whether there 's any truth in the statement .
And notice that the editorial makes the leap from false registration to intent to cast a fraudulent vote , without even stopping for breath , much less evidence .
The second accusation , that of the multiple votes by students at Marquette , seems more precise .
The trouble is , the editorial was written in 2006 .
The supposed incident mentioned occurred in 2000 .
So did this article .
A Marquette University student backed down Wednesday from earlier claims that he voted four times in the presidential election , while local officials investigating claims of widespread voter fraud among Marquette students began to publicly question those claims .
As more investigations were made , it became clear that the story was entirely a fabrication .
Not only that , it was fabricated intentionally .
In the statement , Bosworth said he was trying to express his belief that there was a high potential for voter fraud and did so " by overstating his position . "
Every investigation -- including investigations by the local district attorney -- found no evidence of any actual voter fraud .
The incident at Marquette was part of a number of Republican efforts to generate controversy in Wisconsin in 2000 .
Why ?
Because they needed a counter story to signs of clear voter suppression elsewhere , including in Florida .
As the drama in Florida unfolded , Republicans invented incident by incident in Wisconsin , all in an effort to distract the press and drum up righteous indignation .
Six years later , this utterly disproven incident is still being used in an editorial to defend the polls from " voter fraud . "
In fact , the " fraud at Marquette , " has become one of those events enshrined in Republican mythology .
Sacrificing the US attorneys to sustain the voter fraud story may end the career of Alberto Gonzales , and seeing Gonzo trotted out of town may generate some visceral satisfaction .
But keep this in mind : Gonzales will surely be leaving only to take some seven - figure position at a Republican law firm .
He 'll spend the rest of his life sipping champagne based on the contributions he 's made to obscuring truth and perverting justice .
Gonzales is not important .
If the Republicans exit this affair without losing the curtain of voter fraud that they 've been able to drape over every effort for voter suppression since the first days of the civil rights movement , they 'll come out of this the winners .
Update [ 2007-3-18 14:23:40 by Devilstower ] : I should have mentioned this earlier , but if you have n't already read Land of Enchantment 's excellent diary on the circumstances in New Mexico , do so .
Very nice work .

According to the Russian internet publication Obozprevatel ( " the Critic " ) , shown in the photographs are colleagues of the provocative Russian - Ukrainian performance artist Oleg Kulik who " conducted their own Moscow own protest action recently , commemorating not only the larger and more well - publicized ' March of the Dissidents ' but also the 46th birthday of Mr. Kulik , as Oleg himself reports on Invivio.net . "
Apparently the group was inspired to enact their own unique sort of protest action by mounting a mattress on the roof of a car and then driving it through the streets of Moscow while copulating after witnessing the Moscow protest action last weekend led by dissident politicians Garry Kasparov and Mikhail Kasynanov as the " Other Russia " coalition .
It seems they wanted to emphasize the " make - love - not - war " theme in the most visceral manner possible .
According to the participants , they received a much more " sympathetic " response from the local police than was the case in regard to Kasparov 's forces ; the cops they passed only laughed and waived .
Wisely , it seems , the participants somehow managed to refrain from referring to Vladmir Putin at all , not even as the nation 's " phallic symbol . "
One can also see this as a significant commentary on the Other Russia protest itself ; the ragtag protest groups that comprise it are badly organized , poorly funded , and receive scant Western media attention except when there is violence or when somebody prominent like Kasparov gets arrested .
Their platforms are not widely available in English .
The turnout for the followup protest in St. Petersburg after the major crackdown in Moscow was atrocious , easily crushed by the Kremlin 's heavy - handed tactcs , and the action largely ineffective .
State - owned Russian TV broadcast virtually nothing about the events , and one must wonder what the protesters would in fact have to do in order to register such coverage .
For some reason I especially like to read books on Peak Oil , sustainability , and energy issues while traveling .
Part of the reason is that traveling always makes me reflective .
Part of the reason is that these books are often an ice - breaker that allows me to talk about energy with other travelers .
On previous trips I read Jared Diamond 's Collapse and John Howe 's The End of Fossil Energy ( reviewed here ) .
On my latest trip I read Mick Winter 's Peak Oil Prep and Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth .
I started reading Peak Oil Prep during my first flight , and while the man sitting across the aisle from me reading the National Enquirer did n't show much interest in what I was reading , the woman sitting next to me reading about Christina Aguilera 's confessions in Glamour kept glancing at the book .
But unfortunately , she never asked about it and we never struck up a conversation .
Opportunity missed .
First of all , I thought the title -- as well as the subtitle -- were both misnomers .
This is not a book that will merely come in handy when world oil production peaks .
Much of the advice in this book will help you save money and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle while lowering your ecological footprint .
The subtitle is a misnomer because there were certainly more than " Three Thing You Can Do . "
That was in fact the theme throughout the book : Three Things to Do ( in the kitchen , regarding your health , on education , on community gardens , etc . )
The book contained a lot of information that will be familiar to TOD readers .
In fact , there was even a plug for TOD on Page 19 .
However , each section is chock full of links to additional resources .
This was the strength of the book , in my opinion .
There were a lot of practical tips , but then the author linked to additional information so you could research a topic to your heart 's content .
Want to learn to garden using permaculture ?
Read the permaculture summary on Page 78 , and then follow up with one or more of the ten references on permaculture .
This is not a book to convince people of Peak Oil or of climate change .
There is a short section in the beginning that discusses these topics , but those are more appropriate for someone who is already familiar with those issues .
This is a book for those who have at least a basic grasp , and who are wondering " What can I do ? "
And that is answered from " A " ( acupressure ) to " Z " ( zoning ) .
This book is essentially a user 's manual for sustainable living .
The book could be repetitive over certain points .
While I think it is incredibly valuable advice to tell people to change out their incandescent bulbs for compact fluorescents ( and I have done so in the past 3 homes I lived in ) , I counted no fewer than 7 times this was mentioned in the book .
There were also some topics that seemed to be out of place in a peak oil book ( e.g. " get more sleep " ) .
But , by and large , the advice is topical , worthwhile , and could probably benefit all of us .
Taking Notes
I took 3 pages of notes as I read this book on things that were of particular interest to me .
In this section I will share some of those issues .
In the early part of the book , the author makes the case that demand is likely to outstrip supply ( which I also think is very likely ) , and that conflict with China appears possible .
He also commented that China is outlawing bicycles in some areas , which came a surprise to me .
This is the last thing one should do when fossil fuel resources are diminishing .
On Page 18 , the author mentions something that I think we frequently forget about - plastics are made from petroleum .
We often think of Peak Oil in terms of energy , but we are dependent on petroleum in many other ways .
On Page 20 , he mentions a theme that I do n't think gets enough attention :
Even if you do n't believe that Peak Oil is an imminent problem , implementing solutions that reduce your energy usage will lower greenhouse gas emissions .
The author calls this a " two - fer " , but given that many of these solutions will also save you money it could very well be a " three - fer " .
On Page 30 , the author discusses the benefits of walking , and then describes 10 keys to walkable communities .
As I worked my way down the list , I was struck by how most European villages would be aptly described by these 10 keys , but the typical town in the U.S. would not .
On Page 43 , Winter starts to hammer home the " localize " theme , which is a familiar one to TOD readers .
This something I have put more effort into this past year , as I spent much more time at farmers ' markets .
On Page 61 , one of the references caught my eye .
It was Dan Chiras ' 31 Ways to Create Sustainable Neighborhoods .
That sounded like one to add to my library .
That is probably enough to give a good flavor of the book .
Some of the topics covered through the rest of the book were how to compost , solar ovens , beer making , growing your own coffee , and making your house more energy efficient .
One point that really caught my attention was the author 's claim that over 50 % of the vegetables consumed in Havana ( population 2 million ) are produced in local gardens .
That gives me great hope for the future .
Addressing a Misconception
There was one oil company misconception that I want to address , because I see it frequently .
On Page 17 , the author states that no new oil refineries have been built in the U.S. since 1976 .
He then suggests that this may be because there 's no sense expanding facilities if the feedstock is starting to diminish .
I can tell you that the reason no new refineries have been built is not because oil companies are concerned about Peak Oil .
When ExxonMobil tells you that there is plenty of oil , they are not just throwing out a smokescreen .
This is what they honestly believe .
The vast majority of oil companies , in my opinion , believe that we have adequate supplies of oil for quite some time .
The reason no new refineries have been built is that the permitting process is lengthy .
A group in Arizona , Arizona Clean Fuels Yuma LLC , applied for a permit to build a new refinery in 1999 .
It was finally granted in 2005 .
So , instead of going through the lengthy permitting process , refiners simply expand their existing refineries .
The permitting process for this is significantly simpler .
The EIA has written extensively on this issue .
The bottom line on refinery capacity :
Much has been made of the fact that no significant grassroots refinery has been built in the United States in nearly 3 decades other than some small simple refineries .
Yet , U.S. refinery capacity has increased 1.9 million barrels per day over the last 10 years , which is equivalent to the addition of 1 medium - size refinery per year on average , as refiners attempt to de-bottleneck and make their refineries more efficient , change feedstocks , and add capacity to meet market opportunities .
In EIA 's latest Petroleum Supply Annual , Volume 1 , although the number of refineries stayed the same between January 1 , 2003 and January 1 , 2004 , capacity increased by 137,000 barrels per day , adding , again , the equivalent of another medium - sized refinery !
So , refiners are expanding capacity .
This should tell you that , while they may be wrong , they are betting against an imminent peak .
Conclusion
Overall , this was a solid book that was full of useful resources .
This is a good book for anyone trying to live sustainably .

Does democracy really deserve the praise it receives ?
According to Webster 's Dictionary , democracy is defined as " government by the people ; especially : rule of the majority . "
What 's so great about majority rule ?
Let 's look at majority rule , as a decision - making tool , and ask how many of our choices we would like settled by what a majority likes .
Would you want the kind of car that you own to be decided through a democratic process , or would you prefer purchasing any car you please ?
Ask that same question about decisions such as where you live , what clothes you purchase , what food you eat , what entertainment you enjoy and what wines you drink .
I 'm sure that if anyone suggested that these choices be subject to a democratic process , you 'd deem it tyranny .
I 'm not alone in seeing democracy as a variant of tyranny .
James Madison , the father of our Constitution , said that in a pure democracy , " there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual . "
At the 1787 Constitutional Convention , Edmund Randolph said , " ... that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy . "
John Adams said , " Remember , democracy never lasts long .
It soon wastes , exhausts , and murders itself .
There was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide . "
Chief Justice John Marshall observed , " Between a balanced republic and a democracy , the difference is like that between order and chaos . "
Our founders intended for us to have a limited republican form of government where rights precede government and there is rule of law .
Citizens , as well as government officials , are accountable to the same laws .
Government intervenes in civil society only to protect its citizens against force and fraud but does not intervene in the cases of peaceable , voluntary exchange .
By contrast , in a democracy , the majority rules either directly or through its elected representatives .
The law is whatever the government deems it to be .
Rights may be granted or taken away .
Clearly , we need government , and that means there must be collective decision - making .
Alert to the dangers of majority rule , the Constitution 's framers inserted several anti-majority rules .
In order to amend the Constitution , it requires a two - thirds vote of both Houses , or two - thirds of state legislatures , to propose an amendment , and requires three - fourths of state legislatures for ratification .
Election of the president is not done by a majority popular vote but by the Electoral College .
Part of the reason for having two houses of Congress is that it places an obstacle to majority rule .
Fifty - one senators can block the wishes of 435 representatives and 49 senators .
The Constitution gives the president a veto to thwart the power of 535 members of Congress .
It takes two - thirds of both houses of Congress to override the president 's veto .
In Federalist Paper No. 10 , James Madison wrote , " Measures are too often decided , not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party , but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority . "
That 's another way of saying that one of the primary dangers of majority rule is that it confers an aura of legitimacy and respectability on acts that would otherwise be deemed tyrannical .
Liberty and democracy are not synonymous and could actually be opposites .
Just published " THE FAMILY - The Real Story of the Bush Dynstasty " , by veteran highly controversial author , Kitty Kelley .
According to book industry sources , the publisher intends to issue and market one million copies of this book that is the lowdown of the Bushies .
The book details a number of stories long - since posted and archived , and publicly discussed by us on www.skolnicksreport.com and www.cloakanddagger.ca including stories co-authored by Sherman H. Skolnick and Lenny Bloom , as Middle - Finger News .
Also posted and archived through www.rense.com/Datapages/skolnickdatapage.html
Also widely discussed on radio talk shows by Skolnick and also jointly with co-host Lenny Bloom on internet radio worldwide www.cloakanddagger.ca as well as by Skolnick on numerous other radio talk shows U.S. , Canada , Australia , nnd Europe , over the last five years and more .
Mentioned in Kitty Kelley 's book following the already publicized independent investigations of Skolnick and his colleagues : === That George W. Bush cohabited at his Texas ranch and elsewhere with the Mayor of a major city in Tennessee , says Kitty Kelley .
Skolnick began the discussion severel years ago as a story about " The Pedophile / Homosexual Underground " .
www.skolnicksreport.com
" Overthrow of the American Republic " , Part 24 .
It relates to George W. Bush 's homosexual relationsip , since about puberty , with Victor Ashe , long - time Mayor of Knoxvillle .
When some in Congress began inquiries in the fall of 2003 , Ashe in December , 2003 , gave up being Knoxville Mayor and was appointed by George W. Bush , the occupant and resident of the White House , as the U.S. Ambassador to Poland .
That is , getting Ashe out of the U.S. jurisdiction , not available to nosey Congressmen .
Bush and Ashe are both members of the satanic cult , " Skull & Bones " , headquartered in a windowless building , called " The Tomb " on the campus of Yale University .
Part of the initiation procedure is for the new proposed member to divulge his entire sexual history , to several other Bonesmen , so that when he is shoved up into high office , government , finance , etc. , he can be blackmailed into silence .
The new member has to cavort , au naturel , sometimes more than once , with another Bonesman in a double - size coffin filled with mud .
An older Bonesman member has to also participate in such proceedings .
This was done by John F. Kerry slightly older than George W. Bush .
As mentioned in our stories and talk shows , the secret pictures of this , reportedly ended up in the possession of the picture editor of a group of magazines run by American Media , Inc. , AMI , headquartered in Boca Raton , Florida .
That editor was Bob Stevens .
Being of near - sighted vision , he took off his glasses and he opened up an envelope addressed to him , holding it close up to his face , breathing thus in spores of anthrax , from which he soon thereafter died .
In his public statements , Skolnick carefully discussed that he usually does not discuss sordid relations EXCEPT if they involved National Security .
In the Ashe / Bush matter , the Red Chinese Secret Police have used their knowledge of the matter to blackmail out of the Bush White House , U.S. MILITARY , financial , and industrial secrets , clearly warranting us publicizing the Ashe / Bush matter .
Further , Skolnick contended that Ashe and Bush met for sex at a Tennessee location owned by the purported top financier of Osama bin Laden .
That U.S. resident moneybags has been granted unlawful protection and immunity from exposure by the Bush White House .
The more than 500 that worked at AMI were evacuated , the building was closed up by America 's secret political police , about October 2001 , shortly after the 9 - 11 incidents .
The FBI did not permit any of the picture or text files to be removed .
Stevens ' widow , in a little - known lawsuit against the FBI , claimed the Bureau obstructed her from finding out what happened to her husband .
Rudolph Guiliani , once U.S. District Attorney in New York , later Mayor of New York City , founded and owns BioOne , specializing in cleaning up places made toxic by anthrax .
He bought the closed AMI building for a " song " and now has possession of the pictures that could scandalize his pal George W. Bush , and Bush 's male sex-mate , U.S. Senator John F. Kerry , " laying down and playing dead " while supposedly running for president against 3rd cousin and fellow Bonesman George W. Bush .
In her book , Kitty Kelley claims that , from her sources , Bush , facing embarrassment by the possible revelations of the pictures , arranged for secret U.S. agents to murder Bob Stevens .
===Skolnick in his posted and archived statements and on various radio talk shows , discussed how George H.W. Bush , that is Daddy Bush , has been in business with the co-founder of the Medelin , Colombia dope cartel , Carlos Lehder .
And that the link was covered up when the Bushies arranged to secretly remove from a U.S. Jail , Lehder , who has disappeared .
Numerous details are in the series , " The Chandra Levy Affair " , www.skolnicksreport.com
Kitty Kelley raises the issue of Bush , Sr. , being in dope trafficking through South America and elsewhere .
=== Because of George W. Bush 's homosexual relationships , and because his wife of convenience , Laura , was a reputed known and open lesbian since high school , and may be a dyke ; that George W. Bush may not be the actual father of the twin daughters .
Skolnick has raised these issues .
Now , in her book , Kitty Kelley raises the issue of the little - known relationship between Laura and General Tommy franks .
More coming .
Stay tuned ...

Guest Post by Mast Qalandar
In my last two posts on Islamabad ( here and here ) I talked about the woods and the forest trails that I love so much and take to them whenever I can .
In those woods , at the foot of the Margallas , until a few years ago , there was a very large and very old tree , believed to be several hundred years old .
Its gnarled branches sprawled like an umbrella over a very large area around the tree .
It was a pipal tree ( ficus religiosa ) .
Pakistani residents of Islamabad were generally unaware of the significance of this tree .
But the tree attracted many expatriate residents , mostly from South East or East Asian diplomatic missions in Islamabad .
They would come and simply contemplate the tree and its surroundings .
Someone had even a built a concrete kiosk and a concrete bench next to the tree for visitors to sit .
The tree was believed to be a Bodhi tree .
What is a bodhi tree and how it came to be in Islamabad ?
As many of us would remember from our history books , that is , if one graduated before the 1970s , for afterwards they stopped teaching history of pre-Muslim era of the subcontinent in schools , prince Siddhartha Gautuma meditated under an old pipal tree in Gaya , a village near Patna , Bihar , some 2,500 years ago .
Ultimately he achieved nirvana , or was â€œawakenedâ€ .
Consequently , the tree under which he sat was named Bodhi , meaning â€œawakening .
â€ Sidhartha Gautuma became Buddha ( the awakened ) and the village came to be known as Bodh Gaya , the name it still carries today .
The Bhodi tree that grows in Bodh Gaya today is believed to be a direct offspring of the original Bhodi tree .
In the centuries after Buddha , the Bodhi tree became a symbol of Buddhaâ€™s presence and an object of devotion for Buddhists .
A little more history before I get to the pipal tree in the woods of Islamabad .
King Ashoka ( died 232 BC ) , the third Maurian king , converted to Buddhism and became a great advocate of the religion and actively propagated Buddhism throughout his empire .
The Mauran Empire included , other than the present Northern India , the Gandhara region , which included the area around present day Islamabad , the Peshawar valley and parts of Afghanistan and Iran .
Taxila ( then Taxshashila ) , Peshawar ( then Parshpura ) and Charsaddah ( then Pushklavati ) were important cities of Gandhara .
It was at this time that Taxila reached the peak of its development and became the center of Buddhism .
Chandra Gupta Mauria and Asoka spent time at Taxila and so did their famous political adviser , Chanakya , who taught at Taxila .
King Asoka ’s daughter , Sanghamitra , who became a Buddhist nun , is said to have taken a cutting of the Bohdi tree from Bhod Gaya to Sri Lanka and planted it at Anaradapura , the ancient capital of the island , where it still grows .
Many temples throughout the Buddhist world have bodhi trees growing in them , which are or are believed to be offspring of the one from Anaradapura .
Now , back to Islamabad .
The old pipal tree that grew in the woods of Islamabad was also believed to be “ descendent ” of the Bodhi tree in Gaya , possibly planted , centuries ago , by a devotee , alongside a temple that might have existed there .
Taxila , as the crow flies , is only a few miles from Islamabad , and is full of Buddhist monuments – stupas , statues and remains of monasteries .
In the 1980s , Ziaul Haq ruled Pakistan .
In his zeal to â€ œIslamizeâ€  the country , he encouraged and helped build madrassas all over the country , many with Saudi money .
One such madrassa was built in the woods of Islamabad , not far from where the Bodhi tree stood .
Over the years , the madrassa expanded , as most madrassas do , violating the building codes and encroaching upon state land , to become one of the largest madrassas in Islamabad .
Today , it occupies 5 - 7 acres of prime real estate in Islamabad and has a sprawling building complex , and a very large playing field â€ “ probably larger than any school or college in Islamabad might have .
The madrassa houses a couple of thousand students ranging in age from 6 to 26 , or even older .
One sees them during breaks in their classes when they swarm into the playground and overrun the nearby childrenâ€™s park , driving the children and women out .
It is a bizarre sight to see young bearded men swinging and sliding on the swings and slides meant for children .
Other contributions of these madrassa students to the community are : street signs defaced with posters soliciting sacrificial animal skins , and vandalized letterboxes .
All these violations of civic rules would be a minor misdemeanor compared to what they did to the Bodhi tree one night .
They set it on fire !
A symbol of a different faith standing so close to the madrassa was something too defiant for the trainee clerics to tolerate .
What was really sad and frightening , though , was not just the loss of an old tree or the act of wanton vandalism but the mindset that wouldnâ€™t tolerate anything that did not fit into their pattern of beliefs .
I suppose , the madrassa students were simply replicating the example of the Taliban who , earlier that year , to the horror of the whole world , had blasted the 1500 years old Bamyan Buddhas , in Afghanistan .
Obviously , the Taliban virus had spread pretty wide and deep into Pakistan
Fortunately , because of its very large girth , the Bodhi tree did not burn down completely even though it was badly damaged .
It survived with half of its branches still intact .
The city administration tried to preserve what was left of the tree .
They even posted guards at the site for sometime after the incident to protect the tree from any further attacks .
When I saw it last , a few years ago , it was still green and seemed as if it was struggling to recover from the wounds inflicted upon it .
Last week , having returned to Islamabad after two years , I decided to look up the tree , as if you would look up an old friend , and see how it was doing .
I was shocked .
There was no tree there !
Only a few logs of the decapitated tree were lying around like dead bodies .
The concrete kiosk next to it was partially demolished , its remaining walls covered with graffiti , and the bench was gone .
Through the woods , I could also see the madrassa , some construction work going on it .
Still expanding , I guess .
No one knows , or is willing to say , how the tree finally perished .
Did it just die of its old age or past injuries , or was it chopped down by the same people who had tried to burn it down earlier ?

I dug out the group 's 2005 IRS return , which can seen here .
The group claimed on its signed tax statement to not have lobbied on a national , state or local issue to influence public opinion .
Yet , this 2005 article in the Chattanooga Times Free Press shows how that is not accurate , as it details the group lobbying the state to privatize or shut down public golf courses .
Golf courses are a key issue among elitist conservatives , you know .

HEADLINE : Group wants state out of golf business
BYLINE : Ian Berry , Staff Writer
Tennessee this month assumed control of four state - owned golf courses , including one at Harrison Bay State Park .
That brings the number of state courses to 12 , which one group says is 12 too many .
The Tennessee Center for Policy Research , a group that promotes conservative economic policies , has singled out the state courses as its " monthly misuse " for December .
The group said the courses are losing money and should be privatized or shut down .
" They honestly would be better as grazing land for deer , " said Drew Johnson , the group 's executive director ......
http://www.timesfreepress.com/...
The group also failed to fill out its top officers as required .
The IRS requires groups to list officers , directors and " key employees " such as the president and executive director .
The group 's 2005 tax return claims $ 104,908 in revenues and $ 76,673 in expenses , including roughly $ 5,000 for meals , $ 6,000 for " marketing , " $ 3,000 for travel , $ 3,000 for legal expenses - and only $ 18 for research materials and $ 24 for printing and publications .
So you have a supposed non-partisan " policy research " organization spending only $ 42 for publications and research materials as thousands are spent on food , travel and unspecified marketing and legal expenses .
That does n't sound like a legitimate non-partisan research institute to me .
WASHINGTON , Dec 12 : His role in the Iraq war and the practice of appointing cronies from the Republican Party to senior positions is catching up with World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz who faces an unprecedented rebellion inside his own office .
On Sunday , Mr Wolfowitz , former US deputy defence secretary , was heckled at a meeting in Atlanta , Georgia , where protesters called him a “ liar ” and a “ war criminal ” .
On Monday , news outlets across the United States flashed stories of a rebellion inside the World Bank headquarters close to the White House where Mr Wolfowitz , an architect of President George W. Bush ’s failed Iraq strategy , attended many meetings while planning the 2003 invasion of the Arab state .
Reports said that the bank ’s directors were upset with Mr Wolfowitz for appointing people with political connections but little experience in their relevant fields .
Mr Wolfowitz ’s policies , reports said , were driving away seasoned managers .
The World Bank media office , when asked for comments , promised to call back but never did .
“ I will not be able to get you comments immediately .
I will have to work with my colleagues , ” Amy L. Stilwell , the bank ’s media manager told Dawn .
Media reports claimed that half of the bank 's 29 highest - level executives have left since Mr Wolfowitz took office in June last year .
Among them is Christiaan Poortman , vice - president for the Middle East and a 30 - year veteran , who left in September after resisting pressure to speed up lending and adding staff in Iraq .
" It was very sad to see someone of Mr Poortman 's calibre leaving , " Eckhard Deutscher , one of 24 executive directors of the World Bank , told the Bloomberg news agency .
" The bank needs to be very careful not to lose too much of its human capital . "
Media reports said that the exodus is damaging the World Bank , which provided $ 23.6 billion last year for projects across the world .
The people Mr Wolfowitz brought to the bank include Robin Cleveland , who as associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget helped secure congressional funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He is now counsellor to the bank ’s president .
Kevin Kellems , a former spokesman for Vice - President Dick Cheney , was named director of external strategy .
Suzanne Rich Folsom , who joined in 2003 and is the bank 's chief anti-corruption executive , is married to George Folsom , who was principal deputy director of the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office and president of the International Republican Institute .
Mr Wolfowitz " has placed considerably more trust in a small group of outsiders from the Republican Party than in the seasoned experts in the bank " , said Alison Cave , head of the World Bank staff association .
On Sunday in Atlanta , the 62 - year old World Bank president confronted protesters who blamed him for misleading the American public during the run-up to the war .
Mr Wolfowitz was at Atlanta ’s Ahavath Achim Synagogue to speak about the relevance of Africa for Americans .
At one point a man stood up silently at the front of the audience wearing an orange jumpsuit , seen by protesters as symbolic of clothes worn by prisoners at the US jail at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
" You lied about the Iraq war !
You are a war criminal ! " shouted another woman as she was escorted from the synagogue .
Outside around 20 protesters held up signs condemning Mr Wolfowitz and the war .
Police escorted the protesters out of the synagogue .
They were told they would be arrested if they returned .
Later , during questions , Mr Wolfowitz defended the Bush administration ’s decision to go to war .
" When it comes to Iraq I think it is fair and accurate to say that we did not go to war for oil , " he said .
" The essential concern is to make difficult decisions about the security of the United States and that 's what they did , " he said .
Mr Wolfowitz said the World Bank is advising Baghdad on how to distribute its oil wealth .
" The biggest question that Iraq faces in many ways is ... policy decisions about public resource management , " he said .
Democrats , who will control Congress starting in January , have promised to conduct vigorous reviews of US policy on Iraq , including post - war reconstruction and stabilization .
Mr Wolfowitz , who was appointed president of the World Bank last year , could be called to testify .
The World Bank Information Centre , which has a special segment on its website called Wolfowitz Watch , notes that “ Mr Wolfowitz is regarded as one of the chief masterminds behind the war in Iraq and the policies directing US involvement .
Criticisms over his contribution to the debacle have come to the fore following the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld ” .
The posting suggests that “ Mr Wolfowitz should put the bank 's rhetoric around transparency and accountability into action by testifying should he be called to do so ” .
Another posting on the same website points out that “ Mr Wolfowitz ’s confirmation followed a selection process criticised by many as opaque , undemocratic and inappropriately dominated by the United States ” .
How do retirment accounts work ?
Most have n't given much thought to retirement .
If you want to know how you should handle retirement , read this article .
How does retirement work ?
For most people , it ’s like this : you reach a certain age and start thinking about spending your days on the golf course .
Then you look at your bank statement and freak out , and think about taking on a second job instead .
I want to be clear about something : I ’m sincerely interested in doing less and less work as I go through my life .
This is why retirement accounts – your 401 ( k ) and your Roth IRA – are one of the best investment tools I ’ll write about on this site .
Retirement accounts let you do less work .
All you have to do is start a retirement account NOW , which I ’ll show you exactly how to do .
Here ’s what we ’re going to cover in this beginner ’s guide to retirement accounts :

How do retirement accounts work : the magical benefits
Many people mistakenly think that retirement accounts are just places for you to save money until you ’re 65 .
Actually , they offer you humongous benefits if you agree to save for a long - term horizon .
Let ’s compare regular ( taxable ) investing accounts with how retirement accounts work .
Regular investing accounts vs. retirement accounts
Regular investing accounts .
When you open up an account at ETrade or whatever , you ’re generally opening up a regular investing account , which is also called a taxable account .
This means that when you sell your stocks , you ’ll pay taxes on your gains–and if you sell your stocks in less than a year , you ’ll pay a huge amount ( regular income - tax rates , like 15 % or 30 % ) .
Let ’s not get bogged down in the details , OK ?
As I ’ve written on this site , buy - and - hold investing wins over the long term .
And because of the way taxes are structured , you pay a penalty for trading too frequently .
See how the pieces fit together ?
It ’s paternalism at its best .
But there ’s an even stronger advantage to holding your money for longer–say , until retirement .
Retirement accounts .
Retirement accounts , quite simply , give you huge tax / growth advantages in exchange for your promise to save and invest for the long term .
Now , this does n’t mean that you have to hold the same stock for 30 years .
You can buy and sell shares of almost anything as often as you want .
But with a few exceptions , you have to leave the money in your account until you get near retirement age .
Here ’s how retirement accounts work , and where the magical benefits kick in .
In a retirement account , you get big tax benefits .
While 10 % or 20 % may not seem like much in 1 year , when you compound that over 30 years , it becomes a gigantic amount .
In fact , start a retirement account next week and two things will happen : ( 1 ) You will be more financially prepared than 99 % of your peers , and ( 2 ) you will be rich .
Yeah , I said it :
If you start a retirement account in your early 20s and fund it regularly , you will be rich .
Let ’s look at a simple comparison of investing in a retirement account vs. just investing in a regular , taxable account :
Image from Leggmason.com
Do n’t worry about the exact amounts .
Just notice the difference in how much you earn–especially at the end .
A retirement account–whether it ’s a Roth IRA , 401 ( k ) , or something else–lets your money grow at an accelerated rate with hardly any extra work from your end .
Now let ’s get into the details .
Bonus : I wrote a huge free guide to personal finance and how to manage your money that goes into even more detail on the strategies described here .
Understanding your 401( k ) – A beginner ’s guide
A 401(k ) is a type of retirement account .
If you work for a company , chances are you already have a 401 ( k ) offered to you .
Here ’s how a 401 ( k ) works :
You put pre-tax money into the account , meaning you have n’t paid taxes on it yet .
Let ’s look at why that ’s important .
In regular , taxable investing accounts , you pay taxes on your income and then invest it .
So for every $ 100 you make , you might actually only be able to invest $ 85 of it .
15 % ( or whatever , depending on your tax rate ) goes to the tax man .
A 401( k ) is different .
You can invest the entire $ 100 and let it grow for about 30 years until retirement .
That extra ~ 15 % turns out to make a huge difference as it gets compounded more and more .
401( k ) matches
There ’s an extra benefit , too : Your company might offer a 401 ( k ) match .
For example , a 1:1 match up to $ 2,000 means that your company will match every dollar you invest up to $ 2,000 ; therefore , investing $ 2,000 / year really means you ’re investing $ 4,000 / year .
Woah .
This is free money and you absolutely , positively need to participate if your employer offers a 401 ( k ) match .
It does n’t matter what kind of debt or expenses or whatever you have –if your company offers a match , do it .
So what exactly happens when you contribute money to your 401( k ) ?
Basically , it goes into an investing account where a professional investing company manages it .
You can choose from a bunch of different investing options , like aggressive , mixed , international , etc .
Honestly , it ’s like McDonald ’s for investors : anyone can do it .
The hardest part is making the first phone call to HR to get it set up .
Summary of 401 ( k ) advantages :
There are a lot
We ’ve covered the advantages of a 401 ( k ) account :
You get to put pre-tax money to work ( i.e. , money you have n’t paid taxes on yet , so there ’s more of it to grow ) .
Your company might offer an insanely lucrative 401 ( k ) match , which you must take .
And it ’s not that hard to set up –your company does most of the work .
In fact , you can instruct them to automatically withdraw a certain amount from every paycheck .
Do n’t worry about switching jobs ; if you leave your company later , you can take your 401 ( k ) with you .
And be aggressive with how much you contribute to your 401 ( k ) because every dollar you invest now is worth many more times that in the future .
Image from firsthandfunds.com
401 ( k ) restrictions
The 401 ( k ) is n’t tax - free , though .
There are a few restrictions .
First , the government has to get its tax revenue sometime , so you ’ll pay ordinary income tax on the money you withdraw around retirement age .
( Remember , though , that all that money has been growing “ tax - deferred ” for ~ 30 years . )
Second , you ’re currently limited to putting $ 19,000 / year in your 401( k ) .
Third , and this is important , you ’ll be charged a big penalty of 10 % if you withdraw your money before you ’re 59.5 years old .
This is intentional :
This money is for your retirement , not to go out drinking on Saturday .
Finally , there are some other esoteric restrictions , but you can read about them from some links I ’ll give you later .
Bonus :
Having more than one stream of income can help you through tough economic times .

You can get around the 401 ( k ) restrictions !
Not to get too complicated , but there are also exceptions to some of the above restrictions that let you withdraw your 401 ( k ) money penalty - free .
For example , if you ’re buying a house or a couple of other things , you can withdraw money penalty - free .
But for all intents and purposes , this is money you ’re putting away for 30 years .
401 ( k ) summary
$ 19,000 annual limit
Pre-tax money ( money is n’t taxed at the beginning ; it grows until you withdraw and is taxed at the end )
Company matches supercharge growth even more –this is free money you must take
Let ’s talk about dumb people and 401 ( k ) s in general
A lot of people are dumb .
Let ’s just have a look at some recent findings :
“ One out of four workers simply fails to sign up .
Only one in 10 contributes the maximum allowed .
Nearly half do n’t contribute enough to get the full company match .
Many take too much or too little risk , and most fail to rebalance their accounts to manage their risk .
About half cash out when they change jobs .
( Admittedly , this is a squishy statistic .
Hewitt Associates research says it ’s 42 % ; Munnell ’s research says 55 % . ) ”
Your company wants you to invest in your 401( k ) !
Yet many people still do n’t invest , or they invest poorly , or they invest too late in life .
Sorry , but we all need to take responsibility for this stupidity .
But they ’re not the only ones to blame .
Your employers and the 401 ( k ) companies make it insanely hard to understand what the hell a 401 ( k ) is , or how to get started .
Have you ever read one of their prospectuses ?
I have , and even though I do this stuff every day , I wanted to jump off a bridge while perusing the latest 401 ( k ) literature so maybe I could try to cram in some more time of reading that incomprehensible garbage .
You need all the help you can get with this stuff .
But there ’s even more blame to go around .
The stupid personal - finance media and pundits have overhyped everything money - related .
Unfortunately , now we just tune it out–even when it ’s good for us .
When was the last time you heard something about retirement accounts ?
Probably pretty recently , but you tuned it out because most of what ’s marketed to us is trash .
Finally , the government is a dismal failure at properly educating us on personal finance and retirement issues–even though it ’s in the government ’s interest .
Opening your 401( k )
I have to tell you that blaming everyone has a very satisfying quality to it .
I really enjoyed that .
But realize one thing :
Of all the parties I mentioned and want to scream at , the only one you can change is you .
Call up your HR representative on Monday and get enrolled in your 401( k ) .
Start an automatic - payment plan so money is taken directly from your paycheck .
Trust me , you ’ll learn to live without it .
And if you have questions , leave a comment on this post .
Understanding your Roth IRA – A beginner ’s guide
A Roth IRA is another type of retirement account .
Every person in their 20s should have a Roth IRA .
It ’s simply the best deal I ’ve found for long - term investing .
Remember how your 401 ( k ) uses pre-tax dollars and you pay income tax when you take the money out at retirement ?
Well , a Roth IRA is different than a 401 ( k ) .
A Roth uses after - tax dollars to give you an even better deal .
With a Roth , you put in already taxed income into stocks , bonds , index funds –whatever–and you do n’t pay when you withdraw it .
Here ’s how it works :
When you make money every year , you have to pay taxes on it .
With a Roth , you take this after - tax money , invest it , and pay no taxes when you withdraw it .
If Roth IRAs had been around in 1970 and you ’d invested $ 10,000 in Southwest Airlines , you ’d only have had to pay taxes on the initial $ 10,000 income .
When you withdrew the money 30 years later , you would n’t have had to pay any taxes on it .
Oh , and by the way , your $ 10,000 would have turned into $ 10 million .
Think about it .
You pay taxes on the initial amount , but not the earnings .
And over 30 years , that is a stunningly good deal .
Roth IRA restrictions
Again , you ’re expected to treat this as a long - term investment vehicle .
You are penalized if you withdraw your earnings before you ’re 59.5 years old .
( Exception :
You can withdraw your principal , or the amount you actually invested from your pocket , at any time , penalty - free .
Most people do n’t know this . )
There are also exceptions for down payments on a home , funding education for you / partner / children / grandchildren , and some other emergency reasons .
And there ’s a maximum income of $ 137,000 to make full contributions to a Roth ( updated in 2019 ) .
But you can read about those later .
What ’s the big takeaway from all those restrictions and exceptions ?
I see 2 things :
First , you can only get some of those exceptions if your Roth IRA has been open for 5 years .
This reason alone is enough for you to open your Roth IRA on Monday .
I want you to research it this weekend , and I want your Roth IRA opened by next week .
Second , starting early is crucial .
I ’m not going to labor the point , but every dollar you invest now is worth much , much more later .
Even waiting two years can cost you tens of thousands of dollars .
Currently , the maximum you ’re allowed to invest in your Roth IRA is 6,000 a year ( updated in 2019 ) .
I do n’t care where you get the money , but get it .
Put it in your Roth and max it out this year .
These early years are too important to be lazy .
Opening your Roth IRA
It ’s easy .
You can go through your current discount brokerage , like ETrade or Datek .
You can also go through an independent service like Vanguard .
Call them up , tell them you want to open a Roth IRA , and they ’ll walk you through it .
Special note :
These places have minimum amounts for opening a Roth IRA , usually $ 3,000 .
Sometimes they ’ll waive the minimums if you set up an automatic payment plan depositing , say , $ 100 / month .
Other times , you ’re out of luck .
Shop around .
Once your account is set up , your money will just be sitting there .
You need to do things then : First , set up an automatic payment plan so you ’re automatically depositing money into your Roth .
How much ?
Try doing as much as you ’re comfortable with , plus 10 % .
Second , decide where to invest your Roth money ; it can be in stocks , index funds , mutual funds , whatever .
Read my introductory articles for more on how to choose .
I also created a video about how to choose a Roth IRA .
Here ’s a quick illustration of the power of continually adding money to your investment account :
Image from hffo.cuna.org
Roth IRA links
401 ( k ) or Roth IRA : Which retirement account should you start ?
The simple answer is both :
These accounts , while conceptually different , work together pretty well .
Here ’s how I think about it .
First , I would max out any 401 ( k ) match that my company provides .
Second , I ’d max out the $ 6,000 for my Roth IRA .
Third , I ’d max out the rest of my 401 ( k ) , up to $ 19,000 .
Finally –if your employer does n’t offer a 401 ( k ) , you ’re not employed yet , or you still have money left over –I ’d open a regular , taxable investment account and put money there in stocks , index funds , etc .
Why max out your Roth before your 401( k ) ?
Well , there ’s a lot of dorky debate in the personal - finance world , but the basic reasons are taxes and tax policy :
Assuming your career goes well , you ’ll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire , meaning that you ’d have to pay more taxes with a 401 ( k ) .
Another common reason for the Roth is that tax rates are considered likely to increase .
Remember : Your 401 ( k ) money is taxed at the end , while Roth money is taxed right away and then grows tax - free .
What to do about your retirement accounts today
I want you to spend the weekend getting educated about 401 ( k ) s and Roth IRAs .
On Monday , I want you to open up your retirement accounts and start funding them .
Call your HR department and get your 401 ( k ) squared away .
Call a few discount - brokerage firms to get a Roth account , too .
Do n’t worry about where to invest your money just yet .
Take it one step at a time and just open your accounts .
Oh yeah , and one more thing : I already anticipate 1 billion comments debating fiscal policy , the effectiveness of Roth IRAs vs. 401( k ) vs. Keogh plans vs. SEP IRAs vs. Simple IRAs , and other crap .
Please do n’t waste your time on this minutiae .
The problem is not debating the tiny details .
The problem is that most people do n’t have retirement accounts .
The problem is that most people do n’t fund it as regularly as they should , even though $ 100 / month makes a big difference .
And the problem is that most people do n’t open retirement accounts early enough .
So let the fools debate .
For you , just get your accounts open .
Rich does n’t happen by accident
Lots of people believe that they ’ll just get rich somehow .
In fact , “ more than one in five Americans believe the best way to get rich is to win the lottery . ”
That ’s not a joke .
You need to think ahead .
And I do n’t just mean to retirement .
Are you going to need a car in a few years ?
A wedding ?
A honeymoon ?
A house ?
The money for that does n’t just appear .
Unfortunately , most people put off thinking about this stuff , which results in them wringing their hands , saying things like “ We ’re always struggling to make ends meet . ”
Some of them ( not all , but some ) got there because they did n’t plan for anything .
So get over the initial excuses .
Yes , it ’s hard to pick up the phone .
But think about what time you ’re living in .
Here you have a site with thousands of other readers who are in exactly the same boat as you–and even better , the experienced ones will help you through it .
Set up your retirement accounts now .
Your future self will thank you .

Nanotechnology propulsion technology for space exploration
( Nanowerk Spotlight )
Most of today 's rocket engines rely on chemical propulsion .
All current spacecraft use some form of chemical rocket for launch and most use them for attitude control as well ( the control of the angular position and rotation of the spacecraft , either relative to the object that it is orbiting , or relative to the celestial sphere ) .
Real rocket scientists though are actively researching new forms of space propulsion systems .
One heavily researched area is electric propulsion ( EP ) that includes field emission electric propulsion ( FEEP ) , colloid thrusters and other versions of field emission thrusters ( FETs ) .
EP systems significantly reduce the required propellant mass compared to conventional chemical rockets , allowing to increase the payload capacity or decrease the launch mass .
EP has been successfully demonstrated as primary propulsion systems for NASAs Deep Space 1 , Japans HAYABUSA , and ESAs SMART - 1 missions .
A new EP concept proposes to utilize electrostatically charged and accelerated nanoparticles as propellant .
Millions of micron - sized nanoparticle thrusters would fit on one square centimeter , allowing the fabrication of highly scaleable thruster arrays .
Field emission thrusters are not suitable for launching a spacecraft into orbit .
Their intended purpose is to provide attitude control and acceleration .
Orbiting spacecraft are subjected to a variety of forces while circling an object in space : drag , gravity , solar pressure and magnetic streams all must be compensated for in order to maintain the desired orbit .
The very low and highly controllable thrust levels provided by various electric propulsion technologies enable a new category of missions which otherwise would not be possible .
A new electrostatic thruster technology is under development at the University of Michigan 's Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory , using nanoparticles as propellant with micro- and nano - electromechanical systems ( MEMS / NEMS ) .
Termed the nanoparticle field extraction thruster – nanoFET – this highly integrated propulsion concept is a high efficiency , variable specific impulse engine type that can be readily scalable for a large range of future space science and exploration missions .
The nanoFET utilizes highly scalable MEMS / NEMS structures to feed , extract and accelerate nanoparticles through micron - sized thrusters .
The nanoparticles to be used as propellant can be of various geometries and materials .
nanoFET characteristic size scales ( Image : University of Michigan Department of Aerospace Engineering )
Here is how it works : Conductive nanoparticles would be transported to a small liquid - filled reservoir by a micro-fluidic flow transport system .
Particles that come into contact with the bottom conducting plate would become charged and pulled to the liquid surface by the imposed electric field .
If the electrostatic force near the surface can cause charged nanoparticles to break through the surface tension , field focusing would quickly accelerate the particles through the surface .
Once extracted , the charged nanoparticles would be accelerated by the vacuum electric field and ejected , thus generating thrust .
One intriguing aspect of nanoFET is that it uses MEMS / NEMS technology to enable a " flat - panel " thruster design that incorporates power processing as well as nanoparticle manufacture , storage , feed , extraction , and acceleration .
This results in a modular and geometrically scaleable propulsion system , from watts to megawatts , allowing the decoupling of thruster design from spacecraft design .
Another advantage of this system is that it affords a much broader set of missions with a single engine type – nanoFETs have an unprecedented thrust - to - power ratio for electric propulsion systems ; they can adjust specific impulse over a large range from 100s to 10,000s ; they show a high efficiency range of over 90 % over the entire specific impulse range ; they do not have the life - limiting factors common in ion thrusters .
The system is also very flexible with regard to the size and type of particles that can be used .
Almost any conductive nanoparticle , such as carbon nanotubes , fullerenes , as well as metal nanospheres and nanowires could be used .
Currently , the researchers are experimenting with silver , nickel and copper nanoparticles ranging in size from 5 nm to 70 nm .

One thing I miss about working at a large organization is watching the blame game get played out .
It always amazed me how much more effort went into explaining why a problem was n’t someone ’s fault ( and most certainly not his responsibility to solve ) than actually solving the problem itself .
The larger the issue got and the more experienced players that got involved , the chance of actually solving the problem became nil .
At a certain government agency -- whom I 'll call them the National Intelligence Bureau -- several different agents had been involved in a few “ high profile ” incidents of the international variety .
This resulted in a public outcry and strict orders from the top to rectify the problem .
As an IT contractor working for the NIB , G.R.G. had a chance to watch the whole thing play out from the inside .
The agents ’ superiors said that it certainly was n’t their fault ; the agents were n’t served well by the training department .
Training said that the training classes require competent students , and the agents involved should have never been hired by Human Resources .
Human Resources said that they use a “ perfectly objective ” hiring process and the issue certainly laid in the tests developed by the Testing department .
Testing assured everyone that the competency tests were just fine , but that the problem was in the test taking process ; ergo the Process Engineers were responsible .
The Process Engineers agreed , not because it was their fault , but because the test taking process was completely manual .
It was the 1980 ’s after all , and everything was becoming automated .
G.R.G.’s team was brought in to automate the pre-hire competency testing process .
The computer system they would develop would most certainly solve the problem of the unusually high competency test scores for certain “ seemingly incompetent ” agents .
Of course , due to the highly classified nature of the tests and the process , they could only be shown things first hand .
G.R.G. met with a “ specially trained ” test - giver so that he could be led to the special testing building and into the special testing room to review the special tests .
As the process dictated , the test - giver handed G.R.G. the booklet and left the room .
The first thing that G.R.G. noticed was how poorly written the multiple - choice questions were : the second question had no correct answer ; the third required basic knowledge of ocean tides and lunar cycles ; the fifth assumed that the test taker knew what color public mailboxes were ; and so on .
But clearly G.R.G. was wrong ; the testing department already certified and approved their competency test .
G.R.G. then wondered if the test - takers had talked amongst themselves , pooling their knowledge in some way .
After all , the test - giver does not stay in the room while the tests are given .
But clearly G.R.G. was wrong ; there was a large sign in the room that read “ no talking during the test . ”
Flipping through the pages , G.R.G. thought that the test - takers might have simply gotten a copy of the answer sheet .
What else could explain the high test scores on such an impossible test ?
G.R.G. walked over to the cabinet where the booklets were stored and checked it out .
The cabinet was built into a small alcove and consisted primarily of a crude , unfinished plywood door .
The carpenter who built it must have been the lowest bidder , as the door was slightly crooked , fastened with two giant barndoor hinges , and was about three - inches too small on each side .
Though there was a padlock on the door , one could simply reach his hand through the gap and take one of the answer booklets .
But clearly G.R.G. was wrong ; the test and answer booklets were numbered and were always accounted for prior to validating test scores .
And then G.R.G. noticed something below the cabinet : a Xerox Model 9200 that could copy 240 pages per minute and required no access card or money to be deposited .
It seemed to be the perfect way to cheat on such a test .
But clearly G.R.G. was wrong ; human resources had already verified the integrity of candidates and knew they were n’t the cheating type .
In the end , G.R.G. and his team ended up building the automated testing system .
There were a lot of hurdles along the way -- one of the big ones being that it had to run on a 3.66 Mhz CP / M system with 64 K memory -- but they managed .
For some reason though , it did n’t seem to solve the NIB ’s competency dilemma .
Years later , unusually high test scores were still rampant and agents still found themselves involved in awkward international incidents .
G.R.G. did n’t stick around long enough to know if the problem was ever solved , but last he heard , someone was hard at work on figuring out who could best solve the problem .
A romance scam essentially occurs when a stranger sweeps you off your feet ( or tries to ) and worms his / her way into your affections with the sole intention of laying their hands on your money / bank account or by getting you to commit financial fraud on their behalf .
Most of these scams seem to originate from , and are prevalent in West Africa ( especially Nigeria ) although they are becoming increasingly common in Russia and Eastern Europe .
Another emerging region is Thailand and The Phillipines or any other country where ' mail order ' brides are available .
Although they both involve sending money , typically to Nigeria , romance scams are very different from " advance fee fraud " ( or 419 as it is called ) .
Your typical 419 scam uses greed to lure the victims by inviting them to share in money that they do not really deserve .
Ostensibly , the money belongs to a deposed dictator , or a wealthy businessman who has no known heirs or even to a dying reclusive miser who has seen the error of his ways .
Whatever the story , they need your help to get the money abroad otherwise it will be forfeited to the government .
All they need is your bank account and identity details to facilitate payment .
Once baited the scammer will introduce all sorts of hurdles that require various sorts of fees , costs , and taxes to enable the transfer of the millions of dollars that they are promising .
The key motivator for the victim in this case is greed .
Romance Scams , on the other hand , rely on creating strong emotional ties that by - pass logical thought and appeal strongly and exclusively on emotions ie love .
These feelings are triggered by using appealing photos , dream profiles on dating sites , persuasive and flattering words , poetry and love song lyrics .
The strategy is essentially to get you to fall in love / lust so strongly that you want to be with them right now and forever .
The promise of marriage is very common in this con because they know that no one will refuse to do a small favour for their ' wife ' or ' husband ' .
Marriage ( or the promise of it ) also increases the element of trust and the resulting mind control .
The key motivator for the victim is love and romance .
Of course the motivation for the perpetrator in all cases remains greed .
Grooming
The scammers target their victims by posting fake profiles on multiple dating sites .
Anyone looking for love on the internet is at risk because scammers are known to target every sort of dating site including niche sites like religious , gay , professional , etc .
They will target marks from any race , sexual orientation , nationality , age and location but prefer middle aged men or women looking for long term relationships because they are more likely to have higher incomes , more assets and might be more desperate to attract a potential mate .
In all cases however , all that the scammers are concerned about is that potential victims are willing and ready to open their hearts ( and later , their wallets ) to them .
The insidious and callous nature of the perpetrators is exposed by discovering that there have been cases of wheelchair bound victims on disability allowance who have been conned by being led to believe that someone loves them deeply and wants to marry them .
It is harsh to be not only be fleeced , but to be left broken - hearted and many victims end up suffering massive loss of self - esteem .
Although they target both men and women , almost all the scammers are actually men who pose as women in order to seduce their male victims .
They are able to do this because there are typically more men than women who post profiles on dating sites and also because most of the communication is done via email and instant messaging .
However , if and when they need to , the scammers will hire a female voice to talk to their male vitims .
They tend to hide behind stolen photographs , normally of attractive professional models .
The fraudsters will usually claim to be from the USA or the UK ( if English ) and other Western Europe countries for other languages .
The scammers claim to be going abroad or are already working abroad ( mainly Nigeria ) on some short term project .
Mostly , they will claim to be engineers , IT professionals , pilots , models or any other glamorous or high flying career .
They use highly scripted profiles on the dating sites that are designed to be very smooth and alluring .
It does not matter if the dating site is an ' exclusive ' one that tries to keep out ' undesirables ' by charging a high fee because the scammers will pay for membership using a stolen credit card .
Should they spot a desperate sounding or naive profile , the scammers will create a ' tailor - made ' profile designed to target that unsuspecting victim in particular .
They seek to quickly establish contact and rapport and move you away from the moderated forums and chat rooms so that they can ' work ' you .
This goes progressively from email , instant messaging , telephone calls and finally web cam ( especially important to verify that the victim is real ) .
Bearing in mind that the photos that they posted are not really theirs , they will never reveal themselves on web cam and usually blame this on the dilapidated state of the internet in West Africa .
The scammers then set about establishing intimacy by using pet names and many times claim that fate or even a higher power has pre-ordained the romance .
Almost always , they use free email services especially Yahoo or Hotmail , which should be a dead give away .
They quickly declare love and express a strong desire to be physically present with their victims .
The scammers are very devoted and dote on their victims , sending romantic and flirtatious messages sometimes up to 20 times a day .
They never give their victims an opportunity to forget them as they bombard them with plagiarized poetry and lyrics from romantic love songs .
Many times they will send their victims romantic and thoughtful gifts such as flowers , candy , expensive chocolate , lingerie and even birthday presents for the victim 's children , all purchased with stolen credit cards .
The scammers ( who commonly work in groups of up to 6 people ) tend to be very good judges of character and know which buttons to push and will say things that make their victims fall very deeply in love .
The grooming period typically lasts up to 4 months but it is not unheard of for victims to be prepared for 12 or more months .
It all depends on the skill of the ( team of ) scammer (s ) and the ' desperation ' of the victim to find love .
The grooming period ends when the scammer successfully proposes to his / her intended victim and the victim starts thinking of a wedding ceremony taking place in the forseeable future .
The victim is all primed up and in their minds this is the end of an often long quest to find happiness .
The scammers are very good at building and exploiting their victims dreams and ambitions and use these to ingratiate themselves .
They are very supportive of their victims dreams , be they simply settling down and raising a family to cycling across the sahara desert or to pursuing a career .
Nothing is too much for the scammer who now appears to be the perfect partner because they are so thoughtful , supportive and considerate .
The victims cannot be convinced that their beloved is not the most wonderful , loving and supportive man / woman in the world .
Little do they know that that this is just the begining of their worst nightmare .
The scam kicks in
The extortion phase of the con begins once the perpetrator is certain that he can exercise a certain amount of mind control based on the feelings of love that he has established and nutured .
At this point , the scammer is still claiming to be abroad temporarily on an international job / assignment / project or assignment and cannot wait to finish it so that they can be together .
Unfortunately , for a whole range of reasons , the scammer does not have sufficient cash to make the trip to be together with his / her partner .
Many times , there is no request for direct financial assistance and all that the scammer requests is for his beloved to help overcome the problem by doing them a ' small favour ' to help facilitate the trip .
Key to the scam is the fact that the victim by this stage is ready to do anything to have their ' partner ' by their side and the ' favour ' is an innocent sounding request to cash a cheque / postal order for them .
The scammers normally claim that these are work related cheques that they have n't been able to cash due to the different banking system in Nigeria , but they can also take the form of ' someone owes me money ' or ' a client wishes to pay me in dollars not local currency ' variety .
In all these scenarios the victim will receive what are in fact expertly forged or stolen cheques that will eventually get rejected by the isssuing banks .
Whatever the story , the scammer ensures that he scores brownie points by asking the victim to keep a share of the cheque for themselves .
This not only reinforces the feelings of love and trust within the victim but also serves to incriminate the victim thereby reducing any chance of reporting to the authorities because in the eyes of the law the victim becomes an accomplice by keeping a portion of the stolen money .
For example , the scammer may send the victim a forged or stolen cheque worth $ 4,000 and ask the victim to retain $ 800 for themselves and to forward the remaining $ 3,200 to Nigeria via a telegraphic money transfer service , usually Western Union or Moneygram .
The scammers like to use these services because it is impossible to trace the recepients of the money .
The problem ( for the scammer ) with this method is that once the victim cashes the first cheque , the scammer is then in a race against the clock .
This is because the bank is sure to get in touch with the victim to alert them about the stolen / forged cheques that they deposited .
The banks will then often freeze the victims account or demand immediate payment or threaten to involve the authorities .
The scammer knows that the victim is unlikely to cash any more cheques once the lie is exposed and so they try to make the victim cash as many cheques as they can before the banks discover the bad cheques and start demanding repayment .
The time period will depend on individual banks but generally varies between a few weeks to a few months .
This is therefore a one hit affair and the scammer expects to receive one or two large sums and then nothing at all after that .
For this reason , some scammers prefer to have many small but frequent transfers spread over a longer time because they can make more money that way .
These small ( er ) amounts of money are necessary in order to solve some minor problems that are standing in the way of the the two lovers finally meeting up .
The tales that the scammers spin are constantly evolving but some of the more common ones are listed below .
Common variations
Although sending their victims forged or stolen bankers or postal drafts and cheques and / or money orders are the most common methods of pulling off the scam , there are other methods that scammers use to extract money from their victims .
The scammers are constantly ' innovating ' but the common thread between these and any others not mentioned below is that they prevent the two lovers from being reunited and need a modest amount of money to resolve the problem so that the two lovers can finally be together .
Nigeria and needs urgent medical attention for his life to be saved .
The victim is contacted by a hospital ' adminstrator ' because the patient ( scammer ) is in a coma or unconcious .
They will inform the victim that they found a notebook in his baggage which has listed the victim as next of kin and as such the victim needs to pay for medical treatment .
Without this medical attention , the ' patient ' is sure to die .
The scammer falls seriously ill or is seriously injured in a car crash while inand needs urgent medical attention for his life to be saved .
The victim is contacted by a hospital ' adminstrator ' because the patient ( scammer ) is in a coma or unconcious .
They will inform the victim that they found a notebook in his baggage which has listed the victim as next of kin and as such the victim needs to pay for medical treatment .
Without this medical attention , the ' patient ' is sure to die .
Sometimes they use a more direct route and simply ask their victims to ' lend ' them the money to be able to purchase a ticket or to be able to cover departure tax always promising to repay the money once they are finally together .
The scammer may claim that they have been mugged and / or have lost their wallets .
The scammer can claim to have an unpaid hotel bill and that they being held hostage by the hotel manager or their passports or other documents have been confiscated .
The scammers will desperately plead for money to settle the hotel bill promising to repay the money when the two love birds finally meet .
Nigeria will not allow them to leave with the cheque .
Again , the victim becomes a potential suspect in money laudering and / or an accomplice in criminal theft .
Sometimes , the scammer will ask the victim to open a bank account in the victims name or to cede control of an existing account so that the perpetrator can deposit a large cheque .
The commonest excuse is that the scammer wants to start a business to guarantee their future finacial status but the authorities inwill not allow them to leave with the cheque .
Again , the victim becomes a potential suspect in money laudering and / or an accomplice in criminal theft .
Nigeria .
This is because many businesses in the world will not ship goods directly to Nigeria until full payment is received by their banks .
A credit card in the hands of a Nigerian scammer is virtually worthless because no merchant will agree to send goods to Nigeria , but by using his victims address ( normally in the USA or Western Europe ) he is able to order huge amounts of high value electronic goods using the stolen credit cards .
He then arranges for either the victim or an ' associate ' to pick them up the following day and ship them to the scammer in Nigeria where they will be sold .
Obviously , when the credit card company fails to honour the payment , the merchant pursues the victim for the goods or the money .
The victim becomes responsible for the bill because the goods were delivered to their address .
Scammers frequently ask their victims to reship goods for them to .
This is because many businesses in the world will not ship goods directly tountil full payment is received by their banks .

Eastern European scammers tend to use the guise of mail order bride agencies to scam their victims .
Like their Nigerian counterparts , the lady in question is incredibly attractive and a rapport is quickly established and the lady declares the victim to be her dream partner .
Before long there is a desire to meet up to test ' compatibility ' but the victim needs to pay for her passport , visa and ticket before she can come over to be with him .
Needdless to say , even after stumping up all this money she will never materialise and the victim is left with an empty wallet and an aching heart .
Not a common variation of the scam - some scammers will ask you to take cash advances on your credit cards , then offer to pay off the balances for you , of course you have to give them your credit card and security information .
They will pay on the card , but not the entire balance , so you will accrue a very high interest rate on the remaining balance and advance .
Finally , the scammers purchase high value goods off e-bay or similar services and have the victims pay for them by sending money to diverse locations through out the world .
In this way the scammer is able to receive high value goods sent to them and erase a paper trail .
The End
Whatever form the scam takes , the scammer will keep trying to make as much money as they can until the victim cannot afford to send any more or until the victim realize that their ' spouse ' will never come and that they are being conned .
It is common then for the scammer to terminate the relationship himself because he knows that the victim is unlikely to send any more money and he would rather deal with a more ' productive ' victim .
Many times however , it is the authorities knocking on their door ( with threats of imprisonment ) that alerts many victims to the fact that they have been taken in .
At this point , the victims go through a whole range of emotions - the first and strongest usually being shock .
Many victims will often feel ' numb ' , then feel embarassed for being taken in .
Most victims then feel violated , angry , worthless and even depressed .
In recognition of the emotions that the victims will often go through , two former victims of these romance scams ( Theresa Smalley and Barb Sluppick ) got together and formed a support group ( http://groups.yahoo.com/group/romancescams) that aims to " help any victim of a romance scam heal by providing a safe haven , free of criticism and judgement and to protect future potential victims by educating as many people as possible . "
They also provide practical and useful advice to victims on how they may protect themselves from further legal complexities and financial exposure .
Size of the Problem
Romance scams have become the natural successor of advance fee fraud activities .
This is because many people in the West are much more aware of the typical 419 type scam ; the returns are a lot better with romance scams which are relatively unknown and appeal to love and romance rather than greed .
The romance scammers can make more money by skimming smaller amounts from thousands of victims rather than one large sum from very few victims .
So , instead of milking $ 30,000 from one victim in a ' normal ' 419 scam , romance scammers find it much easier to make $ 1,500 from 20 victims .
The US State Department reported in 2004 that Nigerian email scam constituted the biggest consumer fraud threat on the internet .
As of 2004 , there were 8.4 Million fully paid subscribers to over 1,000 internet dating sites .
In fact , 1 % of all internet activity is dating and romance related .
The market was worth $ 516 million in 2005 .
On many dating sites , up to one third of all profiles are fake , thus ensuring that any user who communicates with just two other members runs a real risk of coming into contact with these scammers .
Assuming just a 1 % response rate , then there were at least 84,000 people who each stood to loose a relatively modest $ 1,000 each .
The total losses in this scenario work out to be more than $ 84 million , and that is in just in 2004 alone .
Now , consider that this frightening amount of $ 84 M is based on just a 1 % rate - the grim reality is that the actual response rates are closer to 10 % and the average losses are more than $ 2,500 per victim .
It is not a wonder then , that email fraud is Nigeria 's 5th largest ' export ' and the only source of income for millions of educated but unemployed 18 - 45 year olds in Nigeria .
And this situation will only get worse in the future because these huge sums of money ( and the associated glamour ) attract more and more people to the scamming ' industry ' in a country where the average wage for a person in formal employment is between $ 50 and $ 70 per month .
Indeed , there are thousands of reports of people leaving formal jobs to become ' yahoo - yahoo boys .
The Internet Crime Complaint Centre ( a US government funded research organization ) reported 207,449 Nigerian fraud complaints resulting in losses of $ 68 Million in 2004 alone .
These figures , however , are very conservative because many victims never report these types of crimes to the authorities .
Many victims are too embarrassed to speak , fear that they may be arrested , the associated bureaucracy ( so many forms and departments ) or do n't bother when they realize that the FBI cannot apprehend the Nigerian - based scammers ( so why report ? ) .
Taking these factors into consideration , then the $ 2,200,000 ( yes ! $ 2.2 M ) loss that 243 members of Yahoo RomanceScams group reported ( an average of $ 9,000 + per victim as of May 2006 ) seems to be a more accurate and reliable figure and a true indicator of the size of the problem .
It is in recognition of the threat that these Nigerian ( and other ) scammers pose to the internet - using public that led federal law enforcement agencies to launch a website ( http://www.lookstoogoodtobetrue.com) to help combat these cyber outlaws .
Scams & Swindles : Phishing , Spoofing , ID Theft , Nigerian Advance Schemes Investment Frauds : How to Recognize And Avoid Rip -Offs In The Internet Age
While useful in its day , the JavaScript and PHP techniques discussed here have been made obsolete ( as anticipated by the article itself ) by the CSS nth - child pseudo - selectors .
Ever since CSS hit the big time , the table has become increasingly rare .
Semantic markup and CSS have replaced tables as layout tools .
Tables are now relegated to their original role : displaying data stored in records ( rows ) and fields ( columns ) .
Article Continues Below
However , their new status does n’t mean that they still ca n’t be the targets of a designer ’s styles and a developer ’s hacks .
A table typically presents more information than the rest of the page in a much smaller area , and much effort has been spent in attempting to make tables and other data visualizations as easy to interpret as possible .
The web designer ’s and developer ’s toolbox of the DOM , CSS , and JavaScript can aid in this effort .
This article will take a look at how a simple method of altering a table ’s appearance can alter the ease with which its information is interpreted , and along the way , we ’ll take a look at how it is possible to mimic some of CSS3 ’s power through some old - fashioned JavaScript and the DOM .
Zebras and tables and cells , oh my#section2
Take a peek at the following screen - capture ( anyone who has used iTunes will instantly recognize its origin ) :
The stripes , alternating between white and light blue , serve two purposes :
They ’re aesthetically pleasing .
They guide the reader ’s eye , allowing the reader to piece together the bits of information that belong to a particular song .
While the latter reason may not be noticable in the above image , take a look at these images to gain an idea of how useful the stripes become when the gap between the two columns is much larger .
In the event that you employ a liquid layout for a site , you may end up with the situation shown in the above comparison : columns are separated by large amounts of whitespace , making it difficult to jump from one column to the next .
Let ’s see if we ca n’t remedy the problem .
Solution # 1 : the usual suspect #section3
Re-creating the stripe effect in an XHTML table is pretty easy : we simply alternate background colors for the cells in the even and odd rows .
This can be easily achieved by creating two CSS classes ( one for even rows , the other for odd ) and then binding them to the appropriate rows .
A simple example of this method follows :
< html > < head > < title > tables </ title > < style type =" text/css " > # playlist tbody tr.even td { background - color : #eee ; } #playlist tbody tr.odd td { background - color : # fff ; } </style > </ head > < body > < table id =" playlist " > < tbody > < tr class = " odd " > <!-- cells go here --> </tr> < tr class= " even " > <!-- cells go here --> </tr> < tr class= " odd " > <!-- cells go here --> </tr> < tr class= " even " > <!-- cells go here --> </tr> </tbody > </ table > </ body > </html >
Because there are only two possible holes for this pigeon ( even / odd ) , we can get away with applying only one class , and assume that rows without a class declaration must fall into the the other hole :
< html > < head > < title > tables </ title > < style type =" text /css " > # playlist tbody tr td { background - color : #eee ; } #playlist tbody tr.odd td { background - color : # fff ; } </style > </ head > < body > < table id =" playlist " > < tbody > < tr class = " odd " >
<!-- cells go here --> </tr> < tr> <!-- cells go here --> </tr> < tr class= " odd " > <!-- cells go here --> </tr> < tr> <!-- cells go here --> </tr> </tbody > </ table > </ body > </html >
Pretty simple , no ?
After compacting the white space in the second example , we ’ll have saved our visitors and server even more bytes in precious bandwidth .
However , we still run into the same inherent problems as our first example ; one may cause you to pull out your hair , while the other is relatively trivial to work around .
Let ’s take a look - see .
Problem # 1 : manual labor#section4
The purpose of stylesheets , whether it be on the web via CSS or in an application such as Adobe InDesign is to control the visual properties of elements contained within a document .
And while CSS ’s selectors allow you to specify which document elements should have which styles applied , the above solution requires the author to apply the appropriate class ( either even or odd ) to atleast half of the rows in a table .
While this is n’t a problem if the table contains only a few rows , copying and pasting gets old very quickly when the table contains tens or hundreds of rows .
This problem can be avoided when the table is generated on the server side , since modifications to the table ’s markup require only the editing of a few lines of code .
But not every web page is built by a server - side application , and even if you are creating a web app , it is frequently desirable to off - load layout processing to the client through CSS and JavaScript .
Problem # 2 : row consistency #section5
If you move rows around within the table while authoring the page , chances are that you ’ll end up with a sequence of two or more rows with odd or even classes following each other , which will cause your nice stripes to be transformed into a mess of random lines .
Correcting the attributes can prove to be tedious when there are many rows in the table .
So what ���s a web developer to do ?
Eventually CSS3 ’s pseudo - selectors will resolve this problem ; however , browser support for CSS3 is currently sketchy at best .
Solution # 2 : open your toolbox#section6
However , there is another solution to our problem .
The odd / even method mentioned above uses pure CSS ; it ’s time to put away the hammer and try the other tools in our belt : JavaScript and the DOM .
Instead of manually binding CSS classes to the appropriate rows , we ’ll use a pinch of JavaScript to walk through the table and apply CSS styles .
Let ’s take a look at the recipe :
Obtain a reference to the table that we want to add stripes to .
With that in hand , drill down into the table ’s child elements to find all the < tr > s that are contained within < tbody > elements .
Loop through the < td > s and apply the appropriate styling ( which is determined by the location of this < tr > in the table ) .
Season to taste .
While it sounds pretty simple in theory , it is almost as easy in practice .
Honest .
The following is our tasty morsel that accomplishes exactly what we need ( and scores bonus points for being documented ) .
View the script .
Let ’s see how it turned out .
This method comes with two advantages :
We can now use classes for more specific uses in the table ( using the iTunes metaphor , for example , we can indicate whether the track is enabled or disabled , or if it ’s currently selected ) .
We are now able to automatically add stripes to tables in any page that has the stripe ( ) function included ; we simply need to invoke the function with the table ’s id as an argument at some point in the page .
And while our tasty morsel does require a bit of preparation when compared to our first solution , the code is straightforward and easy to customize .
And once it ’s in your toolbox , you ’ll never have to look at it again .
On 15 December 2006 , Nate Anderson posted a piece on the online journal Ars Technica entitled " Are iPods shrinking the British vocabulary ? "
In it , Anderson reports on research by Lancaster University linguistics professor Tony McEnery .
According to the Ars Technica report :
McEnery found that one - third of most teenage speech was made up of only 20 common words like " yeah , " " no , " and " but . "
This is problematic for teenagers seeking jobs in the corporate world , where at least some level of professionalism is required when communicating with others .
The report finds that " technology isolation syndrome " is part of the problem .
Teenagers spend increasing amounts of time immersed in television , video games , and music from their iPods - activities where they listen rather than speak .
As a result , they do n't get much practice at communicating clearly with others , and they are n't exposed to a wide vocabulary .
This appears , on first blush , to be very striking news .
Are iPods , television , and video games destroying young Briton 's ability to communicate ?
Are teenagers ' vocabularies shrinking ?
Probably not .
A striking aspect of the Ars Technica report is that it does not link to McEnery 's work at Lancaster University .
Instead , it refers to a similarly alarmist report from BBC News .
The unnamed reporters from the BBC appear to have interviewed Professor McEnery , and to have consulted a press release from Lancaster University .
According to the BBC report , teens have an average vocabulary of about 12,600 words , compared to about 21,400 words for young adults aged 25 - 34 .
Of particular interest to the BBC reporters is this claim attributed to McEnery : " [ The words ' no ' and ' but ' ] occur in the sequence ' but no ' or ' no but ' almost twice as frequently in teenage speech as it does in young adult or middle aged speech . "
These collocations are of interest since they are used to parody British teen speech in the television program " Little Britain " .
The BBC reporters can thus provide ' scientific proof ' that the parody reflects reality .
They quote linguist McEnery as saying , " When things are funny it is because they ring true with people . "
What , then , should we make of the claims presented by Ars Technica and the BBC ?
Let me take what I see to be three central claims , each in turn .
1 . One third of most teenage speech is made up of twenty common words .
This claim is probably true .
If so , however , it is utterly unremarkable .
As early as 1935 , George Kingsley Zipf noted that the most frequent word types in a natural language account for the majority of word tokens .
( In corpus linguistics , type refers to the general category - say , every instance of the word the - while token refers to one instance of the type . )
Zipf 's law states that the most frequent word will occur twice as often as the second most frequent , which will occur twice as often as the fourth most frequent , and so on .
It is not surprising , then , that a small number of word types accounts for most of the tokens produced .
In fact , in collections of English speech and writing such as the Brown Corpus or the British National Corpus the top twenty words usually account for about a third of all words in the corpus , depending , among other things , on how you define " word " .
Linguists Mark Liberman , Geoff Pullum , and Arnold Zwicky have recently written quite a lot about the treatment of this non-story by the BBC in their blog , Language Log , including a response from Tony McEnery .
I 'll say no more about it here .
2 . Teens have an average vocabulary of 12,600 words , compared to 21,400 words for adults .
This is a very difficult question to address given the difficulty of defining vocabulary and words .
What does it mean to have an item in one 's vocabulary ?
Does recognizing it in context ( called passive vocabulary ) count ?
Or must one be able to speak or write it ( called active vocabulary ) ?
The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language ( Crystal 1995 ) refers to an apparently unpublished study in which three subjects , an office secretary , a business woman , and a university lecturer , estimated their active and passive vocabularies by marking the number of headwords in an unspecified dictionary that they used and recognized .
The three subjects had estimated active vocabularies of 31,500 , 63,000 , and 56,250 words , and passive vocabularies of 38,300 , 73,350 , and 76,250 words each .
It seems clear that McEnery 's methods must have differed from that used in this study .
It may seem easy enough simply to count the number of words each subject uses or recognizes .
However , this assumes that words are discretely defined , which is not the case .
A single lexeme ( the minimal unit of a lexicon ) may have multiple forms .
The lexeme GO , for instance , has the forms go , goes , gone , and went .
Does this count as one word , or four ?
It 's not clear how McEnery defined these issues for the purpose of his research .
The press release from Lancaster University describing McEnery 's study , though , provides a very sensible analysis of the reported difference in vocabulary sizes .
According to the statement , " The research clearly demonstrated that teenagers are still developing their oral communication skills , underlining the need to ensure that they are given appropriate support by schools in doing so . "
In other words , those who are currently undertaking secondary education know less than those who have completed high school or even college .
This seems utterly commonsensical , though it will probably attract fewer readers than claims that contemporary young people are failing to live up to the standards achieved by their elders .
3. " Technology isolation syndrome , " caused by over - use of television , video games , and iPods , is part of the problem .
This is the issue that first got linguistic anthropologists - or at least , some contributors to this blog - interested in the claims .
Alexandre Enkerli suggested that the Ars Technica piece presented a reductionist form of linguistic determinism .
Enkerli noted that coverage of the study seemed to reiterate tired ' kids these days ' discourses without using the study " as an opportunity to see the actual connections between technological developments , social changes , and language change . "
It seems that press coverage not only played up the technology angle - it introduced it .
As with other elements of this story , " technology isolation syndrome " appears to originate not from any academic study , but from the 12 December BBC piece .
The Lancaster University press release makes no mention of the supposed syndrome , and it is not mentioned in any academic studies I can find .
A Google search for " technology isolation syndrome " finds fewer than 400 references , all apparently variants of the BBC piece .
None of these reports is very close to descriptions of the study by Lancaster University News or Tony McEnery .
( The research itself was carried out for a private sponsor and is confidential . )
In fact , it appears that only one source , the BBC , had any direct contact with McEnery or his research .
The other sources , mostly technology - related blogs , relied on the BBC report .
That report contains several quotes from McEnery , which reflect a desire to improve the teaching of speech in British schools .
As the story has moved to technology - blogs , this focus on the teaching of spoken English has largely disappeared .
Instead , one off - hand comment gets all the press : " This trend , known as technology isolation syndrome , could lead to problems in the classroom and then later in life . "
Nowhere does McEnery mention television , video games , or iPods .
The original study was , however , based on a corpus of speech ( 10,000,000 words ) plus writing in blogs ( 100,000 words ) .
This may be the slim foundation on which the edifice of " technology isolation " reporting rests .
According to McEnery , " [ The ] work itself was widely misrepresented in the press .
I wrote a study looking at difference and , predictably , the press translated that into a discourse of deficiency . "
He directs interested parties to the Lancaster press release , which he says is " something closer to the spirit of the original report . "
According to that press release :
New research by Professor Tony McEnery of the Department of Linguistics and English Language argues that it is important that we remember that teenagers are still developing their linguistic skills not merely in reading and writing , but also in oral communication .
Schools need to focus on the development of speaking skills just as much as they need to focus upon the development of reading and writing .
...
Professor McEnery 's research looked at the communication skills of 200 teenagers with an examination of 10,000,000 words of transcribed , naturally occurring speech from across the UK collated in a language database as well as 100,000 words of data gathered from blogs written by teenagers .
The research clearly demonstrated that teenagers are still developing their oral communication skills , underlining the need to ensure that they are given appropriate support by schools in doing so .
This is sensible enough , with no trace of linguistic determinism , techno - phobia , or the fall of British society .
On the other hand , it probably wo n't sell much advertising .

Wal - Mart has hired Democratic P.R. experts to help improve its reputation on such issues as low wages , miserly benefits , sex discrimination , and union busting .
LAURENT CILLUFFO
On the second floor of Wal - Mart ’s headquarters , in Bentonville , Arkansas , is a windowless room called Action Alley .
In the Wal - Mart idiom , the term “ Action Alley ” usually refers to the main aisle of the company ’s two thousand Supercenters — the stores that have upended the retail business by selling enormous quantities of groceries and imported goods at prices that competitors find difficult or impossible to match .
At the “ home office , ” as Bentonville is known , Action Alley is the company ’s war room , a communications center that was set up and is staffed by Washington - based operatives from Edelman , a public - relations firm that advises companies on issues of “ reputation management . ”
Wal - Mart corporate culture is parsimonious except in the matter of executive compensation , but , according to a source , the company has been paying Edelman roughly ten million dollars annually to renovate its reputation .
Twenty years ago , Wal - Mart was widely viewed as a scrappy regional retailer , and its founder , Sam Walton , an Ozarks eccentric with a vision of super - discounting , was praised for intuiting the needs of his customers , and for maintaining high morale among his workers .
When Walton retired , in 1988 ( he died in 1992 ) , the company had revenues of sixteen billion dollars .
Today , Wal - Mart is the second - largest company in the world in terms of revenue — only ExxonMobil is bigger .
Its revenues last year came to more than three hundred and fifteen billion dollars , with profits of more than eleven billion , and it has developed a reputation as a worldwide colossus that provides poor pay and miserly benefits to its 1.8 million employees .
The image of the company is not helped by the immoderation of Sam Walton ’s widow and children , who together control forty per cent of Wal - Mart ’s outstanding shares , and who are worth roughly eighty billion dollars ; they are , by a striking margin , the richest family in America .
( They are worth more than Warren Buffett and Bill Gates combined . )
Wal - Mart is traditionally a Republican - leaning company ( during the past fifteen years , more than seventy - five per cent of its political donations have gone to Republicans ) and has become a favorite target of Democratic politicians .
Hillary Clinton , who once served on Wal - Mart ’s board , recently returned a five - thousand - dollar donation because of what a campaign spokeswoman said were “ serious differences with current company practices . ”
Barack Obama and John Edwards have joined union - led campaigns to denounce the company for its wage - and - benefit policies .
Wal - Mart is notably unfriendly to unions ; in 2000 , when meat - cutters at a single Wal - Mart in Texas organized into a collective - bargaining unit , Wal - Mart responded by shutting down its meat counters across Texas and in five neighboring states .
It closed an entire store in Quebec , rather than see workers unionize .
The company has also been criticized for driving American jobs overseas , by demanding immense discounts from its suppliers .
Senator Byron Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat who is one of Wal - Mart ’s main foes in Congress , says that the company , by forcing its suppliers to manufacture goods in China , shows that it “ does n’t stand for American values . ”
Wal - Mart has been the subject of numerous unflattering documentaries and books .
Even Ron Galloway , the maker of a recent pro-Wal - Mart documentary , “ Why Wal - Mart Works and Why That Makes Some People Crazy , ” has turned against the company .
Galloway told me that he now considers Wal - Mart to be a “ heartless ” employer .
“ They just instituted a wage cap for long - term employees — people making between thirteen and eighteen dollars an hour .
It ’s a form of accelerated attrition .
They ca n’t expect me to defend that , ” Galloway said .
Two unions — the Service Employees International Union and the United Food and Commercial Workers — fund anti-Wal - Mart lobbying groups that catalogue what they see as the company ’s diverse sins .
Each month seems to bring a new , self - inflicted embarrassment .
Most recently , Wal - Mart announced that it had fired a technician from its Threat Research and Analysis division ( which combats industrial espionage ) for eavesdropping on telephone calls made by the Times ’ Wal - Mart beat reporter , Michael Barbaro .
Wal - Mart claims that the technician acted alone ; the U.S. Attorney in Arkansas is investigating .
In 2005 , Barbaro and another Times reporter , Steven Greenhouse , cited an internal memo written by the company ’s chief human - resources executive , M. Susan Chambers , in which she suggested that the company could control personnel costs by not hiring unhealthy people .
( To keep the sick and the lame off the payroll , Chambers suggested that all jobs should include “ some physical activity ; e.g. , all cashiers do some cart - gathering . ” )
In the same memo , Chambers noted that forty - six per cent of the children of Wal - Mart ’s million - plus American employees were uninsured or on Medicaid .
More recently , the company experienced a run of bad publicity when it announced new scheduling policies for its store workers ( known as “ associates ” ) .
Under what critics call the “ open availability ” policy , workers must make themselves available for different shifts from month to month or risk losing hours .
Kathleen MacDonald , a cosmetics - counter manager at a Wal - Mart in Aiken , South Carolina , explained to me , “ It ’s simple .
They say you have to be there when the computer says the customers will be there .
So if you have kids at home you ca n’t show up , but then your hours are being cut . ”
The company is facing more consequential challenges over its treatment of women .
A class -action lawsuit filed in San Francisco in 2001 by six female Wal - Mart employees , alleging that the company has denied promotions and equal pay to women , is proceeding steadily to trial ; by some estimates , the suit could cost the company as much as five billion dollars .
Wal - Mart has denied that it discriminates against women .
Kathleen MacDonald joined the suit after she learned that a male counterpart , who , like her , was stocking shelves , earned more than she did .
When she raised the issue , she told me , “ my immediate supervisor said , ‘ Well , God made Adam first , and Eve came from him . ’
I was , like , what ?
That ’s when I decided enough was enough . ”
Full - time hourly workers at Wal - Mart stores make an average of $ 10.51 an hour , according to the company .
Wal - Mart ’s most energetic adversary , a group called Wake Up Wal - Mart , which is sponsored by the food workers ’ union , notes that $ 10.51 may be the average full - time wage , but the company wo n’t disclose the average hourly wage of part - timers .
“ We think the true average is probably less than nine dollars , ” Chris Kofinis , the Wake Up Wal - Mart spokesman , said .
The company has had its bright moments , most notably in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , when Wal - Mart mobilized its truck fleet to deliver goods to the storm zone .
But that was a rare instance of good public relations .
Owing in part to its status as a retail behemoth , Wal - Mart has met with resistance in numerous communities ( including New York City ) when it has tried to open stores .
And its recent business performance has been less than stellar ; sales have slowed , and the stock price is stagnant .
Problems like these have concentrated the minds of Lee Scott , Wal - Mart ’s C.E.O. , and his top executives .
“ We used to be the David and now we ’re seen as the Goliath , ” John Fleming , the company ’s chief merchandising officer , told me .
The job of the Edelman people — there are about twenty , along with more than three dozen in - house public - relations specialists — is to help Wal - Mart scrub its muddied image .
Edelman specializes in helping industries with image problems ; another important client is the American Petroleum Institute , a Washington lobbying group that seeks to convince Americans that oil companies care about the environment and that their profits are reasonable .
Edelman does its work by cultivating contacts among the country ’s opinion élites , with whom it emphasizes the good news and spins the bad ; by such tactics as establishing “ Astroturf ” groups , seemingly grass - roots organizations that are actually fronts for industry ; and , as I deduced from my own visit to Bentonville , by advising corporate executives on how to speak like risk - averse politicians .
China Arnold 's daughter had high - heat internal burns , but no outside marks , Ken Betz from the county coroner 's office in Montgomery , Ohio , said .
" We have some forensic evidence that is consistent with our belief that a microwave oven was used , " Mr Betz said of baby Paris Talley 's death .
The mother denies the charge , which comes over a year after the girl died .
Paris Talley , who was one month old , was already dead when Ms Arnold took her to hospital in August 2005 .
The mother was briefly arrested at the time and later released while the authorities continued investigating .
The investigation proved tricky because " there is not a lot of scientific research and data on the effect of microwaves on human beings , " according to Mr Betz .
Ms Arnold 's lawyer , Jon Paul Rion , has denied that his client microwaved the baby .
" China - as a mother and a person - was horrified that such an act could occur , " Mr Rion told the Associated Press .
Ms Arnold claims that the night before the baby was taken to hospital she had been left for a short time with a babysitter .
Ms Arnold says that neither she nor the baby 's father suspected that there was anything wrong with the child until she was found unconscious the following morning .
WASHINGTON , March 20 — House Republicans joined Democrats on Tuesday in warning the F.B.I. that it could lose the power to demand that companies turn over customers ’ telephone , e-mail and financial records if it did not swiftly correct abuses in the use of national security letters , the investigative tool that allows the bureau to make such demands without a judge ’s approval .
The warnings came at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee into a recent report by the Justice Department ’s inspector general , Glenn A. Fine .
The report found that the F.B.I. had repeatedly violated the rules governing the letters , sometimes by invoking emergency procedures to exercise them when there was no emergency , and had bungled record keeping so badly that the number of letters exercised was often understated when the bureau reported on them to Congress .
“ I just want to convey to you how upset many of us are who have defended this program and have believed it is necessary to the protection of our country , ” Representative Dan Lungren , Republican of California , told Valerie E. Caproni , the bureau ’s general counsel .
If the handling of national security letters is not improved soon , added Mr. Lungren , a former California attorney general , the bureau will not “ have to worry about improving your procedures for N.S.L. ’s because you probably wo n’t have N.S.L. authority . ”
It 's no secret that some content owners do n't seem to understand how the DMCA works — that , or they simply do n't care when sending mass takedown notices .
This seems to be the case with the recent saga of legal maneuvers between the National Football League ( NFL ) and Brooklyn Law School professor Wendy Seltzer .
The two have been going back and forth with DMCA - related " requests " since early February — with YouTube stuck in between — and in the process , the NFL itself appears to have violated the DMCA .
The story began when Seltzer posted a YouTube clip on her personal blog in early February .
The clip showed the NFL 's copyright message that aired during the Super Bowl :
This telecast is copyrighted by the NFL for the private use of our audience ,
and any other use of this telecast or of any pictures , descriptions or accounts
of the game without the NFL 's consent is prohibited
Seltzer took exception to this claim — as it clearly makes no concession for fair use — and wanted to show her students how content owners are beginning to exaggerate their rights .
Five days later , she received a DMCA takedown notice through YouTube , saying that the NFL had claimed copyright violation and that the clip had been removed .
Ironic ?
Perhaps , but it gets better .
Seltzer , law professor by day , is also staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) by night and founder of Chilling Effects , a web site dedicated to educating the public about online rights .
Well aware of her own rights under DMCA , she promptly sent a counter - notification to YouTube ( generated by the Chilling Effects counter - notice generator , no less ) , citing Section 512 of the DMCA saying that YouTube must replace the material if they receive a counter - notification asserting " good faith belief " that the material removal was a mistake .
Several weeks after that , Seltzer 's Super Bowl copyright notice clip came back online as a result of her counter - notification .
Seltzer was happy that the system appeared to work the way it was designed to work and assumed that the NFL had decided not to sue to keep the video offline .
She was wrong , however .
Just 12 days later , the NFL filed yet another takedown notice with YouTube for the clip , and YouTube complied once again .
This is where the saga starts to get messy .
Seltzer 's counter - notification — which was forwarded to the NFL from YouTube — clearly described her use of the clip as fair use : " an educational excerpt featuring the NFL 's overreaching copyright warning aired during the Super Bowl . "
As Seltzer outlines in her blog post , the NFL 's only option in response to her counter - claim would be to force her to remove the clip via court proceedings .
This obviously did not happen , and instead , the NFL chose to ignore her claims completely .
After receiving her counter - notification claiming fair use , sending another takedown notice over the same content is considered a knowing misrepresentation that the clip is infringing , according to DMCA section 512 ( f ) ( 1 ) .
Under the DMCA , the NFL would be liable for all legal fees incurred by the alleged infringer , along with damages .
Essentially , the NFL is now in violation of the same law that it is using to try to protect its own content .
And , instead of following the proper procedures outlined in the DMCA , the NFL appears to be choosing to beat her over the head with takedown requests .
Would this be happening if YouTube was not caught in the middle , hosting the clip for Seltzer ?
There is no way to know , but it seems that the trend du jour is for content owners to target YouTube with these requests , knowing that YouTube is likely to comply immediately and ask questions later .
But Seltzer is n't likely to let this issue rest now , and seems more than happy to continue pushing back on the issue until it goes to court .
It 's hard to imagine that a court would do anything but decide in Seltzer 's favor , and if that were to happen , it may force content owners to be more cautious about sending takedown notices in the future .
I caught this article on Reddit this weekend and had definite mixed feelings about it .
Many of their suggestions were obviously good ideas — calling SetTimeout ( ) with a string is obviously stupid , as are 90 % of the possible uses of eval ( ) and Function ( ) .
The advice on what causes the DOM to repaint and reflow was interesting and informative .
It would have been a really good article except that some of their advice seemed weak .
Some of what was masquerading as optimization “ advice ” seemed more like work - arounds for a substandard javascript implementation .
Take this for example :
var min = Math. min( a , b ) ; A.push(v ) ;
These alternatives provide the same functionality , while performing better : var min = a < b ? a : b ; A[ A.length ] = v ;
Yes , I can see in someone ’s world that might perform better .
But come on , the compiler / scanner should be able to produce the equivalent code .
Anything less is a failing of your browser and not an “ unoptimized ” program .
Do you really expect people to crappify their programs because your browser can’t properly optimize javascript for you ?
“ Well , ” I hear you say , “ it ’s interpreted , not compiled . ”
To which I say , yeah , well there ’s your first problem .
Fix that before telling me that I need to use stupid constructs to make my program go fast .
Here ’s another example :
This example requires the script engine to create 21 new string objects , once for each time the length property is accessed , and once each time the charAt method is called : var s = ' 0123456789 ' ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < s.length ; i++ ) { s.charAt( i ) ; }
This equivalent example creates just a single object , and will perform better as a result : var s = new String ( '0123456789 ' ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < s.length ; i++ ) { s.charAt( i ) ; }
Again , this strikes me as being a failing of the compiler .
I see no reason why the browser should instantiate a string object just to call its length ( ) .
A little bit of hard coding in your implementation can optimize that to a strlen ( ) call or better —
No object instantiation at all .
What if someone overrode String.prototype.length ( ) ?
That ’s one if statement in C and some fallback code .
Again , I do n’t think my program should suffer because your browser does n’t properly optimize things .
But then again , maybe I ’m just crazy .

My girlfriend wanted me to verify I was not shooting real bullets because I was tired of feeling like my shaft was stuck in neutral because I had to wear a fricking condom .
I told her I was tied off but we both wanted to make sure I was not " live " before I ditched the $ 5 a box condoms .
I came into your Lab with a doctor 's order for a sperm sample .
There were two other people behind me at the counter when you took the order from my hand and then asked me in a loud voice " When is the last time you ejaculated ? "
( I guess you wanted to know if I had enough spluge to give a good sample to run the test ) WTF ?
Do you have to broadcast to the whole damn place that I 'm there to shoot my load into a clear plastic cup ?
I told you that I should be good .
You then have me go sit in the waiting room .
I sat down and rifled through a bunch of magazines and found a two year old Sports Illustrated .
I read it from cover to cover .
Then you came into the waiting room and handed me a cup to do my deed .
You then led me back to the front desk area where the only bathroom in the place is 3 feet away from the counter .
Apparently I was expecting you to hand me a choice of porn material so I could get this done .
But I now know that I will have to supply my own , in the future .
I went into the bathroom ( aka sperm sample room ) and took out my limp dick .
I try to remember the girl on the front of Cosmo magazine , that I saw briefly , and work to get a hard on when I hear on the other side of the door , a woman visibly upset that her insurance requires a copay for her bloodwork to be drawn .
WTF ?
The girl on the cover of Cosmo quickly exits my mind as I am now listening to you try to calm this woman down .
I turn the water on to try and drown out the conversation so I can shoot my load into the cup .
At this point , I am now stripping all the way down to nothing so I can feel like I 'm crawling into the sack with my girlfriend .
I manage to get a rod up and proceed to stroke but guess what ?
There is no lotion .
I NEED LUBE !
I am going like a bat out of hell with both hands to know avail .
I then discover the liquid soap in the liquid soap dispenser and damn near empty the thing into the palm of my hand .
( sorry for using all the soap )
So now I 'm completely naked , jacking off in a public restroom and pink soap flying everywhere .
( I flush the toilet to try and drown out the conversation between you and a coworker complaining about how your husband forgot your damn birthday )
So with all this all going on it really is tough trying to stay somewhat aroused to get this sperm from inside my body into this cup .
So I call my girlfriend , who is a corporate trainer , to see if I can get her to have phone sex with me .
But of course she 's training people and can't help me out , at all .
After 45 minutes of front desk conversation , toilet flushing , and water running I finally getrdone .
My heart is racing a hundred miles an hour , my arms hurt and I 'm flat worn out .
I rinse myself , wash the walls , get my clothes back on and take my sealed sample to you .
You then ask me how'd it go ?
What kinda damn question is that ?
I smile and say great and then walk out the door .
BTW , I have no live sperm and now can have proper intercourse with my girlfriend .
Thanks for all your help Labcorp lady .
I hope I never have to see you again .
It works very simply by repeatedly plotting the least significant bit of the java.util.Random.nextLong ( ) method once for each point in the grid .
As you can probably see by the horizontal stripes , this ' random ' method exibits significant periodic behavoiour .
Rather than looking like random static , the applet 's display looks like a badly tuned - in television .
All Java virtual machines that are available to me appear to exhibit the same problem .
The nextInt method is also ( approximately ) half as seriously afflicted .
Observe that the applet displays a regular period - each fourth frame is the same .
As the grid is 128x128 this means the pattern repeats after a period of 65536 , or 2^16 calls .
As the random number generator uses a long seed , this means that it fails to achieve its maximum period by a factor of 2^48 !
Random number generation algorithms which exhibit such behaviour in their low bits are less than ideal for generating integers without post - processing .
The source code for the above applet is available for inspection here .
I have formally submitted a bug report to Sun relating to this problem , complete with a proposal regarding how to remedy it .
Long hours at work can lead to hypertension and death .

What ’s the real message here ?
Become more efficient .
Get the same work done in less time .
Think and plan your work , work SMARTER not HARDER .
Slowing down does not mean being lazy .
It requires planning and discipline , and these take time .
Take more time to enjoy life and family , adjust your priorities .
If you are in a leadership position , find out why your people are working consistent overtime , and intervene .
You could be saving their lives and improving their health .

Rivers on every continent are drying out , threatening severe water shortages , according to a new WWF report .
( pdf )
The report , World ’s Top Rivers at Risk , released ahead of World Water Day ( 22 March ) , lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change , pollution and dams .
Ebro Delta Spain
â€ œAll the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis , which we have been signalling for years , ” says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock .
“ Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever .
Like the climate change crisis , which now has the attention of business and government , we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.â€ 
Amazon River Brazil
Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone .
They are the Yangtze , Mekong , Salween , Ganges and Indus .
Europeâ€™s Danube , the Americasâ€™ La Plata and Rio Grande / Rio Bravo , Africaâ€™s Nile - Lake Victoria and Australiaâ€™s Murray - Darling also make the list .
Yangtze China
Dams along the Danube River â€ ” one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe â€ ” have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basinâ€™s wetlands and floodplains .
Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers , the Indus River faces scarcity due to over - extraction for agriculture .
Fish populations , the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide , are also being threatened .
Mekong Delta Cambodia
The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and peopleâ€™s livelihoods .
â€ œConservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security , health and economic success , â€ Pittock adds .
â€ œEmphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary .â€ 
Murry River Australia
In addition , cooperative agreements for managing shared resources , such as the UN Watercourses Convention , must be ratified and given the resources to make them work , says WWF .
â€ œThe freshwater crisis is bigger than the ten rivers listed in this report but it mirrors the extent to which unabated development is jeopardizing natureâ€™s ability to meet our growing demands , â€ says Pittock .
â€ œWe must change our mindset now or pay the price in the not so distant future.â€ 
The US Navy is funding research into a " Star Trek phaser set on ' stun ' " .
At least to begin with , the kit is intended for use by Marines in ordinary urban combat rather than starship crewmen beamed down onto strange new worlds ( fans of the classic series may be interested to note that the USS Enterprise happens to be preparing for an " upcoming surge deployment " , however . )
The new technology has been given an acronym , EPIC , for Electromagnetic Personnel Interdiction Control .
The idea is that intense radio - frequency emissions – capable of passing through walls – would be used to temporarily disrupt the balance and coordination functions of targets ' inner ears , knocking them down relatively harmlessly .
The Navy notes that " second order effects would be extreme motion sickness , " suggesting that in fact the order given by future Captain Kirks may be " set phasers on ' puke ' " .
The intention of the programme is to avoid unnecessary harm to the target , but unconscious vomiting would seem to present something of a choking hazard .
Still , EPIC - based regurge blasters would seem less brutal than the microwave - oven cannons already tested , which are designed to disperse crowds by lightly frying their outer skin layers .
Texas - based wireless systems firm Invocon was awarded a $ 99,609 development contract in 2004 .
The company now claims that " the first known demonstration of a vestibular response to an electromagnetic stimulus has been performed " , and wants more money " for research into the effects of the stimulus and potential delivery mechanisms " .
The best commentary so far was provided by " Dan Lardee " on Wired 's blogs , who simply said : " I think I got hit by one of those beams last night . " ®
Warning : Public health officials have determined that not breast - feeding may be hazardous to your baby 's health .
There is no black - box label like that affixed to cans of infant formula or tucked into the corner of magazine advertisements , at least not yet .
But that is the unambiguous message of a controversial government public health campaign encouraging new mothers to breast - feed for six months to protect their babies from colds , flu , ear infections , diarrhea and even obesity .
In April , the World Health Organization , setting new international bench marks for children 's growth , for the first time referred to breast - feeding as the biological norm .
" Just like it 's risky to smoke during pregnancy , it 's risky not to breast - feed after , " said Suzanne Haynes , senior scientific adviser to the Office on Women 's Health in the Department of Health and Human Services .
" The whole notion of talking about risk is new in this field , but it 's the only field of public health , except perhaps physical activity , where there is never talk about the risk . "
A two - year national breast - feeding awareness campaign that culminated this spring ran television announcements showing a pregnant woman clutching her belly as she was thrown off a mechanical bull during ladies ' night at a bar — and compared the behavior to failing to breast - feed .

Several people have sent me links to a video of a juggler named Chris Bliss .
It ’s going around .
He is working very very hard and earns a standing ovation at the end .
Today , I got a video , featuring Jason , who just might be the best juggler I have ever seen .
Same music , similar routine .
Except … five balls .
Not three , five .
Infinitely more difficult .
And Jason makes it look easy : YouTube – Chris Bliss Diss Video .
The thing is , even though I know how much more difficult Jason ’s routine is and how skilled he is , the very ease of his delivery makes it less likely an audience would give him that same ovation .
Interesting how important effort seems to be .
The Red Cross has just announced a new disaster - response partnership with Wal - Mart .
When the next hurricane hits , it will be a co-production of Big Aid and Big Box .
This , apparently , is the lesson learned from the US government 's calamitous response to Hurricane Katrina : businesses do disaster better .
" It 's all going to be private enterprise before it's over , " Billy Wagner , emergency management chief for the Florida Keys , currently under hurricane watch for tropical storm Ernesto , said in April .
" They 've got the expertise .
They 've got the resources . "
But before this new consensus goes any further , perhaps it 's time to take a look at where the privatisation of disaster began , and where it will inevitably lead .
The first step was the government 's abdication of its core responsibility to protect the population from disasters .
Under the Bush administration , whole sectors of the government , most notably the Department of Homeland Security , have been turned into glorified temp agencies , with essential functions contracted out to private companies .
The theory is that entrepreneurs , driven by the profit motive , are always more efficient ( please suspend hysterical laughter ) .
We saw the results in New Orleans one year ago : Washington was frighteningly weak and inept , in part because its emergency management experts had fled to the private sector and its technology and infrastructure had become positively retro .
At least by comparison , the private sector looked modern and competent .
But the honeymoon does n't last long .
" Where has all the money gone ? " ask desperate people from Baghdad to New Orleans , from Kabul to tsunami-struck Sri Lanka .
One place a great deal of it has gone is into major capital expenditure for these private contractors .
Largely under the public radar , billions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on the construction of a privatised disaster - response infrastructure : the Shaw Group 's new state - of - the - art Baton Rouge headquarters , Bechtel 's battalions of earthmoving equipment , Blackwater USA 's 6,000 - acre campus in North Carolina ( complete with paramilitary training camp and 6,000 - foot runway ) .
I call it the Disaster Capitalism Complex .
Whatever you might need in a serious crunch , these contractors can provide it : generators , watertanks , cots , port - a- potties , mobile homes , communications systems , helicopters , medicine , men with guns .
This state - within - a - state has been built almost exclusively with money from public contracts , including the training of its staff ( overwhelmingly former civil servants , politicians and soldiers ) .
Yet it is all privately owned ; taxpayers have absolutely no control over it or claim to it .
So far , that reality has n't sunk in because while these companies are getting their bills paid by government contracts , the Disaster Capitalism Complex provides its services to the public free of charge .
But here 's the catch : the US government is going broke , in no small part thanks to this kind of loony spending .
The national debt is $ 8 trillion ; the federal budget deficit is at least $ 260 bn .
That means that sooner rather than later the contracts are going to dry up .
Insiders call it the " homeland security bubble " .
When it bursts , firms such as Bechtel , Fluor and Blackwater will lose their primary revenue stream .
They will still have all their hi-tech gear giving them the ability to respond to disasters , while the government will have let that precious skill wither away - but now they will rent back the tax - funded infrastructure at whatever price they choose .
Here 's a snapshot of what could be in store in the not - too - distant future : helicopter rides off rooftops in flooded cities at $ 5,000 a pop ( $ 7,000 for families , pets included ) , bottled water and " meals ready to eat " at $ 50 a head ( steep , but that 's supply and demand ) , and a cot in a shelter with a portable shower ( show us your biometric ID , developed on a lucrative homeland security contract , and we 'll track you down later with the bill ) .
The model , of course , is the US healthcare system , in which the wealthy can access best - in - class treatment in spa-like environments while 46 million Americans lack health insurance .
As emergency - response , the model is already at work in the global Aids pandemic : private - sector prowess helped produce life - saving drugs ( with heavy public subsidies ) , then set prices so high that the vast majority of the world 's infected cannot afford treatment .
If that is the corporate world 's track record on slow - motion disasters , why should we expect different values to govern fast - moving disasters such as hurricanes or even terrorist attacks ?
It 's worth remembering that as Israeli bombs pummelled Lebanon not so long ago , the US government initially tried to charge its citizens for the cost of their own evacuations .
And , of course , anyone without a western passport in Lebanon had no hope of rescue .
One year ago , New Orleans 's working - class and poor citizens were stranded on their rooftops waiting for help that never came , while those who could pay their way escaped to safety .
The country 's political leaders claim it was all some terrible mistake , a breakdown in communication that is being fixed .
Their solution is to go even further down the catastrophic road of " private - sector solutions . "
Unless a radical change of course is demanded , New Orleans will prove to be a glimpse of a dystopian future , a future of disaster apartheid in which the wealthy are saved and everyone else is left behind .
· Naomi Klein 's book on disaster capitalism will be published in spring 2007 .

録音・録画補償金やDRMのあり方など、著作物の意義や対価システムが見直されようとしている。消費者にしてみれば、もちろん補償金もDRMもいやだということだけははっきりしているわけだが、権利者の団体はそれによって著作権者の利益が守られるのだと主張する。
だがちょっと待って欲しい。権利者といっても、いつも議論の舞台に登場するのはJASRACを始めとする権利団体だ。本当の意味での著作権者である音楽家達は、補償金やDRMなどのことをどう考えているのかという話は、ちっとも伝わってこないのである。
これはどう考えても、議論の席に座る人のバランスとしておかしいだろう。その権利者団体が、果たして正しくミュージシャンなど芸術家の総意を代表していると言えるのかがはっきりしないことには、権利者団体と話し合いをして意味があるのかも、実はわからないのではないか。
実際のプロの音楽家が今日の状況をどのように考えているのか、それを語るにふさわしい人をいろいろと考えていった結果、平沢進氏に行き当たった。
日本のテクノ・ニューウェーブシーンをリアルタイムで経験した年代の人間であれば、「平沢進」の名前を知らないはずはない。P-MODELのリーダー／ボーカリストであり、1989年以降はソロとしても活躍中である。
同氏は1999年、まだ音楽配信など影も形もない頃に、自らのサイトでMP3を使った楽曲の音楽販売を開始した。文字通り音楽配信の先駆者である。
またそれと並行し てJASRACの権利支配のあり方に疑問を持ち、メジャーレーベルとの契約を自ら切り、作品の版権を引き上げて自分で管理するという方法に切り替えた。現役ミュージシャンで音楽配信や著作権、補償金の話を聞くのに、これ以上ふさわしい人はいないだろう。
ライブパフォーマンスにおいては、会場のオーディエンスとネット上のファンによる「選択」で毎回違ったストーリーを展開していく、独特の「インタラクティブ・ライブ」を実践し、2001年には「デジタルコンテンツグランプリ」において最優秀賞である経済産業省大臣賞を受賞している。
せんえつながら、この受賞したショウ「賢者のプロペラ」で、ネット上のインタラクティブサイトのグラフィックスデザインを行なったのが、筆者であった。今回はそのツテを頼って、平沢氏本人に直接お話をうかがうことができた次第である。
音楽業界に深く根を張 るJASRAC の存在
現在平沢氏は、茨城県つくば市に自らのレコーディングスタジオを構築し、活動拠点を移している。このインタビューは、つくば駅からほど近いホテルのラウンジにて行なわれた。
音楽配信でも先駆者的存在の平沢進氏
――平沢さんといえば音楽配信の先駆者であるわけですが、これを始めることとメジャーレーベルから離れるということは、関連した動きだったんですか？
平沢氏： そもそも私のやっている音楽は、メジャー向きじゃないんですね（笑）。私もバンドのメンバーも、メジャー的な姿勢で音楽を作っていったり、アルバムをリリースしていくことに関してずっと違和感を感じていました。ただデビューした79年という時代では、自ら音楽をリリースすることがそれほど簡単ではなかったんですよ。全国規模でプロモーション、ディストリビューション、レコーディングにかかる費用含めて、自分たちだけでは満足いくものは作れないということで、留まっていたんですね。ですがインターネットが普及してきたのと合わせて、MP3というインターネットに適したフォーマットが出現してきた。これをきっかけに、もう居る理由はないということで辞めてしまった。
――メジャーを去ることで 、JASRACなど管理会社との関係はどうなったのでしょう？
平沢氏： JASRAC とはこの業界の悪しき構造ゆえに、完全に縁が切れてはいない状態なんです。いくつかの楽曲はやむなくJASRACに管理を任せざるを得ないことになっていますが、基本的にはe-Licenseにライセンス管理をお願いしています。
e-Licenseとは、2001年に著作権等管理事業法が施行されたときに立ち上がった、著作権管理事業者である。それ以前はJASRAC一社が音楽著作権のすべてを行なってきたわけだが、権利者自身が事業者を選べるようになることで、自由化を促した。
だが音楽著作権にまつわるすべてが、新規事業者に任されているわけではない。著作権等管理事業法では、音楽著作権を4つに分けた。「演奏権等」「録音権等 」「貸与権 」
「出版権等」である。これを「支分権」という。
e-Licenseなど新規参入の管理事業者は、このうち「録音権等」のみの管理しか行なうことができず、そのほかの権利に関しては相変わらずJASRACが独占的に管理している。このため、管理事業法本来の趣旨が発揮できていないといった批判も強い。

How To Make Money Naming Domains
A long time ago , I learned a simple rule of life :
When the crowd rushes off in a lather to the right …
I take a serious look at going left instead .
You do n’t have to be a student of history for very long before it becomes blaringly apparent that the “ common wisdom ” of any culture is usually just deadass wrong .
There ’s something slithery deep in our nature that makes us gullible whenever “ everyone ” starts believing something .
After the dust settles , it ’s hard to see how anyone could have bought into whatever was thought of as a brilliant idea at the time .
Enron was featured on every major finanical publication ’s front cover as the “ company of the future ” just months before it collapsed .
People went absolutely berzerk over really stupid ( and completely unworkable )
Web concepts while the Dot Com bubble stretched toward the inevitable pop .
And yes , while some people made a bundle during the recent real estate land - grab …
I ’m sure you know more than a few folks who are sitting on muliple mortgages equal to , gosh , more than they earn .
On paper , they look like finanical geniuses .
If only they can get someone to buy those overpriced spec properties , hopefully before the next mortgage payment arrives …
It ’s the same mentality that fuels witch hunts .
Something in our lizard brain wants to believe the worst about everything and everyone .
For some folks , fear is the only thing that gets them up in the morning .
Especially when “ everyone ” shares the same jitters .
The impending death of the daily newspaper is one example .
Everyone — and that includes newspaper owners — believes the Web will kill off the entire concept .
Soon .
Maybe by September .
And yet , if you examine the actual numbers , nothing of the sort is about to happen .
While almost no town has two newpapers anymore , every town still has one .
And while the evening edition has pretty much vanished , subscriptions to morning editions have actually increased a bit .
( Add online readership , and the numbers start to look staggering . )
More important … the actual business of running a newpaper remains mega-profitable .
It ’s just not profitable in a way that excites Wall Street .
Traders hate slow , plodding , unsexy cash cows .
There ’s a great post by James Surowiecki in the New Yorker last week about this .
Newspapers will mutate , and probably stop trying to compete with the Web for reporting the latest national and international news … but will continue to be the primary source of LOCAL news .
And , of course , still the first - choice for classified ads .
I mention this , because I just got back from yet another seminar , where otherwise smart people in the audience occasionally questioned the wisdom of using direct mail “ anymore ” to sell anything .
You know … because “ no one reads mail ” these days .
The fact is …
I almost hesitate to show new clients how to use direct mail now .
Not because it does n’t work anymore , though .
Naw .
Because it works so WELL .
And it ’s kinda nice that the volume of competing junk mail has started to decline .
The less number of marketers who get hip to the power of good ( not bad ) direct mail … the better it is for those of us who know the truth .
I love the Web , and I ’ve made a ton of money using it .
There ’s more to be made , and I ’m thoroughly enjoying going deeper and deeper into the wonderful world of nurturing and / or pillaging house lists through email .
But there will always be certain advantages to mail you can open and hold in your hands .
No matter how “ virtual ” your world gets , the “ real ” world of senses and tangible materials will never go away .
Right now , the crowd is rushing off in crazy directions , like lemmings hunting for a cliff .
And I ’m sort of enjoying the relative tranquility of strolling in the opposite direction .
Something to consider as you make your marketing plans for the coming days of turmoil and excitement .
Stay frosty .

A new wide - field panorama reveals more than a thousand supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies , some up to several billion times more massive than the sun .
This survey was taken in a region of the Bootes constellation .
At 9.3 square degrees , it is over 40 times larger than the full moon seen on the night sky , which is also shown in this graphic for scale .
A new survey revealing more than a thousand supermassive black holes in one region of the sky calls into question a popular model of how the gravity monsters behave .
Multimedia : All About Black Holes
Black holes can't be seen , but astronomers identify them by their gravitational effects on surrounding material and by noting emissions of X - rays and other radiation from their maws .
Typically , a black hole is surrounded by a doughnut - shaped region , or torus , of gas .
The view of the black hole 's immediate surroundings is blocked by this torus by different amounts , depending on the orientation whether we 're looking through it edge - on or looking down on the setup from above , the thinking goes .
If true , then astronomers should find a range of absorption of the radiation from the nuclei of black holes - from nuclei that are heavily obscured and barely detectable to those that are not obscured at all , along with everything in between .
" Instead of finding a whole range , we found nearly all of the black holes are either naked or covered by a dense veil of gas , " said Ryan Hickox of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
" Very few are in between , which makes us question how well we know the environment around these black holes . "
The objects found are called active galactic nuclei , or AGNs .
They are very bright objects shrouded in dust and gas and thought to be developing galaxies anchored by black holes .
This study found more than 600 obscured and 700 unobscured AGNs , located between about 6 billion to 11 billion light years from Earth .
A light - year is the distance light travels in a year , about 6 trillion miles ( 10 trillion kilometers ) .
So these objects are seen as they existed billions of years ago .
The universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
The black holes were detected [ image ] by combining data from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory , the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground - based optical telescopes .

Patrick Fontana twisted his left knee last spring while hitting a drive down the fairway on a golf course in Columbus , Ohio .
But what really pained him was the $ 900 bill for diagnostic imaging ordered by his doctor .
Mr. Fontana , a 42 - year - old salesman , has a high - deductible health plan coupled to a health savings account .
Since he was nowhere near meeting his deductible , he was on the hook for the entire bill .
So he did something that insurance companies routinely do : he forwarded the bill to a claims adjuster , in this case My Medical Control , a Web - based company that reviews doctor and hospital bills for consumers .
After concluding that Mr. Fontana was not getting the best possible price , the company ’s representatives called the imaging facility and demanded a lower one , promptly saving him $ 200 — minus a 35 percent collection fee .
Newswise —
It 's essential to all life , and numerous research papers are published about it every year .
Yet there are still secrets to reveal about water , that seemingly simple compound we know as H2O .
Equipped with high - speed computers and the laws of physics , scientists from the University of Delaware and Radboud University in the Netherlands have developed a new method to " flush out " the hidden properties of water -- and without the need for painstaking laboratory experiments .
Their new first - principle simulation of water molecules -- based exclusively on quantum physics laws and utilizing no experimental data -- will aid science and industry in a broad range of applications , from biological investigations of protein folding and other life processes , to the design of the next generation of power plants .
The research is reported in the article " Predictions of the Properties of Water from First Principles " in the March 2 issue of Science , a prestigious international journal .
Krzysztof Szalewicz , professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Delaware , led the scientific team , which included Robert Bukowski , a former UD postdoctoral researcher who is now at Cornell University , and Gerrit Groenenboom and Ad van der Avoird from the Institute for Molecules and Materials at Radboud University in Nijmegen , Netherlands .
The UD research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation .
We all know a molecule of water chemically as H2O - - two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom .
Sounds simple , does n't it ?
But liquid water is much more complex than that .
" Water as a liquid is not simple at all and has several properties different from most other liquids , " Szalewicz said .
" For example , a well - known anomaly of water is that its density is highest at four degrees Celsius above the freezing point .
Thus , ice floats on water , whereas the solid state of other compounds would sink in their liquids . "
Among its many properties , water also can absorb large amounts of heat before it begins to get hot , and it releases heat slowly during cooling .
Otherwise , pools of water , from puddles to oceans , might boil during the day or freeze solid at night , regardless of the season .
Water 's unique characteristics are directly related to its molecular structure and the ability of water molecules to form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules .
The hydrogen side of the water molecule has a slight positive charge , while a slight negative charge exists on the opposite side of the molecule .
" For a long time , most researchers agreed that , in its liquid state , each water molecule coordinates on average with four other water molecules by forming hydrogen bonds , " Szalewicz said .
" However , a 2004 paper in Science claimed that this coordination takes place with only two molecules , a discovery that , if correct , would turn over the whole water paradigm . "
The experimental claim was not dismissed right away , Szalewicz said , because existing theoretical models of liquid water were " parameterized " or coordinated to a specific class of experiments .
" However , the ambiguities about the structure of liquid water may be resolved if the structure is predicted directly from the laws of physics , " Szalewicz said .
Through the use of quantum mechanics , the application of the laws of physics at the microscopic level , the scientists were able to generate a new theoretical framework for describing the structure and behavior of the water molecule atom by atom .
" This became possible recently when fast multiprocessor computers enabled very accurate solutions of the equations of quantum mechanics describing the forces that water molecules exert on each other , " Szalewicz said .
" Once these forces are known , one can find motions in an ensemble of water molecules and predict all the properties of liquid water . "
The UD researchers used clusters of Linux computers to perform the large - scale computer calculations required for the research .
The study took several months to complete .
The result is a new model -- the first that can accurately predict both the properties of a pair of water molecules and of liquid water .
Among its many applications , the research should help scientists better understand water in not only its liquid form , but in other states as well , such as crystalline forms of ice , and water in extreme conditions , including highly reactive " supercritical " water , which is used to remove pollutants in wastewater and recover waste plastic in chemical recycling , Szalewicz said .
Perry fires youth agency head 2 years after probe TYC shake - up comes 2 years after probe
Agency 's leader ousted ; ' cover - up ' of abuse alleged
AUSTIN — Gov. Rick Perry 's staff learned last fall of a Texas Rangers investigation into allegations of sexual abuse in 2005 at a West Texas state juvenile facility , but the governor took no major action to reform the Texas Youth Commission until after the report became public last week .
On Wednesday , Perry removed the agency 's board chairman , Pete Alfaro , of Baytown , and appointed Don Bethel , of Lamesa , as Alfaro 's replacement .
Perry also recommended that at its meeting Tuesday , the board hire Ed Owens , the deputy executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , as the acting TYC director and set up an inspector general who answers directly to the board .
And late Wednesday , the Senate voted to ask the legislative audit committee to recommend the entire state agency be put into a conservatorship .
Perry would have the final say on whether a conservatorship is adopted .
Legislative committees held hearings last year in which former TYC employees and the parents of youth offenders testified that there was widespread physical and sexual abuse of those incarcerated in the system .
But Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Sens. John Whitmire , D - Houston , and Juan Hinojosa , D - McAllen , said they did n't find out until last week about the Texas Rangers ' report on the possible sexual assault of boys by TYC administrators at the West Texas State School in Pyote .
They said there appeared to be a cover - up by high - ranking TYC officials .
" Two or three years ago a Ranger report went to the Youth Commission , and we 're just finding out about it in the Legislature in the last few days , " Dewhurst said .
" Who was on the distribution ?
That Texas Ranger report , did it just go to the Youth Commission or did it go to other offices ? "
No charges have been filed
Perry spokesman Ted Royer said the governor , the lieutenant governor and speaker were notified of the original investigation in 2005 , but he said the results were given only to TYC .
Royer said the governor 's staff became aware of the report in November when public safety adviser Alfonso Royal was contacted by Alison Brock , the chief of staff for state Rep. Sylvester Turner , D - Houston .
Royer said Brock asked Royal if the governor 's office could help getting Ward County District Attorney Randall " Randy " Reynolds moving on prosecuting the offending TYC officials .
Royer said Perry 's staff never saw the report , but Royal received the ranger 's notes and talked to the ranger about his investigation .
Royer said the district attorney told Royal he did not have the staff to prosecute the case .
He said Royal then coordinated with Reynolds to get him help from the Texas attorney general 's prosecutor assistance office .
No criminal charges have been filed .
Royer said the governor 's office was trying to address " systemic " problems one step at a time .
" You never take the most drastic step first .
You take smaller , aggressive steps to see if you can get the job done , " Royer said , noting that Perry has now taken a more drastic step .
Repeated reports
Brock said she turned to Royal for help after learning about the report from juvenile justice advocate Isela Gutierrez , of Austin .
Brock said she called the ranger who conducted the investigation and he told her his report outlining possible sexual assault by two TYC officials was sitting in the prosecutor 's office .
That is when Brock turned to the governor 's office .
" It 's 100 percent state funded .
The board is appointed by the governor .
It 's just one of those agencies where you look to the governor for help , " Brock said .
She said she thinks Royal is dedicated to improving TYC .
Alfaro said Wednesday that the board knew of the Rangers ' investigation in 2005 , but thought the case had been turned over to the local district attorney .
He said he did n't learn that no action had been taken or that there had been an additional internal investigation until last week .
He admitted there are problems at the agency , but thinks the board was addressing them .
Alfaro said he had not been officially notified about Perry 's decision to replace him as chairman .
He said he will resign from the board when that occurs .
The sexual abuse that the Texas Rangers substantiated at the West Texas State School occurred despite repeated reports from staff members to superiors that students were being preyed on .
The officials either turned a blind eye or intentionally covered up for their colleagues , the Rangers determined .
" Everyone knew what was going on , " one juvenile told a Rangers investigator .
The Rangers ' report indicated two top administrators had turned the Pyote facility into something of a sex camp between 2003 and 2005 , molesting scores of young offenders .
The two officials resigned in 2005 .
' This is no surprise '
Gutierrez , who heads the Texas Coalition Advocating Justice for Juveniles , said Texas legislators heard many similar stories of youth abuse and sexual assault during a series of hearings last year that were held in McAllen and San Antonio .
Gutierrez said legislators did not demand immediate action to clean up TYC until they learned of the Rangers ' report .
She said it had been too easy to dismiss many of the stories as coming from allegedly disgruntled ex-employees or the parents of TYC youths .
" This is no surprise .
What is a surprise is that the legislators are now taking it so seriously , " Gutierrez said .
Dewhurst said he told Perry on Tuesday that the Senate would prefer to put TYC under a conservator and " fire " the entire board .
Dewhurst said Perry declined to go along with that .
Whitmire noted that TYC Executive Director Dwight Harris resigned last Friday after being called to testify before the Senate Criminal Justice Committee on Tuesday .
He said one of the TYC officials who received complaints about the Pyote facility , Lemuel " Chip " Harrison , was still working at the commission until he was suspended during the Senate committee hearing .
" Because of the history over the past two years of cover-ups ... we 're concerned about what we do n't know , " Whitmire said .
" This agency is still involved in a cover - up . "
Hinojosa said the governor 's office is focusing on the Pyote facility as an isolated problem , not part of a systemwide problem .
He said there have been similar abuse cases at TYC facilities in Giddings and Edinburg .
" They think ( the West Texas State School ) is the only problem .
It 's not , " said Hinojosa .

The Erma Bombeck Writers ' Workshop has been dubbed the " Woodstock of Humor . "
Another writer described it as a " utopia " for writers — one " that only appears every other year , out of the mist , on the edge of the Great Miami River in Dayton , Ohio ( like Brigadoon ) . "
The workshop 's mission is simple : to encourage and inspire writers in the same way that celebrated columnist and author Erma Bombeck ' 49 found encouragement and inspiration at the University of Dayton .
Its mantra is timeless : " You can write ! "
The recent news that South Korea is to take the US to task over Google Earth images which expose its military installations to close Commie scrutiny has provoked a mini stampede of other peace - loving nations eager to protect their assets from prying eyes .
Enter stage right Thailand , which says it may ask Google to " block images of important state buildings vulnerable to attack " .
Armed forces spokeschap Major General Weerasak Manee - in told Reuters : " We are looking for possible restrictions on these detailed pictures , especially state buildings .
I think pictures of tourist attractions should do , not crucial places which could threaten national security . "
Well , we went and had a quick shufti at some Thai military installations , and took the opportunity to scour the Earth 's surfaces for other Google satellite data which might threaten Our Way of Life .
We restricted ourselves to stuff which lends itself to perusal , mostly air force bases , because ( trust us on this one ) you can easily waste a whole day looking for Russian ICBM installations .
First up , the evidence for Thai military preparedness .
Here 's Udorn Air Force base , around 300 miles from Bangkok :
Move along , nothing to see here , but try Korat :
That 's more like it .
Zoom in for a closer look , and voila !
Top-quality , US - bought hardware :
They 've even got an awacs parked there on the hard shoulder :
Hmmm .
The good General may have a point .
On the other hand , what is Thailand realistically going to do about it ?
Manee 's Sri Lankan counterpart , Brigadier Daya Ratnayake , admitted it was a " serious concern if anyone could get detailed images of sensitive installations and buildings " , but added : " This is a new trend , we will first have to see whether , in this day and age , if this a considerable threat to national security . "
He sagely added : " In this era of technology , you have to live with the fact that almost everything is on the internet - from bomb - making instructions to assembling aircraft .
So it 's something the military has to learn to live with and adapt . "
India agrees .
Reuters quotes an anonymous security official there as confirming that " the issue of satellite imagery had been discussed at the highest level but the government had concluded that ' technology cannot be stopped ' . "
" We are aware that there are websites which give detailed pictures of buildings like the president 's house including every tree in the compound .
Our security agencies are aware of this but how can we stop technology ? " he added .
How indeed ?
And just to prove the point , here 's Palam airport in New Delhi , home of domestic flights but also government air transportation in and out of the capital :
A planespotter 's paradise , as a close - up reveals :
Australia , too , has been fretting a little over Google 's all - seeing eye .
The Australian Department of Defence has said it is taking " appropriate measures to manage the threat " posed by satellite imaging :
The above is a lovely snap of Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ( ANSTO ) nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights , south of Sydney , although ANSTO declared the " current images on Google posed no security risk " because : " Although buildings are clearly visible , critical infrastructure is not .
The photographs are over two years old . "
Quite so .
At this point we 're getting the feeling that the South Koreans and Thai may be over - reacting a tad .
What 's more , they 're not looking at the plus side : if Vietnam and North Korea are as we speak eagerly filling their broadband boots with Google - supplied military secrets , what 's to stop us exploiting the same resource ?

2003/04/15 溝畑 考史さんより 「サンセリフ」に関して意見を頂いたので 訳註に追記。
最近、MITで教えている友人と話をした。彼の研究分野は今たいへん人気があり、
毎年大学院への応募書類が殺到している。 「 みんな賢そうだよ」と彼は言った。「ただ、センスがあるかどうかを見分けるのは難しい。」
センス。あるいは審美眼。最近この言葉をあまり聞かなくなった。
だがこの言葉の指す概念の重要性が失われたわけではない。
私の友人が言いたかったのは、技術者として優秀なだけでなく、
その技術的な知識を使って美しいものをデザインできる学生が欲しいということだ。
数学者は良い仕事 を 「 美しい 」と形容する。 科学者、技術者、音楽家、建築家、デザイナー、作家、画家、そういった人々も、
過去や現在に、「美しい」という形容詞を使ってきた。
皆が同じ単語を使うのは単なる偶然なんだろうか。
それともその意味するものの間に何かの共通項があるんだろうか。
もし共通項があるとすれば、一つの分野での美に関する知見を
他の分野にも使えないだろうか。
ものをデザインする我々のような立場にとって、これは単なる理論的な問題じゃない。
美というものが存在するなら、我々はそれをきっちり認識できなくちゃならない。
良いものを作るには、良いセンス、美を見分ける力が必要なんだ。
美を実体のない抽象概念として扱って、それについてたわごとを並べたり
逆にそれについて議論することを避けて通ったりするのではなく、
現実的な問題として考えてみようじゃないか。
「 どうやったら良いものが作れる?」
* * *
現代では、センスについて語ろうとすると、多くの人がこう言うだろう。
「 センスなんて主観的なものさ」 。 実際彼らにとってはそう感じられるから、そう信じているんだ。
何かを好ましいと思っても、何故そうなのか彼らにはわからない。
それが美しいからなのかもしれないし、母親も同じ物をもっていたからなのかもしれないし、
雑誌で映画スターと一緒に写ってたのを見たからかもしれないし、
あるいは単に高価なものだと知っているからかもしれない。
色々な思い付きが絡み合っていて、人々はそれをよく考えてみようとはしない。
我々の多くは子どもの頃に、この絡み合いを考えないままでいるように教えられてきた。
弟が塗り絵で人を緑に塗っているのをばかにしていると、母親はきっと
「あなたにはあなたの好みが、弟には弟の好みがあるのよ」とかなんとか言うだろう。
ここで母親は美学についての重要な真実を教えようとしているわけではない。
単にあなたと弟がけんかするのを止めたいだけだ。
大人が我々に教えてくれた半分だけの真実はたいていそうなのだが、
これも大人が言う他のことと矛盾する。 センスは単なる個人の好みだと子供のあなたにくどくど教え込んだ後で、
大人はあなたを美術館に連れてゆき、 レオナルド・ダ・ヴィンチは偉大な芸術家だからしっかり見ておきなさいなんて言うんだ。
このとき子供の頭にはどんな考えが浮かぶのだろう。
「 偉大な芸術家」ってどんな意味だと思うだろう。
人には人それぞれのやり方があるって何百回も言われた後では、
偉大な芸術家は他の人より良い仕事をする人だ、
という結論にはなかなかたどり着けない。
どっちかというと、子供の天動説的な世界の中では、
「 偉大な芸術家」っていうのはきっと自分にとって良いものなんだって説に落ち着くだろう。
ちょうど、本にそう書いてあったからブロッコリーが身体にいいんだって考えるみたいに。
* * *
センスは個人の好みだと言うのは論争を避けるには良い方法だ。
問題は、それが真実でないということだ。
ものをデザインしはじめると、それを感じることになる。
どんな仕事をしていても、それをもっとうまくやりたいと思うようになるのは自然なことだ。
フットボールの選手は試合に勝ちたいし、CEOは利益を増やしたい。
仕事をより良くやることはプライドの問題でもあるし、本物の喜びでもある。
でも、ものをデザインするのが仕事で、そして客観的な美というものが存在しないとしたら、
仕事をもっとうまくやるということは原理的に不可能じゃないか。
センスが単なる個人の好みなら誰もが既に完璧だ。
みんな自分の好きなものを好きになり、それでおしまい。
他のどんな仕事とも同じように、ものをデザインする仕事を続けていれば
だんだんうまく出来るようになってくる。センスが変わってくるのだ。
そして仕事が上達する人は誰しも、自分が上達してくるのがわかる。
だとすれば、あなたの古いセンスは単に違うというだけでなく、今より悪かったのだ。
センスに正しいも間違いも無いなんて定理、誰が作ったんだい?
現代では相対主義が流行してて、 自分のセンスが育っていたとしても、それについて考えるのを邪魔するかもしれない。
でも眼を開けて、良いデザインと悪いデザインというものがあるのだと
少なくとも自分の中で認めなければ、良いデザインについて詳しく学び始めることはできない。
自分のセンスはどう変わった? 何が原因で間違いを犯した?
他の人はデザインについて何を学んだんだろう?
この問題を考え始めると、さまざまな分野における美の概念の共通項の多さに驚くだろう。
良いデザインに関して同じ原則が何度も何度も出て来るのだ。
良いデザインは単純である。 数学から絵画に至るまでこの文句を聞いたことがあるだろう。
数学では、これは短い証明ほど良いものである傾向があるということだ。
特に公理に関しては少ない方が良い。 プログラミングにおいても同じことが言える。
建築家とデザイナーにとっては、この原則は、美とは表面的な装飾で溢れさせることではなく、
少数のよく考えられて選ばれた要素から組みたてられるものだということだ。
( 装飾それ自体は悪いものではないが、特徴に欠ける中身を隠すものであってはならない ) 。
同じように、絵画においては、よく観察されてしっかり型取られた少数の静物の方が、
例えばレースの襟なんかを無意味に繰り返し描いたものよりはおもしろいものになるだろう。
文章においてはこういうことだ。言いたいことを簡潔に言え。
単純さをわざわざ強調しなければならないというのは不思議なことだ。
何もしなければ単純になるだろうと思うかもしれない。
装飾をつけるのはもっと大変な仕事じゃないかと。
だが、人々が創造的であろうとする時、何か不思議な力がやってくる。
駆け出しの小説家は普段話している言葉とかけ離れたおおげさな言い回しを使いたがる。
デザイナーは芸術的であろうとして、 画家は表現主義者になる。 これらはみな言い逃れだ。 長ったらしい単語や「表現主義的な」絵のタッチの下には、
実は大した中身がない。それって恐いことじゃないか。
単純でなければならないと強制されれば、ほんとうの問題と向き合わなければならなくなる。
装飾を見せられないなら、実体を見せなくちゃならない。
良いデザインは永遠である。 数学では間違いが無い限り全ての証明は永遠だ。
じゃあハーディが醜い数学は生き残らないと言った意味はなんだろう。
それはケリー・ジョンソンが言ったのと同じことだ。
醜いものは最良の解にはなり得ない。 きっとより良い解があるはずで、いずれ誰かがそれを発見するだろう。
色褪せない解を目標にするのは最良の解を見付ける良い方法だ。
誰かが自分よりうまい方法を見付けるだろうと思っているくらいなら、
その方法を自分で見付けなくちゃ。 最も偉大な人々はこの方法を突き詰めたおかげで、
後から来る人が改善する余地がほとんどないものを
作り上げた。デュラー以降の版画家は彼の影の中で生きることを強いられるのだ。
色褪せない解を目標にするのは、流行にはまるのを避ける良い方法でもある。
その定義からして流行は時間とともに変化する。
ずっと未来にも良く見えるものを作れたとすれば、
それはそのものの真価が受け入れられたわけで、流行に乗ったからではない。
ちょっとひねったアイディアだが、もし未来の世代にも気に入られるものを作りたいなら、
過去の世代にも気に入られるものを作ろうとするのも一つの方法だ。
未来がどうなるかを予測するのは難しいが、
現在の流行に左右されないという意味では過去も同じようなものだ。
だから現在の人々に好まれて、しかも1500年の人々にも好まれたであろうものが作れれば、
それが2500年の人々にも好まれるであろう可能性は高い。
良いデザインは正しい問題を解決する。 よくある台所のレンジは4つの火口が四角に並んでいて、
それぞれを調節するつまみがついている。
このつまみをどうやって配置したらいいだろう。
一番簡潔な答えはそれを横一列に並べることだ。 だがそれは、間違った問いに対する簡潔な答えなのだ。
つまみは人が使うものだ。つまみが横一列に並んでいたら、
不幸なユーザーは毎回どのつまみがどの火口に対応しているかを考えなければならないだろう。
火口と同じようにつまみを四角に配置した方が良い。
悪いデザインの多くは、勤勉であるが勘違いした仕事の結果だ。 20世紀中盤に、文章をサンセリフ [ 訳 註4 ] で組版するのが流行ったことがあった。
確かに装飾無しのフォントの方がもともとの文字の形に近い。
しかし文章において、それは解くべき問題ではないのだ。
読みやすさのためには文字同士が区別しやすいことの方が重要だ。
ビクトリア王朝風に見えたとしても、 Times Roman書体の小文字のgは小文字のyと容易に区別が付く。
解と同じように、問題も改善してゆける。 ソフトウェアでは、追跡不可能な問題を、等値でしかも解くのが容易な問題へと
置き換えることが出来る場合が多い。 物理学は、観察した事象を経典と調和させることが課題だった時代より、
事象を予測することが課題になってからずっと速く進歩するようになった。
良いデザインは想像力を喚起する。 ジェーン・オーステンの小説には叙述がほとんどない。
いろんなものがどんなふうに見えるかを説明するかわりに、
彼女は物語を実にうまく語るので、あなたは情景を目に浮かべることができるのだ。
同様に、色々想像できる絵画の方が全部描いてあるものよりも見ていて飽きない。
誰もがモナ・リサに関して自分だけの物語を作り上げる。
この原則は建築とデザインにおいては、建物や品物は人々が使いたいように使えるべきである
ということになる。例えば良いビルディングは、そこに住む人々が自分の生きたいように
生活を送る背景となるべきであり、建築家の書いたプログラムを実行しているように生きる
ためであってはならない。
ソフトウェアにおいては、ユーザーが自分の思う通りにまるでレゴのように
組み合わせることができる少数の基本要素を提供すべきだ。
数学においては、多くの新しい発見の基礎となるような証明の方が、
難しいけれど新しい発見へとつながらない証明より望ましい。
一般に科学では引用が真価の目安となる。
良いデザインはしばしばちょっと滑稽だ。 これはいつでも正しいというわけではないかもしれない。
でも、デュラーの版画や サーリネンのウーム・チェア、 そしてパンテオンや 初代のポルシェ911は、 私にとってはちょっとばかり滑稽に見える。
ゲーデルの不完全性定理がプラクティカルジョークに思えてくるほどだ。
私が思うに、これはユーモアが力と関連しているからだ。
ユーモアのセンスがあることは、力強くあることである。
ユーモアのセンスを持ち続けるということは、不幸な出来事も肩をすくめてやり過ごせるということだし、
ユーモアを失うということは、そういう出来事で傷ついてしまうということだ。
そして、力強さのしるし、あるいは特長は、自分のことを深刻に考えすぎないということだ。
この自信は、しばしば過程の全てをちょっとばかり茶化すようなところがある。
ヒッチコックが彼の映画でやったように。あるいはブリューゲルが彼の絵画でやったように。
この点に関してはシェークスピアも同様だ。
良いデザインが常におもしろおかしくなければならないというわけじゃない。
でも、良いデザインでかつユーモアを感じないものを想像するのはとても難しい。
良いデザインをするのは難しい。 素晴らしい仕事をした人々を見ると、 彼らに共通することは非常に頑張ったということだ。
実際、頑張っていないのなら、それは時間の無駄というものだ。
困難な問題は多大な努力を要求する。 数学では難しい証明には技巧的な解法が必要で、それはまた興味深いものにもなる。 工学でも同様だ。
山を登る時は、不必要なものは荷物から捨ててゆくだろう。
同じように、建築家は難しい建築物や限られた予算を前にすれば、
エレガントなデザインを強いられることを悟るだろう。
流行や華美な装飾は、そもそも問題を解くという困難な仕事の中に入って来る余地が無いのだ。
どんな頑張りでも良いというわけではない。良い苦しみと、悪い苦しみがある。
走っているときに感じるような苦しみなら結構だが、釘を踏み抜いた時のような 苦しみは御免だ。 困難な問題はデザイナーにとって良いものだが、
気まぐれな顧客や信頼できない素材はそうではない。
美術では、伝統的にもっとも価値を認められてきたのが人物画であった。
この伝統には、単に人の顔が他の絵の押さない我々の脳内のボタンを押すとかいうことだけじゃない理由がある。
人間が人の顔を見分ける能力があまりに優れているため、
人の顔の画を描く者は観る者を満足させるためには非常な努力をしなければならないのだ。
木を描いて、枝の角度を5度ばかり変えたとしても、誰も気が付くまい。
だが、誰かの目を5度傾けて描いたら、みんな気づくだろう。
バウハウスのデザイナーがサリヴァンの「形態は機能にしたがう」という方針を
採用した時、彼らが意図したのは「形態は機能にしたがうべきである」ということだった。
そして機能が難しいものであるなら、形態もそれに従わざるを得ない。
誤りを犯す余地は無いからだ。野性の動物が美しいのは、彼らが困難な生を生きているからだ。
良いデザインは簡単に見える。 偉大な陸上選手のように、偉大なデザイナーはデザインをいとも簡単に見せる。
ほとんどの場合、それは幻想だ。読みやすい会話調の良文は8回目の書き直しでようやく得られる。
科学や工学では、いくつかの偉大な発見はあまりにも単純に見えて、
「これなら自分でも思い付いたよ」と言いたくなることがある。
発見者はこう言うだろう。「じゃあ君が思い付けば良かったじゃないか。」
レオナルド・ダ・ヴィンチの肖像画のいくつかはほんの数本の線にすぎない。
それを見て人はこう考えるかもしれない。美しい肖像画を描くには、
正しい位置に8本か10本ばかりの線をおけば良いだけだと。 確かにその通り。 だが、それらの線は完璧に正しい位置に置かれなければ。
ほんのわずかの誤りがすべてを駄目にしてしまう。
実際、線画は限りない完璧さを要求するために、視覚的な媒体として最も難しいものだ。
数学で言えば、それは閉じた形の解にあたる ; 劣った芸術家は、実際、同じ線画という問題を何度も近似を繰り返すことにより解いているわけだから。
子供が10歳くらいで絵を描くことをあきらめてしまうひとつの理由は、
大人がやるように描こうとするからで、 最初に試すことの一つが顔の線画だったりする。やれやれ。
多くの分野で、一見簡単そうなことは練習によってもたらされる。
練習の効用とは、意識しなければできなかったことがらを無意識の中でできるようにすることなんだろう。 実際に身体を鍛えなければならない場合もある。 熟練したピアニストは、頭から手に信号が送られるよりも速く音符を弾くことができる。 同じように絵描きも、練習の後には、人が足で自然にリズムを取るように視覚の認識が目からそのまま手に流れるようになるのだろう。
いわゆる 「没入している時」というのは、脊髄が全てを制御下に置いている時だと思う。
脊髄はためらわないし、意識をより難しい問題に使えるように解放してくれる。
良いデザインは対称性を使う。 対称性は簡潔さに到達する方法の一つだと思うが、ここで別項目として挙げておくに足る
重要性があると思う。自然は対称性をよく使っていて、それは良い指標だ。
対称性には2種類ある。繰り返しと再帰だ。 再帰とは、葉脈の模様のような、部分構造への繰り返しと言っても良い。
いくつかの分野では、過去に濫用されたために、今では対称性は流行らないものとされている。
建築家はビクトリア朝時代に意識的に非対称な建築を始め、1920年代には非対称性は
近代建築の前提とされた。それでも、これらの建築物は主要な軸に対してのみ
非対称であることが多い。その中にはたくさんの小さな対称性がある。
文章の中にも、文中の句から小説の筋書きに至るまでさまざまな階層で、対称性を見て取ることが出来る。
音楽や美術でもそうだ。 モザイク画や、セザンヌの作品のいくつかは、
限られた基本要素から全体の画を組み立てることで視覚的なインパクトを高めている。
対称的なコンポジションは、特に二つの部分が互いに反応している場合、
最も印象に残る絵画となる。例えば アダムの創造や、 アメリカン・ゴシック のような作品だ。
数学や工学では、再帰が特に有用だ。 帰納法による証明は素晴らしく短い。
ソフトウェアでは、再帰的で解ける問題はほとんどの場合、それが最良の解法だ。
エッフェル塔が印象的なのは、おそらくその塔の上に塔がある再帰的な構造にその一部を負っている。
対称性、特に繰り返しの危険なところは、それが深く考える代わりに
使われてしまい得るという点だ。
良いデザインは自然に似る。 自然に似ているからとにかく良い、というのではなく、
自然は問題を解くのに非常に長い時間をかけてきたから、参考にする価値がある。
あなたの解が自然の解に似ていたら、それは良いしるしだ。
模倣することは悪いことではない。 物語は人生のようであるべきだということに反対する人はほとんどいない。
絵画でも、生活から始めるのは良い方法だが、その役割はよく誤解される。
単に記録を取るのが目的なのではない。 生活の中から素材をとるポイントは、精神が咀嚼するものを与えてくれるからだ。
素材を見ている間に、手がよりおもしろい仕事をしてくれる。
工学でも自然を模倣することができる。 船は昔から動物の胸部のように、肋骨と背骨を備えていた。
ただ、より良い技術を待たねばならない場合もある。
初期の飛行機の設計者は飛行機を鳥に似せようとしていた。
十分に軽い素材や動力も無く(ライト兄弟のエンジンは68kgでほんの12馬力しか出なかった ) 、
鳥のように飛ばせるだけの制御機構も無い時代には、そのような設計は間違いである。
だが私は、これから50年のうちに、鳥のように飛ぶ小さな無人の偵察機が作られるのではないかと想像する。
十分な計算力を手にした現在、我々は自然の結果だけでなくその手法までも模倣することができる。
遺伝的アルゴリズムは通常の手法では複雑すぎる設計をも行うことができるだろう。
良いデザインは再デザインだ。 最初からうまくできるということは滅多にない。
熟練者は初期の仕事は捨てるつもりでやる。計画が変更されることを予定してかかるのだ。
仕事を捨てるのには自信が必要だ。 「 ここまで出来たのなら、もっと出来るはずだ。」こう考えることができなくちゃならない。
例えば絵を描き始めたばかりの人は、うまく描けなかった部分をやり直したがらない。
ここまで出来たのはラッキーだった、これ以上何かやったら悪くしてしまうかもしれない、
そう思ってしまうのだ。 やり直す代わりに、そんなに悪くないじゃないか、多分こう描くのが良かったんだと、
人は自分を納得させてしまう。
危険な領域だ。むしろ、不満足な点を突き詰めなければ。 ダ・ヴィンチの絵画 には、しばしば5回も6回も線を正そうとした跡が見て取れる。
ポルシェ911の特徴的な背面は、ださい 試作品があって初めて生まれた。 ライトのグッゲンハイム の初期の計画では、右半分はジグラット [ 訳 註5 ] 形式になる はずであった。彼は後にそれを現在の形へと改めた。
間違うのは自然なことだ。間違いを大失敗のように考えるのではなく、
簡単に見付けて簡単に直せるようにしておくことだ。
ダ・ヴィンチは絵画においてより多くの可能性を試すことができるように
スケッチを発明したと言っても、当たらずとも遠からずであろう。
オープンソースソフトウェアはバグの可能性を認めているがゆえにバグが少ない。
変更を簡単にしておく媒体を持つことは助けになる。
15世紀に油絵がテンペラを置き換えて、画家たちは人物画のような難しい対象に
取り組みやすくなった。テンペラと違って、油絵具は混ぜたり塗り重ねたりできるからだ。
良いデザインは模倣する。 模倣に対する態度はしばしば一巡する。初心者は知らず知らずのうちに模倣する。 そのうち、彼は意識的に独自性を出そうとする。 最後に、独自性よりも正しくあることがより重要だと気づく。
気づかずに模倣することは、ほぼ間違い無く悪いデザインをもたらす。
どこから自分のアイディアが来たのか知らない場合、
たぶんあなたは模倣者の模倣をしている。 ラファエルは19世紀中ごろの美術界を席巻したため、
その時代に画家を志した者のほとんどは彼を模倣していた。 ラファエル前派 [ 訳 註6 ] が反発したのは ラファエル自身の作品よりも、そういった風潮であった。
志有る人は単なる模倣では満足しない。 センスの成長の次の段階では意識的に独自性を出そうとする。
最も偉大な作り手達は、ある種の滅私状態に達するのではないかと私は思う。
彼らは正しい答えを知りたいだけなのだ。そしてもし、
答えの一部が誰かによって発見されていたのなら、それを利用しない手はない。
誰かの仕事を借りても自分のビジョンは曇らないという十分な自信があるのだ。
良いデザインはしばしば奇妙だ。 もっとも優れた仕事のいくつかは、妖しい性質を帯びている。 オイラーの公式、 ブリューゲルの雪中の狩人、 SR - 71 、 Lisp。 これらは単に美しいだけでなく、奇妙な美しさを持っている。
何故だか私にはわからない。単に私が鈍いだけなのかもしれない。
缶切りは犬にとって神秘的に見えるだろう。 私がもっと賢かったら、ei*pi = - 1 であるような世界が 一番自然に思えるのかもしれない。結局のところ、それが真理なのだから。
私がここで挙げた良いデザインの性質の多くは意識して作り出してゆくことができるが、
この奇妙さに関してだけはそうはいかないと思う。せいぜい出来るのは、奇妙さが現れて来た時に
それを潰さないように気を付けることくらいだ。
アインシュタインは相対性理論をわざわざ奇妙にしようとしたわけではなかった。
ただ正しくしようとして、その結果奇妙な真実が現れたのだ。
私がアートスクールで学んでいた時、学生は何を置いても自分のスタイルを確立したがっていた。
だが、ただ良いものを作ろうとすれば、必然的にそれを他とは違ったやり方でするようになるのだ。
ちょうど歩き方が人それぞれであるのと同じように。
ミケランジェロは、ミケランジェロのように描こうとしたわけではなかった。
ただうまく描こうとして、その結果どうしてもミケランジェロのように描いてしまったのである。
唯一持つべきスタイルは、どうしてもそうなってしまう、というようなものだ。 特に奇妙さにおいてはそうだ。そこに至る近道はない。 マンネリスト、ロマン派、そし
て2世代にわたるアメリカの高校生達が探した 北西航 路 [ 訳 註 7 ] は存在しないようだ。 そこに至る唯一の方法は、良いものをひたすら求めて、 気が付くと反対側に出ていた、というようなものでしかあり得ない。
良いデザインは集団で生起する。 15世紀のフィレンツェには、 ブルネレスキ、ギベルティ、ドナテルロ、マザッチョ、フィリッポ・リッピ、
フラ・アンジェリコ、ヴェロッキオ、ボッティチェリ、レオナルド・ダ・ヴィンチ、そしてミケランジェロがいた。
その当時、ミラノはフィレンツェとほぼ同規模の都市だった。
あなたは何人のミラノ出身のアーティストを挙げることができるだろうか。
15世紀、フィレンツェには何かが起こっていたのだ。
それは現在に続いてはいないから、血統のせいではないと言える。
レオナルド・ダ・ヴィンチやミケランジェロに何らかの生まれながらの能力が備わっていたとしても、
ミラノにも同様の能力を持った人はいたはずだ。ではミラノのレオナルドには何が起こったのだろう。
現在、アメリカ合衆国には15世紀のフィレンツェの人口の約1000倍の人々が住んでいる。
1000人のレオナルド、1000人のミケランジェロが我々の中にいるはずだ。
DNAが全てを支配するなら、こんにち我々は毎日のように素晴らしい芸術に驚嘆している
はずではないか。現実はそうではない。レオナルドがレオナルドになるには、
生まれながらの能力以上の何かが必要なのだ。1450年のフィレンツェが必要なのだ。
関連した問題を解こうとしている才能ある人々のコミュニティほどパワフルなものはない。
それに比較すれば遺伝子の影響なんて小さなものだ。 遺伝子的にレオナルドであるだけでは、フィレンツェではなくミラノに生まれてしまった
不利を打ち消すことはできない。 現代では人々の移動は激しいが、良い仕事は依然としてごく少数の「ホットスポット」から
集中して出てくる。バウハウス、マンハッタンプロジェクト、「ニューヨーカー」、
ロッキードのスカンクワークス、そしてゼロックスのParc。
どんな時代にも、少数のホットなトピックがあり、それに向けて多くの仕事をなす少数の集団がいる。
それらの中心から遠く離れてしまっていては、良い仕事をするのはほとんど不可能だ。
このような流れを押しよせたり引き寄せたりすることはある程度できるが、
完全に逃れることは出来ない。 ( いや、あなたなら出来るかもしれないけどね。でもミラノのレオナルドには出来なかった ) 。
良いデザインはしばしば大胆だ。 歴史のどの時代にも、あまりにばかげた考えを信じて、
村八分にされたり暴力にさらされる危険を犯してまでも言わずには居れなかった人々がいた。
我々の時代は違うというのならそれは素晴らしいことだ。
だが私の見る限り、我々の時代も同じだ。
この問題は全ての時代だけでなく全ての分野に影を投げかけてきた。
ルネッサンスの芸術の多くは当時はあまりに世俗的だと考えられた。

実際問題としては、美を想像するよりは醜に目をやる方が簡単だと思う。
美しいものを作った人々の多くは、彼らが醜いと思ったところを直していったのだと思える。
誰かが何かを見てこう考える：「俺ならもっとうまくできる」。
これが偉大な仕事の発端なのだろう。 ジョットは人々が何世紀にもわたって満足してきた方式で描かれたビザンチンのマドンナ像を見て、
無表情で不自然だと感じた。 コペルニクスは、同時代の他の学者が許容してきたツギハギにどうしても我慢できず、
もっと良い方法があるに違いないと感じたのだ。
醜いものを許せないだけでは十分ではない。 どこを直せば良いのか知る嗅覚を得るためには、その分野を十分に理解していなければならない。
しっかり勉強しなくちゃならないんだ。だがその分野で熟練者となれば、
内なる声が囁き出すだろう。「なんてハックだ!もっと良い方法があるはずだ」。
この声を無視してはいけない。それを追求するんだ。
厳しい味覚と、それを満足させる能力。それが偉大な仕事のためのレシピだ。

How many times have you started a new activity ( such as a personal project or exercise routine ) with a burst of enthusiasm , only to feel that initial loss of motivation ?
This often leads to depression and causes us to give up prematurely .
I ’ve experienced this letdown dozens of times myself .
But fortunately , with a bit of thought and reflection you can turn this negative emotion around .
The key to harnessing your emotions is understanding them .
The natural pattern of human emotion is peaks and valleys .
When we start a new project we ’re filled with tremendous optimism .
All we can think about is the expected benefits , and since we have n’t started yet , we are n’t aware of the difficulties involved .
This natural high causes a surge of mental and physical activity .
The peak is a great thing because the energy boost gets projects off the ground .
If you ’re a creative type like me , you know that this period is euphoric .
You feel like nothing can stop you .
The downside of this surge of energy is that it inevitably ends .
Exerting large amounts of energy wears you down , and after the initial optimism wears off we feel extremely tired .
However high you started off , you fall down just as low .
This causes a loss of confidence .
The combination of fatigue , scant results , and an awareness of impending adversity makes us want to give up .
From personal experience I ’ve learned a few ways to hold strong against negativity .
Be Prepared for a Letdown
Emotions , by nature , lose their power when we understand them .
Prove this to yourself .
Next time you get angry , take a moment to reflect on the reason behind the emotion .
When I step back and reflect , it ’s easy to see that my anger is caused by insecurity / selfishness / jealousy etc .
After I understand the cause my anger fades away .
The same technique applies to a loss of motivation .
Instead of giving into negativity , step back and analyze .
Look at the causes .
Are you tired , burned out , disappointed by the results ?
Are these feelings justified , or are they a by product of a low point in the emotional spectrum ?
To illustrate these ideas , I ’ll use my most recent project as an example , the creation of this site .
When I launched Pick the Brain it took an enormous amount of effort .
I was completely new to blogging , web design , and traffic building so there was a steep learning curve .
Writing new posts , setting up the site , and trying to build traffic took up nearly all my free time .
After about three weeks I was completely burned out .
I got depressed and started to question if the site was worth the effort .
I was n’t seeing any returns and I started to find enormous faults in my writing and the purpose of the site .
There were moments when I was resigned to failure .
One reason I was able to overcome this loss of motivation is that I prepared myself for a letdown .
Beforehand , I researched blogging and learned that it generally takes 9 - 12 months before a site begins to see significant traffic .
Knowing that my lack of success was perfectly normal helped me get over it .
The same is true for other endeavors .
If you know losing 20 pounds in a month is unrealistic , you ’ll be able to accept losing only 5 more easily .
I also knew my own emotions and was prepared for the initial emotional peak to pass .
When I was first inspired to launch a website , my expectations were through the roof .
Dreams of AdSense revenue danced in my head and I pictured throngs of loyal readers as if they already existed .
But because I understand my emotional pattern , I realized this optimism would give way to depression .
In the back of my mind , I foresaw the impending motivational battle , and when it came I was ready .
Reevaluate Your Strategy and Motivation
The passing of the emotional peak is a blessing in disguise because it allows us to reevaluate our plans from a fresh perspective .
At first we are blinded by our own optimism .
When we lose our motivation we can see gaping holes our in plan .
We can either get down on ourselves and give up , or we can use this negative emotion to discover our faults and correct them .
After I pulled myself out of the motivational cellar , I went back to all the negatives thoughts I ’d had and applied them to improving the site .
Having a pessimistic attitude opened my eyes .
It made me realistic about my abilities and expectations .
Emotional valleys bring us back to reality .
Without them we’d be raving lunatics with unlimited self - confidence .
Use a loss of motivation as an opportunity to reconsider what your motivation really is .
One reason I lost motivation is that I became too concerned with the financial aspect of blogging and lost sight of the real reason I started : sharing my passion for self improvement and the pursuit of happiness .
When I realigned my motivation with my passion , the lack of results did n’t matter .
My motivation returned because I realized connecting with people through my writing is an end in itself .
Even if this site never makes I dime , sharing my ideas and experiences to help other people is worth the effort .
In truth , sometimes giving up is the right decision .
If you started doing something for the wrong reasons you ’ll likely lose your motivation .
This is a good thing .
It allows us to see what really motivates us .
In these cases , the best choice is to move on to a new endeavor .
Do n’t fight self doubt , use it for your benefit .
Conclusion
Dealing with emotional highs and lows is an experience common to all people .
We generally accept our emotions as beyond our control .
They are powerful and mysterious and appear quite irrational .
But if we contemplate our emotions , if we explore the inner workings of our minds , we find that like all things , emotions obey the law of cause and effect .
Armed with this knowledge , we can continue to allow our emotions to dominate our lives , or we can use them to our benefit .
Do n’t be surprised by a loss of motivation and do n’t be disappointed by it .
Understand it as natural effect of the human mind , and utilize this knowledge of self to make your emotions work for you .

· Four former leaders to grill contestants in TV special · Winner to walk away with £ 22,500 in prize money
Some countries have elections .
Some countries have sectarian violence .
Others have civil war .
But in Canada , they do things differently .
Next March four former Canadian prime ministers will take part in a reality TV show titled The Next Great Prime Minister .
The four will grill contestants on their leadership qualities before picking a winner in the one - hour TV special .
While other former leaders will be strutting the world stage - Jimmy Carter worrying about democracy , Bill Clinton about poverty - former Canadian prime ministers Brian Mulroney , John Turner , Joe Clark and Kim Campbell will be donning their best clothes to question five contestants about the qualities needed to lead the nation .
But just what are those qualities ?
Are they looking for the staid approach of the incumbent , Stephen Harper , the stolid young conservative who put an end to 12 years of liberal rule this year ?
Or do Canadians hark back to racier times , to the days of Pierre Trudeau , the sandal - wearing liberal who danced behind the Queen 's back ?
Then there is Mr Mulroney , the straight - talking Reagan - hugging conservative who ruled Canada from 1984 - 1993 .
Or perhaps they prefer the role model offered by Ms Campbell , Mr Mulroney 's successor , whom he described as a " very vain person " .
For her model of a great Canadian prime minister , Ms Campbell chooses Lester Bowles Pearson , who led the country for five years in the mid-1960s .
" His bow tie , smile and slight lisp formed Canada 's face to the world , " she writes in an essay for the show .
" Pearson 's colleagues often regarded him as a weak and vacillating leader .
It was said that he told people what they wanted to hear , and held the views of the last person who spoke to him .
His governments were scandal - ridden . "
Mr Clark turns to the " passionate , difficult , courageous , western populist " John Diefenbaker , who ruled from 1957 - 63 .
Diefenbaker , lauded as a uniter , was none the less " suspicious and distrustful " , writes Mr Clark .
" His interest in the economy was casual . "
Contestants on the show , to be made by the national broadcaster , the CBC , are asked to submit a speech saying what they would do if they were prime minister .
The qualities the judges are looking for are clear : the bow - tie wearing , weak , vacillating contestant with the suspicious air should walk away with the £ 22,500 prize money .
We need only look to Britain .
In the name of security , they are pushing for a national ID card ; to get the card you must surrender extremely onerous information to the government for whatever nefarious uses they might find .
But do n’t worry , the program is optional .
If you do n’t want to give them the information , you do n’t have to .
But you ’ll never leave Britain again .
It seems that “ Big Brother ” is gaining ground in Great Britain .
Starting in 2009 , in order to apply for a passport , Britons will be required to register their fingerprints , facial scans and a host of personal information such as second homes , drivers licenses and insurance policy numbers .
If they do this , they will receive a national ID card and then their passport .
However , the program is not mandatory .
The British government has said that the program is voluntary and that people will be allowed to opt out .
However , those that do will be denied receiving a British passport .
Since the program has been proposed one in eight Britons has said that they would refuse to register their personal information with the government .
This could mean that up to five million people would be refused the right to travel outside of Great Britain .
Phil Booth , a member of the NO2ID group , said : “ The idea that ID cards scheme is voluntary , and people can opt - out , is a joke .
There are all sorts of reasons why people need to travel , not just for holidays .
There is work , visiting relatives .
What are these people supposed to do ?
It stretches the definition of voluntary beyond breaking point .
They will go to any length to get personal information for this huge database .
Who knows what will happen to it then ? ”
The notion that this is a voluntary program comes in since Britons need not receive one of the official ID cards , however in order to receive a passport they will still need to surrender their personal information and pay the full Â£ 93 price for an ID card and a passport .
So , in spite of the government ’s insistence that the program is mandatory , the only way in which Britons will be able to avoid the program entirely is if they never renew or apply for a passport again ; this means that those British citizens who refuse to participate for whatever reasons will effectively be compelled to stay in Great Britain for the rest of their lives , unable to leave the island nation for whatever reason .
The right to exit your country as a response to their tyranny is largely seen as fundamental .
That right will only exist in Britain until 2009 .
What happens when they link the same requirements to the RealID they ’re proposing here in the USA ?
An increasing number of US businesses are screening their customers against a US Treasury watchlist of suspected terrorists and drug traffickers , resulting in citizens with names similar to those on the list being denied services , according to a new report .
The report , released Tuesday by the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area ( LCCR ) , says that the list of " specifically designated nationals " ( SDNs ) kept by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) in the US Treasury Department has resulted in " stigma as well as delayed or denied consumer transactions " for " ordinary people even where there is no discernible relationship to national security . "
In recent years , a growing number of Americans have endured stigma and lost opportunities in ordinary consumer settings because their names are mistakenly flagged as being on a terrorist list .
This list of suspected terrorists , narcotics traffickers , and other " specially designated nationals " is maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) , and now includes over 6,000 names .
Financial institutions , credit bureaus , charities , car dealerships , health insurers , landlords , and employers are now checking names against the list before they open an account , close a sale , rent an apartment , or offer a job .
Few people in the United States are actually on the list .
But because many names on the OFAC list are common Muslim or Latino names - such as " Mohammed Ali " or " Carlos Sanchez " - people in this country with similar names are increasingly getting snagged .
Even a shared first or middle name , including some of the most common names in the world , can lead to consumer transactions being denied or delayed .
Moreover , at a time when Muslims , Arabs , and immigrants in the United States are already subject to prejudice and suspicion , it is hardly surprising that individuals from these vulnerable communities encounter problems from OFAC list misidentification .
The report notes that among those names on the OFAC list that could generate " false positives " are common names such as Abdul , Diaz , Lopez , Lucas , Gibson , and Patricia .
The LCCR report documents several cases of people who were denied services .
Tom and Nancy Kubbany of California were refused by a mortgage broker because Mr. Kubbany 's middle name is Hassan , an alias used by one of the sons of Saddam Hussein .
A Phoenix , Ariz. , couple was initially prevented from purchasing a home because the man 's first and last names , both common Hispanic ones , were similar to a name on the OFAC list .
Another California couple was flagged when buying exercise equipment because the man 's first name is Hussein .
This required investigation " because of Saddam Hussein , " according to a representative from the bank that provides financing to the exercise store 's customers .
The OFAC list predates September 11 , 2001 , but was expanded by President Bush soon after the attacks to include " specifically designated global terrorists , " to freeze the assets of those who commit or support terrorist acts .
The presidential order also expanded responsibility for engaging in transactions with those on the list to all US citizens , residents , and businesses .
In addition , the order made no exception for minimal transactions , so even a sale worth pennies could be penalized under the law .
Furthermore , regulations issued by the Treasury Department in 2003 made clear that while " willful " violations of the law could result in criminal penalties , even transactions without any " willful " intent to violate the law could trigger civil penalties .
Therefore , by its terms , the Executive Order extended liability to hair stylists , flower peddlers , hot dog vendors , or any Jane Doe who unwittingly sold a product or provided a service to a designated person .
Although portions of the presidential order were struck down in court , steep penalties for doing business with those on the list remain .
The LCCR report says that organizations can face fines of $ 500,000 for willful transactions with terrorists , $ 1 million for violating sanctions against Cuba , and $ 10 million for violating the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act .
The report notes that " even non -' willful ' violations can result in civil penalties , motivating businesses to take measures to prevent even inadvertent violations . "
The Washington Post reports that the Treasury recognizes how the lists ' regulations may makes things diffcult for businesses .
Molly Millerwise , a Treasury Department spokeswomen , acknowledged that there are " challenges " in complying with the rules but said that the department has extensive guidance on compliance , both on the OFAC Web site and in workshops with industry representatives .
She also said most businesses can root out " false positives " on their own .
If not , OFAC suggests contacting the firm that provided the screening software or calling an OFAC hotline .
" So the company is not only sure that they are complying with the law , " she said , " but they 're also being good corporate citizens to make sure they 're doing their part to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse by terrorists or [ weapons ] proliferators or drug traffickers . "
On its " Frequently Asked Questions " page , OFAC provides the following instructions about what to do when you encounter an SDN match .
If you have checked a name manually or by using software and find a match , you should do a little more research .
Is it an exact name match , or very close ?
Is your customer located in the same general area as the SDN ?
If not , it may be a " false hit . "
If there are many similarities , contact OFAC's " hotline " at 1-800-540-6322 for verification .
If your " hit " concerns an in - process wire transfer , you may prefer to e-mail your question to OFAC .
Unless a transaction involves an exact match , it is recommended that you contact OFAC Compliance before actually blocking assets .
The Post also reports that though use of OFAC list has become commonplace , some argue it is of little use .
" The law is ridiculous , " said Tom Hudson , a lawyer in Hanover , Md. , who advises car dealers to use the list to avoid penalties .
" It prohibits anyone from doing business with anyone who's on the list .
It does not have a minimum dollar amount .
...
The local deli , if it sells a sandwich to someone whose name appears on the list , has violated the law . " ... James Maclin , a vice president at Mid-America Apartment Communities in Memphis , which owns 39,000 apartment units in the Southeast , said the screening has become " industry standard " in the apartment rental business .
It began about three years ago , he said , spurred by banks that wanted companies they worked with to comply with the law .
David Cole , a Georgetown University law professor , has studied the list and at one point found only one U.S. citizen on it .
" It sounds like overly cautious companies have started checking the list in situations where there 's no obligation they do so and virtually no chance that anyone they deal with would actually be on the list , " he said .
" For all practical purposes , landlords do not need to check the list . "
The LCCR report recommends a reassessment of the OFAC list , including a rollback of its application to businesses where national security is not a concern and a study of its effect on civil rights .

New York City has long been a magnet for the young , well educated and ambitious .
According to a report published by the Census Bureau in 2003 , nearly 132,500 young , single , college - educated people poured into the New York metropolitan area between 1995 and 2000 , more than into any other metropolitan area in the United States .
“ Sometimes we underestimate how important that is in generating the city ’s creativity , ” said Frank Braconi , chief economist for the city comptroller ’s office .
“ To the degree that housing costs become a barrier to that group , it can in the long run sap us of that creative potential that we would otherwise have . ”
Brad Lander , director of the Pratt Center for Community Development , a nonprofit group , said young professionals get less attention than other financially struggling groups because they are more mobile and have options .
Though they , too , are wrestling with the city ’s shortage of lower - cost housing , they are seen as harbingers of gentrification .
Mr. Lander said a well - known strategy among landlords of buildings with rents regulated by the city is to seek out tenants who they imagine will not stay long , because they can often increase the rent when a tenant leaves .
“ Students as well as professionals , ” he said .
“ Plenty of landlords find this group an attractive set of folks to rent to , believing they ’ll be out in a couple of years . ”

Foley IM 's appear to be 3rd degree felony Brian Beutler and Ron Brynaert
Published : Monday October 2 , 2006 Print This Email
This A passing statement in an instant message conversation with a teenage page might provide investigators with a damning piece of evidence suggesting criminal behavior in the case of former congressman Mark Foley , RAW STORY has learned .
That instant message conversation from 2003 contains the following exchange : Teen : whered ya go this afternoon ( sic )
Maf54 : I am in pensecola - had to catch a plane Foley told the boy that he was chatting from a Pensecola hotel room on campaign business , although he had n't officially announced his intent to run for reelection to the House , yet .
In 2004 , Foley won with 68 percent of the vote .
Over the course of several pages of dialogue , that conversation became extraordinarily graphic , and included several direct references to masturbation techniques and frequency , discussion of the child 's penis size , and even the congressman 's explicit interest in sexual contact with the boy .
However , by acknowledging his Pensacola , FL location , Foley may have offered evidence of his violation of Florida state law Statute 847.0135 , which says : " Any person who knowingly utilizes a computer on - line service , Internet service , or local bulletin board service to seduce , solicit , lure , or entice , or attempt to seduce , solicit , lure , or entice , a child or another person believed by the person to be a child ... commits a felony of the third degree . "
An article in Monday 's New York Times referred to another Florida law , Statute 847.0137 which prohibits the " transmission of pornography by electronic device or equipment . "
" A Florida law makes it a third - degree felony , punishable by up to five years in prison , to transmit ' material harmful to minors by electronic device , ' " Adam Liptak reported for the Times .
" The law defines the material broadly to include descriptions of ' nudity , sexual conduct , or sexual excitement . ' "
Republican Leadership under fire
In the days since the extent of Foley 's transgressions were made public , questions have arisen about how much information House Republican leaders had about the Florida congressman 's sexual proclivities .
Today , House Speaker Dennis Hastert sought to clear up that confusion by releasing a statement which read in part , " No one in the Republican Leadership , nor Congressman Shimkus , saw those [ instant ] messages until last Friday when ABC News released them to the public . "
However , critics on both the right and the left have pointed out that ABC News was able to obtain the instant message conversation only days after learning about the less - explicit emails .
House leadership has known about those same emails since 2005 .
Among the harshest critics is David Bossie , head of the conservative group Citizens United .
He told the right wing publication Human Events , " Speaker Hastert had knowledge of Congressman Foley 's inappropriate behavior and chose to protect a potential pedophile and powerful colleague over a congressional page - Mr. Hastert should resign immediately . "
Other instant message conversations between Foley and underage boys do not contain clear indications of the congressman 's location , an ambiguity that may confuse which laws apply to him .
RAW STORY will continue to search for evidence of his whereabouts at the time of these online sessions .
It happens all the time : we get a resume that everyone thinks is really exciting .
Terrific grades .
All kinds of powerful - sounding jobs .
Lots of experience .
Speaks seventeen languages .
And saved over 10,000 kittens !
Look ! kittens !
And then I call them up , and I ca n’t stand talking to them .
Within ten minutes , I realize they are not going to make it as programmers .
I ’ve had people with great resumes tell me a pointer should fit in one byte .
Sometimes they just ca n’t answer the simplest questions , or you feel like you have to wrestle the answers out of them .
Before moving on to a full - fledged in - person interview , we usually use a phone screen to make sure that we ’re not wasting time and money on someone who is just seriously not smart .
A phone screen has distinct advantages over a normal in - person interview .
First , it ’s cheap .
It takes 45 minutes to an hour and actually does eliminate about half of the people who looked really , really good on paper .
More importantly , it ’s more fair .
With a phone interview , because you ca n’t see the person , it ’s easier to focus on the quality of what they ’re saying rather than other external factors not relevant to their job , like their appearance , or their nervousness .
Ever since Malcolm Gladwell wrote Blink , I ’ve been terrified of the prospect that we might be judging candidates too quickly based on things which are not relevant to their ability to do their job — their appearance or confidence or height or general nerdy demeanor might make us way more apt to look on everything else that happens during the interview with rose - colored glasses .
The great thing about a phone interview is that it ’s much harder to form these kinds of snap judgments ; you actually have to listen to what the person is saying and decide if that corresponds to what a smart person might say .
This is n’t completely true , of course : you may have prejudices about certain accents or dialects .
But at least you are moderately less susceptible to appearance prejudice .
My phone interviews have three parts .
In the first part , I ask the candidate to describe their career history and basically tell me about themselves .
This is mainly intended to get them loosened up and feeling comfortable , to eliminate any nervousness , and to let them sort of present themselves the way they want to be presented .
During this stage , you should be looking for evidence that the candidate is a problem solver : the kind of person who gets things done .
You ’re also looking for passion .
You want people who care about the stuff that they did .
During this part I ’ll drill down on two kinds of things : technology and politics .
Technology .
If someone tells me that they implemented such - and - such a project , I ’ll ask detailed questions about the technology they used and how they used it .
I ’ll also ask specifically what role they played .
Sole developer ?
Developer on a team ?
I ’ll tend to go into these questions in great detail , because this is where you uncover the people who either did n’t know what they were doing , or have made things up , or have exaggerated their own roles .
If someone ’s resume implies that they spent two years coding in Python , for example , I ’m going to drill down until I ’m pretty confident that it sounds like they really have two years of Python experience .
Do n’t hesitate to use trick questions .
I might say , “ I hate Python , because it ’s really tedious to declare all your variables .
That ’s why I like C better . ”
Python does n’t make you declare variables ( and C does ) .
Do n’t be afraid that the candidate will feel pressured to agree with your false assertion .
Smart programmers have a certain affinity for the truth , and they ’ll call you on it .
As Dave Winer says , “ You ca n’t lie to a compiler . ”
If they ’re really good , they ’ll find a way to be diplomatic about it .
But they ’re going to be passionate enough that they ’ll almost forget that they ’re in an interview .
That ’s a good sign .
Politics .
Behind the boring list of past employers on the resume , there ’s always a story .
What I ’m looking for is the story of how the candidate handled challenges in the past .
I ’m looking for people that got things done , even in the face of opposition .
I ’m looking for people who challenged the status quo , who overcame objections , and who made things happen .
So when the resume says , “ drove the adoption of . NET , ” I want to hear what drove means .
In detail .
When the resume says that they “ founded a company , ” I want to hear everything .
Whose idea was it ?
Who convinced whom ?
Who did what ?
Did it work out ?
Why not ?
The second part of the phone screen is the technical problem .
I usually ask the same question for years and years before switching it , because this makes it easier to compare candidates .
The question is a wide - ranging , open design question : how would you design a data structure or a block of code to do x ?
Where x is something kind of big and complicated .
I usually have a series of questions ready to guide the candidate down a particular path in the design of this data structure or block of code , because it ’s such a big question , and I can often tell how smart the candidate is by how far they get down that path in a fixed amount of time .
Here are some ideas to get you started :
How might you design a program that lets people play Monopoly with each other over the internet ?
What would be a good data structure for a photo editor ?
How would you implement code to operate the elevators in a high rise ?
How would you implement the rendering engine of a web browser ?
The ideal question takes something where the interviewee is deeply familiar with how the thing works from having used it , but is unlikely to have ever implemented it themselves .
You want something that can be done over the phone , without too much writing , so “ how would you write the code for quicksort ” is a bad question , because we do n’t expect programmers to be able to recite code over the phone .
You want to have a conversation about algorithms and data structures , really , the meat and potatoes of programming , where the goal is not to find the best possible answer , necessarily , but simply to give you the opportunity to talk about code , to talk about time / space tradeoffs , to talk about performance characteristics of code , all of which will add up to giving you a pretty good idea in your mind whether the person you ’re talking to is actually pretty good at programming and whether they ’re smart or not .
If you find yourself explaining everything three times , either you ’re terrible at explaining things , or you ’re talking to someone who is not that smart .
The bottom line in my interviewing technique is that smart people can generally tell if they ’re talking to other smart people by having a conversation with them on a difficult or highly technical subject , and the interview question is really just a pretext to have a conversation on a difficult subject so that the interviewer ’s judgment can form an opinion on whether this is a smart person or not .
The third and final part of the interview is letting the candidate interview me .
Remember , the whole philosophy of recruiting is predicated on the idea that smart candidates have a choice of where to work , and if that ’s true , the interview process is as much a way for the candidate to decide if they want to work for us as it is a way for us to decide if we want to hire the candidate .
“ Do you have any questions about Fog Creek , about working at Fog Creek , or anything else you want to ask me ? ”
Sometimes this part of the interview reveals a frightening lack of preparation by the candidate .
“ So , what exactly does Fog Creek do ?
And where are you located ? ”
Failing to do even the most basic homework before the interview , by spending five minutes on our web site , does not give me a great deal of confidence in the candidate ’s ability to be smart or to get things done .
By this point I ’ve already decided if this person seems smart enough to score an in - person interview .
So I treat the third part of the phone interview as if I were the one being interviewed , and the candidate was the one that had to be sold on Fog Creek .
Which they do .
Passing a phone screen is never enough to get hired .
It ’s nothing more than a simple filter designed to save time and expense on in - person interviews , and to eliminate candidates who will never make it before you ’ve flown them all the way across the country and put them up in a fancy hotel .
Still , even with the phone screen , probably only about one in three candidates makes it all the way through the in -person interview .
They were poor men , barefoot farm labourers with pinched cheeks and calloused hands .
But when they spoke , their bloodshot eyes flashed with cold steel .
Four days earlier Muhammad Aslam , 35 , and Maqbool Ahmed , 40 , had killed their younger sister and her lover .
It was a crude , gruesome death : the pair were battered with a brick and strangled with an old rope .
But the killers expressed not an ounce of remorse .
" We feel no shame .
They had been warned , " said Aslam , a slightly built father of eight .
" We did it for honour , " said Ahmed defiantly .
" In our society a man without honour is nothing . "
A man 's pride exacts a high price in hidebound rural Pakistan .
Almost every day a woman is beaten , clubbed or shot to death for what is euphemistically termed " adultery " - sex outside marriage .
In most cases the killer is a father , brother or uncle .
" There 's an increased brutalisation of society , " said Kamila Hyat of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , which recorded about 300 so - called honour killings in 2006 - about the same number as the previous year .
Occasionally one case is so shocking it dominates the news , even if for the wrong reason .
Initial reports about the Donga Bonga killings suggested the lovers had been tied to a tree and stoned to death .
The story was carried across the world .
The image resonated powerfully with perceptions of Pakistan being gripped by Islamic fundamentalists .
The reports were wrong .
There was no Taliban - style execution in Donga Bonga and Islam had little to do with it .
But the truth - a tale of roguish men , powerless women and the shortcomings of a frail state - is no less compelling .
By all accounts , Ghulam Nabi Shah was a villain of renown .
A burly man with a carefully combed moustache , he was the scion of a widely respected family in Chak Khatan , their home village .
His father , Hafiz Ahmed Shah , was a Sufi mystic who was honoured with a tinsel - draped shrine .
But Shah junior was more sinner than saint .
Several neighbours and the local police chief described Shah as a domineering character with a taste for banditry and bedding women .
" He was a terrorist and a bully , " said Zafar Bukhari , the district police officer .
" He would beat the people and steal from them .
We picked him up several times . "
Smuggling
Shah 's family was known to be involved in smuggling across the closed Indian border five miles away .
India pays poor Pakistanis to sell sensitive information in return for cheap wine , police officers claimed .
He was also adept at slipping from the law .
His record was expunged some years ago after the local police station caught fire .
Detectives said he was suspected of killing a rival five years ago but the case collapsed due to lack of witnesses .
" The villagers were even more sick of the other man , so nobody would come forward , " said Mr Bukhari .
His downfall was his affair with Elahi Sain .
The 35 - year - old woman had left her husband a year earlier after a 10 - year union that failed to produce any children .
Shah started secretly courting Sain , sneaking into her bedroom in the compound she shared with her brothers .
But word of the scandalous liaison escaped .
Ahmed and Aslam warned the couple to stop .
" It was a disgrace .
We went to Shah just after Eid [ a religious holiday in early January ] .
We pleaded with him to stop .
But he said we were talking rubbish , " said Ahmed .
The final straw came a week ago , when a voice drifted from Sain 's room just before midnight .
Enraged , the brothers barged through the door .
Inside they found Shah hiding under a bed .
Aslam wrestled him to the ground - " I bit his nose , " he recalled - while Ahmed beat his head with a brick .
Screaming curses ,
Shah reached for a pistol lying on a locker .
But he could n't make it .
Shah passed out as blood oozed from his cracked skull .
To finish the job , the brothers bound a rope around his neck and pulled .
Then they stormed into the next room , where Sain was cowering .
Screaming , they dragged her out by the hair and murdered her beside Shah 's body in exactly the same way .
Then they locked the door , called a neighbour and waited for the police .
" It was a good job , " said Aslam .
The murder has split opinions in Chak Khatan , a dirt - track Punjabi village surrounded by swaying mustard plants and freshly sprouting wheat .
On Friday about 100 mourners crowded on to rope - covered benches around Ghulam Nabi Shah 's mud-brick house .
His 12 - year - old son sat glumly in the middle .
" This was a political murder .
The woman was just an excuse , " thundered Akhtar Hussain , an uncle .
An equally large crowd gathered near the murder scene , where an open door led to a blood - smeared bedroom .
These men quietly approved of the killing .
" It was the correct thing to do , " said Sain 's estranged husband .
" She left me one year ago .
She was not a good woman . "
Gallows
Meanwhile , at nearby Donga Bonga jail , a burly warden watched over the two brothers , who claimed to have no fear of the gallows .
Pakistan has one of the world 's highest rates of capital punishment , with 7,400 prisoners on death row .
Fifty - four were hanged in the first six months of last year .
" If we die , Allah will look after our children , " said Ahmed flatly .
Rape and " honour killings " are an embarrassment to President Pervez Musharraf , who lightened the laws on " adultery " in November but under pressure from the religious right refused to abolish them entirely .
An incident last week in which a woman was gang - raped and paraded half - naked through her village brought fresh revulsion .
" Every rape is a blot on the nation 's tormented conscience , " said the respected Dawn newspaper .
But although " honour killings " are often linked to Islam , they are more often a product of a poor , uneducated and deeply feudalistic rural society .
Mr Bukhari , the police chief , said only schooling and greater prosperity - areas where Musharraf 's military - led government has failed to make much progress - would end the phenomenon .
Human rights groups say better policing would also help .
This week a police officer was shot in the shoulder during attempts to mediate in a land dispute between three brothers .
To apprehend the culprits the police took their wives and daughters into custody - in effect making them hostages .
" All unofficially , of course , " said one detective , who added that rough places required tough law .
" That 's always been the way of the Punjab police . "

A belated heads up to viewers of the PBS America at the Crossroads documentary featuring former assistant secretary of defense Richard Perle , “ The Case for War : In Defense of Freedom . ”
Midway through the documentary , Perle takes the film cameras and viewers with him to a Dubai hotel to meet an Iranian dissident who , Perle says , had just escaped from Iran .
( In fact , the Iranian , Amir Abbas Fakhravar , had flown out of Tehran airport on a normal commercial flight — more on that in a moment ) .
In the documentary , Perle and Fakhravar sit on a couch and Perle uses the young Iranian as a cipher upon which to project his views of why the U.S. should be promoting regime change in Iran .
( In a Wired magazine blog review , writer Sharon Weinberger captures the scene : “ ‘ Oh my God , is he gonna kiss him ? ’ my husband asked , as Perle gazed affectionately at Fakhravar ” ) .
Whatever the merits of the idea , it ’s worth reading my feature on Perle ’s chosen Iranian dissident cipher , “ Has Washington Found Its Iranian Chalabi : Introducing the Talented Mr. Fakhravar , ” to get a better feel for just what a Hollywood version of faux reality Perle is basing his beliefs upon — and potentially dragging the 82nd Airborne with him .
As I wrote :
But Fakhravar may be a false messiah .
In interviews with more than a dozen Iranian opposition figures , some of them former political prisoners , a different picture emerged — one of an opportunist being pushed to the fore by Iran hawks , a reputed jailhouse snitch who was locked up for nonpolitical offenses but reinvented himself as a student activist and political prisoner once behind bars .
Fakhravar and his supporters vehemently deny such allegations , saying that the attacks are motivated by petty jealousy and a vendetta by Fakhravar ’s enemies on the Iranian left .
For those like Perle who want the United States to eschew diplomacy in favor of backing regime change , Fakhravar is an essential link in the argument for confrontation with Iran . …
But by choosing Fakhravar , they may have inadvertently accomplished the opposite , exposing the ruptures in the pro-democracy movement and throwing into question the notion that America ’s problems with Tehran will be solved by a saffron revolution .
As later parts of the documentary show , Perle grew up in in the shadow of Hollywood , and as he says , many of his school friends ’ parents were blacklisted Hollywood writers .
Perle ’s wishes for the people of the Middle East to enjoy the benefits of democracy may be deeply well intentioned , but reality has not lived up to almost any of his pronouncements about Iraq .
The fact that Perle and the PBS film ’s producers seemingly failed to do any basic fact checking on Fakhravar ’s story is striking and fits the pattern .
As Perle ’s pre-war expounding about Iraq and ardent championship of Ahmad Chalabi have shown , these things do n’t often work out according to the movies .
Have you heard of an online service for kids called Webkinz ?
It ’s like a cross between cocaine and puppies .
Kids ca n’t resist it .
It ’s frickin’ brilliant .
Before you use the Webkinz service , you have to buy a stuffed animal that comes with a code .
You use that code to activate an animated character in an online world that looks like your stuffed animal .
The brilliant part is that your online critter will become sick if you do n’t regularly visit and care for it .
Somehow this makes kids emotionally invested .
Kids can earn fake money by playing games on the system .
That money goes toward caring for their online creatures , including buying furniture and so on .
Kids love it .
But I think kids are n’t the biggest market for this sort of thing .
I think single women would want an online boyfriend they could totally control .
But here ’s the hook :
The online boyfriend is a “ project . ”
If you do n’t sign into the system regularly , your online boyfriend will start dressing with clothes from the 80’s , smoking , gambling , staying out late , and flirting with other women .
It ’s the “ owner ’s ” job to make the virtual boyfriend eat right , exercise , look for a job , and trim his nose hair .
If he scratches his crotch or passes gas during an online dinner party , he gets no virtual sex for a week .
The women could earn fake online money by playing games just like in the Webkinz model .
For example , imagine a Tetris - type game where articles of clothing fall from above and you have to assemble them into coordinated outfits before they reach the ground .
You ca n’t tell me that would n’t be a hit .
Here are some more online game ideas for the virtual boyfriend site :
- Quickly identify which movie at the Cineplex would make a human feel the worst .
Send the online boyfriend to watch it .
- Send the online boyfriend to the drugstore for you and try to assemble a basket of items that is the most embarrassing .
- Make the online boyfriend carry a purse through a tough neighborhood without being beaten to death .
- How about a game set in a Mexican restaurant where all the tables have candles ?
The object is to navigate your online boyfriend around the tables and to the Men ’s room without him tooting too near the candles and setting the other diners aflame .
Do you have any more game ideas ?
Just a brief update in case you have n't caught the latest : Crave reports that James and his family are driving a 2005 silver Saab station wagon with license plate " DOESF . "
The official missing person report can be found here .
Officials investigating the case have narrowed their search to a stretch of Oregon 's Highway 38 , which is on the route that the family would most likely have taken to get to the Gold Beach motel where they had reservations .
We 're tracking the situation at our post from yesterday , so that 's the place to bookmark for now .
We 'll keep everybody updated as we learn more .
Also , our very sincerest thanks to all our readers -- many of whom obviously love CNET and James 's work there -- for their support and compassion .
We 're all hopeful the Kim family will return safely soon .
A draft memo to Wal - Mart 's board was obtained from Wal - Mart Watch , a nonprofit group , allied with labor unions , that asserts that Wal - Mart 's pay and benefits are too low .
Tracy Sefl , a spokeswoman for Wal - Mart Watch , said someone mailed the document anonymously to her group last month .
When asked about the memo , Wal - Mart officials made available the updated copy that actually went to the board .
Under fire because less than 45 percent of its workers receive company health insurance , Wal - Mart announced a new plan on Monday that seeks to increase participation by allowing some employees to pay just $ 11 a month in premiums .
Some health experts praised the plan for making coverage more affordable , but others criticized it , noting that full - time Wal - Mart employees , who earn on average around $ 17,500 a year , could face out - of - pocket expenses of $ 2,500 a year or more .
Eager to burnish Wal - Mart 's image as it faces opposition in trying to expand into New York , Chicago and Los Angeles , Wal - Mart 's chief executive , H. Lee Scott Jr. , also announced on Monday a sweeping plan to conserve energy .
He also said that Wal - Mart supported raising the minimum wage to help Wal - Mart 's customers .
The theme throughout the memo was how to slow the increase in benefit costs without giving more ammunition to critics who contend that Wal - Mart 's wages and benefits are dragging down those of other American workers .
Ms. Chambers proposed that employees pay more for their spouses ' health insurance .
She called for cutting 401 ( k ) contributions to 3 percent of wages from 4 percent and cutting company - paid life insurance policies to $ 12,000 from the current level , equal to an employee 's annual earnings .
Life insurance , she said , was " a high - satisfaction , low - importance benefit , which suggests an opportunity to trim the offering without substantial impact on associate satisfaction . "
Wal - Mart refers to its employees as associates .
Acknowledging that Wal - Mart has image problems , Ms. Chambers wrote : " Wal - Mart 's critics can easily exploit some aspects of our benefits offering to make their case ; in other words , our critics are correct in some of their observations .
Specifically , our coverage is expensive for low - income families , and Wal - Mart has a significant percentage of associates and their children on public assistance . "
I did a double - take when I read the headline .
I found this on the BBC website last night , and I re-read the page just to make sure it was n’t some tabloid journalism .
Tell me what you think ?
Looking for more information about this turned up really little .
Do any of you know if there ’s any …

As a judge and highly successful barrister , Charles James Monckton Miskin QC is used to dealing with deceit on a criminal level .
During the complex fraud trials in which he specialises , his brilliant legal mind cuts through the elaborate web of lies woven by many of those he encounters in court .
Scroll down for more ...
Privately , however , the 54 - year - old married father of seven used his intellectual agility to commit deception on a monstrous scale .
Last year , having lied to his family and friends , he abandoned his pregnant wife to set up home with his married former college sweetheart .
The sorry tale of how one of Britain 's most respected lawyers destroyed two happy families is as tangled as one of Miskin QC 's cases .
It involves - among other things - a secret love affair spanning almost four decades , a wedding to his second wife at which his wealthy heiress mistress , Catherine Kennaugh , was a guest , and later a street brawl with his lover 's cuckolded husband - an encounter that left Miskin 's fine cashmere sweater covered in blood .
It 's all a far cry from the hushed atmosphere of the courtroom - and certainly not the kind of behaviour expected of a judge .
But , as we shall see , Judge Miskin 's behaviour has been anything but honourable .
The roots of this extraordinary story can be traced back to the 1970s when Charles Miskin , an old boy of Charterhouse , first met Catharine .
He was reading Jurisprudence at Worcester College , Oxford .
She was studying History of Art at Cambridge .
They briefly became lovers , but their relationship evolved instead into a close friendship .
They were close enough that they attended each other 's weddings : Catharine to Patrick Kennaugh , a onetime antique toy seller , now a successful art dealer in Fulham ; Miskin to his first wife , glamorous Karen Booth , with whom he had four children .
Patrick Kennaugh vividly remembers his first encounter 30 years ago with Charles Miskin , a former chairman of the Bar Theatrical Society - for the most unlikely reason .
The cigar - chomping young lawyer , who was among guests at a party at his wife 's parents ' house , was wearing mascara .
' I light - heartedly asked him about that , ' recalls Patrick .
' He kept denying it until , finally , I joked with him that if I was in a court of law and produced a witness from Max Factor who testified that he was indeed wearing make - up , how would he answer ?
' Then he grudgingly admitted it .
It was the late 1970s and he was just making his way as a junior barrister .
He always a flamboyant , theatrical figure . '
The Kennaughs - joint proprietors of the Hollywood Road art gallery in Fulham for the past 24 years - saw Miskin marry first wife Karen near London 's High Court in 1982 , and the Miskins were frequent guests at dinner parties held by the couple at their house overlooking the Thames in Putney , South - West London .
But Patrick Kennaugh could never have suspected that Miskin harboured a secret affection for his wife Catharine , who found the tall , dashing barrister 's company hugely entertaining over the years .
In fact , some years later Miskin left his wife , Karen , and in the mid-Nineties he moved in with fellow barrister Angharad Start at a fourstorey house in a leafy enclave of Stockwell , South London .
By now his career was going from strength to strength .
He was named among the ' Best of the Next Generation ' by influential The Lawyer magazine in 1996 , became a QC two years later , and shone in the highly specialised - and equally lucrative - field of criminal fraud .
Thanks to long , drawn - out trials and fat fees , his salary rose to around £ 500,000 a year .
While his career flourished , he and Angharad had two children together .
Their life , for all the world , seemed complete .
Indeed , in 2005 , they chose to seal their union with a lavish wedding ceremony at Southwark Cathedral in London , after which guests were ferried by paddle steamer to Chelsea Physic Garden .
After taking their seats inside the vast marquee erected in the grounds of the 17th - century walled gardens , the audience guffawed politely when Miskin 's best man quipped : ' I hope this is the last time I 'm called upon to perform this ceremony for you , Charles . '
Had anyone glanced at 50 - year - old Catharine Kennaugh at that moment , sitting close to the bridal table next to her husband , Patrick , they might have noticed the merest suggestion of a nervous blush on her face .
In fact , for the previous year , she had been committing adultery with Judge Miskin , the man she first fell in love 30 years earlier when they were both Oxbridge students .
Less than a year after that idyllic summer wedding , Judge Miskin dropped his domestic bombshell , walking out on Angharad - despite the fact she was six months pregnant with their third child - and announcing his affair with Catherine Kennaugh through email which he sent both to his wife and his love rival , Kennaugh .
Summing up his predicament in the kind of restrained , erudite language usually reserved for the courtroom , he wrote : ' Sentimental affection turned into a private and sexual excitement .
C's ( Catharine's ) and my relationship - I will not call it an affair - started long ago , with incidents in 1978 , 1991 and 2004 . '
As Patrick Kennaugh soon discovered , such ' incidents ' blossomed into a fully - fledged love affair , and Miskin and Catharine were seeing each other on most days behind their respective partners ' backs .
Often they met at the flat in Fulham which Miskin had inherited from his late father , Nigel , just across the Thames from the Kennaughs ' family home .
As Patrick puts it : ' I have no idea why he married Angharad after they 'd been together for nearly ten years - especially as he was having an affair with my wife .
' How could he make his marriage vows in the full knowledge that he was carrying on an affair at the time - and with a woman sitting in the congregation ? '
Patrick is hurt and angry , but says he feels more for Miskin 's spurned wife Angharad than he does for himself .
' Her personal and professional pride has been severely dented , ' he says .
' She 's a tough , well - skilled barrister herself , but make no mistake , it 's a man 's world and she 's junior to him .
She 's been battered from all sides .
' It was reprehensible to have led her down the garden path to get married and have a third baby , considering what he was up to .
' My wife was also the last to know about Angharad being pregnant , which is equally bad since he was carrying on with Catharine at the same time . '
It was February 2006 when Catharine - who stands to inherit a £ 3 million fortune from her godmother , who lives in Argentina - first told her husband she was leaving him for Miskin .
It was one of their grown - up sons who dropped the bombshell news to
It appears that the skin , the largest organ in our body , is a kind of zoo and some of the inhabitants are quite novel , according to a new study .
Researchers found evidence for 182 species of bacteria in skin samples .
Eight percent were unknown species that had never before been described .
It is the first study to identify the composition of bacterial populations on the skin using a powerful molecular method .
Not only were the bacteria more diverse than previously estimated , but some of them had not been found before , says Martin J. Blaser , M.D. , Frederick King Professor and Chair of the Department of Medicine and Professor of Microbiology at NYU School of Medicine , one of the authors of the study .
" The skin is home to a virtual zoo of bacteria , " he says .
This study is published February 5 , 2007 , in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The researchers analyzed the bacteria on the forearms of six healthy subjects ; three men and three women .
" This is essentially the first molecular study of the skin , " says Dr. Blaser .
The skin has been , he says , terra incognita , an unknown world that he and his colleagues have set out to understand much like explorers .
" There are probably fewer than ten labs in the U.S. looking at this question , " says Dr. Blaser .
" It is very intensive work , " he adds .
Zhan Gao , M.D. , senior research scientist in Dr. Blaser 's lab , led the research , which took more than three years to complete .
Some of the bacteria on the skin appear to be more or less permanent residents ; others are transient , according to the study .
This research is part of an emerging effort to study human microbial ecology .
Dr. Blaser 's laboratory has previously examined the bacterial population in the stomach and the esophagus .
" Many of the bacteria of the human body are still unknown , " he says .
" We all live with bacteria all our lives and occasionally we smile , so they 're not that bad for us . "

The most numerous cells in our body are microbial -- they outnumber our cells 10 to 1 .
The body has microbes native to the body , including the skin , and these populations change according to how we live , he says .
" Ultimately what we want to do is compare disease and health , " says Dr. Blaser .
Keeping bacterial populations in our body stable may be part of staying healthy , he says .
In the new study , the researchers took swabs from the inner right and left forearms of six individuals picking the region halfway between the wrist and the elbow for its convenience .
" It 's not where they wash their hands , " explains Dr. Blaser .
" And they do n't have to undress . "
The researchers wanted to be able to compare two similar parts of the body .
Because they also wanted to study change over time , they took swabs from four of the individuals 8 to10 months after the first test .
Roughly half , or 54.4 % , of the bacteria identified in the samples represented the genera Propionibacteria , Corynebacteria , Staphylococcus and Streptococcus , which have long been considered more or less permanent residents in human skin .
The six individuals differed markedly in the overall composition of the bacterial populations on their skin .
They only had four species of bacteria in common : Propionibacterium acnes , Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum , Streptococcus mitis , and Finegoldia AB109769 .
" This is a surprise , " says Dr. Gao .
" But many things affecting the skin affect bacteria , such as the weather , exposure to light , and cosmetics use . "
Almost three - quarters , or 71.4 % , of the total number of bacterial species were unique to individual subjects , suggesting that the skin surface is highly diversified in terms of the bacteria it harbors , according to the study .
Three bacterial species were only found in the male subjects : Propionibacterium granulosum , Corynebacterium singulare , and Corynebacterium appendixes .
While the sample is too small to draw conclusions , the scientists believe that women and men may harbor some different bacterial species on their skin .

In each individual , the bacterial populations varied over time while revealing a core set of bacteria for each individual .
" The predominant bacteria do n't change much , " says Dr. Gao .
" But the more transient bacteria did change over time , " she says .
" What that suggests , " adds Dr. Blaser , " is that there is a scaffold of bacteria present in everybody 's skin .
Some stay and others come and go . "
Finding the method
To obtain a sample Dr. Gao rubbed a swab on each individual 's forearms .
" We did n't tell them to be particularly clean , we just made sure they did n't take antibiotics up to one month prior to the test , " Dr. Gao explains .
She chose three men and three women to have a balance of genders .
She set up a clean room so the samples did n't risk contamination .
Traditionally , bacteria are cultured in the lab in petri dishes , which contain a medium to grow bacteria .
But the method leads to inaccuracies , she explains , because only a fraction of bacteria in a sample grow in that medium .
So the team used a powerful molecular method that involved extracting a subunit of genetic material called 16S ribosomal DNA from the samples .
" It is kind of a common currency , it 's a conserved gene , " says Dr. Blaser .
Another advantage is that there is a large database of 16S ribosomal DNA available to scientists .
The ambitious task for this study was to gather samples , prepare them , amplify the bacteria creating colonies of each single species of bacteria present in the skin samples .
Then Dr. Gao used established tools -- primers -- to pick out the species - specific genetic regions in the bacteria .
After sequencing those regions , the 16S ribosomal DNA ( rDNA ) in each colony , she consulted 16S rDNA databases to determine the bacterial species present in each sample .
Many bacteria in the database only exist as sequences and have nether been named or extensively studied .
Those are termed SLOTUs , or species - level taxonomic units .
Taxonomy and the study results
To distinguish organisms from one another , biologists group and categorize them .
Species or SLOTUs are small categories .
There are larger groupings such as genera and phyla .
Humans , for example , belong to the phylum chordata , the genus Homo and the species Homo sapiens .
The molecular method used in this study revealed differences between the bacterial populations in individuals .
Other methods had previously not shown those differences .
The team found a total of 182 species or SLOTUs and 91 genera of bacteria in the skin samples .
The samples yielded mainly three phyla of bacteria : Actinobacteria , Firmicutes , and Proteobacteria .
Ninety - four point six percent of the bacteria were in these phyla .
These phyla were found in all six tested individuals .
When compared with earlier studies , the researchers found that these three phyla are also dominant in the esophagus and the stomach .
In terms of bacterial species , however , the insides of the body , for example the stomach , and the exterior of the body , the skin , show vast differences in bacterial populations .
Skin condition can change markedly due to a variety of factors such as climate , diet , personal hygiene , and disease .
But skin is never devoid of bacteria , particularly its more permanent residents .
That is not bad news , after all , in healthy individuals these bacteria are not pathogens .
" Without good bacteria , the body could not survive , " says Dr. Gao .
The next step for the research team is to look at diseased skin .
" We plan to ask the question :
Are the microbes in diseased skin , in certain diseases like psoriasis or eczema , different than the microbes in normal skin ? " says Dr. Blaser .
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , by a Senior Scholar Award from the Ellison Medical Foundation , and by the Diane Belfer Program in Human Microbial Ecology in Health .
The authors of the study are Zhan Gao , M.D , Chi-hong Tseng , Ph.D. , Zhiheng Pei , M.D. , Ph.D , and Martin J. Blaser , M.D .
Small Biz 101 : Cash Flow RyanC 61 comments Latest by taktuk_1990
Why cash flow is so important
Welcome to the second part of my Small Biz 101 series .
For those of you who did n’t catch the first article , How to Get Started , this series is a simple guide for helping people start their own web - based company , based on my experience with Carson Systems .
In this article I ’m going to be focusing on cash flow , because it ’s the # 1 issue that puts people out of business .
On that happy note , let ’s get started !
Cash flow basics
My university degree in Computer Science did n’t include any business training , so I ’ve learned everything by trial and error .
One of the biggest lessons I ’ve learned is this :
Your company cash flow will be the first thing to put you out of business .
Cash flow basically means " Do I have enough cash in my bank account to cover my expenses ? "
Sounds stupidly simple , but you ’d be surprised at how many people ignore this .
So why is this the # 1 killer of small businesses ?
Here are the two main reasons :
Companies are n’t realistic when it comes to predicting their income and expenses .
They overestimate their income and underestimate their expenses .
Companies do n’t see a cash shortage coming and they run out of money
You can have the most amazing service or product in the world , but if you run out of cash , it wo n’t matter .
What to do about it
In order to keep track of your cash flow , you ’ll need a simple spreadsheet tool .
My favorite is Excel .
If you do n’t have a copy ( or do n’t want to give your hard - earned cash to Microsoft ) , you can use the free AJAX spreadsheet tool Num Sum .
The idea is simple : enter how much money is coming in versus how much money is going out .
I ’ve created a very simple example for you here ( Excel , 40 KB ) .
The most important thing is that the values go at least three months into the future ( I ’d actually recommend 12 months ) .
The beauty of having a realistic cash flow spreadsheet , is that if you see your bank account going into the red in three months time , you ’ll have plenty of time to do something about it .
Tips for keeping your cash flow happy
Hopefully you ’re convinced of the importance of watching your cash flow , but how do you keep it healthy ?
Here are my suggestions :
Spend as little as possible .
This is especially important in the early days of your business .
Before you make any purchases over $ 50 , ask yourself " Do I really need this ? "
If not , you can live without it .
Do n’t buy hardware you do n’t need .
This goes along with the above rule , but it ’s worth specifically mentioning .
I used my crappy old PC and banged up CRT monitor until I was forced to replace it because it died .
You do n’t need that 23 " Apple Cinema Display - trust me .
Be brutally realistic .
Always overestimate your expenses and underestimate your income .
Your cash flow should always be a ‘ worst - case scenario’ .
If you know you can stay in business when things are n’t going well , then you know you ’ll be dandy if the best - case scenario happens .
Chase invoices the minute they ’re late .
It may sound harsh , but the minute that an invoice is late , call the company and start pressuring them .
If they think they can get away with late payment , then they ’ll put you behind all the other customers they have to pay .
Update your cash flow regularly .
As time goes on , you ’ll realise that some of your predictions about income and expenses were wrong .
When this happens , update those figures to make your cash flow realistic .
I ’d recommend updating your cash flow weekly .
Once you ’ve got a year under your belt , monthly updates will probably be enough .
Cut expenses as much as possible .
Have a hard look at the expenses column on your cash flow .
Is there anything you can find a cheaper deal on ?
Anything in there that is n’t absolutely vital ?
Saving just a few dollars per month will really add up .
People do n’t always pay on time .
When planning your cash flow , always account for the fact that it usually takes people longer to pay you than you think .
Make sure that your cash flow does n’t depend on certain invoices being paid on time .
If your cash flow is dependant on a specific invoice being paid on time , make sure to communicate with the company at least four weeks before it ’s due to make sure it will be paid on time .
Summing it up
I hope that this has been helpful .
If you have any other useful tips for keeping your cash flow happy , or if you disagree with any of my opinions , please comment below .
Next time I ’ll tackle the subject of how to generate new business .
Stay tuned …
I like meat .
Or at least I used to .
This particular book - an innocuous volume soaked with the juices of some long - gone cook , still faintly fragrant with drippings and grease - is one of the most alarming and offensive tomes in the Gallery 's collection .
I hesistate to post this one ; a sizeable number of visitors may vow to never buy any of my books , let alone the Gallery .
I 'm serious .
Get ready for Meat !
Because Meat is ready for you .
( Note : this is one of the original sites in the Gallery ; goes back to 2000 , I think .
Not that it matters ; just saying this is ancient history here , Internet - wise . )

It ’s a natural plant that grows in the dirt .
Do you know what ’s not natural ?
80 year old dudes with hard - ons .
That ’s not natural .
But we got pills for that .
We ’re dedicating all our medical resources to keeping the old guys erect , but we ’re putting people in jail for something that grows in the dirt ?
You know we have more prescription drugs now .
Every commercial that comes on TV is a prescription drug ad .
I ca n’t watch TV for four minutes without thinking I have five serious diseases .
Like : “ Do you ever wake up tired in the morning ?
” Oh my god I have this , write this down .
Whatever it is , I have it .
Half the time I do n’t even know what the commercial is …people running in fields or flying kites or swimming in the ocean .
I ’m like that is the greatest disease ever .
How do you get that ?
That disease comes with a hot chick and a puppy .
The schools now …
It is all about self - esteem in the schools now .
Build the kids ’ self - esteem , make them feel good about themselves .
If everybody grows up with high self - esteem , who is going to dance in our strip clubs ?
What ’s going to happen to our porno industry ?
These women do n’t just grown on trees .
It takes lots of drunk dads missing dance recitals before you decide to blow a goat on the internet for fifty bucks .
And if that disappears , where does that leave me on a Friday night with my new high speed connection ?
Masterminds are another word that comes up all the time .
You keep hearing about these terrorists masterminds that get killed in the middle east .
Terrorists masterminds .
Mastermind is sort of a lofty way to describe what these guys do , do n’t you think ?
They ’re not masterminds .
“ OK , you take bomb , right ?
And you put in your backpack .
And you get on bus and you blow yourself up .
Alright ? ” “ Why do I have to blow myself up ?
Why ca n’t I just …
” “ Who ’s the fucking mastermind here ?
Me or you ?
” Americans , let ’s face it :
We ’ve been a spoiled country for a long time .
Do you know what the number one health risk in America is ?
Obesity .
They say we ’re in the middle of an obesity epidemic .
An epidemic like it is polio .
Like we ’ll be telling our grand kids about it one day .
The Great Obesity Epidemic of 2004 .
“ How ’d you get through it grandpa ? ” “ Oh , it was horrible Johnny , there was cheesecake and pork chops everywhere .
” Nobody knows why were getting fatter ?
Look at our lifestyle .
I ’ll sit at a drive thru .
I ’ll sit there behind fifteen other cars instead of getting up to make the eight foot walk to the totally empty counter .
Everything is mega meal , super sized .
Want biggie fries , super sized , want to go large .
You want to have thirty burgers for a nickel you fat mother fucker .
There ’s room in the back .
Take it !
Want a 55 gallon drum of Coke with that ?
It ’s only three more cents .
Sometimes you have to suffer a little bit in your youth to motivate yourself to succeed in later life .
Do you think if Bill Gates got laid in high school , do you think there ’d be a Microsoft ?
Of course not .
You got to spend a long time in your own locker with your underwear shoved up your ass before you start to think , “ You ’ll see .
I ’m going to take of the world of computers !
I ’ll show them .
” We ’re in one of the richest countries in the world , but the minimum wage is lower than it was thirty five years ago .
There are homeless people everywhere .
This homeless guy asked me for money the other day .
I was about to give it to him and then I thought he was going to use it on drugs or alcohol .
And then I thought , that ’s what I ’m going to use it on .
Why am I judging this poor bastard .
People love to judge homeless guys .
Like if you give them money they ’re just going to waste it .
Well , he lives in a box , what do you want him to do ?
Save it up and buy a wall unit ?
Take a little run to the store for a throw rug and a CD rack ?
He ’s homeless .
I walked behind this guy the other day .
A homeless guy asked him for money .
He looks right at the homeless guy and says why do n’t you go get a job you bum .
People always say that to homeless guys like it is so easy .
This homeless guy was wearing his underwear outside his pants .
Outside his pants .
I ’m guessing his resume is n’t all up to date .
I ’m predicting some problems during the interview process .
I ’m pretty sure even McDonalds has a “ underwear goes inside the pants ” policy .
Not that they enforce it really strictly , but technically I ’m sure it is on the books .

When it comes to Microsoft Windows Operating Systems , knowing what is running under the hood is the key to identifying problems and keeping the system running properly .
One example is identifying what processes are running , and how did they start .
Understanding how to track processes down , can be a big help if you think your system is infected with spyware , or if performance is sluggish .
You can use Task Manager to quickly see all running processes , but if you need to drill down and find out what program started the process , Task Manager falls short of reporting all the needed details .
A tool that I use to get the details , is Process Explorer from Microsoft Sysinternals site .
You can easily download Process Explorer at Windows Sysinternals site and it's free .
Process Explorer runs on PC versions : Windows Vista and higher ( Including IA64 ) and server version : Windows Server 2008 and higher ( Including IA64 ) .
Once downloaded , unzip it and click on procexp.exe ( no installation required ) .
You should see a screen similar to this :
Process Explorer at first may look intimidating , but do n't let that discourage you from using this tool .
In the left window pane are all processes running on you computer .
The right window pane has several columns .
One column that you should add is the Command line column .
This can be easily added by selecting from the menu , View , Select Columns then check Command Line and click on Ok .
As you can see in the first screen shot , all processes are easily identified by the Description and Company name .
The two important columns are the Path and Command Line .
These two columns display the exact location of the program that started the process and the command parameters that ran during execution .
One sign of a rogue process is usually when the Description and Company columns are blank .
If you suspect a process is suspicious , check the directory location where it was started , and see what date the directory was created .
Also mouse over the process as shown in the screenshot below , and see if there are any services running for the process .
In this case the process svchost . exe reveals all programs it has started .
You can also right click on a process and select properties which will display all information of the process such as Security , Environment settings , Performance and Threads .
Two tabs that will be of most interest is the Image tab which displays path , command line and current directory of the process , and TCP / IP tab that identifies port and connection information which can be of value in understanding who the process is communicating with .
If you suspect a process is a problem , you can kill the process and see if it restarts on it's own ( a real sign of spyware or virus ) .
You can kill a process either by right clicking and selecting Kill Process or from the Image tab by selecting properties .
Make sure no applications are open to avoid data loss before killing a process .
TIP : Not sure what a process is , right click on the process and select Search Online .
Your browser will open and the process name will be searched online .
From there you can start to investigate and find detailed information about the process .
Process Explorer is a powerful tool that can provide a window into your Operating System and let you see what is running on your System .
A good idea is to run the tool once a day so you can get used to seeing what processes should be running normally on your System .
If you suspect something is wrong , you can then easily identify any process that are not recognizable and quickly determine where the process is located on your PC and if it causing problems .
Philips has a long history of breakthrough innovation .
The company began in lighting and founded its first research lab in 1914 .
Applying its technical knowledge to healthcare , Philips introduced a medical X - ray tube in 1918 .
This marked the point when the company began to diversify its product range and to systematically protect its innovations with patents in areas stretching from X - ray radiation to radio reception .
Along the way , we 've been responsible for some truly ground - breaking discoveries and standards , such as the Rotalix X - ray tube , the high - pressure mercury lamp , the triple - headed dry electric razor , the Compact Cassette , the Brilliance 40 - slice CT scanner , CD , DVD , Ambilight TV , and more recent innovations such as the AirFloss , Lumify portable ultrasound , and the all - digital Vereos PET / CT scanner .
The powerful earthquake that hit Pakistan on Tuesday ( Sept. 24 ) and killed more than 320 people struck along one of the most hazardous yet poorly studied tectonic plate boundaries in the world .
The magnitude - 7.7 earthquake was likely centered on a southern strand of the Chaman Fault , said Shuhab Khan , a geoscientist at the University of Houston .
In 1935 , an earthquake on the northern Chaman Fault killed more than 30,000 people and destroyed the town of Quetta .
It was one of the deadliest quakes ever in Southeast Asia .
Shaking from yesterday 's earthquake in Pakistan demolished homes in the Awaran district near the epicenter , according to news reports .
The death toll will likely rise as survivors and emergency workers search the debris .
In the hours after the quake , a new island suddenly rose offshore in shallow seas near the town of Gwadar , about 230 miles ( 380 kilometers ) southwest of the epicenter .
Geologists with the Pakistan Navy have collected samples from the rocky pile , the Associated Press reported .
From pictures and descriptions , many scientists think the mound is a mud volcano , which often erupt after strong earthquakes near the Arabian Sea .
A second island has also been reported offshore of Ormara , about 170 miles ( 280 km ) east of Gwadar , Geo News said .
" Other mud volcanoes have been triggered at this distance for similar size earthquakes , " Michael Manga , a geophysicist and expert on mud volcanoes at the University of California , Berkeley , told LiveScience 's OurAmazingPlanet .
Little known risk
The unexplained island may have focused unusual global attention on the earthquake , which hit in a region that frequently experiences devastating temblors .
[ Video : Island Appears After Pakistan Earthquake ]
But despite the hazards faced by millions living near the Chaman Fault , a combination of geography and politics means the seismic zone remains little studied .
The Taliban killed 10 climbers , including an American , in northern Pakistan in June .
" Its location is in an area that is very difficult to do any traditional field work , " Khan told LiveScience 's OurAmazingPlanet .
" I tried twice to submit proposals to [ the National Science Foundation ] and I got excellent reviews , but the review panel said I was risking my life to work in that area . "
But the National Academy of Sciences felt differently .
With their support , Khan and his colleagues in Pakistan and at the University of Cincinnati are now studying the fault 's current and past movement .
This will help the researchers forecast future earthquake risk .
" This fault has had very little work and no paleoseismology , " Khan said .
" It is really important . "
Complex collision zone
Pakistan 's deadly earthquakes owe their birth to the juncture of three colliding tectonic plates : Indian , Eurasian and Arabian .
The Indian and Eurasian plates grind past each other along the Chaman Fault , triggering destructive temblors .
Earthquakes along the Chaman Fault are more frequent in the north than in the south , Khan said .
Similar to California 's San Andreas Fault or Turkey 's East Anatolian Fault , in some spots , the massive plate boundary is not a single fracture .
In southern Pakistan , the Chaman Fault splits into more than one strand , weaving a braid of many smaller faults .
The differences between north and south influence the number of earthquakes .
In the past 40 years , only one quake bigger than magnitude 6.0 has jiggled southern Pakistan within 125 miles ( 200 km ) of yesterday 's shaker , according to the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology in Seattle .
[ High & Dry : Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau ]
The Sept. 24 Pakistan earthquake epicenter is plotted on the map with regional seismicity since 1990 .

Altogether , the strike - slip Chaman Fault spans more than 500 miles ( 860 kilometers ) , crossing through Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Strike - slip faults move each side of the fracture mostly parallel to each other .
In the north , near the town of Chaman where India jabs a knuckle into Pakistan , the fault has zipped along at 33 millimeters ( 1.3 inches ) every year for the past 38,000 years , according to a study Khan 's team published Sept. 12 in the journal Tectonophysics .
" That is very fast , " Khan said .
" That tells me there were multiple major earthquakes in the last 38,000 years . "
Many mud volcanoes
The ongoing tectonic crash in Pakistan also helps create the mud volcanoes that pop up after earthquakes there .
" Whenever there is a major earthquake there are mud volcanoes , " Khan said .
The spectacular mountains and roaring rivers of the Pamirs and the Himalayas deliver huge piles of wet silt and mud to the Arabian Sea .
Jiggling these wet , gassy layers triggers an eruption of trapped water , Manga said .
Think of liquefaction — when saturated soil loses its strength — but on a titanic scale .
A new island offshore of the city of Gwadar in Pakistan appeared after today 's ( Sept. 24 ) magnitude - 7.7 earthquake .
( Image credit : Geo news )
The gray , dome - shaped mass offshore of Gwadar is 60 feet ( 18 meters ) high , 100 feet ( 30 m ) long and 250 feet ( 76 m ) wide , a geologist with the Pakistan Navy told Geo News .
Stones on top of the pile suggest the muck roared out of the sea fast enough to carry solid rock .
" Given the size , it must have erupted pretty quickly , " Manga said .
Mud volcanoes in the northern Apennine Mountains in Italy have tossed rocks up to a meter ( 3 feet ) in size , he said .
Manga calculated the mud must have erupted at several meters per second ( a few miles per hour ) to throw the rocks .
There are about 1,000 mud volcanoes worldwide , and the ones that erupt at sea are ephemeral , soon disappearing under the waves .
In 2001 , a magnitude - 7.7 earthquake in India birthed a short - lived mud volcano 300 miles ( 480 km ) away .
And at least five mud volcanoes surfaced in the Arabian Sea in 1945 after a massive magnitude - 8.1 shock on the Makran subduction zone offshore of Pakistan , including one near Gwadar .

Do n't blink , but the GOP may in fact try to run against the Bush / Cheney administration , both in congressional reelections and for the presidency in '08 .
McCain claims that he has been a constant critic of Rumsfeld and the war plan for Iraq , and to a degree that 's true .
But most often , his criticisms have taken this tone :
I have said , as long ago as nearly three years ago , when I was asked if I had confidence in Secretary Rumsfeld , I said I did not .
I was asked if he should resign .
I said no , that ‘s up to the president .
Elections have consequences , the president picks his team , and the president has the right to stay with that team if he wants to .
Why did n't McCain , who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee do more when the Republicans controlled congress to fix the war effort ?
If Rumsfeld 's management has been so bad and so misguided as McCain has pointed out , why did the Republicans rubber - stamp every decision made by the administration for the last 6 years ?
And this goes for other issues as well .
Why did Sen . Pat Roberts and the Republicans Fail To Conduct A Thorough Phase II Investigation " to fully answer the " critical questions surrounding the use of intelligence in the months leading up to the war ? "
Why did the Republicans refuse to investigate Iraq
War abuses and why have they failed to provide oversight on everything from Iraq , to Katrina , to Medicare to Dick Cheney 's secret energy meetings ?
Now that the electorate has turned against the Republicans and the Bush administration , some in the GOP are finally growing the cojones to do ( or at least say ) what they should have been doing all along : reigning in this rogue presidency .
If they did n't stop it when they had the power to why should we believe them now ?
It 's simply transparent that they are running from the administration to save their own skins .
And we have to make sure the voting public knows this .
It 's our job and the Dem 's job to call this out as Bullshit each time it occurs .
Dem 's who voted for the war and have since admitted it was a mistake help our cause because it puts pressure on GOP candidates to do the same .
And now that Democrats are beginning to investigate and provide oversight , the GOP is going to try to call foul by saying it 's political .
Our counter argument is that if the Repubs had bothered to do any investigating or oversight at all when they had power , that it would n't be necessary now .
The only way we give Republican congress members a free ride on this is if they agree to go all the way with us ... and that means impeachment , baby .
But until then we call them out on it .
We do a pretty good job of branding this as Bush 's war .
But we can't let the GOP use the same tactic to the extent that they extricate themselves from responsibility .
They are going to try to shift blame on this war to Democrats after the next election .
But before they can do that , they may try to couch it as Bush 's mistakes , but not the party 's .
The truth is they 've had the power to reshape it , to fix it , to stop it for 3 years now .
And they have n't .
They are just as culpable as the administration .
Our job is not to let the public forget it .

The production lines for Windows 98 stopped in 2001
Visionary science fiction writer William Gibson once wrote : " The future is here .
It 's just not widely distributed yet " .
By that he meant that technologies which re-make our lives tend to appear in small patches before they spread , connect and engulf everyone in a tidal wave of change .
The flipside of his observation is that the past has not entirely departed either .
There are places where it stubbornly persists .
Visiting these places gives us a chance to see if predictions about how technology and the world would interact , came true .
Time travel
A perfect opportunity to visit the past and check our visions of the future has arisen with Microsoft 's decision to end support for Windows 98 .
By re-installing it on an old PC we can see what the future looked like eight years ago and check our progress .
For this time travelling I used an old Gateway PC that has a PIII 450 Intel chip onboard , 384MB Ram and a four gigabyte hard drive .
Installing Windows 98 was straight - forward and hints of the changes it brought in were evident from the start .
Launched in 1997 , IE 4.0 is now obsolete
Both point up the fact that in 1998 , consumers were only just starting to go online in big numbers .
It was when the dotcom boom was just starting to be heard .
At that time about 36 million web hosts were registered - today there are almost 400 million of them .
Although it was possible to use the net with Windows 95 , it was in Windows 98 that Microsoft started to tie the operating system much more closely to its Internet Explorer browser .
With Windows 98 it became possible to view directories as a web page and to navigate between locations using the same keys as you do to go back and forth when browsing the net .
Net gains
Despite Microsoft 's claims that Windows 98 makes using the net easier , finding a browser that worked with the raw operating system was a challenge .
HAVE YOUR SAY Unfortunately , it 's the nature of the industry and Windows 98 has had its day
Simon Neale
Send us your comments
Internet Explorer 4.0 is now obsolete and it proved impossible to download a newer version of the browser from the Microsoft site using the old software .
The only browser I could get working straight off was Opera - once I had that working updating other components got easier .
But most striking about the Windows 98 desktop on a fresh installation was the large floating bar down the right - hand side that brought together links to more than 35 so - called " channels " through which relevant net content was supposed to be piped .
When Windows 98 launched , most net users were on dial - up
The idea was that the channel partners would prepare special content that would be " pushed " out to users .
Prominent among the list of channel partners is PointCast - one of the bright stars of the early dotcom days but which shut down its " push " system in 1999 due to lack of interest .
Clicking on the channels opened up a full screen where the content would be aired .
At the time it was thought that the net was going to become more like TV and viewers / users would tune in to those channels of interest .
Now , eight years on , none of the channels are active .
At best clicking on the links to channel partners re-directs to the homepage of the company involved - such as Forbes , or ZDNet .
At worst clicking crashed the browser .
This vision of content " pushed " to users is one that has not been fulfilled - at least not entirely .
" Push " has some parallels with RSS with one big difference .
RSS is all about you choosing what you want to see rather than have it " pushed " to you whether you want it or not .
And perhaps this reveals the big difference between the visions of 1998 and the reality of today .
Back then big players thought they would be in control of the net and dispense it to users .
But now its real power is being revealed in the communities it brings together and the information it gives them so they can make better choices .
And it is William Gibson that gives an insight into why this might be .
" The street , " he has written , " finds its own uses for things . "
I expect to pass through this world but once , any good thing therefore that I do , or any kindness that I can show to any living creature , let me do it now .
Let me not defer …
In its tireless efforts to molest passengers , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is photographing them at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport .
Naked .
The TSA is about the baddest , bawdiest bureaucracy ever to curse a country , but geez , even they must have needed help on this one .
I figure they went to Larry Flynt at Hustler Magazine for advice .
Only a pornographer of his unsavory talents could have dreamed up such wickedness : tell Americans that merely groping us is no longer enough protection from the terrorists thronging our airports .
Now we must pose for dirty pictures , too .
And so the TSA has installed " backscatter X - ray " equipment in Phoenix .
These contraptions penetrate clothing to show the flesh beneath .
Victims do n’t strip : the rays do it for them .
Screeners leering at the monitor see only our birthday suits — and , of course , the guns and knives so many of us tape to our thighs .
The TSA claims its debauchery at Sky Harbor is only a test .
But because " the machines have the potential to speed up the security process , " they are " likely future replacements for the metal detectors now in use " at other airports .
That ’s all the excuse the TSA wants to plant the gizmos everywhere .
A nationwide peepshow !
Wanna bet Flynt ’s the star of the agency ’s Christmas — excuse me , holiday party this year ?
The TSA certainly dreams big : it ’s already scheming to move its smutty technology beyond airports .
Consumer Affairs reports that " Backscatter machines …are also being considered for big - city train and subway stations . "
Why ?
Undoubtedly for the same reason that the manufacturer , American Science and Engineering ( AS&E ) , sells its device to the creeps at Customs : to " search for drugs . "
Apparently , Our Rulers have confused us with AS&E ’s other clients : " SmartCheck personnel scanners are in use at maximum - security prisons to screen inmates and visitors for threats and contraband . "
The police state scores again .
Like a dirty old man who ca n’t decide when to pounce , the TSA has dithered about dosing us with backscatter X - rays for years .
But a media as sympathetic as it is gullible reports that the bureaucrats " struggl[ed ] with privacy issues . "
Hard to believe an agency that enthusiastically paws new mothers would balk at forcing passengers to pose in the raw .
Then , too , its head honcho growled in April 2005 that there should n’t be an " endless debate " over privacy .
Apparently , the only " struggle " confronting the TSA was coaxing passengers to accept this newest assault .
USAToday assures us that " the machines will be used only on travelers who require extra screening beyond a metal detector . "
[ Emphasis added here and in other quotes . ]
Oh , the subtleties of mainstream bias !
You poor slobs who are hauled aside for " secondary screening , " whose belongings are rifled while a uniformed goon violates your body — it ’s your own fault !
You " require " it , though even the TSA admits that " Passengers … are selected for secondary screening … "
But whether " requiring " or " selected , " passengers now have a choice .
Yes !
According to the TSA , " Backscatter is a voluntary option for passengers undergoing secondary screening as an alternative to the physical pat down procedures currently conducted by Transportation Security Officer s [ sic ] at the security screening checkpoint . "
Or , as USA Today chirps , " Those passengers will be offered the option of being photographed from the front and back by the backscatter machine or undergoing the customary pat - down by a screener . "
" Customary , " huh ?
So that ’s what we call warrantless searches of citizens who have committed no crime .
You can either be sexually assaulted or photographed naked .
It ’s your " choice " !
Thank you , Leviathan .
We ca n’t blame Larry for this : even he understands that forcing folks to follow artificial , arbitrary regulations , regardless of whether they can select which regulations they ’ll follow , is as anti-choice as it gets .
The sluts adorning Hustler ’s pages are there because they want to be , not because they went to an airport to catch a flight and were instead pushed into a " personnel scanner " under penalty of arrest .
And what happens to our pictures when the TSA ’s done with them ?
Has Larry cut a deal with the Feds that will save him modelling fees ?
Au contraire .
The TSA ’s website alleges that the photos are deliberately blurred in a high - tech version of the fig leaf and that they are " erased from the screen " as soon as the prey clears security .
Furthermore , " the capability of printing , storing or transmitting the image is not available to the Transportation Security Officer . "
Yeah , right .
These are the liars who insisted that Rigoberto Alpizar hollered about a bomb before air marshals killed him last year , contradicting other passengers ’ testimony .
They are pedophiles and thieves .
The Administration that created their agency has lied about WMD ’s , eavesdropping on us , torturing POW ’s , and just about everything else for the last six years .
I trust the TSA ’s denials that screeners can " print , store or transmit " blurred pictures of naked passengers about as much as I would Larry ’s claims that he reads Playboy for the articles .
Screw that .

No one in the evening crowd at a Starbucks in Pasadena knew Humphrey Cheung .
But Cheung , quietly sipping hot chocolate and working on his laptop , knew things about them .
Several tables away was a guy sitting alone with his own laptop .
“ He ’s starting a business , ” Cheung said .
And the young couple in the far corner ?
“ They ’re getting married , ” he confided .
Cheung is n’t psychic .
He had hacked into the coffee shop ’s wireless Internet connection on his Toshiba laptop .
It took him all of about five minutes to do so , using free software available online .

Once hooked into the system , Cheung was able to monitor the online activity of other laptops in the shop .
Luckily for the people around him , he was n’t snooping for any reason except to make a point :
As wireless hot spots proliferate , the tools for secretly monitoring these Internet connections are becoming more sophisticated .
“ When people are on a public wireless connection , they have the same expectations about privacy as when they are on the Internet at home , ” said Cheung , 32 , a computer security expert and an editor for TG Daily , a technology news website .

“ But it does n’t work that way .
Someone could be listening in . ”
Cheung was using a “ sniffer ” program that intercepted online signals as they flew back and forth from the laptops to a wireless modem hidden somewhere amid the coffee paraphernalia .
Mostly , the monitoring was limited to tracking the websites being visited .
Numbers correlating to Web addresses flew across Cheung ’s computer screen , allowing him to see that the couple were viewing pages belonging to a wedding planning site .
The man a few tables away started with sites selling high - speed broadband service .
He went from there to a page about managing websites .

Like in a mystery yarn , the clues kept coming in .
“ You start to get a story about someone , ” Cheung said .
Suddenly , the line “ LLCs in the state of California ” popped up on the screen .
An LLC is a limited liability company , a type of business structure often used by small - business owners .
“ He ’s in Google , ” Cheung said .
“ That ’s a search he typed in . ”
Sure enough , the next stop was a California secretary of state site with information about forming LLCs .

When approached , the man , Alex Auzers , 20 , of Pasadena , confirmed that he was doing research on starting a business .
Asked if he had searched the exact phrase , “ LLCs in the state of California , ” Auzers looked stunned .
Then he shook his head .
“ Is someone using a sniffer program ? ” he asked .
Auzers also is in the computer field -- he hopes to start a business that would service residential setups .

“ I feel kind of stupid , ” he said , “ because I know that kind of thing can be done . ”
The company that provides wireless fidelity , or Wi-Fi , signals at Starbucks is T - Mobile USA Inc .
It manages about 7,600 HotSpots nationwide , including in coffee shops , hotels and airports .
On its website , the company warns that communications in the HotSpots “ may be subject to unauthorized interception and are not inherently secure . ”
But good luck in finding that security warning .
The link to it is in small print at the bottom of T - Mobile ’s HotSpot Web page , grouped with 18 other links to various company Web pages .

T- Mobile offers a free software program , Connection Manager , to improve browsing security , said Mike Selman , the service ’s marketing director .
“ You can use this to make sure you are connected properly to our network , ” Selman said , “ and that communications are encrypted from the laptop . ”
But the security program also seems to be more or less a secret .
Not only does the name of the program not mention security , but the link to download it also is grouped with several other items in a dropdown menu .
And if you have a Macintosh computer , you ’re out of luck :
The software comes only in a Windows version .
Asked whether customers at a HotSpot should be told about the software as they sign on , Selman answered , “ Not a bad suggestion . ”
At least Cheung could n’t read e-mails .
Except in one case .
Advertisement
Most major e-mail sites on the Web -- such as those run by AOL , EarthLink , Google and Yahoo -- are protected by encryption .
This is signified by the site address beginning with “ https ” instead of “ http . ”
Major banking and e-commerce pages that ask for financial information are https , too .
But the Web e-mail page for Internet service provider Charter Communications Inc. is plain old http and therefore not secure .
Cheung tuned into a Charter e-mail page being viewed in a Starbucks and began to read , “ In an oiled casserole dish ... . ”
It was a recipe for yam enchiladas .
Advertisement
“ You definitely want to make sure that if you are using Web e-mail on a wireless connection , ” Cheung said , “ that it ’s on an https page . ”
In response to questions about its non-secure service , Charter said in an e-mail that it was “ currently exploring an https implementation as well as other security options . ”
On home Wi -Fi setups , password protection can be implemented on the modem , which offers a lot of security -- although some hackers say they can break through the most basic protection regimen , known as WEP .
Public Wi -Fi setups , whether paid or free , do n’t have the luxury of using passwords .
That would defeat the purpose of allowing a great many people to use them .
Advertisement
T- Mobile , which charges about $ 10 a day for HotSpot use , is working to get more people to use them .
Last month , the company finished installing a system at Los Angeles International Airport that covers 3.8 million square feet of space , making it one of the largest Wi -Fi deployments in the world .
Also , free Wi-Fi hot spots are being added to more outdoor areas by cities .
Fullerton and Long Beach already have them , and there are plans to install a system at Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles .
So , enjoy the freedom of Wi-Fi .
But maybe you should n’t surf to sites you would n’t want people to know you ’re visiting .
“ If you watch where people go , one site after another , ” Cheung said , “ it ’s almost like you can read their minds . ”

Yesterday ’s Los Angeles Times chronicles the ways in which California Democrats are quickly becoming the Kings of Nanny State legislation :
SACRAMENTO — Enjoy fast food ?
Like to light up while you watch the waves ?
Forget to sock away money for your kids ’ education ?
Some California lawmakers want to change your ways .
They ’ve planted a crop of proposals this year â€ ” “ nanny ” bills , as they ’re called â€ ” that would : â€¢ Restrict the use of artery - clogging trans fat , common in fried and baked foods and linked to heart disease , in restaurants and school cafeterias .
â€¢
Bar smoking at state parks and beaches , and in cars carrying children .
â€¢
Open a savings account , seeded with $ 500 , for every newborn Californian to use at 18 for college , a first home purchase or an investment for retirement .
â€¢
Fine dog and cat owners who do n’t spay or neuter their pets by 4 months of age .
â€¢ Require chain restaurants to list calorie , saturated fat and sodium content on menus .
â€ ¢
Phase out the sale of incandescent light bulbs , which are less energy - efficient than compact fluorescent bulbs .
The proposals have sparked something of a debate in the hallways of the State Legislature in Sacramento :
The debate has commenced in the Capitol : How far should government go ?
The proposals are the brainchildren of Democratic legislators .
Republicans , who say the sponsors are trying to parent the whole state , are having none of it .
“ Could you imagine the founding fathers dealing with â€ ” I do n’t know â€ ” wearing a helmet when you ’re in the buggy ? ” said the Assembly ’s Republican leader , Mike Villines of Clovis .
“ We all know you ca n’t mandate behavior ; it just does not work , ” he said .
“ It creates criminals of people for things that are not criminal behaviorâ€¦ .
You ca n’t legislate for stupidity . ”
But that is exactly what legislators across the country are trying to do and , as David Boaz points out , the Nanny State impulse is n’t limited to Democrats :
So the next time you hear a Republican complaining about Democrats who want to ban smoking in outdoor restaurants , or trans - fat , or whatever it might be , remember this :
[ F ] rom the Republicans we get federal money for churches ; and congressional investigations into textbook pricing , the college football bowl system , the firing of Terrell Owens , video games , the television rating system , you name it ; and huge new fines for indecency on television ; and crackdowns on medical marijuana and steroids and ephedra ; and federal intervention in the sad case of Terri Schiavo ; and the No Child Left Behind Act ; and federal subsidies for marriage ; and ( for less favored constituencies ) a constitutional amendment to override the marriage laws of the 50 states .
Republicans and Democrats .
They both want to control your life .
And they both think they know what ’s good for you , better than you do .

WSGI Explorations in Python
By Mike Orr ( Sluggo )
Contents
Introduction
WSGI has become a buzzword among Python developers , especially since the PyWebOff discussed in my last article .
The burgeoning proliferation of web application frameworks -- once a testament to how easy it is to build one in Python -- is now seen by many as a liability .
The fifty - odd frameworks are non-interoperable for the most part and leave the new user scratching his head wondering which one to use .
WSGI attempts to address the interoperability problem by providing a common protocol between frameworks and servers .
A lot of related work has started over the past year , but it 's mainly been by individuals working alone quietly .
There has n't been a central place to get an overview on what 's available , and the packages themselves often lack the documentation and demos necessary to survey them all in a reasonable amount of time .
One bright spot is Paste ( formerly WSGIKit ) , which is positioning itself as a meta - framework and has seen significant development over the past few weeks .
This article attempts to bring all this together and provide an overview of WSGI activity circa May 2005 .
The article changed direction at least three times while I was writing it because the WSGI landscape is changing so rapidly .
My original modus operandi was to get the Quixote Altdemo running in the widest variety of WSGI environments .
( The Altdemo is a one - file application demonstrating logging in , sessions , and displaying the request context .
Quixote is our reference point because I like its philosophy and am currently using it . )
I started exploring , putting my notes into the article as I went so they would n't get lost .
The first wall I hit was the lack of a WSGI interface for Quixote .
( I 'll explain all these words later . )
This led to the discovery of Titus Brown 's QWIP ( the missing interface ) , and my detour to update QWIP and embed it in a server module for Quixote ( wsgi_server.py ) .
Then I put aside the article for a few days , grew frustrated at how long the not - yet - written sections were threatening to be , and finally realized Paste is where I should concentrate my exploration , even though I 'm not yet ready to commit to Paste for my own projects .
So the article finally morphed from a hands - on HOWTO for comparing projects into a bird 's - eye summary of what 's available .
Frameworks
First let 's take a very brief overview of the differences between the frameworks .
Zope stands alone as the Emacs of web application environments .
It 's very comprehensive but you have to do things " the Zope way " , which is very different from normal Python programming .
Zope predated most of the other frameworks , and many of them are a reaction to it .
Nevertheless , several advanced add - ons have been written for Zope including the Plone Content Management System .
Webware ( or rather its WebKit component ) is based on the Java servlet model .
Python modules coexist with static files ( images , multimedia ) in the filesystem .
The URL resolver finds foo .py if there 's no closer match for " / foo " .
The module must contain a same - name subclass of Servlet .
Various methods are called to produce the output ; various other method provide context information ( GET / POST variables , session variables ) and support services ( redirects ) .
Quixote and CherryPy resolve URLs by searching object attributes rather than the filesystem .
So you provide a root object , and " / foo/bar / baz " maps to ROOT.foo.bar.baz .
Context information comes from global imports that " know about " the current request ; this is not very OO but it keeps the application code remarkably clean .
A URL directory maps to a class , and a leaf node to a method .
Quixote 2.0 goes a step further by giving you complete control over the URL resolver .
All Quixote does is call ROOT._q_traverse( url_components ) , and the default implementation works as above , calling ._q_traverse on " subdirectories " as necessary .
But you can override it to do anything you want , including handling all URLs another way , diverting to a login form , checking authorization , calling leaf nodes with additional arguments , wrapping a header / footer around the output , etc .
Many of the " Why does n't Quixote do it this way ? " questions are answered with , " You can do it in ._q_traverse .
Twisted is more of an application - and - server framework rather than just a web application framework , but it does include the minimal twisted .
web upon which Nevow is based .
Both use the Directory object model , with a .locateChild method handling all URLs under it .
Minimalist frameworks provide only the minimum required for web applications : a URL resolver , access to context variables , session management , handling HTTP headers and errors , and redirection .
The URL resolver more or less determines the structure of your application .
Richer frameworks provide a complete Model - View - Controller structure , a template system , a database access system , a Form object of some sort , HTML generation functions , a configuration file , and / or a Javascript library .
Applications need a template system to merge calculated values into predefined HTML .
Most of these ( Zope Page Templates , Nevow 's ) use XML - style tags for the variable placeholders , and are thus limited to producing HTML / XML output .
Cheetah uses a $ placeholder and #command syntax , making it suitable for other types of output as well .
Quixote 's PTL system turns templating on its head : the template is an ordinary Python function , except that standalone expressions are concatenated and used as the implicit return value .
PTL also escapes " unsafe " values automatically -- those coming from a non-trusted source ( arguments or function calls ) that may contain unexpected HTML markup .
There 's an htmltext class to mark a string as " safe " to prevent further escaping .
( There are examples of PTL and Nevow in my PyCon 2004 article . )
Python 2.4 includes a built - in template system using $ placholder syntax , but it 's so new and limited I have n't seen anyone using it .
Most template systems are affiliated with a certain framework but can also be used standalone .
Another difference between the template systems is where the plug - in values come from .
For Python's , you provide a dictionary .
For Cheetah , you can provide a list of dictionaries / objects to search in order , or you can set template attributes directly .
For Nevow you provide a function that sets the values in the template ( really ! ) , and additional functions for looping .
PTL gets values from the function arguments or lexical scope .
Fortunately , none of these systems require a bunch of .setValue ( key , value ) calls like certain Java / PHP / Perl templates !
Applications also need to access a database .
Some use object databases like ZODB or Durus , others use SQL directly , others use an object - relational mapper to pretend they 're not using a SQL database .
Of course , the object - relational mappers are non-interoperable ; perhaps that is the next frontier for standardization in Python .
There are also various SQL - generation modules that provide a thin wrapper over the syntax .
( I 've written one of those , dbutil.py . )
Most frameworks come with a Python web server either recommended for production or used just for testing .
All connect to Apache via CGI , and some via a generic Apache module ( FastCGI , mod_python ) or a custom Apache module ( mod_scgi , mod_webkit ) .
Some can run under Twisted .
Because web requests can arrive simultaneously , servers have to deal with concurrency .
There are four concurrency models :
Synchronous servers handle one request at a time .
Any subsequent requests just have to wait .
( Python's SimpleHTTPServer , Quixote 's simple_server )
servers handle one request at a time .
Any subsequent requests just have to wait .
( Python's SimpleHTTPServer , Quixote 's simple_server ) Multiprocess servers handle each request in a subprocess .
( Apache CGI , mod_python , mod_scgi )
Each subprocess handles one request or several synchronously , but they all run in parallel .
A subprocess can handle the request itself or transmit it to a long - running server via a socket .
servers handle each request in a subprocess .
( Apache CGI , mod_python , mod_scgi )
Each subprocess handles one request or several synchronously , but they all run in parallel .
A subprocess can handle the request itself or transmit it to a long - running server via a socket .
Multithreaded servers handle each request in a thread .
( Webware , Zope , WSGI Utils ' httpServer )
servers handle each request in a thread .
( Webware , Zope , WSGI Utils ' httpServer ) Asynchronous servers use select to multiplex I/O between several pending requests .
( Twisted , Medusa )
Each model has its advantages and disadvantages .
Synchronous servers are too slow for most production systems .
Multithreaded servers require careful programming to avoid clobbering shared variables .
Some frameworks are not thread safe anyway .
Twisted uses a non-linear programming model to avoid threads ; its Deferreds and callbacks are enough to make many programmers run screaming from the room .
The multiprocess model avoids clobbering shared variables but can still clobber shared files .
In many cases ( especially with Apache ) the webserver adapter does not calculate the response itself but instead forwards the request to a separate application server .
The application server may have a different concurrency model than the web server .
All frameworks provide session management , each in its own way .
A session is a dictionary or object that is shared between requests by the same user as long as the user does n't quit his / her browser or remain idle too long .
A session manager stores sessions and gives the correct session to each request .
Sessions may be stored in a dictionary , files , or a database .
A dictionary session manager requires a single long - running process ( not multiprocesses ) , and the sessions vanish when the server quits or crashes .
File - based sessions persist between server instances and can be shared by multiprocesses , but file locking is required to prevent simultaneous updates .
Database sessions are similar but the database server often handles the multiplexing for you .
Each framework also has a way for managing forms .
Some have a form object and widget objects ; others use an XML description .
Quixote uses the former .
The form object can both render a form , validate it , and redisplay it with error messages .
With some frameworks you get the form input and validate it against the widgets .
In Quixote , you ask the widgets to find themselves in the GET / POST variables , validate themselves , and return the value or None .
Pre-WSGI Standardization
A few attempts at standardization were made before WSGI appeared .
For instance , frameworks come with their own web servers and adapters for Apache , and these are generally not interchangeable with other frameworks .
Webware comes with mod_webkit , a module that quickly transmits the request to a Webware application server .
Neil Schemenauer , a Quixote developer , aimed to do this in a generic way and wrote SCGI .
It serializes the request environment variables and input , sends it through a socket , and expects a complete HTTP document ( with headers ) in reply .
His mod_scgi does this in an Apache module , and his cgi2scgi.c does it in a CGI script .
I wrote a Python equivalent , cgi2scgi.py , which is useful for testing .
Titus Brown wrote SWAP , a SCGI - WSGI gateway .
It 's included in Paste , or you can get it from his QWIP and SWAP page .
Subway aggregates CherryPy , Cheetah , SQLObject , and now Paste into an integrated development environment similar to Ruby on Rails .
It uses CherryPy's WSGI interface to link into Paste .
Credit should also be given to the Zope team for unbundling their ZODB database and template systems so they can be used with other frameworks .
WSGI
WSGI is Python PEP 333 , the Web Server Gateway Interface .
It 's a a protocol for communicating with Python web applications .
WSGI works by callbacks .
The application provides a function which the server calls for each request :
application ( environ , start_response )
environ is a Python dictionary containing the CGI - defined environment variables plus a few extras .
One of the extras is " wsgi.input " , the file object from which to read the POST variables .
start_response is a callback by which the application returns the HTTP headers :
start_response(status , response_headers , exc_info=None )
status is an HTTP status string ( e.g. , " 200 OK " ) .
response_headers is a list of 2 - tuples , the HTTP headers in key - value format .
exc_info is used in exception handling ; we wo n't cover it here .
The application function then returns an iterable of body chunks .
In the simplest case this can be :
[ " < html > Hello , world ! </html > " ]
Getting slightly more elaborate , here 's the second - smallest WSGI application in the world :
def app2 ( environ , start_response ) : start_response( " 200 OK " , [ ] ) s = " < html >
You requested < strong >
%s</ strong></html> " s %= environ [ ' PATH_INFO '] return [ s ]
The protocol may look strange , but it 's designed to meet the needs of the widest possible variety of existing and potential frameworks and servers .
And middleware .
Middleware are reusable components providing generic services normally handled by frameworks ; e.g. , a Session object , a Request object , error handling .
They 're implemented as wrapper functions ; i.e. , decorators .
Inbound they can add keys to the dictionary ( e.g. , quixote . request for a Quixote - style Request object ) .
Outbound they can modify HTTP headers or translate the body into Latin or Marklar .
Here 's a small middleware :
class LowercaseMiddleware : def __init__( self , application ) : self .
application = application # A WSGI application callable .
def __call__( self , environ , start_response ) : pass #
We could set an item in ' environ ' or a local variable .
for chunk in self.application ( environ , start_response ) : yield chunk.lower ( )
Assuming we had a server constructor Server , we could do :
app = LowercaseMiddleware ( app2 ) server = Server ( app )
Since it 's so easy to write a WSGI application , you may wonder , " Who needs a framework ? "
That 's a legitimate question , although the answer is , " It 's tedious without one . "
Your application is responsible for every URL under it ; e.g. , if it 's installed as http://localhost:8080/ , it would have to do something intelligent with http://localhost:8080/foo/bar/baz.
Code to parse the URL and switch to an appropriate function is ... a framework !
So you may as well use an existing framework and save yourself the tedium .
Writing a WSGI server interface is more complex .
There 's an example in PEP 333 .
I wrote an object - oriented one for Quixote ( in wsgi_server.py ) .
But the experience taught me it 's more fun to write the application side .
WSGI opens the way for a lot of interesting possibilities .
Simple frameworks can be turned completely into middleware .
Some frameworks might be able to run on top of other frameworks or even be emulated by them .
Ideally , existing applications would run unchanged or with minimal changes .
But this is also a time for framework developers to rethink how they 're doing things and perhaps switch to more middleware - friendly APIs .
Currently , CherryPy and Nevow have WSGI interfaces .
Twisted 's CVS has a twisted .
web2.wsgi module .
Quixote has QWIP .
Why WSGI Wo n't Replace SCGI
Many people think WSGI will replace mod_scgi and all the other webserver adapters .
This is partly due to the confident language in the PEP about connecting to " web servers " .
But both sides of WSGI must be in the same process , for the simple reason that the spec requires an open file object in the dictionary , and you can't pickle a file object and transmit it to another process .
So a WSGI call from an Apache module to an embedded Python application is possible , but a WSGI call from Apache to a long - running application server is not .
Yet these long - running servers are necessary to maintain state and factor out the initialization overhead .
SCGI can replace the framework - specific adapters since it is serializable and framework neutral ( and programming - language neutral ) , but WSGI will have to operate on the " application side " of an SCGI interface .
Conversely , people may wonder why to use WSGI when SCGI is both a gateway and serializable .
However , inbound processors would have to parse and reformat the entire input stream instead of merely passing a dictionary object through , and outbound processors would likewise have to parse the headers .
Python web servers , however , can take the day off because they have to provide only one interface now , WSGI .
Then any compliant application can be plugged into them regardless of framework .
Since the web server is a long - running process , the application will initialize itself only once , and it can store any needed state in module globals ( but watch out for threading issues ) .
And I suppose a WSGI application could be a stub that calls a standalone application server via SCGI ...
Quixote 's Challenges to WSGI
Let 's look at the specific challenges one framework has in adapting to WSGI .
QWIP exists to connect the monolithic Quixote Publisher to WSGI , but what if we want to factor out parts of Quixote to middleware ?
Given that the URL resolving is already factored out to your Directory object , if you take out the session handling , error handling , and request handling , is there much of a Publisher left ?
Do you use generic middleware , which would require people to change their applications , or middleware that produces Quixote - style objects ?
Three considerations stand out :
Because Quixote makes it easy to subclass Publisher , Session and Request , many applications do .
These applications are apparently incompatible with some middleware .
Applications access their context objects by calling global functions : e.g. , quixote.get_session ( ) .
These functions are frequently used in lieu of passing arguments .
Middleware puts context objects in the environment dictionary .
A middleware 'd Quixote may have to create a fake quixote module with functions that read the environment dictionary , or maybe the middleware would have to stuff the objects into a fake quixote module itself .
There is precedent for this in Paste , whose webkit component provides a fake Webware environment for a servlet to run in .

Most frameworks use a dictionary for the session object , but Quixote uses an instance , and users often add attributes .
One predefined attribute is .user , although Quixote does nothing with it except initialize it to None .
But applications frequently set it to something and access it via quixote.get_user ( ) .
Is it better to change applications to use dictionary sessions , or provide a Quixote - style session middleware ?
Or can we use a generic session manager middleware with our own session objects ?

Or can we use a generic session manager middleware with our own session objects ?
Quixote is not thread safe , so my version of QWIP refuses to connect to a multithreaded server .
There 's a class and a wrapper in wsgi_server .py to make it thread safe , but they need further testing .
WSGI Utils
WSGI Utils provides :
wsgiServer , a multithreaded HTTP - to - WSGI server based on Python 's SimpleHTTPServer .
It takes a mapping of URL prefixes to applications , allowing you to serve multiple applications from one server , and can also overlay a static directory for any non-matching URLs .
wsgiAdapter , a simple application framework .
It provides Basic Authentication and signed cookies .
some persistent session classes using DBM and an optional daemon .
Paste has an interface to wsgiServer , as does my wsgi_server .py .
I had some trouble with the application mapping .
It works fine with a single application but is not very robust for multiple applications .
One wonders whether attaching multiple applications at this level is really that useful anyway , but time will tell .
wsgiAdapter may be an interesting framework to build other frameworks on top of , although that may require more modification to existing frameworks than it 's worth .
One caveat about the static overlay , which is inherited from Python 's SimpleHTTPServer : it serves from the current directory , and there 's no provision to specify another directory .
So make sure to chdir to the static directory before launching wsgiServer .
Other packages
Flup is Allan Saddi's package of WSGI utilities .
There are gateways to SCGI and FastCGI , both threaded and forking .
There are middlewares for error handling , gzip compression , and sessions .
The session object is a dictionary subclass , and the session managers are memory - , shelve - , and file - based .
There 's also a minimal application framework .
( The more the merrier ! )
PEAK is a library for enterprise applications .
Among its diverse offerings is wsgiref , a reference library for WSGI including a simple HTTP server .
wsgiref seems to have spun off into its own repository , located here .
Paste
Paste is what I call a meta - framework , a way to plug together frameworks and servers and middleware using a common configuration system .
Here 's how Paste 's creator , Ian Bicking , describes it : http://pythonpaste.org/docs/what-is-paste.html
Paste has been getting an extraordinary level of development recently .
It includes two frameworks : a WSGI - aware implementation of Webware , and a ( backward - incompatible ) modernization of that called Wareweb .
Paste is becoming the Borg , assimilating some third - party code and linking to others .
It has incorporated gateways from SWAP and Flup , and Quixote support is in progress .
Subway has refactored itself to work with Paste .
Paste should also work with any generic WSGI application .
It has been creating and borrowing middleware left and right , for configuration , error handling , caching , testing , authentication , redirects , session management , HTML validation , and no doubt others .
Paste has a top - level executable ' paster ' .
If the first argument is " serve " , it launches the server / application / middleware combination specified in a Python - syntax configuration file .
Some of the configuration parameters are :
server : " wsgiutils " , " scgi " , " scgi_flup_fork " , " scgi_flup_threaded " , " console " , etc .
The console server is for debugging and dumps the response on the screen .
Run ' paster serve -- list - servers ' to see all servers with descriptions .

The console server is for debugging and dumps the response on the screen .
Run ' paster serve -- list - servers ' to see all servers with descriptions .
publish_app : a generic WSGI application .
This can be a function object , or a string naming the object to import .
This overrides the " framework " and " publish_dir " parameters .
: a generic WSGI application .

This overrides the " framework " and " publish_dir " parameters .
framework : " webkit " , " wareweb " , " subway " , etc .
The default uses webkit .
: " webkit " , " wareweb " , " subway " , etc .
The default uses webkit .
publish_dir : a directory containing a framework - specific application .
( Only used by certain frameworks . )
The configuration is read into a dictionary and available to all parts of the runtime .
This means frameworks can define additional parameters , and so can middleware and your application .
This allows you to put all configuration information in one place with one format .
For instance , a session middleware might need to know which directory to save to , and your application might need to know which database to connect to .
If the first argument is " create " , paster creates a stub directory for a new application .
You do n't have to do this -- you can build your own application directory from scratch -- but paster has skeletons for several common scenarios .
For instance :
$ paster create --template=webkit_zpt /tmp/paste_app.py $ ls /tmp/paste_app.py __init__.py server.conf sitepage.pyc web / __init__.pyc sitepage .py templates /
This creates a Webware application using Zope Page Templates and SQLObject .
Here 's what it contains :
__init.py__ :
Makes this directory a Python package so you can import it .
: Makes this directory a Python package so you can import it .
server.conf :
The configuration file .
: The configuration file .
sitepage .py : Class SitePage , the superclass of your servlets .
: Class , the superclass of your servlets .
templates :
Put your ZPT templates here .
By default you get a generic home page , a standard header / footer , and a basic error page .
: Put your ZPT templates here .
By default you get a generic home page , a standard header / footer , and a basic error page .
web :
The published directory .
Put your servlet and static files here .
The default home page lists the WSGI dictionary for the request .
Here 's the server .conf file created by the above command ( comments deleted ) :
import os app_template = ' webkit_zpt ' app_name = ' paste_app ' framework = ' webkit ' publish_dir = os.path.join( '/tmp/paste_app' , ' web ' ) sys_path = [ ' / tmp ' ] verbose =
False server = ' wsgiutils ' reload =
True debug = True
Obviously I did n't choose a good location since you do n't want / tmp in your Python path , but you get the idea .
( Note : do n't call your application directory " paste " or Python 's import mechanism will get confused . )
Paste had Twisted support but it removed due to bugginess and obsolescence .
New code for twisted .web2.wsgi ( not released yet ; in Twisted CVS only ) has not been written .
QLime
QLime is a rich framework built on top of Quixote .
I 'm mentioning it because it has an intriguing configuration system , one that might be useful for Paste or another meta - framework .
QLime uses a global " registry " reg , which is just a container for arbitrary attributes .
reg.site is the published application ; i.e. , a Quixote Directory and its sub-Directories .
reg.oc contains table classes for QLime 's object - relational mapper , and reg.ds contains database connection objects .
But you can set any attributes you want , such as reg.skin.red and reg.skin.blue , which might be instances describing user - selectable color themes .
The registry is built from a configuration file in Windows .ini format :
[ site qlime.registry .SiteObject ] [ site.colorhello colorhello.Hello ] skin_name=skin.red [ skin.red colorhello.Red ] [ skin.blue colorhello.Blue ] [ oc.note class:qlime.demo.noteapp.Note ] ds=notedb oc=default
Each [ ] line is a section header .
The first word in the header tells where in the registry to attach this object .
The second word names the class to instantiate .
Any key=value pairs are arguments to the constructor ( strings only ) .
If the second word begins with " class : " , it attaches the class itself rather than an instance .
In that case , the arguments are passed to a special class method , ._q_class_init .
So the above configuration corresponds roughly to :
from qlime .
registry import SiteObject from colorhello import Hello , Red , Blue from qlime.demo.noteapp import Note reg.site = SiteObject ( ) reg.site.colorhello = Hello( skin_name= " skin.red " ) reg.skin.red = Red( ) reg.skin.blue = Blue( ) reg.oc.note = Note # Class , not instance !
Note._q_class_init( ds =" notedb " , oc= " default " )
The web-sig
Python 's web - sig is a mailing list for coordinating the various web - related projects .
Discussion topics include how to improve the Python standard library for HTTP / HTML / framework support , and what third - party packages are needed and how they should be structured .
Of course the cabal cannot tell a developer what to do , but those interested in standardization will look to the group 's consensus , and the list is also a resource for questions like " Is anybody else working on X ? " and " How do I do Y ? "
The list is pretty active , and most of the bigwigs are on it .
So this is a good place to coordinate WSGI work .
Recent topics include making a Javascript library a la Nevow's , an AJAX framework , what Rails got that we do n't got , porting frameworks to Paste , etc .
Conclusion
WSGI is only part of the solution .
It helps interoperability but does nothing for the Python newbie who just wants to get a simple dynamic site up and running quickly and is overwhelmed by the choices .
Documentation is what the newbie needs , and the Python community needs to come to an agreement regarding the top framework (s ) to recommend , or perhaps the top framework for each purpose ( simple site , large site , heavily - loaded site ) .
Paste plays a paradoxical role .
On the one hand it encourages people to write even more frameworks to experiment with the expanding possibilities .
On the other hand , this new code will be designed with interoperability in mind , something we have n't had before .
And perhaps instead of compromising on one framework and giving up our beloved esoteric features , we can compromise on this meta - framework and keep our features , and Johnny Newbie will be less confused .
Next month I 'm planning an article on User - Centered Design and Usability Testing , and maybe the following month I 'll have more to report on Paste .

Cheese lovers can now watch cheddar mature 24 hours a day on the internet .
West country farmers set up the Cheddarvision website featuring a 25 kg block of cheddar , reports ITN .
Farmer Tom Calver -
" How many other cheeses do you know of on the internet that have their own webcam and a live feed to the internet ?
I do n't think many .
" The highlight of the day on www.cheddarvision.tv is at around 10 am when the cheese at the Somerset dairy is turned .
"
We've had 245,000 hits on our website , so somebody must like it somewhere .
" Marion Harris who is in charge of the live webcam - " I think if this website actually gets people to think a little bit more about where cheese comes from and the process it gets through before it gets in the shops , then I guess it 's a good thing . "
Music , Mind , and Meaning Marvin Minsky Computer Music Journal , Fall 1981 , Vol. 5 , Number 3
This is a revised version of AI Memo No. 616 , MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory .

Why Do We Like Music ?
Why do we like music ?
Our culture immerses us in it for hours each day , and everyone knows how it touches our emotions , but few think of how music touches other kinds of thought .
It is astonishing how little curiosity we have about so pervasive an " environmental " influence .
What might we discover if we were to study musical thinking ?
Have we the tools for such work ?
Years ago , when science still feared meaning , the new field of research called ' Artificial Intelligence ' started to supply new ideas about " representation of knowledge " that I 'll use here .
Are such ideas too alien for anything so subjective and irrational , aesthetic , and emotional as music ?
Not at all .
I think the problems are the same and those distinctions wrongly drawn : only the surface of reason is rational .
I do n't mean that understanding emotion is easy , only that understanding reason is probably harder .
Our culture has a universal myth in which we see emotion as more complex and obscure than intellect .
Indeed , emotion might be " deeper " in some sense of prior evolution , but this need not make it harder to understand ; in fact , I think today we actually know much more about emotion than about reason .
Certainly we know a bit about the obvious processes of reason the ways we organize and represent ideas we get .
But whence come those ideas that so conveniently fill these envelopes of order ?
A poverty of language shows how little this concerns us : we " get " ideas ; they " come " to us ; we are ' re - minded of " them .
I think this shows that ideas come from processes obscured from us and with which our surface thoughts are almost uninvolved .
Instead , we are entranced with our emotions , which are so easily observed in others and ourselves .
Perhaps the myth persists because emotions , by their nature , draw attention , while the processes of reason ( much more intricate and delicate ) must be private and work best alone .
The old distinctions among emotion , reason , and aesthetics are like the earth , air , and fire of an ancient alchemy .
We will need much better concepts than these for a working psychic chemistry .
Much of what we now know of the mind emerged in this century from other subjects once considered just as personal and inaccessible but which were explored , for example , by Freud in his work on adults ' dreams and jokes , and by Piaget in his work on children 's thought and play .
Why did such work have to wait for modern times ?
Before that , children seemed too childish and humor much too humorous for science to take them seriously .
Why do we like music ?
We all are reluctant , with regard to music and art , to examine our sources of pleasure or strength .
In part we fear success itself  we fear that understanding might spoil enjoyment .
Rightly so : art often loses power when its psychological roots are exposed .
No matter ; when this happens we will go on , as always , to seek more robust illusions !
I feel that music theory has gotten stuck by trying too long to find universals .
Of course , we would like to study Mozart 's music the way scientists analyze the spectrum of a distant star .
Indeed , we find some almost universal practices in every musical era .
But we must view these with suspicion , for they might show no more than what composers then felt should be universal .
If so , the search for truth in art becomes a travesty in which each era 's practice only parodies its predecessor 's prejudice .
Imagine formulating " laws " for television screenplays , taking them for natural phenomenon uninfluenced by custom or constraint of commerce .
The trouble with the search for universal laws of thought is that both memory and thinking interact and grow together .
We do not just learn about things , we learn ways to think about things ; then we can learn to think about thinking itself .
Before long , our ways of thinking become so complicated that we cannot expect to understand their details in terms of their surface operation , but we might understand the principles that guide their growth .
In much of this article I will speculate about how listening to music engages the previously acquired personal knowledge of the listener .
It has become taboo for music theorists to ask why we like what we like : our seekers have forgotten what they are searching for .
To be sure , we can't account for tastes , in general , because people have various preferences .
But this means only that we have to find the causes of this diversity of tastes , and this in turn means we must see that music theory is not only about music , but about how people process it .
To understand any art , we must look below its surface into the psychological details of its creation and absorption .
If explaining minds seems harder than explaining songs , we should remember that sometimes enlarging problems makes them simpler !
The theory of the roots of equations seemed hard for centuries within its little world of real numbers , but it suddenly seemed simple once Gauss exposed the larger world of so - called complex numbers .
Similarly , music should make more sense once seen through listeners ' minds .
Sonata as Teaching Machine
Music makes things in our minds , but afterward most of them fade away .
What remains ?
In one old story about Mozart , the wonder child hears a lengthy contrapuntal mass and then writes down the entire score .
I do not believe such tales , for history documents so few of them that they seem to be mere legend , though by that argument Mozart also would seem to be legend .
Most people do not even remember the themes of an evening 's concert .
Yet , when the tunes are played again , they are recognized .
Something must remain in the mind to cause this , and perhaps what we learn is not the music itself but a way of hearing it .
Compare a sonata to a teacher .
The teacher gets the pupils ' attention , either dramatically or by the quiet trick of speaking softly .
Next , the teacher presents the elements carefully , not introducing too many new ideas or developing them too far , for until the basics are learned the pupils cannot build on them .
So , at first , the teacher repeats a lot .
Sonatas , too , explain first one idea , then another , and then recapitulate it all .
( Music has many forms and there are many ways to teach .
I do not say that composers consciously intend to teach at all , yet they are masters at inventing forms for exposition , including those that swarm with more ideas and work our minds much harder . )
Thus ' expositions ' show the basic stuff the atoms of impending chemistries and how some simple compounds can be made from those atoms .
Then , in ' developments ' , those now - familiar compounds , made from bits and threads of beat and tone , can clash or merge , contrast or join together .
We find things that do not fit into familiar frameworks hard to understand such things seem meaningless .
I prefer to turn that around : a thing has meaning only after we have learned some ways to represent and process what it means , or to understand its parts and how they are put together .
What is the difference between merely knowing ( or remembering , or memorizing ) and understanding ?
We all agree that to understand something , we must know what it means , and that is about as far as we ever get .
I think I know why that happens .
A thing or idea seems meaningful only when we have several different ways to represent it different perspectives and different associations .
Then we can turn it around in our minds , so to speak : however it seems at the moment , we can see it another way and we never come to a full stop .
In other words , we can ' think ' about it .
If there were only one way to represent this thing or idea , we would not call this representation thinking .
So something has a " meaning " only when it has a few ; if we understood something just one way , we would not understand it at all .
That is why the seekers of the " real " meanings never find them .
This holds true especially for words like ' understand ' .
That is why sonatas start simply , as do the best of talks and texts .
The basics are repeated several times before anything larger or more complex is presented (l .
No one remembers word for word all that is said in a lecture or all notes that are played in a piece .
Yet if we have understood the lecture or piece once , we now " own " new networks of knowledge about each theme and how it changes and relates to others .
No one could remember all of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony from a single hearing , but neither could one ever again hear those first four notes as just four notes !
Once a tiny scrap of sound , these four notes have become a known thing a locus in the web of all the other things we know and whose meanings and significances depend on one another .
Learning to recognize is not the same as memorizing .
A mind might build an agent that can sense a certain stimulus , yet build no agent that can reproduce it .
How could such a mind learn that the first half - subject of Beethoven 's Fifthcall it Aprefigures the second half call it B ?
It is simple : an agent A that recognizes A sends a message to another agent B , built to recognize B .
That message serves to " lower B's threshold " so that after A hears A , B will react to smaller hints of B than it would otherwise .
As a result , that mind " expects " to hear B after A ; that is , it will discern B , given fewer or more subtle cues , and might " complain " if it cannot .
Yet that mind cannot reproduce either theme in any generative sense .
The point is that inter - agent messages need not be in surface music languages , but can be in codes that influence certain other agents to behave in different ways .
( Andor Kovach pointed out to me that composers do not dare use this simple , four - note motive any more .
So memorable was Beethoven 's treatment that now an accidental hint of it can wreck another piece by unintentionally distracting the Listener . )
If sonatas are lessons , what are the subjects of those lessons ?
The answer is in the question !
One thing the Fifth Symphony taught us is how to hear those first four notes .
The surface form is just : descending major third , first tone repeated thrice .
At first , that pattern can be heard two different ways :
Fifth and third in minor mode , or
Third and tonic in major mode .
But once we have heard the symphony , the latter is unthinkable a strange constraint to plant in all our heads !
Let us see how it is taught .
The Fifth declares at once its subject , then its near - identical twin .
First comes the theme .
Presented in a stark orchestral unison , its minor mode location in tonality is not yet made explicit , nor is its metric frame yet clear : the subject stands alone in time .
Next comes its twin .
The score itself leaves room to view this transposed counterpart as a complement or as a new beginning .
Until now , fermatas have hidden the basic metric frame , a pair of twinned four - measure halves .
So far we have only learned to hear those halves as separate wholes .
The next four - measure metric half - frame shows three versions of the subject , one on each ascending pitch of the tonic triad .
( Now we arc sure the key is minor . )
This shows us how the subject can be made to overlap itself , the three short notes packed perfectly inside the long tone 's time - space .
The second half - frame does the same , with copies of the complement ascending the dominant seventh chord .
This fits the halves together in that single , most familiar , frame of harmony .
In rhythm , too , the halves are so precisely congruent that there is no room to wonder how to match them and attach them into one eight - measure unit .
The next eight - measure frame explains some more melodic points : how to smooth the figure 's firmness with passing tones and how to counterpoise the subject 's own inversion inside the long note .
( I think that this evokes a sort of sinusoidal motion - frame idea that is later used to represent the second subject . )
It also illustrates compression of harmonic time ; seen earlier , this would obscure the larger rhythmic unit , but now we know enough to place each metric frame precisely on the afterimage of the one before .
Then ,
Cadence .
Silence .
Almost .
Total .
Now it is the second subject - twin 's turn to stand alone in time .
The conductor must select a symmetry : he or she can choose to answer prior cadence , to start anew , or to close the brackets opened at the very start .
Can the conductor do all at once and maintain the metric frame ?
We hear a long , long unison F ( Subdominant ? ) for , underneath that silent surface sound , we hear our minds rehearsing what was heard .
The next frame reveals the theme again , descending now by thirds .
We see that it was the dominant ninth , not subdominant at all .
The music fooled us that time , but never will again .
Then , tour de force : the subject climbs , sounding on every scale degree .
This new perspective shows us how to see the four - note theme as an appogiatura .
Then , as it descends on each tonic chord - note , we are made to see it as a fragment of arpeggio .
That last descent completes a set of all four possibilities , harmonic and directional .
( Is this deliberate didactic thoroughness , or merely the accidental outcome of the other symmetries ? )
Finally , the theme 's melodic range is squeezed to nothing , yet it survives and even gains strength as single tone .
It has always seemed to me a mystery of art , the impact of those moments in quartets when texture turns to single line and fortepiano shames sforzando in perceived intensity .
But such acts , which on the surface only cause the structure or intensity to disappear , must make the largest difference underneath .
Shortly , I will propose a scheme in which a sudden , searching change awakes a lot of mental Difference - Finders .
This very change wakes yet more difference - finders , and this awakening wakes still more .
That is how sudden silence makes the whole mind come alive .
We are " told " all this in just one minute of the lesson and I have touched but one dimension of its rhetoric .
Besides explaining , teachers beg and threaten , calm and scare ; use gesture , timbre , quaver , and sometimes even silence .
This is vital in music , too .
Indeed , in the Fifth , it is the start of the subject !
Such " lessons " must teach us as much about triads and triplets as mathematicians have learned about angles and sides !
Think how much we can learn about minor second intervals from Beethoven 's Grosse Fuge in E - flat , Opus 133 .
What Use Is Music ?
Why on earth should anyone want to learn such things ?
Geometry is practical for building pyramids , for instance but of what use is musical knowledge ?
Here is one idea .
Each child spends endless days in curious ways ; we call this play .
A child stacks and packs all kinds of blocks and boxes , lines them up , and knocks them down .
What is that all about ?
Clearly , the child is learning about space !
But how on earth does one learn about time ?
Can one time fit inside another ?
Can two of them go side by side ?
In music , we find out !
It is often said that mathematicians are unusually involved in music , but that musicians are not involved in mathematics .
Perhaps both mathematicians and musicians like to make simple things more complicated , but mathematics may be too constrained to satisfy that want entirely , while music can be rigorous or free .
The way the mathematics game is played , most variations lie outside the rules , while music can insist on perfect canon or tolerate a casual accompaniment .
So mathematicians might need music , but musicians might not need mathematics .
A simpler theory is that since music engages us at earlier ages , some mathematicians are those missing mathematical musicians .
Most adults have some childlike fascination for making and arranging larger structures out of smaller ones .
One kind of musical understanding involves building large mental structures out of smaller , musical parts .
Perhaps the drive to build those mental music structures is the same one that makes us try to understand the world .
( Or perhaps that drive is just an accidental mutant variant of it ; evolution often copies needless extra stuff , and minds so new as ours must contain a lot of that . )
Sometimes , though , we use music as a trick to misdirect our understanding of the world .
When thoughts are painful we have no way to make them stop .
We can attempt to turn our minds to other matters , but doing this ( some claim ) just submerges the bad thoughts .
Perhaps the music that some call ' background ' music can tranquilize by turning under - thoughts from bad to neutral , leaving the surface thoughts free of affect by diverting the unconscious .
The structures we assemble in that detached kind of listening might be wholly solipsistic webs of meaninglike cross-references that nowhere touch " reality . "
In such a self - constructed world , we would need no truth or falsehood , good or evil , pain or joy .
Music , in this unpleasant view , would serve as a fine escape from tiresome thoughts .
Syntactic Theories of Music
Contrast two answers to the question , Why do we like certain tunes ?
Because they have certain structural features .
Because they resemble other tunes we like .
The first answer has to do with the laws and rules that make tunes pleasant .
In language , we know some laws for sentences ; that is , we know the forms sentences must have to be syntactically acceptable , if not the things they must have to make them sensible or even pleasant to the ear .
As to melody , it seems that we only know some features that can help but we know of no absolutely essential features .
I do not expect much more to come of a search for a compact set of rules for musical phrases .
( The point is not so much about what we mean by ' rule ' , as about how large is the body of knowledge involved . )
The second answer has to do with significance outside the tune itself , in the same way that asking " Which sentences are meaningful ? " takes us outside shared linguistic practice and forces us to look upon each person 's private tangled webs of thought .
Those private webs feed upon themselves , as in all spheres involving preference : we tend to like things that remind us of the other things we like .
For example , some of us like music that resembles the songs , carols , rhymes , and hymns we liked in childhood .
All this begs this question :
If we like new tunes that are similar to those we already like , where does our liking for music start ?
I will come back to this later .
The term ' resemble ' begs a question too :
What are the rules of musical resemblance ?
I am sure that this depends a lot on how melodies are " represented " in each individual mind .
In each single mind , some different " mind parts " do this different ways : the same tune seems ( at different times ) to change its rhythm , mode , or harmony .
Beyond that , individuals differ even more .
Some listeners squirm to symmetries and shapes that others scarcely hear at all and some fine fugue subjects seem banal to those who sense only a single line .
My guess is that our contrapuntal sensors harmonize each fading memory with others that might yet be played ; perhaps Bach 's mind could do this several ways at once .
Even one such process might suffice to help an improviser plan what to try to play next .
( To try is sufficient since improvisers , like stage magicians , know enough vamps or ' ways out ' to keep the music going when bold experiments fail .
How is it possible to improvise or comprehend a complex contrapuntal piece ?
Simple statistical explanations cannot begin to describe such processes .
Much better are the generative and transformational ( e.g. , neo - Schenkerian ) theories of syntactic analysis , but only for the simplest analytic uses .
At best , the very aim of syntax - oriented music theories is misdirected because they aspire to describe the sentences that minds produce without attempting to describe how the sentences are produced .
Meaning is much more than sentence structure .
We can not expect to be able to describe the anatomy of the mind unless we understand its embryology .
And so ( as with most any other very complicated matter ) , science must start with surface systems of description .
But this surface taxonomy , however elegant and comprehensive in itself , must yield in the end to a deeper , causal explanation .
To understand how memory and process merge in " listening , " we will have to learn to use much more " procedural " descriptions , such as programs that describe how processes proceed .
In science , we always first explain things in terms of what can be observed .
{ Earth , water , fire , air . ]
Yet things that come from complicated processes do not necessarily show their natures on the surface .
[ The steady pressure of a gas conceals those countless , abrupt micro-impacts . ]
To speak of what such things might mean or represent , we have to speak of how they are made .
We cannot describe how the mind is made without having good ways to describe complicated processes .
Before computers , no languages were good for that .
Piaget tried algebra and Freud tried diagrams ; other psychologists used Markov Chains and matrices , but none came to much Behaviorists , quite properly , had ceased to speak at all .
Linguists flocked to formal syntax , and made progress for a time but reached a limit : transformational grammar shows the contents of the registers ( so to speak ) , but has no way to describe what controls them .
This makes it hard to say how surface speech relates to underlying designation and intenta baby - and - bath - water situation .
I prefer ideas from
Al research because there we tend to seek procedural description first , which seems more appropriate for mental matters .
I do not see why so many theorists find this approach disturbing .
It is true that the new power derived from this approach has a price : we can say more , with computational description , but prove less .
Yet less is lost than many think , for mathematics never could prove much about such complicated things .
Theorems often tell us complex truths about the simple things , but only rarely tell us simple truths about the complex ones .
To believe otherwise is wishful thinking or " mathematics envy . "
Many musical problems that resist formal solutions may turn out to be tractable anyway , in future simulations that grow artificial musical semantic networks , perhaps by " raising " simulated infants in traditional musical cultures .
It will be exciting when one of these infants first shows a hint of real " talent . "
Space and Tune
When we enter a room , we seem to see it all at once ; we are not permitted this illusion when listening to a symphony .
" Of course , " one might declare , for hearing has to thread a serial path through time , while sight embraces a space all at once .
Actually , it takes time to see new scenes , though we are not usually aware of this .
That totally compelling sense that we are conscious of seeing everything in the room instantly and immediately is certainly the strangest of our " optical " illusions .
Music , too , immerses us in seemingly stable worlds !
How can this be , when there is so little of it present at each moment ?
I will try to explain this by ( 1 ) arguing that hearing music is like viewing scenery and ( 2 ) by asserting that when we hear good music our minds react in very much the same way they do when we see things . '
And make no mistake : I meant to say " good " music !
This little theory is not meant to work for any senseless bag of musical tricks , but only for those certain kinds of music that , in their cultural times and places , command attention and approval .
( Edward Fredkin suggested to me the theory that listening to music might exercise some innate map - making mechanism in the brain .
When I mentioned the puzzle of music 's repetitiousness , he compared it to the way rodents explore new places : first they go one way a little , then back to home .
They do it again a few times , then go a little farther .
They try small digressions , but frequently return to base .
Both people and mice explore new territories that way , making mental maps lest they get lost .
Music might portray this building process , or even exercise those very parts of the mind . )
To see the problem in a slightly different way , consider cinema .
Contrast a novice 's clumsy patched and pasted reels of film with those that transport us to other worlds so artfully composed that our own worlds seem shoddy and malformed .
What " hides the seams " to make great films so much less than the sum of their parts so that we do not see them as mere sequences of scenes ?
What makes us feel that we are there and part of it when we are in fact immobile in our chairs , helpless to deflect an atom of the projected pattern 's predetermined destiny ?
I will follow this idea a little further , then try to explain why good music is both more and less than sequences of notes .
Our eyes are always flashing sudden flicks of different pictures to our brains , yet none of that saccadic action leads to any sense of change or motion in the world ; each thing reposes calmly in its " place " !
What makes those objects stay so still while images jump and jerk so ?
What makes us such innate Copernicans ?
I will first propose how this illusion works in vision , then in music .
We will find the answer deep within the way the mind regards itself .
When speaking of illusion , we assume that someone is being fooled .
" I know those lines are straight , " I say , " but they look bent to me . "
Who are those different I 's and me's ?
We are all convinced that somewhere in each person struts a single , central self : atomic and indivisible .
( And secretly we hope that it is also indestructible . )
I believe , instead , that inside each mind work many different agents .
( The idea of societies of agents [ Minsky 1977 ; 1980a ; 1980b ] originated in my work with Seymour Papert . )
All we really need to know about agents is this : each agent knows what happens to some others , but little of what happens to the rest .
It means little to say , " Eloise was unaware of X " unless we say more about which of her mind - agents were uninvolved with X .
Thinking consists of making mind - agents work together ; the very core of fruitful thought is breaking problems into different kinds of parts and then assigning the parts to the agents that handle them best .
{ Among our most important agents are those that manage these assignments , for they are the agents that embody what each person knows about what he or she knows .
Without these agents we would be helpless , for we would not know what our knowing is for . )
In that division of labor we call ' seeing ' , I will suppose that a certain mind - agent called Feature - Finder sends messages ( about features it finds on the retina ) to another agent , Scene - Analyzer .
Scene - Analyzer draws conclusions from the messages it gets and sends its own , in turn , to other mind - parts .
For instance , Feature - Finder finds and tells about some scraps of edge and texture ; then scene analyzer finds and tells that these might fit some bit of shape .
Perhaps those features come from glimpses of a certain real table leg .
But knowing such a thing is not for agents at this level ; scene - analyzer does not know of any such specific things .
All it can do is broadcast something about shape to hosts of other agents who specialize in recognizing special things .
Since special things like tables , words , or dogs  must be involved with memory and learning , there is at least one such agent for every kind of thing this mind has learned to recognize .
Thus , we can hope , this message reaches Table - Maker , an agent specialized to recognize evidence that a table is in the field of view .
After many such stages , descendants of such messages finally reach Space - Builder , an agent that tries to tell of real things in real space .
Now we can see one reason why perception seems so effortless : while messages from Scene - Analyzer to Table - Maker are based on evidence that Feature - Finder supplied , the messages themselves need not say what feature - finder itself did , or how it did it .
Partly this is because it would take scene - analyzer too long to explain all that .
In any case , the recipients could make no use of all that information since they are not engineers or psychologists , but just little specialized nerve nets .
Only in the past few centuries have painters learned enough technique and trickery to simulate reality .
( Once so informed , they often now choose different goals .
Thus Space - Builder , like an ordinary person , knows nothing of how vision works , or about perspective , foveae , or blind spots .
We only learn such things in school : millennia of introspection never led to their suspicion , nor did meditation , transcendental or mundane .
The mind holds tightly to its secrets not from stinginess or shame , but simply because it does not know them .
Messages , in this scheme , go various ways .
Each motion of the eye or head or body makes Feature - Finder start anew , and such motions are responses by muscle - moving agents to messages that Scene - Analyzer sends when it needs more details to resolve ambiguities .
Scene - Analyzer itself responds to messages from " higher up . "
For instance , Space - Builder may have asked , " Is that a table ? " of Table - Maker , which replies to itself , " Perhaps , but it should have another legthere , " so it asks scene - analyzer to verify this , and Scene - Analyzer gets the job done by making Eye - Mover look down and to the left .
Nor is Scene - Understander autonomous : its questions to Scene - Analyzer are responses to requests from others .
There need be no first cause in such a network .
When we look up , we are never afraid that the ground has disappeared no matter that it has " dis-appeared . "
This is because Space - Builder remembers all the answers to its questions and never CHANGES any of those answers without reason ; moving our eyes or raising our heads provide no cause to exorcise that floor inside our current spatial model of the room .
My paper on frame - systems [ Minsky 1974 ] says more about these concepts .
Here we need only these few details .
Now , back to our illusions .
While Feature - Finder is not instantaneous , it is very , very fast and a highly parallel pattern matcher .
Whatever Scene - Analyzer asks , Feature - Finder answers in an eye flick , a mere tenth of a second ( or less if we have image buffers ) .
More speed comes from the way in which Space - Builder can often tell itself , via its own high - speed model memory , about what has been seen before .
I argue that all this speed is another root of our illusion :
If answers seem to come as soon as questions are asked , they will seem to have been there all along .
The illusion is enhanced in yet another way by ' " expectation " or " default . "
Those agents know good ways to lie and bluff !
Aroused by only partial evidence that a table is in view , Table - Maker supplies Space - Builder with fictitious details about some " typical table ' " while its servants find out more about the real one !
Once so informed , Space - Builder can quickly move and plan ahead , taking some risks but ready to make corrections later .
This only works , of course , when prototypes are good , and are rightly activated that is what intelligence is all about .
As for " awareness " of how all such things are done , there simply is not room for that .
Space - Builder is too remote and different to understand how feature - finder does its work of eye fixation .
Each part of the mind is unaware of almost all that happens in the others .
( That is why we need psychologists ; we think we know what happens in our minds because those agents are so facile with " defaults "  but really , we are almost always wrong about such things . )
True , each agent needs to know which of its servants can do what , but as to how , that information has no place or use inside those tiny minds inside our minds .
How do both music and vision build things in our minds ?
Eye motions show us real objects ; phrases show us musical objects .
We " learn " a room with bodily motions ; large musical sections show us musical " places . "
Walks and climbs move us from room to room ; so do transitions between musical sections .
Looking back in vision is like recapitulation in music ; both give us time , at certain points , to reconfirm or change our conceptions of the whole .
Hearing a theme is like seeing a thing in a room , a section or movement is like a room , and a whole sonata is like an entire building .
I do not mean to say that music builds the sorts of things that space - builder does .
( That is too naive a comparison of sound and place . )
I do mean to say that composers stimulate coherency by engaging the same sorts of inter-agent coordinations that vision uses to produce its illusion of a stable world using , of course , different agents .
I think the same is true of talk or writing , the way these very paragraphs make sense or sense of sense if any .
Composing and Conducting
In seeing , we can move our eyes ; lookers can choose where they shall look , and when .
In music we must listen * here * ; that is , to the part that 's being played now .
It is simply no use asking Music - Finder to look * there * because it 's not then , now .
If composer and conductor choose what part we hear , does not this ruin our analogy ?
When Music - Analyzer asks its questions , how can Music - Finder answer them unless , miraculously , the music happens to be playing what music - finder wants at just that very instant ?
If so , then how can music paint its scenes unless composers know exactly what the listeners will ask at every moment ?
How to ensure when Music - Analyzer wants it now that precisely that " something " will be playing now ?
That is the secret of music of writing , playing , and conducting it !
Music need not , of course , confirm each listener 's every expectation ; each plot demands some novelty .
Whatever the intent , control is required or novelty will turn to nonsense .
If allowed to think too much themselves , the listeners will find unanswered questions in any score about accidents of form and figure , voice and line , temperament and difference - tone .
Composers can have different goals : to calm and soothe , surprise and shock , tell tales , stage scenes , teach new things , or tear down prior arts .
For some such purposes composers must use the known forms and frames or else expect misunderstanding .
Of course , when expectations are confirmed too often the style may seem dull ; this is our concern in the next section .
Yet , just as in language , one often best explains a new idea by using older ones , avoiding jargon or too much lexical innovation .
If readers cannot understand the words themselves , the sentences may " be Greek to them . "
This is not a matter of a simple hierarchy , in which each meaning stands on lower - level ones , for example , word , phrase , sentence , paragraph , and chapter .
Things never really work that way , and jabberwocky shows how sense comes through though many words are new .
In every era some contemporary music changes basic elements yet exploits established larger forms , but innovations that violate too drastically the expectations of the culture cannot meet certain kinds of goals .
Of course this will not apply to works whose goals include confusion and revolt , or when composers try to create things that hide or expurgate their own intentionality , but in these instances it may be hard to hold the audience .
Each musical artist must forecast and pre-direct the listener 's fixations to draw attention here and distract it from there to force the hearer ( again , like a magician does ) to ask only the questions that the composition is about to answer .
Only by establishing such pre-established harmony can music make it seem that something is there .
Rhythm and Redundancy
A popular song has 100 measures , 1000 beats .
What must the Martians imagine we mean by those measures and beats , measures and beats !
The words themselves reveal an awesome repetitiousness .
Why is n't music boring ?
Is hearing so like seeing that we need a hundred glances to build each musical image ?
Some repetitive musical textures might serve to remind us of things that persist through time like wind and stream .
But many sounds occur only once : we must hear a pin drop now or seek and search for it ; this is one reason why we have no ear - lids .
Poetry drops pins , it says each thing just once or not at all .
So does some music .
Then why do we tolerate music 's relentless rhythmic pulse or other repetitive architectural features ?
There is no one answer , for we hear in different ways , on different scales .
Some of those ways portray the spans of time directly , but others speak of musical ' things ' , in worlds where time folds over on itself .
And there , I think , is where we use those beats and measures .
Music 's metric frames are transient templates used for momentary matching .
Its rhythms are " synchronization pulses " used to match new phrases against old , the better to contrast them with differences and change .
As differences and change are sensed , the rhythmic frames fade from our awareness .
Their work is done and the messages of higher - level agents never speak of them ; that is why metric music is not boring !
Good music germinates from tiny seeds .
How cautiously we handle novelty , sandwiching the new between repeated sections of familiar stuff !
The clearest kind of change is near - identity , in thought just as in vision .
Slight shifts in view may best reveal an object 's form or even show us whether it is there at all .
When we discussed sonatas , we saw how matching different metric frames helps us to sense the musical ingredients .
Once frames are matched , we can see how altering a single note at one point will change a major third melodic skip at another point to smooth passing tones ; or will make what was * there * a seventh chord into , * here * , a dominant ninth with missing root .
Matching lets our minds see different things , from different times , together .
This fusion of those matching lines of tone from different measures  like television 's separate lines and frames lets us make those magic musical pictures in our minds .
How do our musical agents do this kind of work for us ?
We must have organized them into structures that are good at finding differences between frames .
Here is a simplified four - level scheme that might work .
Many such ideas are current in research on vision ( Winston 1975 ) .
Feature - Finders listen for simple time - events such as notes or peaks or pulses .
Measure - Takers notice certain patterns of time - events like 3/4 , 4/4 , 6/8 .
Difference - Finders notice that figure X is like figure Y , but higher by a fifth .
Structure - Builders notice that three phrases form an a regular " sequence . "
The idea of interconnecting Feature - Finders , Difference - Finders , and Structure - Builders is well - exemplified in Winston 's work [ 1975 ] .
Measure - Takers would be kinds of ' frames ' , as described in [ Minsky 1974 ] .
First , the Feature - Finders search the sound stream for the simplest sorts of musical significance : entrances and envelopes , the tones themselves , the other little , local things .
Then Measure - Takers look for metric patterns in those small events and put them into groups , thus finding beats and postulating rhythmic regularities .
Then the Difference - Finders can begin to sense events of musical importanceimitations and inversions , syncopations and suspensions .
Once these are found , the Structure - Builders can start work on a larger scale .
The entire four - level agency is just one layer of a larger system in which analogous structures are repeated on larger scales .
At each scale , another level of order ( with its own sorts of things and differences ) makes larger - scale descriptions , and thus consumes another order of structural form .
As a result , notes become figures , figures turn into phrases , and phrases turn into sequences ; and notes become chords , and chords make up progressions , and so on and on .
Relations at each level turn to things at the next level above and are thus more easily remembered and compared .
This " time - warps " things together , changing tone into tonality , note into composition .
The more regular the rhythm , the easier the matching goes and the fewer difference agents are excited further on .
Thus once it is used for " lining up , " the metric structure fades from our attention because it is represented as fixed and constant like the floor of the room you are in , until some metric alteration makes the measure - takers change their minds .
Sic semper all Alberti basses , um - pah - pahs , and ostinati : they all become imperceptible except when changing .
Rhythm has many other functions , to be sure , and agents for those other functions see things different ways .
Agents used for dancing do attend to rhythm , while other forms of music demand less steady pulses .
We all experience a phenomenon we might call ' persistence of rhythm ' , in which our minds maintain the beat through episodes of ambiguity .
I presume that this emerges from a basic feature of how agents are usually assembled ; at every level , many agents of each kind compete [ Minsky 1980 b ] .
Thus agents for 3/4 , 4/4 , and 6/8 compete to find best fits .
Once in power , however , each agent " cross- inhibits " its competitors .
Once 3/ 4 takes charge of things , 6/8 will find it hard to " get a hearing " even if the evidence on its side becomes slightly better .
When none of the agents has any solid evidence long enough , agents change at random or take turns .
Thus anything gets interesting , in a way , if it is monotonous enough !
We all know how , when a word or phrase is repeated often enough it , it appears to change as restless searchers start to amplify minutiae and interpret noise as structure .
This happens at all levels because when things are regular at one level , the difference agents at the next will fail , to be replaced by other , fresh ones that then re-present the sameness different ways .
( Thus meditation , undirected from the higher mental realms , fares well with the most banal of repetitious inputs from below . )
Regularities are hidden while expressive nuances are sensed and emphasized and passed along .
Rubato or crescendo , ornament or passing tone , the alterations at each level become the objects for the next .
The mystery is solved ; the brain is so good at sensing differences that it forgets the things themselves ; that is , whenever they are the same .
As for liking music , that depends on what remains .
Sentic Significance
Why do we like any tunes in the first place ?
Do we simply associate some tunes with pleasant experiences ?
Should we look back to the tones and patterns of mother 's voice or heartbeat ?
Or could it be that some themes are innately likable ?
All these theories could hold truth , and others too , for nothing need have a single cause inside the mind .
Theories about children need not apply to adults because ( I suspect ) human minds do so much self - revising that things can get detached from their origins .
We might end up liking both The Art of Fugue and The Musical Offering , mainly because each work 's subject illuminates the other , which gives each work a richer network of " significance . "
Dependent circularity need be no paradox here , for in thinking ( unlike logic ) two things can support each other in midair .
To be sure , such autonomy is precarious ; once detached from origins , might one not drift strangely awry ?
Indeed so , and many people seem quite mad to one another .
In his book Sentics [ l978 ] , the pianist - physiologist Manfred Clynes describes certain specific temporal sensory patterns and claims that each is associated with a certain common emotional state .
For example , in his experiments , two particular patterns that gently rise and fall are said to suggest states of love and reverence ; two others ( more abrupt ) signify anger and hate .
He claims that these and other patterns he calls them ' sentic ' arouse the same effects through different senses that is , embodied as acoustical intensity , or pitch , or tactile pressure , or even visual motion and that this is cross-cultural .
The time lengths of these sentic shapes , on the order of 1 sec , could correspond to parts of musical phrases .
Clynes studied the " muscular " details of instrumental performances with this in view , and concluded that music can engage emotions through these sentic signals .
Of course , more experiments are needed to verify that such signals really have the reported effects .
Nevertheless , I would expect to find something of the sort for quite a different reason : namely , to serve in the early social development of children .
Sentic signals ( if they exist ) would be quite useful in helping infants to learn about themselves and others .
All learning theories require brains to somehow impose " values " implicit or explicit in the choice of what to learn to do .
Most such theories say that certain special signals , called reinforcers , are involved in this .
For certain goals it should suffice to use some simple , " primary " physiological stimuli like eating , drinking , relief of physical discomfort .
Human infants must learn social signals , too .
The early learning theorists in this century assumed that certain social sounds ( for instance , of approval ) could become reinforcers by association with innate reinforcers , but evidence for this was never found .
If parents could exploit some innate sentic cues , that mystery might be explained .
This might also touch another , deeper problem : that of how an infant forms an image of its own mind .
Self - images are important for at least two reasons .
First , external reinforcement can only be a part of human learning ; the growing infant must eventually learn to learn from within to free itself from its parents .
With Freud , I think that children must replace and augment the outside teacher with a self - constructed , inner , parent image .
Second , we need a self - model simply to make realistic plans for solving ordinary problems .
For example , we must know enough about our own dispositions to be able to assess which plans are feasible .
Pure self - commitment does not work ; we simply cannot carry out a plan that we will find too boring to complete or too vulnerable to other , competing interests .
We need models of our own behavior .
How could a baby be smart enough to build such a model ?
Innate sentic detectors could help by teaching children about their own affective states .
For if distinct signals arouse specific states , the child can associate those signals with those states .
Just knowing that such states exist , that is , having symbols for them , is half the battle .
If those signals are uniform enough , then from social discourse one can learn some rules about the behavior caused by those states .
Thus a child might learn that conciliatory signals can change anger into affection .
Given that sort of information , a simple learning machine should be able to construct a ' finite - state person model . "
This model would be crude at first , but to get started would be half of the job .
Once the baby had a crude model of some other person , it could be copied and adapted in work on the baby 's own self - model .
This is more normative and constructional than it is descriptive , as Freud hinted , because the self - model dictates ( rather than portrays ) what it purports to portray .
With regard to music , it seems possible that we conceal , in the innocent songs and setting of our children 's musical cultures , some lessons about successions of our own affective states .
Sentically encrypted , those ballads could encode instructions about conciliation and affection , or aggression and retreat precisely the knowledge of signals and states that we need to get along with others .
In later life , more complex music might illustrate more intricate kinds of compromise and conflict , ways to fit goals together to achieve more than one thing at a time .
Finally , for grown - ups , our Burgesses and Kubricks fit Odes to Joy to Clockwork Oranges .
If you find all this farfetched , so do I .
But before rejecting it entirely , recall the question , Why do we have music , and let it occupy our lives with no apparent reason ?
When no idea seems right , the right one must seem wrong .
Theme and Thing
What is the subject of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony ?
Is it just those first four notes ?
Does it include the twin , transposed companion too ?
What of the other variations , augmentations , and inversions ?
Do they all stem from a single prototype ?
In this case , yes .
Or do they ?
For later in the symphony the theme appears in triplet form to serve as countersubject of the scherzo : three notes and one , three notes and one , three notes and one , still they make four .
Melody turns into monotone rhythm ; meter is converted to two equal beats .
Downbeat now falls on an actual note , instead of a silence .
With all of those changes , the themes are quite different and yet the same .
Neither the form in the allegro nor the scherzo alone is the prototype ; separate and equal , they span musical time .
Is there some more abstract idea that they both embody ?
This is like the problem raised by Wittgenstein of what words like game mean .
In my paper on frames [ Minsky 1974 ]
I argue that for vision , ' chair ' can be described by no single prototype ; it is better to use several prototypes connected in relational networks of similarities and differences .
I doubt that even these would suffice to well represent musical ideas ; there are better tools in conceptual dependency , frame - systems , and semantic networks .
( See Roads , 1980 . )
What is a good theme ?
Without that bad word good , I do not think the question is well formed because anything is a theme if everything is music !
So let us split that question into ( 1 ) What mental conditions or processes do pleasant tunes evoke ?
and ( 2 ) What do we mean by pleasant ?
Both questions are hard , but the first is only hard ; to answer it will take much thought and experimentation , which is good .
The second question is very different .
Philosophers and scientists have struggled mightily to understand what pain and pleasure are .
I especially like Dennett's [ 1978 ] explanation of why that has been so difficult .
He argues that pain " works " in different ways at different times , and all those ways have too little in common for the usual definition .
I agree , but if pain is not a single thing , why do we talk and think as though it were and then represent it with such spurious clarity ?
This is no accident : illusions of this sort have special uses .
They play a role connected with a problem facing any society ( inside or outside the mind ) that learns from its experience .
The problem is how to assign the credit and blame , for each accomplishment or failure of the society as a whole , among the myriad agents involved in everything that happens .
To the extent that the agents ' actions are decided locally , so also must these decisions to credit or blame he made locally .
How , for example , can a mother tell that her child has a need ( or that a need has been satisfied ) before she has learned specific signs for each such need ?
That could be arranged if , by evolution , signals were combined from many different internal processes concerned with needs and were provided with a single , common , outputan infant 's sentic signal of discomfort ( or contentment ) .
Such a genetically pre-established harmony would evoke a corresponding central state in the parent .
We would feel this as something like the distress we feel when babies cry .
A signal for satisfaction is also needed .
Suppose , among the many things a child does , there is one that mother likes , which she demonstrates by making approving sounds .
The child has just been walking there , and holding this just so , and thinking that , and speaking in some certain way .
How can the mind of the child find out which behavior is good ?
The trouble is , each aspect of the child 's behavior must result from little plans the child made before .
We can not reward an act .
We can only reward the agency that selected that strategy , the agent who wisely activated the first agent , and so on .
Alas for those behaviorists who wasted their lives life by missing this simple principle .
To reward all those agents and processes , we must propagate some message that they all can use to credit what they did ; the plans they made , their strategies and computations .
These various recipients have so little in common that such a message of approval , to work at all , must be extremely simple .
Words like good are almost content - free messages that enable tutors , inside or outside a society , to tell the members that one or more of them has satisfied some need , and that tutor need not understand which members did what , or how , or even why .
Words like ' satisfy ' and ' need ' have many shifting meanings .
Why , then , do we seem to understand them ?
Because they evoke that same illusion of substantiality that fools us into thinking it tautologous to ask , why do we like pleasure ?
This serves a need : the levels of social discourse at which we use such clumsy words as ' like ' , or ' good ' , or ' that was fun ' must coarsely crush together many different meanings or we will never understand others ( or ourselves ) at all .
Hence that precious , essential poverty of word and sign that makes them so hard to define .
Thus the word ' good ' is no symbol that simply means or designates , as ' table ' does .
Instead , it only names this protean injunction : Activate all those unknown processes that correlate and sift and sort , in learning , to see what changes ( in myself ) should now be made .
The word like is just like good , except it is a name we use when we send such structure - building signals to ourselves .
Most of the " uses " of music mentioned in this article learning about time , fitting things together , getting along with others , and suppressing one 's troubles are very " functional , but overlook much larger scales of " use . "
Curtis Roads remarked that , " Every world above bare survival is self constructed ; whole cultures are built around common things people come to appreciate . "
These appreciations , represented by aesthetic agents , play roles in more and more of our decisions : what we think is beautiful gets linked to what we think is important .
Perhaps , Roads suggests , when groups of mind - agents cannot agree , they tend to cede decisions to those others more concerned with what , for better or for worse , we call aesthetic form and fitness .
By having small effects at many little points , those cumulative preferences for taste and form can shape a world .
That is another reason why we say we like the music we like .
Liking is the way certain mind - parts make the others learn the things they need to understand that music .
Hence liking and its relativeslies at the very heart of understanding what we hear .
' Affect ' and ' aesthetic ' do not lie in other academic worlds that music theories safely can ignore .
Those other worlds are academic self - deceptions that we use to make each theorist 's problem seem like someone else's .
Note : Many readers of a draft of this article complained about its narrow view of music .
What about jazz and other " modern " forms .
What about songs with real words , monophonic chants and ragas , music made with gongs and blocks , and all those other kinds of sounds ?
And what about those listeners who claim to be less intellectual , to simply hear and feel and not to build those big constructions in their minds ?
We can't discuss here all those things , but we can ask how anyone could be so sure much about what their minds do .
It is ingenuous to think that you " just react " to anything a culture works a thousand years to develop .
In any case , because it 's not my purpose here to define boundaries , it 's better to focus in on something that we all agree is musical  and that is why I chose this Symphony .
For what is music ?
All things played on all instruments ?
Fiddlesticks .
All structures made of sound ?
That has a hollow ring .
The things I said of words like ' theme ' hold true for words like ' music ' too : that word is public property , but not all the senses of its meanings to each different listener .

The Israeli air force strikes severed Lebanon 's last significant road link to Syria , stopped a convoy carrying 150 tonnes of relief and cut what the UN called its " umbilical cord " for aid supplies .
Five Lebanese civilians were killed and 19 wounded in the bombing raids , which hit Christian areas in which Hizbollah has little support or presence .
More than two dozen farm workers died in a separate air strike near the Lebanon - Syria border .
The Israeli army said three of its soldiers were killed by an anti-tank missile during fighting in southern Lebanon , and an army spokesman said at least seven Hizbollah fighters had been killed during fighting in the Lebanese town of Markaba .
Israel said it had destroyed the bridges along Lebanon 's main north - south coastal road to prevent Syria from rearming Hizbollah , which is also backed by Iran .
However , the European commission said the bombing had made it harder to deliver humanitarian relief .
" We will need guarantees for the safety of our people on the ground if we are to successfully continue the provision of aid , " Louis Michel , the European commissioner for humanitarian aid , said .
" The bombing of roads that have been previously cleared as safe for evacuation and humanitarian aid could have a major impact on the delivery of our aid . "
Christiane Berthiaume , of the UN World Food Programme , said : " This [ road ] is Lebanon 's umbilical cord .
This has been the only way for us to bring in aid . "
The bridge at Maameltein , just north of Beirut , was split down its centre .
Further north , the ruins of another bridge lay in the valley it once spanned .
" The whole road is gone , " Astrid van Genderen Stort , a senior information officer for the UNHCR refugee agency , said .
" It 's really a major setback , because we used this highway to move staff and supplies into the country . "
The World Food Programme said a convoy carrying supplies and emergency personnel to Beirut today was stuck .
Although UN trucks may be able to take secondary roads , this would slow down aid shipments .
UN teams have so far been refused permission to assess the damage caused by the bombing , Ms Berthiaume said .
Security officials and witnesses said a Lebanese soldier and four civilians were killed in separate Israeli air raids near Beirut 's airport and southern suburbs .
The UN called off planned convoys to the southern port city of Tyre after air raids on a Beirut suburb prevented drivers from reaching the assembly point .
The broadened bombing campaign came as Hizbullah guerrillas unleashed another day of rocket attacks on Israel .
Hizbullah fighters fired 45 rockets in less than a half hour , killing four Israelis , three of them Arabs .
Farm workers killed
Four Israeli missiles hit a refrigerated warehouse where farm workers were loading vegetables near the Lebanon - Syria border , killing at least 33 people and wounding 20 , local officials said .
The attack happened at a farm near the town of al - Qaa , a Hizbullah stronghold around six miles from Hermel that has been hit by Israeli air strikes at least three times .
An Israeli army spokesman said air strikes in the area had targeted two buildings that military intelligence had shown were being used by Hizbollah to store weapons .
However , television footage showed the bodies of what appeared to be farm workers near the ruins of a small structure in fruit groves .
Fruit baskets were strewn nearby .
It was the second deadliest strike in Lebanon after the air raid that killed up to 54 civilians in the village of Qana on Sunday .
At least 720 people in Lebanon and 74 Israelis have been killed in the conflict so far .
Israel has put more than 10,000 troops into Lebanon , and says it has carved out a zone containing 20 villages up to 7 km from its border .
The army has been ordered to prepare for a possible push further north .
The US and France today continued negotiations on a UN resolution aimed at securing a ceasefire backed by an international force more robust than the UN peacekeepers already in south Lebanon .
Once they reach agreement - which officials said could happen over the weekend - a UN security council vote could take place within 24 hours .
The US ambassador to the UN , John Bolton - speaking after several hours of talks with the French UN ambassador , Jean - Marc de la Sabliere - said progress had been made and a text was being sent back to Washington and Paris for review .
Washington wants an international force in southern Lebanon immediately after a truce , while France - a likely leader of the force - wants the troops to move in only after a permanent ceasefire .
Valerie Plame said her identity was ' recklessly abused '
Plame 's criticisms
The comments were her first public statements on a political scandal which rocked Washington .
She says her identity was revealed in 2003 to discredit her husband , a former diplomat , for criticising the Iraq war .
No -one has been charged over the leak , but the vice - president 's former top aide was convicted of perjury .
It was a terrible irony that administration officials were the ones who destroyed my cover
Valerie Plame
Ex-spy makes tough Bush critic
Lewis " Scooter " Libby , former chief of staff to Dick Cheney , resigned from his role as chief of staff and was convicted of perjury and obstruction in the case earlier this month .
He could face up to 25 years in prison .
A US former Deputy Secretary of State , Richard Armitage , has admitted that he first disclosed that Ms Plame was an undercover CIA agent .
Exaggerated
Former US ambassador and Ms Plame 's husband , Joseph Wilson , stated publicly that the case for war against Iraq and the threat the country posed had been exaggerated .
Soon after his comments , government sources revealed the secret identity of his wife to US media .
Ms Plame said she had always been aware that her identity might have been discovered by foreign governments but never expected her own to leak her role .
" It was a terrible irony that administration officials were the ones who destroyed my cover , " Ms Plame told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
For the past five years , Dr. Erika Dyck has been unearthing some intriguing facts related to a group of pioneering psychiatrists who worked in Saskatchewan , Canada in the '50s and '60s .
Among other things , the University of Alberta history of medicine professor has found records of the psychiatrists ' research that indicate a single dose of the hallucinogenic drug LSD , provided in a clinical , nurturing environment , can be an effective treatment for alcoholism .
Her findings are published this month in the journal Social History of Medicine .
After perceiving similarities in the experiences of people on LSD and people going through delirium tremens , the psychiatrists undertook a series of experiments .
They noted that delirium tremens , also know as DTs , often marked a " rock bottom " or turning point in the behavior of alcoholics , and they felt LSD may be able to trigger such a turnaround without engendering the painful physical effects associated with DTs .
As it turns out , they were largely correct .
" The LSD somehow gave these people experiences that psychologically took them outside of themselves and allowed them to see their own unhealthy behavior more objectively , and then determine to change it , " said Dyck , who read the researchers ' published and private papers and recently interviewed some of the patients involved in the original studies -- many of whom had not had a sip of alcohol since their single LSD experience 40 years earlier .
According to one study conducted in 1962 , 65 per cent of the alcoholics in the experiment stopped drinking for at least a year - and - a - half ( the duration of the study ) after taking one dose of LSD .
The controlled trial also concluded that less than 25 per cent of alcoholics quit drinking for the same period after receiving group therapy , and less than 12 per cent quit in response to traditional psychotherapy techniques commonly used at that time .

Published in the Quarterly Journal for Studies on Alcohol , the 1962 study was received with much skepticism .
One research group in Toronto tried to replicate the results of the study , but wanted to observe the effect of LSD on the patients in isolation , so they blindfolded or tied up the patients before giving them the drug .
Under such circumstances , the Toronto researchers determined LSD was not effective in treating alcoholism .
The Saskatchewan group argued that the drug needed to be provided in a nurturing environment to be effective .
However , the Toronto researchers held more credibility than the Saskatchewan researchers -- who were led by a controversial , British psychiatrist , Dr. Humphry Osmond -- and the Saskatchewan group 's research was essentially buried .
But Dyck believes there is value in the Saskatchewan group 's experiments .
" The LSD experience appeared to allow the patients to go through a spiritual journey that ultimately empowered them to heal themselves , and that 's really quite an amazing therapy regimen , " Dyck said .
" Even interviewing the patients 40 years after their experience , I was surprised at how loyal they were to the doctors who treated them , and how powerful they said the experience was for them -- some even felt the experience saved their lives . "
In spite of the promise LSD showed as psychotherapy tool , its subsequent popularity as a street drug , and the perception of it as a threat to public safety , triggered a worldwide ban in the late 1960s -- including its use in medical experiments .
However , the ban on its use in medical experiments appears to be lifting , Dyck noted .
A few groups of researchers in the U.S. , including a team at Harvard , have recently been granted permission to conduct experiments with LSD .
" We accept all sorts of drugs , but I think LSD 's ' street ' popularity ultimately led to its demise , " Dyck said .
" And that 's too bad , because I think the researchers in Saskatchewan , among others , showed the drug is unique and has some intriguing properties that need to be explored further . "

Author , musician and former Texas gubernatorial candidate Kinky Friedman has been friends with Don Imus since 1975 , when they met on stage at The Bottom Line .
I MET Imus on the gangplank of Noah ’s Ark .
He was then and remains today a truth - seeking missile with the best bull - meter in the business .
Far from being a bully , he was a spiritual chop - buster never afraid to go after the big guys with nothing but the slingshot of ragged integrity .
I watched him over the years as he struggled with his demons and conquered them .
This was not surprising to me .
Imus came from the Great Southwest , where the men are men and the emus are nervous .
And he did it all with something that seems , indeed , to be a rather scarce commodity these days .
A sense of humor .
There ’s no excusing Imus ’ recent ridiculous remark , but there ’s something not kosher in America when one guy gets a Grammy and one gets fired for the same line .
The Matt Lauers and Al Rokers of this world live by the cue - card and die by the cue - card ; Imus is a rare bird , indeed – he works without a net .
When you work without a net as long as Imus has , sometimes you make mistakes .
Wavy Gravy says he salutes mistakes .
They ’re what makes us human , he claims .
And humanity beyond doubt , is what appears to be missing from this equation .
If we ’ve lost the ability to laugh at ourselves , to laugh at each other , to laugh together , then the PC world has succeeded in diminishing us all .
Political correctness , a term first used by Joseph Stalin , has trivialized , sanitized and homogenized America , transforming us into a nation of chain establishments and chain people .
Take heart , Imus .
You ’re merely joining a long and legendary laundry list of individuals who were summarily sacrificed in the name of society ’s sanctimonious soul : Socrates , Jesus , Galileo , Joan of Arc , Mozart and Mark Twain , who was decried as a racist until the day he died for using the N - word rather prolifically in “ Huckleberry Finn . ”
Speaking of which , there will always be plenty of Al Sharptons and Jesse Jacksons around .
There will be plenty of cowardly executives , plenty of fair - weather friends , and plenty of Jehovah ’s Bystanders , people who believe in God but just do n’t want to get involved .
In this crowd , it could be argued that we need a Don Imus just to wake us up once in a while .
There probably is n’t a single one of Imus ’ vocal critics who come anywhere close to matching his record of philanthropy or good acts on this earth .
Judge a man by the size of his enemies , my father used to say .
A man who , year after year , has raised countless millions of dollars and has fought hand - to - hand to combat against childhood cancer , autism , and SIDS – well , you ’ve got a rodeo clown who not only rescues the cowboy , but saves the children as well .
I believe New York will miss its crazy cowboy and America will miss the voice of a free - thinking independent - minded , rugged individualist .
I believe MSNBC will lose many viewers and CBS radio many listeners .
Too bad for them .
That ’s what happens when you get rid of the only guy you ’ve got who knows how to ride , shoot straight and tell the truth .
Did James Cameron find Jesus ?
It makes a great story for a TV film .
But it 's completely impossible .
It 's nonsense .
There is no likelihood that Jesus and his relatives had a family tomb .
They were a Galilee family with no ties in Jerusalem .
The Talpiot tomb belonged to a middle class family from the 1st century CE .~
Amos Kloner †
~ Jodi Magness †
Jesus ' family , being poor , presumably could not afford a rock - cut tomb , as even the more " modest " ones were costly .
And had Jesus ' family owned a rock - cut tomb , it would have been located in their hometown of Nazareth , not in Jerusalem .
For example , when Simon , the last of the Maccabean brothers and one of the Hasmonean rulers , built a large tomb or mausoleum for his family , he constructed it in their hometown of Modiin .
In fact , the Gospel accounts clearly indicate that Jesus ' family did not own a rock - cut tomb in Jerusalem -- for if they had , there would have been no need for Joseph of Arimathea to take Jesus ' body and place it in his own family 's rock - cut tomb !
If Jesus ' family did not own a rock - cut tomb , it means they also had no ossuaries ~ Jodi Magness †
L. Y. Rahmani , an Israeli archaeologist who compiled a catalogue of all of the ossuaries in the collections of the state of Israel , observed that " In Jerusalem 's tombs , the deceased 's place of origin was noted when someone from outside Jerusalem was interred in a local tomb . "
On ossuaries in rock - cut tombs that belonged to Judean families , it was customary to indicate the ancestry or lineage of the deceased by naming the father , as , for example , Judah son of John ( Yohanan ) ; Honya son of Alexa ; and Martha daughter of Hananya .
But in rock - cut tombs owned by non-Judean families ( or which contained the remains of relatives from outside Judea ) , it was customary to indicate the deceased 's place of origin , as , for example , Simon of Ptolemais ; Papias the Bethshanite ( of Beth Shean ) ; and Gaios son of Artemon from Berenike .
Our historical and literary sources ( such as the Gospels , Flavius Josephus , among others ) often make the same distinctions between Judeans and non-Judeans ( for example , Galileans , Idumaeans , Saul of Tarsus , Simon of Cyrene , and so on ) .
If the Talpiyot tomb is indeed the tomb of Jesus and his family , we would expect at least some of the ossuary inscriptions to reflect their Galilean origins , by reading , for example , Jesus [ son of Joseph ] of Nazareth ( or Jesus the Nazarene ) , Mary of Magdala , and so on .
However , the inscriptions provide no indication that this is the tomb of a Galilean family and instead point to a Judean family
What in the world is the " Jesus Family " doing , having a burial plot in Jerusalem , of all places , the very city that crucified Jesus ?
Galilee was their home .
In Galilee they could have had such a family plot , not Judea .
Besides all of which , church tradition -- and Eusebius -- are unanimous in reporting that Mary died in Ephesus .
Paul Maier †
How come there is no tradition whatever -- Christian , Jewish , or secular -- that any part of the Holy Family was buried at Jerusalem ?
Paul Maier †
Carney Matheson
The only conclusions we made was that these two sets [ DNA for Jesus and Mariamne ] were not maternally related .
To me it sounds like absolutely nothing . †
How come there is no tradition whatever -- Christian , Jewish , or secular -- that any part of the Holy Family was buried at Jerusalem ?

The versions of computations appearing in the media are only simplifications .
Furthermore , the results of any such computations depend heavily on the assumptions that go into it ...
It is not in the purview of statistics to conclude whether or not this tombsite is that of the New Testament family .
Any such conclusion much more rightfully belongs to the purview of biblical historical scholars who are in a much better position to assess the assumptions entering into the computations .
The role of statistics here is primarily to attempt to assess the odds of an equally ( or more ) `compelling ' cluster of names arising purely by chance under certain random sampling assumptions and under certain historical assumptions .
In this respect I now believe that I should not assert any conclusions connecting this tomb with any hypothetical one of the NT family
Interaction - Safe State for the Web
Jay McCarthy , Shriram Krishnamurthi
Scheme and Functional Programming , 2006
Abstract
Recent research has demonstrated that continuations provide a clean basis to describe interactive Web programs .
This account , however , provides only a limited description of state , which is essential to Web applications .
This state is affected by the numerous control operators ( known as navigation buttons ) in Web browsers , which make Web applications behave in unexpected and even erroneous ways .
We describe these subtleties as discovered in the context of working Web applications .
Based on this analysis we present linguistic extensions that accurately capture state in the context of the Web , presenting a novel form of dynamic scope .
We support this investigation with a formal semantics and a discussion of applications .
The results of this paper have already been successfully applied to working applications .

Students who are told they can get smarter if they train their brains to be stronger , like a muscle , do better in school , a new psychology study shows .
Many people have various theories about the nature of intelligence .
Some view it as a fixed trait , while others see intelligence as a quality that can develop and expand .
These ideas have can have a profound effect on the motivation to learn , said researcher Carol Dweck , a child and social psychologist at Stanford University .
" Those who follow a fixed theory are concerned with whether they look smart or dumb .
They do n't enjoy tasks that are difficult , where if they have a setback they can look dumb , " Dweck explained .
" Those who think intelligence is something you can cultivate are much more interested in being challenged than in just looking smart .
They are much more resilient and persistent , and not as worried about making mistakes . "
Mysteries of the Mind
Dweck had an experience in 6th grade in Brooklyn that made her want to understand with views people held on intelligence .
" My teacher seated us around the room in IQ order , " she told LiveScience .
" All the responsibilities were assigned to high - IQ students .
Looking back , I always enjoyed learning before , but the experience in that class was n't about learning , it was about feeling like you had to always look smart or get demoted to one of the lesser seats . "
" Working in that fixed framework had a profound influence on me , " Dweck said .
" It was one where intelligence was equated with worth . "
To see what effects different theories of intelligence had on schoolwork , Dweck and her colleagues followed 373 New York City 12 - year - olds over a course of two years of junior high school .
While all the students began the study with roughly the same math achievement test scores , those with a fixed mindset did worse in math , with the gap widening over the years .
" When you have a fixed view , you kind of run away from mistakes and setbacks , since you think they mean you 're not smart , " Dweck said .
" The fixed view does n't give students a good way to repair their deficiencies .
If you believe your ability is permanently fixed , and you do n't do well , there 's no good route to come back from that . "
Video : Brain - Healing Bridges
The researchers then took junior high school students who did poorly in math and divided them into two groups .
Both were introduced to workshops that built study skills , but one experimental group also went through an eight - week program that described the brain as like a muscle , " and the more it was used , the stronger it got , " Dweck said .
" We taught them that the brain forms new connections every time they applied themselves and learned , " she explained .
" It gave them a new model of how their minds worked , and how they had control of their brains and could make it work better .
The idea is to free them from the tyranny of fear of looking dumb .
The name of the game is learning . "
The experimental group showed a significant rebound in math grades , the researchers report in the latest issue of the journal Child Development .
" There was one particular boy who we could n't get to sit still , yet when he started hearing about the brain and how you can make neurons grow , we thought we saw tears in his eyes .
He looked up at us and said , ' You mean I do n't have to be dumb ? ' "
Dweck recalled .
" From that day forward he applied himself to schoolwork , " she said .
" He was one of the first students the teachers mentioned as never doing homework before , but who now brought it in early to get it checked over .
He was studying for tests and moving his grades from Cs and Ds to B + . "
Dweck and her colleagues have developed a computer - based version of their workshop they have now tried out in 20 New York City schools .
" We still have to upgrade the technology and revise it based on feedback from students , but it was really a great success , " Dweck said .
" We 're really excited about making this more available . "

At work we have a very large codebase , in the millions of lines of code .
Nobody understands all the code , and half the people who wrote it are n’t at the company anymore .
So a lot of my time is spent experimentally – tracing through code to figure out how it works , or making small changes to fix unforeseen bugs .
The problem is this requires a lot of recompiling small changes .
Unfortunately , the code is designed in such a way that sometimes small changes result in the recompilation of hundreds of files .
I spend half my day not programming , nor thinking , but waiting for the compiler .
This is by an order of magnitude the biggest hindrance towards my accomplishing anything meaningful .
A single line of code change can take 15 minutes when you consider the time to build , the time to link , the time to regain my lost attention , and the time to do it all again for my second instance of Visual Studio ( for network programming ) .
Fortunately , I ’ve learned a few things as the author of RakNet that can help with compile and link times .
While they may be obvious to experienced programmers , even experienced programmers do n’t consistently follow them so they are worth reviewing .
1 . It ’s bad to include header files in your cpp files .
It ’s exponentially bad to include header files in other header files
.cpp files increase the time to compile your project linearly .
For example , if my cpp file includes “ blah.h ” then every time “ blah.h ” changes , then I have to recompile all cpp files that include that .
That ’s bad – but still far better than header files , which increase your total compile time exponentially .
If files C.h and D.h include B.h , and B.h includes A.h , then anytime A.h changes we have to compile 4 header files – A.h , B.h , C.h , and D.h .
But it ’s not just 4 header files – we are now also rebuilding any cpp file that includes any of those header files .
2. Avoid , as much as possible , putting code in header files
Code is likely to change .
Class definitions are much less likely to change .
Furthermore , code in a cpp file is only included in that one place – that cpp .
Code in a header file is included everywhere that header file is included .
If you put code in a header file , that means that you are likely to change that header file and you are including the same code all over your program meaning it gets recompiled every time .
3. Split up your header into independent classes / structs / enums as much as possible .
It ’s a hassle to add header files to a project .
Oftentimes , when two kinds of interfaces , such as an enumeration and a structure , are both used with a class , it ’s tempting to put both in the same header file .
Supermarket.h
enum Fruits { APPLE , ORANGE , GRAPE} ;
class Supermarket { Fruits GetType ( Fruit * fruit ) ;} ;
There are two problems with this .
First , enumerations are likely to change .
If we later add POMEGRANATE then every class that includes this needs to be recompiled .
Secondly , every class that cares about Fruits now has to also include Supermarket , and vice - versa , resulting in unnecessary compiles .
4 . If your class has complex types in the header , or is included by many other files , think about exposing an interface for that class .
Interfaces can be a hassle since you now have to maintain two copies of your class definition , rather than one .
However , in some cases they can vastly cut down on compile times .
Consider the following :
Database.h
#include " ComplexTemplatedList . h "
class Database
{
Rec* GetRecord ( ) ;
ComplexTemplatedList recordsList ;
} ;
DatabaseInterface.h
class Database
{
virtual Rec* GetRecord ( ) =0 ;
} ;
In the second version , we got rid of all the implementation code yet every class that needs Database can still use it and now compile almost instantly .
Here ’s another example :
class Logger
{
public :
void WriteLog( char *) ;
private :
char * logList ;
int numLogs ;
}
The logger will probably be included in a lot of places .
If we were to add a field
int * logTimes ;
then , even though the log times have nothing to do with the users of the log class , all those users will have to be recompiled .
By using an interface , none of the member variables would be exposed , so adding or deleting member variables wo n’t cause recompiles of files that include this header .
5 . Inside header files , include pointers to other classes rather than the classes themselves
CompileSlow.h
#include " CompositeClass . h "
class MyClass
{
CompositeClass a ;
}
CompileFast.h
class CompositeClass ;
class MyClass
{
CompositeClass *a ;
}
Sorry if my last point is obvious , but it ’s the easiest to do so is worth pointing out .
In conclusion , a few minutes of trouble today can save hours over the life of the project , not just for you but every other programmer that has to do builds .

First , Mississippi regulated flood insurance rates down to a level that it was impossible to make money , so State Farm 's property coverage on the coast did not cover flood / storm damage .
Then , after Katrina , Dickie Scruggs and company sued State Farm , and others , forcing them to cover storm damage from Katrina that their policies explicitly did not cover and were not priced to cover .
So , facing a state government that , by fiat , forces their fees lower and their coverage higher , State Farm is trying to exit the property insurance business in Mississippi , and the state legislature is considering legislation to prevent them from leaving .
Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood said Friday he will seek
legislation aimed at blocking State Farm Insurance Cos. from refusing
to write new homeowners and commercial policies in the
hurricane - battered state .
Hood 's plan would require any company
that writes automobile insurance in Mississippi and also writes
homeowners policies in other states to offer homeowners and commercial
properties throughout Mississippi ....
Hood also said he his urging Gov. Haley Barbour to issue an executive
order that would force the insurer to continue writing new policies
until the Mississippi Legislature can deal with the issue .
Quoting from directive 10 - 289 ( Atlas Shrugged ) :
Point Two :
All industrial , commercial , manufacturing , and business
establishments of any nature whatsoever shall henceforth remain in
operation , and the owners of such establishments shall not quit , nor
leave , nor retire , nor close , sell or transfer their business , under
penalty of the nationalization of their establishment and of any or all
their property .
So I ask you , is the following statement ridiculous over - the - top regulator - speak from Atlas Shrugged , or was it actually made by a US state AG ?
" We 're looking at a robber baron in the face that is trying to make an example of Mississippi , " Hood said of State Farm .
OK , so lets see :
The state government decides what rates you can charge .
The state government decides what your policy has to cover .
The state government decides if you will be allowed to go out of business .
But State Farm is the robber baron .
LOL .

Capistrano ( formerly switchtower ) is the ‘ ruby on rails ’ way to deploy your code out onto your fleet of production / test servers .
I ’ve previously written my own ‘ deploy ’ script which had similar goals to capistrano , but I ’ve only recently tried capistrano itself .
Having now used it , I think it makes a poor design decision .
Capistrano runs a “ svn co ” operation on the deploy host itself .
I think it ’d be much better to grab a clean set of sources on your local development box , and then rsync / scp that to each deploy host .
The capistrano way is poor for the following reasons .
Firstly , since I access my svn respository over ssh I need to have my private key on my deploy host .
This is non-optimal for security reasons .
I want to keep close tabs on my private keys , and I do n’t want it living on a ( potentially ) compromisable public - facing host .
Why not do all the svn stuff locally and keep your private key local ?
But it gets worse .
Your deployed rails app ends up ( by default ) being a ‘ live ’ checked out copy , complete with .svn directories .
Additionally , the default rails setup unfortunately exposes the very top level .svn directory in your deployment .
This leaks some information : nothing critical , but in security terms any leakage is bad .
To find examples , look no further than the list of apps on the RoR site .
Examples include 37signals [ fixed ] and penny arcade and strongspace and iconbuffer [ fixed ] etc .
Like I say , the information leaked in this way is not too critical .
But , if you were into social engineering , knowing the hostname of their internal svn server in addition to login names for several developers could be just the info you need .
What ’s the moral to this story ?
It ’s the old lesson of minimal privileges .
There ’s no real need for the deployment hosts to have ssh access to the svn repository .
Nor is there any need to have your deployment version be a ‘ live ’ checked out version of your source code .
I think I will be sticking to a deployment method where I check out locally and rsync to the production hosts …
Update :
This method also reveals the contents of some .htaccess files … append .svn/text-base/.htaccess.svn-base to your favourite rails app URL .
In a previous article I asked some very tough questions about the Second Life virtual economy .
That article provocatively proposed a case as to why I believe Second Life 's much hyped economy resembles a pyramid Ponzi , or more accurately a type of high yield investment program ( HYIP ) scheme .
After posting that article I was partially convinced by many respondents that Second Life probably is not a Ponzi scheme as a precise legal definition -- at least probably not in most jurisdictions .
Indeed , after learning more about HYIPs , and in particular HYIP Games , Second Life and the game 's system of " virtual currency " satisfy many of the attributes of such schemes .
More about HYIPs later .
First , some background :
Brief Background
I covered the background of Second Life in some detail in my previous article .
Second Life is a type of online computer game often referred to as a Virtual World .
Virtual Worlds , while marketed as computer games and produced by computer game developers , are thought by many to represent the natural evolution of the web .
In fact , there are probably myriad noble and interesting applications of Virtual Worlds to things like education and community collaboration .
What I am concerned about here is only the virtual economy or virtual marketplace aspect of Second Life .
It is the claims of real gold in the Second Life virtual hills that has caused most of the recent media hype around the game .
The makers of Second Life , Linden Research ( privately held ; San Francisco ; funded by Benchmark Capital et. al. , " Linden Labs " , " LL " ) themselves actively encourage this view of Second Life , judging from self - promoting links on Linden 's own official Second Life website :
Second Life :
It 's not a game Fortune 's David Kirkpatrick reports on why IBM's Sam Palmisano and other tech leaders think Second Life could be a gold mine .

Starting a Second Life Business
Find out what entrepreneurial opportunities the virtual world of Second Life has to offer .
Where There 's Smoke ...
In that now infamous article I concluded that Second Life 's supposed economy was n't a whole lot more than a typical pyramid scheme , where most of the money paid in by new recruits ends up realized by the organizers and a handful of early entrants .
I was promptly assured by any number of the Second Life faithful that I was wrong , and that there were literally thousands upon thousands of real , financially valuable businesses making money , providing jobs , growing at astonishing rates , and redeeming their virtual Linden dollars ( L$ ) for real money .
I challenged the Second Life community to offer forth a typical , average business for quantitative financial analysis .
In fairness , a handful of apparently honest folks came forward with offers to participate ; even one of the most well known of the " virtual oligarchs " ( one of those in the handful of players at the top of the virtual economy ) signaled some interest in the project .
Things took a hard turn when I was forced to cancel that project along with most of my Second Life public discussions and debates .
Perhaps I can discuss the particulars later , but suffices for now to say that many in the Second Life community have zero tolerance for critics and criticism .
Nonetheless , I did become more curious after the severe anti reaction I received .
Especially so when even seemingly objective researchers and academics took a see - no - evil attitude , dismissing my analyses without serious treatment .
Even though I played the game myself on and off for more than two years , up until the middle of last year , I was still surprised .
The economic part of the game was always there , but never as a source of practically religious devotion .
What the hell is going on in Second Life ?
Redeemable Virtual Tokens
The L$ is often referred to as a virtual currency .
In fact , it is not a currency at all .
It is a micropayment token system .
I have been around micropayment systems for many years in their application to mobile phone carriers .
The Economist ( Feb. 17 , 2007 ) features a cover story that includes discussions about micropayments vis -à - vis digital cash .
Most justifications for why Linden Research had to create the L$ center around micropayment issues .
In reality , telecoms , Apple iTunes , Microsoft , and others have proven that floating an independent currency is not requisite to enabling a functional micropayment system .
I myself am partial to the iTunes batch - billing approach , keeping payments denominated in real currencies .
Even the more prepaid - credit approaches taken by Microsoft in the Xbox Live Marketplace avoid the complications of currency management introduced by independent , pseudo currencies like the L$ .
Regardless of the reasons , the fact remains that the Linden dollar is objectively not a currency .
In Linden 's Terms of Service agreement , sections 3.3 and 5.3 , Linden clearly states that players have no financial or legal claim to their L$ , and that L$ are a consumable entertainment product which can be revoked or deleted at any time , without reason .
Not quite up the standard of a fiat currency .
But Linden Research does promote , market , and manage the L$ as if it were a legitimate , independent fiat currency .
They operate an official " virtual currency exchange " , the LindeX , on which players can either buy L$ with real money or redeem L$ for real money deposits to their PayPal or bank accounts .
And the redemption rate , or as they call it " exchange rate " implying the Forex equivalent of that term , is floating .
The Wiki on the Linden dollar asserts ( emphasis added ) :
Residents may purchase L$ directly through the client , or convert between Linden currency and U.S. currency through either Linden Lab 's currency brokerage , the LindeX Currency Exchange , or other third - party currency exchanges .
The ratio of USD to L$ fluctuates daily as Residents set the buy and sell price of L$ offered on the exchange , and fluctuated between L$ 240 / USD and L$350 / USD between October 2005 and September 2006 .
Virtual Interventionists
There are all kinds of macroeconomic tangents I could take at this point .
Without straying too far , we can safely say that Linden Research has taken on the role as " virtual central banker " , and " virtual treasury " , in minting and distributing their own " virtual currency " .
( The Second Life economy is built upon a system of " sources and sinks " which , while sometimes cited as a monetary control lever , really more represent the virtual economy 's fiscal policy . )
The exchange rate is not freely set by supply and demand ; it is not a floating exchange rate .
In recent months , Linden Research has sold relatively large amounts of L$ themselves on their own LindeX market .
Clearly a form of seigniorage ( selling newly minted currency for net revenues ) , Linden claims they do this in order to manage L$ / $ USD volatility .
In other words , they want to keep the redemption rate stable , right around the L$ 250 - L$ 300 per $ 1USD range .
Currency intervention .
More economically astute readers will immediately recognize the conceptual and logical hazards and complications this implies .
Managing exchange rates of currencies is something which is extremely difficult , and terribly expensive to do over any period of time .
The lack of theoretical limits to how weak or strong various interests wish for a virtual currency to become only further complicates an interventionist strategy .
So , Linden Research is selling L$ which they print themselves .
Players buy the L$ with real money , but they do n't really own the L$ they bought .
And , Linden Research uses the LindeX pseudo - Forex exchange market in order to stabilize the redemption rate of these virtual L$ tokens .
So , will Linden be so willing to buy back L$ when demand falters ?
Growth , Growth , Growth
Linden has boasted unbelievable growth numbers , even proudly displaying them on their Second Life home page .
In fact , Clay Shirky did n't believe the numbers , and challenged them in myriad forums ( earning him fierce sometimes slanderous attacks from the Second Life faithful ) .
Eventually , Linden acquiesced ( " Overcounts " , Shirky ) and provided more thoughtful statistics which showed that Second Life , while indeed growing rapidly as measured by first - time - visitors ( account creations ) , in fact has only about 200,000 active users ( those investing more than a week of time into the game ) .
From my perspective , these overcounts and growth exaggerations further aggravate my initial HYIP claims .
Simply , Linden Research cannot count on perpetual growth , given their own reported statistics , to support the L$ / $ USD redemption rate .
They will have to start buying back a lot of L$ in the near future .
Or , more likely , the L$ will just devalue rapidly , leaving everyone with money left in the game S.O.L .
Not Just Words
I love narratives as much as any other blogger .
But , the proof is in the numbers .
I 've taken the liberty to put Linden Research 's own data through my analysis grinder , and I offer my results .
I created all these analyses from Linden Research provided data , using Microsoft Excel , Crystal Ball , SAS and my hp 49 g+.
Click the graphs to see the full size versions .
Conclusion : The L$ to $ USD redemption rate depends upon unrealistic growth assumptions .
The growth ( charted in the previous section ) depends upon the assumption of an exponential growth curve ( yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.70 ) .
Inspecting the actual forecast values clearly demonstrates the flaw in this assumption .
Supporting the current regime in which Linden Research is always a net seller of L$ in order to support ( i.e. weaken ) the L$ compared to the $ USD , Second Life must register around 45 million unique players by the end of 2008 ; a growth rate of 40 % per month by that point .
( Using an exponential growth formula , with conservative initial conditions .
This matches historical growth with R - Squared = 0.70 ) .
Note , this is a ceteris paribus analysis .
Linden Research could , and most certainly would attempt to use " virtual fiscal levers " with its series of controlled sources and sinks to strengthen the L$ in the face of diminishing growth .
I maintain , however , that these efforts will probably succeed only for very short durations and , like taxation in real world economies , ultimately produce far worse unintended negative outcomes .
For example , attempting to support L$ strength by forcing in - game deflation would almost certainly result in a serious " virtual recession " by depressing the game 's " virtual commerce " .
Growth is too volatile to count on going forward .
Absolute player growth , as measured by unique players and by registrations , produce equally volatile growth curves .
At best , real growth trends experienced within Second Life are sporadic and barely predictable .
In this example , a 2nd order polynomial fit function still only produces 50 % predictability .
Such growth is consistent with the type of media - induced hype that has caused a recent influx of new Second Life users , but which may be a short lived effect .
Growth of hours per player ( unique ) is even more volatile , and does not yield reliable regression predictions .
Summary statistics from Linden Research provided data for Unique Players , Registrations and User Hours , for reference :
Hours per total unique player is weakening even while hours per new player is beholden to spikes in media hype .
Take note of the consistent decline in hours per total unique player , barely breaking even from mid 2005 until only last month ( January 2007 ) in an amazing reversal .
Historical trends predict future months will return to hours per unique player declines .
Hours as measured by allocation only to incremental new players produces more stable results .
Media cycles are more readily visible in this view also , as are periods of system downtime .
Summary statistics , for reference :
Most troubling , L$ Spend per Unique Player is weakening .
This again returns to the conclusion :
This chart shows the rapidly declining L$ purchased per new player as total unique players has grown exponentially .
L$ purchased per all unique players has also declined , although less rapidly , implying that most economic activity is supported by existing players , with growth in total L$ spending coming purely from new players trying the game , then abandoning it shortly thereafter .
One other bit to consider in the context of the above graph is the trend towards seigniorage .
Unlike economies in the real world , the Second Life economy is strictly zero-sum .
Therefore , every real $ 1 USD extracted from the game comes from someone who put a $ 1 USD in , whether directly from new users buying L$ , or indirectly through internal " sinks " , which amount to little more than the redistribution of players ' future $ USD redemption potentials .
High Yield Investment Programs
After reading and viewing the data and charts in this article , make up your own mind about similarities between the Second Life L$ based economy and a HYIP game .
The following are attributes of HYIP schemes and games .
It is theoretically possible for a HYIP to be legitimate , and not a pyramid Ponzi scheme .
To date , however , all HYIPs have turned out to be Ponzi schemes .
HYIPs are normally offered over the internet .
Entry costs ( initial deposits ) are very low , often less than $ 10USD .
HYIPs usually utilize e-currencies or virtual currencies , making it possible to accept very small investments and easily cross jurisdictions and other boundaries .
HYIP virtual currencies usually introduce psychological " breakage " by being denominated in sub-penny units , making inbound investments , internal activity and unrealized gains feel larger to participants .
HYIP participants strongly encourage and self - enforce thinking of internal activity only in virtual units , not in $ USD translated value .
HYIPs disclose little about internal strategy , management , or operations .
They often publish financial data , sometimes large amounts of detailed financial data , but they almost always refuse to do so in a meaningful , methodological manner which can be verified .
HYIPs usually present emotional appeals , appeals to faith , promises of financial freedom , or promises of a new economic reality with active members best positioned to benefit financially .
HYIPs often claim returns of greater than 1 % per day [ that is an order of magnitude per year .
Some Second Life banks offer 1 % per day interest , incidentally ; Many Second Life " businesses " boast 50 % per month revenue growth ] .
Three types of people typically enter HYIPs : Naive , unwary , and ignorant .
These are most HYIP recruits .
They are usually recruited or referred .
They are attracted to the HYIP as a source of income , often one which they are desperate to have .
Once the HYIP fails , this group is often considered to be undeserving victims .
Gamblers .
A smaller group are those who know the HYIP is inherently unstable .
Some even see it as a Ponzi scam from the start .
But , they calculate that they are early enough or can outsmart the game and earn returns nonetheless .
Cheerleaders and shills .
Some in this group are the organizers or first entrants .
Others are those who 've realized small profits from the game , and seek to grow the game in order to push themselves up in the pyramid structure , thereby amplifying their returns .
Most HYIPs are positioned as low or no risk opportunities , being that little money is needed to start , and time invested is not considered a cost .
HYIPs are zero -sum games by definition .
All realizable returns come from real money investments .
Forum , blog , and email list users will gain trusted reputations , ensuring others they have indeed been able to withdraw real profits .
They will quickly surround , counter and drown out any criticisms to the contrary .
These games are not defensible as lotteries ( although some have used this legal defense ) because the odds of winning returns cannot be calculated ex ante .
Public forms which endeavor to monitor HYIP games and warn unwary investors are nearly always overrun by cheerleaders and shills .
The mainstream media often mistake HYIPs as legitimate , lacking understanding of internet communications ( and thereby ascribing credibility to testimonials by cheerleaders and shills ) .
It is often argued that the Second Life virtual economy does not qualify as a HYIP type of structure because the nature of internal commercial activity largely involves productive endeavors .
By productive endeavors they are generally referring to virtual item design and creation .
At a detailed level , these are largely graphics design , 3 - D computer modeling , computer art , and script programming activities .
I maintain this is false .
While lower - level players may earn some returns , by and large their investments into the game ( both capital and labor ) are trapped and not monetizable at fair market redemption rates .
Two detailed responses to the productive endeavors objection :
It is unclear how much of a percentage of the virtual economy is driven by these " productive endeavors " versus the online gambling , sex and real - estate markets .
The first two are clearly not productive endeavors and likely constitute a significant portion of the internal L$ economy .
The latter is by definition not creating financial value because players have no financial claim on their virtual property -- they have no effective virtual property rights under current US and California laws .
Further , there exist no supply or production function restrictions which would enable long - term price stability of virtual real estate .
Over time virtual real estate will be worth only its marginal cost to provide as a product ( disk space , electricity , router depreciation , etc. ) .
Productive activities produce real returns for players only insofar as they are able to redeem L$ cash flows for real money -- players have no financial claims on anything which resides on Linden Research 's servers or network , including Linden dollars ( only on limited forms of conceptual intellectual property ) .
The continual weakening of the L$ by Linden Research is a mechanism by which potentially realizable financial gains instead accrue to the game 's organizers , and to others with a similar ability to run their own L$ - $ USD redemption exchanges .
Therefore , these players , even while feeling they are engaging in productive endeavors with positive financial returns , more serve to enrich those at the top of the game while also acting as testimonials to attract new game entrants .
Cult Second Life
I learned a valuable lesson my first go around with the Second Life faithful .
Second Life is not a game to many involved .
It 's more of a cult .
I attempted to honestly engage all of my critics .
Unfortunately , I learned that such is a wasted effort when dealing with the blind faith that afflicts Second Life True Believers .
In the end , it 's not all that much different from trying to talk rationally with someone about Amway , Herbalife or Robert Kiyosaki .
OK , one thing really annoyed me .
A few supposedly prominent Second Life blog authors dismissed my first article because I was anonymous .
In fact , I was not and never have been .
But they , like pretty much everyone else in the Second Life universe , were .
[ Shouted Elaine Benes style through a hand megaphone ] " You 're Anonymous ! "
And a Disappointment ...
I was particularly disappointed by some in the academic community , as a response to my original article .
I understand and appreciate the intense interest among academics in Second Life .
Indeed , many are interested in aspects of sociological , communications , pedagogical , and cultural phenomena related to the Second Life Virtual World .
I cannot speak to these topics with any knowledge or authority .
However , I am baffled by the response from some " virtual worlds economics " authorities .
One response in particular dismissed my first article as " so obviously wrong it was hardly worth discussing " .
Further , it went on to claim that harsh criticisms such as mine threatened to destroy the very future of Virtual Worlds .
And , finally , we were told that Second Life is really a lot like fictional " Mayberry " , and not the brutal world of markets and numbers I suggested .
That response stretches the credibility of its author .
If one guy can knock over Second Life or the future of Virtual Worlds in general , then they are hardly deserving of our attention .
And , Second Life is " so obviously not Mayberry " , on so many levels , that " it 's hardly worth discussing " .
I cannot help but wonder what vested interest one has in Second Life in order to resort to wholesomely painting it as the black & white home of Any Griffith .
Just a few obvious shots ( the Second Life echo machine 's endless repeating of the Mayberry analogy set these up for me , even if they are easy targets ) :
Mayberry never printed their own money .
No one spent Barney Bucks at Walker 's Drug Store .
If Mayberry started printing Barney Bucks ,
Andy would have arrested them for counterfeiting .
There were n't all too many prostitutes and call girls hanging out at the Mayberry Hotel .
Myer 's
Lake was not a big casino where people sat around playing rigged Tringo games and got paid to sit in chairs pulling rigged slot machines .
Explicit interspecies sexual role playing was n't seen as mainstream behavior , not to mention ageplay .
Tax evasion , money laundering , gambling , sex trade ?
No , all Mayberry had was a tad bit of moonshining from time to time .
Eventually Wal - mart would have put Weaver 's Department Store out of business , despite the protestations of any authoritarian artisan community or overtly anti-capitalist Bourgeoisie .

Disclaimers
For more than seven years , Dutchman Derk - Jan Eppink worked behind the scenes of the European Commission in Brussels .
As a cabinet member of commissioners Frits Bolkestein and Siim Kallas , he saw how what he called " the European mandarins " exercised their power .
With the journalistic experience he had gained earlier at newspapers like the Dutch NRC Handelsblad and the Belgian De Standaard , Eppink wrote a book about the EU power culture .
Last Wednesday , he and his former boss Frits Bolkestein presented the book at the Centre for European Policy Studies .
The Brussels Journal was there and recorded some remarkable comments from both men .
INTRIGUE , TRICKERY AND DECEIT
Eppink tells how he discovered that the essential thing for a European official is to learn the procedures .
" Because once you know how the procedures work , you can start to manipulate the process .
I arrived in 1984 as a Calvinist , I 'm leaving in 2007 as a Jesuit " , Eppink said , referring to the differences between the principle - driven approach of the protestant Dutch and the devious conspiracies which are sometimes attributed to the catholic order of the Jesuits .
" I have learned all the necessary survival techniques to be a mandarin : intrigue , trickery and deceit .
Many politicians in the Netherlands adhere to the view that intrigue is a very bad thing .
But in fact , it works very well .
Let me give you one example .
My commissioner Frits Bolkestein had very strong views on immigration .
He never went along with the line of the Commission to turn the European Union into an " immigration union " .
But at a meeting in 2001 , it seemed that Bolkestein had agreed to a decision without knowing what he had agreed to .
Only after the meeting , he found out what the decision meant , because it was on the front page of the Financial Times : " European Union = immigration union " .
Of course , he wanted to get rid of this decision .
He asked : what can I do now ?
It is now the official line of the commission to open up Europe to full immigration from Northern Africa and the Middle East .
I said : the only thing we can do is to start an intrigue !
We will have to ask Ministers of Justice in the member countries to try to undermine the proposal of the Commission .
And that is exactly what we did .
Without informing the Commission - because when you start an intrigue , you should not leave any traces - we made appointments with Ministers of Justice in the member countries .
At that time , Belgium was the president of the European Council .
So Bolkestein and I made an appointment with the Belgian minister of Justice , Marc Verwilghen , a very nice man .
We met and we had a good lunch with lots of champagne .
We agreed that the European proposal was totally unrealistic .
I asked Verwilghen to try to get it off the agenda of the Commission and to bury it somewhere in his office , never to be seen again .
And that is exactly what happened .
A few weeks later , 9/11 happened , and public opinion and politicians got a completely different view on immigration .
This attempt of an intrigue , I have to admit , worked very well .
That is how the European Commission works : there are procedures , but luckily there are also ways around the procedures . "
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE USSR AND THE EU
Karel Lannoo from the Centre for European Policy Studies asked Eppink if he saw some similarities between the EU and the late USSR .
Eppink made a comparison between the two in the field of rhetoric , in mechanisms and in the way power is used .
The Soviet Union wanted to harmonize as much as possible within a single political framework .
This is also the mission of the European Union .
The Soviet Union was administered by a political elite .
So is the European Union .
The Soviet Union saw itself as a utopian state .
The European federalists have much the same views .
The Soviet Union had a single bureaucratic center , like the one in the European Union .
The Soviet Union was dominated by a powerful secretary general .
So are the European institutions .
The Soviet Union had party ideologists .
The European Union has legal counselors .
The Soviet Union wanted to create a viable society through a series of official procedures .
So does the European Union .
The Soviet Union had apparatchiks , the European Union has mandarins .
The Soviet Union had a five year plan .
The European Union has a work program .
The Soviet Union saw socialist integration as an irreversible process .
The European Union sees integration as a means for an " ever closer Union " .
The Soviet Union claimed to act on behalf of a mythical worker .
The European Union has its mythical citizen .
The Soviet Union wanted to surpass the United States .
The European Union has been trying to do the same thing for many years .
Eppink concluded the comparison :
" All in all , the Soviet Union lacked the self - correcting forces and the self - criticism which are proper to the democratic process .
The European Union lacks these properties in the same way .
By setting targets which are either too far away or unrealistic , you are undermining the legitimacy of the project and of the institutions which have to implement these policies .
With this book , I want to warn for imperial overstretch and for the creation of expectations which are far - fetched and unrealistic .
Sometimes I have the impression that the European Union is moving towards the same trap that finished the Soviet Union . "
EUROPE'S THREE BIG ILLUSIONS
Eppink 's former boss Frits Bolkestein warned of the dangers of the " pensée unique " and of political correctness .
One day later , EC president José Manuel Barroso echoed this warning in an interview with The Daily Telegraph .
Bolkestein went on and identified three big illusions Europeans are cherishing out of a sense of self - defense :
If we are nice to the world , then the world will be nice to us .
If we leave radical leaders alone , then nothing will happen to us .
Mentally , we are preparing for our retirement .
Nothing new , please !
Will prosperity be sustained ?
We 'll worry about that later .
The best protection against globalisation is isolation .
CULTURAL CAPITULATION
Bolkestein warned for cultural capitulation , or what he calls " lack of cultural self - confidence " :
" This became clear in the issue of the Danish cartoons .
Most member states left Denmark in the lurch .
One year later , virtually none of the European leaders defended the Pope when he made a perfectly defensible speech on the relationship between reason and faith .
Europe is censuring itself with the Council preparing a special lexicon in order to counter what it calls " the use of offensive language " .
The word ' Muslim ' is to be avoided because it is allegedly " inflammatory " .
European leaders wallow in apologetic behaviour .
During his visit to India , Mr Gordon Brown , chancellor of the exchequer was asked to say something about insults made by an English girl against a film actress from Mumbai .
The chancellor of the exchequer had to apologize for a reality show .
I agree with Derk Jan Eppink 's view that this cultural capitulation currently forms the most serious threat to Europe . "
The book by Derk - Jan Eppink , " Life of a European Mandarin - Inside the Commission " is available in English ( at Azur.be ) and in Dutch .

The inspiration for this article comes from a slightly unusual source : The Proceedings of the Old Bailey from April 18th 1694 .
On this particular day 29 death sentences were passed at the court house , as well as numerous orders for brandings ; there would have been 30 death sentences had not one lady 's pregnancy saved her — she had successfully " pleaded her belly " .
The business part of the document ends with a list of the 29 unfortunates and continues to another list ; this time of advertisements .
Surprising though it may seem , advertisements for anything from quack remedies to religious texts formed an important part of the court proceedings between the 1680s and the 1750s .
On April 18th 1694 the second item on the list was an advert for a book :
Pleasure with Profit : Consisting of Recreations of divers kinds , viz .
Numerical , Geometrical , Mathematical , Astronomical , Arithmetical , Cryptographical , Magnetical , Authentical , Chymical , and Historical .
Published to Recreate Ingenious Spirit , and to induce them to make further scrutiny how these ( and the like ) Sublime Sciences .
And to divert them from following such Vices , to which Youth ( in this Age ) are so much inclin'd .
By William Laybourn , Philomathes .
If the author of these lines is to be believed , then those who were tried in the docks that day may well have been spared their gruesome fate , had they only been given access to this work .
We will touch on only a small part of it ourselves : to be precise , pages 12 and 13 .
A detail of page 12 of Pleasure with Profit .
William Leybourn ( 1626 -1719 ) ( alias Oliver Wallingby ) was in his time a distinguished land and quantity surveyor ( although he began his working life as a printer ) .
Such was his prestige , he was frequently employed to survey the estates of gentlemen , and he also helped to survey the remnants of London after the great fire of 1666 .
A prolific and eclectic author , his work The Compleat Surveyor , which was first published in 1653 and ran to five editions , is regarded as a classic of its kind and ( in collaboration with one Vincent Wing ) the 1649 volume Urania Practica , was the first book in English devoted to astronomy .
In 1694 he had published the recreational volume Pleasure with Profit .
It contained a delightful mechanical puzzle , attributed to one " J.P. " , which has become known as the Uphill Roller .
Pages 12 and 13 of the book detail the construction of a double cone and two inclined rails along which the cone can roll — uphill !
His final paragraph explains the paradox : even though the cone does ascend the slope , its centre of gravity will actually move downwards , if the experiment is set up in the right way .
Although one 's senses might be confounded , the law of gravity is not .
This animation shows a virtual uphill roller in action .
In the animation below you can see the downward movement of the centre of gravity of the double cone .
Before we examine his explanation , we will look at the matter through modern eyes , using elementary trigonometry .
The experiment consists of two inclined rails and a double cone .
The cone will roll " uphill " resting on the top surfaces of the two rails .
Figure 1 shows a vertical section of the set - up .
The inclined line represents the top surfaces of the rails .
The bottom end of the slope , shown at the left - hand side of figure 1 , is at a distance a from the ground .
The top end of the slope , on the right - hand side of figure 1 , is at a distance b from the ground .
The figure also shows the cross-section of the double cone after it has rolled some way up the slope .
The point in the middle of this cross section is the double cone 's centre of gravity , which we call G .
The angle of inclination of the rails is Imposing a coordinate system on this plane as shown , we give the point G the coordinates ( x , y ) .
As the double cone rolls up the rails , its centre of gravity G moves along a path given by some equation y = f( x ) .
Our aim is to find this equation .
Figure 1
Figure 2 shows the view from the front , in other words from the point where the two rails meet .
We see the cone as if it had been sliced vertically and lengthwise .
Again we see the centre of gravity G , as well as the points P and Q where the top surfaces of the two rails meet the double cone .
The points G 1 , P 1 and Q 1 are the projections of these three points to the ground .
The angle is half of the angle at the apex of the cone .
Figure 2
Figure 3 shows the projection of the whole set - up to the floor .
The diamond shape is the shadow the double cone casts on the floor and the two lines emanating from the points P 1 and Q 1 are the shadows cast by the two rails .
They meet at the point O and at an angle 2 β .
As before , the points G 1 , P 1 and Q 1 are the projections of G , P and Q .
Figure 3
With the coordinate system from figure 1 in place we can find the equation of the path of the centre of gravity of the double cone as it rolls up the slope .
For convenience we write XY for the straight line segment running from a point X to a point Y .
First consider figure 3 .
The distance between O and G 1 is precisely the x-coordinate of the point G. Using basic trigonometry we have that
Since P 1 Q 1 = PQ we get
Now let 's take the front view from figure 2 .
Write S for the point that lies on the line from G to G 1 at the same height as P and write R for the apex of the cone which lies on the line from G to G 1 .
See figure 4 .
Figure 4
Then so We know that , so
Now the height y of G is SG 1 + SG .
For the second part we have SG = r-RS , where 2r is the thickness of the double cone at its centre ( see figure 4 ) .
So
1
Figure 5
This gives Figure 5 below shows the same view as figure 1 .
Noting that the point Gis at distance x from the origin of the coordinate system , we getand hence
Therefore we have
The path of the centre of gravity of the cone is , then , the straight line
which has the gradient .
For the motion to be possible this straight line has to be sloping downward , as the centre of gravity can only move downhill .
This means that the gradient has to be negative , and so the defining condition for the paradox to exist is that
Of course , to properly appreciate the paradox a physical model is needed .
The author 's model ( made by his long - term friend Brian Caswell ) has :
An excerpt from Leybourn 's recipe for an uphill roller
The things necessary for this Experiment are , First , A Roller of Wood [...] of two Cones ( or Sugar Loaves ) .
Let the thickness in the middle be about 5 or 6 Inches , the length [ of the cone ] about 3 times the thickness . [...]
You must provide two straight smooth Rulers about a Yard in length , and strong enough to bear the weight of the Roller .
Lastly , you must have three pieces of Wood to support the ends of the rulers ; the first about two or three inches thick [ to support the rulers at the bottom of the slope ] ; the other two [ to support the rulers at the top of the slope ] must be thicker than the first by somewhat less than half the diameter of the ruler .
Leybourn 's recipe
measured in degrees , from which it is plain that the inequality holds .
Now that we have a clear criterion to use , we can look more closely at Leybourn 's instructions for building an uphill roller ( which we 've reproduced on the right ) and check that they really do give rise to angles that satisfy the required relationships .
The instructions specify that each of the cones that make up the double cone should be between 5 and 6 inches in thickness , so taking the upper limit of 6 we get r=3 .
The length of each of the two cones is to be three times its thickness , so it is 9 .
The rails are to be one yard in length , and since one yard is 36 inches , the length of the slope is 36 .
The blocks supporting the end of the slope should be thicker than those supporting the beginning of the slope by " somewhat less " than half the diameter of the cone , in other words by less than r ( as marked in the left - hand diagram in figure 6 below ) .
We can choose the thicknesses of the blocks so that their difference is less than , but very close to r .
Then the difference in height between the bottom of the slope and the top of the slope , b - a , is roughly equal to r .
Figure 6
From this and the right - hand diagram in figure 6 , we now deduce that
Figure 7
This means thatis an angle of a right - angled triangle with a hypothenuse of length 12 and the side oppositehaving length 1 . Using Pythagoras 's
Theorem we can work out the third side of this triangle to have lengthand therefore evaluate
Now let 's turn to the angle β.
The right hand diagram in figure 6 shows that the sloped rail and the dotted horizontal line form a right angled triangle with an angle between them .
The slope is the hypothenuse of this triangle , and the dotted line has the same length as the shadow the rail casts on the ground , so
so the length of the rail 's shadow is equal to
At the end of the cone 's journey , the point P 1 , shown in figure 7 , will be at the left - hand apex of the double cone , and its distance to G will be the length of one cone , which is 9 .
This gives
Figure 8
Again we have a right angled triangle whose third side is , making , so
From figure 8 we get that
In summary , Leybourn 's instructions reduce to :
our inequality requires thator that 143 > 134 — which indeed it is !
( Using the same analysis , his lower limit of 5 inches requires that 5159 > 4934 ) .
With the mystery of the uphill roller explained we will leave the reader with the following sentiment expressed in the book , with which we whole - heartedly agree :
But leaving those of the Body , I shall proceed to such Recreations as adorn the Mind ; of which those of the Mathematicks are inferior to none .

So I 'm dating a nice guy now and it SUCKS .
No other way to explain it , it just SUCKS .
He 's no challenge .
He agrees with everything I say .
He 's got it all though - a decent job , a nice house , no kids , no psycho ex-wives , and he 's tall and cute .
Anyone ever seen that Friends episode when Alec Baldwin played Phoebe 's boyfriend ??
YEAH , my boyfriend is THAT nice .
He 's just too fucking nice .
Nice is boring .
I 've never heard him raise his voice .
He 's never aggressive .
He has no .
He wo n't even drive over the speed limit and that fucking annoys the shit out of me , yet I sit in the passenger seat and keep my mouth shut ... watching everyone whiz by us .
And do n't get me started on the sex .
Oh , excuse me ....
After he cums ( note I did n't mention anything about ME cumming ) , he rolls over and says " Oh , that was nice " with a little sigh .
I KID YOU NOT , he says it EVERY TIME and then he sighs like he has just woken from a refreshing nap .
I finally got so tired of missionary and him looking lovingly into my eyes and smiling as he came , that I threw him down on the couch one night and mounted him .
At first he was terrified - yes , TERRIFIED .
He thought something had possessed me .
And it HAD -- it was sheer MADNESS .
I fucked the shit out of him that night .
And then he sighed and said " Oh , that was nice " .
Now that we had the cowgirl position conquered ( always with that sigh afterwards ) , it was time to move on to doggie .
His ex-girlfriend never did doggie ( hmmm ... maybe there 's a " nice " ex-girlfriend to blame for his timid niceness ??
That bitch ... ) .
Anyway , I digress .
I tell him I want him to fuck me from behind .
Yes , I used the word " fuck " and I did n't care what he thought about it .
He gets behind me and enters me , and damned if he did n't say " OH , THIS IS NICE " !!!
Are there any 35 y/o men out there that have n't smacked a woman 's ass when doing her doggie ??
YES , and he 's my boyfriend !
Tonight during sex , I think I 'm gonna tell him to stick his finger in my ass when I 'm riding him .
THAT should be interesting .
So for the nice guys out there , my advice is this :
It 's great that you 're nice ( to an extent ) , but have some backbone .
Do n't be a spine donor all your life .
When your girl is out of line , say something .
Do n't let her walk all over you .
Occasionally , be a " bad " boy ( being bad does n't translate to abusive or criminal ) .
Say " No " to her sometimes .
Raise your voice and be heard .
Say something dirty / sexy to her occasionally .
Drink a few too many beers and piss out in public .
Smack her ass .
Do n't ever use the word NICE to describe things , sex ( okay , that may be a personal pet peeve ) .
Have an interest in at LEAST one sport ( or pretend to ) .
Drive 5 - 10 miles over the speed limit once in awhile .
Run an old lady off the road just for kicks ( yeah , I 'm kidding about this one ... just ride her bumper for a few miles ) .
Be aggressive during sex .
Take off those damn white socks and Jesus sandals .
Grow a goatee for a few weeks .
Shave your balls .
Stray from your routine and shake things up .
BE A MAN FOR GOD'S SAKE ... and the women will fall at your feet .
Whew ...
THAT FELT

Advocates of DRM ( copy protection ) have been keeping their heads down lately , while they try to figure out what went wrong in the SonyBMG DRM spyware fiasco .
No doubt they ’ll try to explain it away as an anomaly – just a little speed bump on the road to the effective , unobtrusive DRM future that they ’re sure will be arriving any day now .
There are some problems with this story .
For starters , we ’re not talking about a single DRM system – we ’re talking about two totally separate systems ( XCP and MediaMax ) , developed by rival companies , both of which turned out to be spyware and to endanger users , in strikingly similar ways .
Is this just a coincidence ?
Of course it ’s not .
If we look carefully at CD copy protection as a technical problem , we ’ll see why DRM designers are drawn to spyware tactics as their best hope of stopping copying .
Let me explain why .
CDs store music files in Compact Disc Digital Audio ( CDDA ) format , which is easily readable by a wide range of devices .
If the music is encrypted or stored in some other tricky format , ordinary audio CD players wo n’t be able to read it , and the disc will be useless to most customers .
So backward compatibility requires that the music be stored in a format that is readable by computer software .
( Technical digression :
There are actually small differences between how a computer reads a disc and how ordinary audio CD players read it .
So - called passive protection technologies try to exploit these differences by putting things on the disc that try to confuse computers without affecting ordinary players .
For our purposes , it will suffice to say that purely passive protection systems are not viable , because computers are not so easily confused .
To my knowledge , purely passive CD DRM technologies are n’t being used any more , although some current vendors combine passive protection with active measures .
For reasons too boring to go into here , passive protection does n’t really affect my analysis ; and so to streamline the discussion I ’ll assume from here on that there is no passive protection . )
If the music is encoded on the disc in a format that any software program can read , the only way to stop programs from reading it is to install software on the user ’s computer , and to have that software actively interfere with attempts to read the disc , for example by corrupting the data stream coming from the disc .
We call this “ active protection ” .
For example , suppose the user wants to use iTunes to read the disc .
But the DRM vendor wants to stop the user from doing this , because iTunes can be used to make copies of the disc .
The active protection software will detect this and will interfere to ensure that iTunes gets a garbled copy of the music .
Here ’s the key issue : Active protection only works if the DRM software is running on the user ’s computer .
But the user does n’t want the software on his computer .
The software provides no value to him at all .
Its only effects are to stop him from doing things he wants to do ( such as listening to the music with iTunes ) , and to expose him to possible security attacks if the software is buggy .
So if you ’re designing a CD DRM system based on active protection , you face two main technical problems :
You have to get your software installed , even though the user does n’t want it .
Once your software is installed , you have to keep it from being uninstalled , even though the user wants it gone .
These are the same two technical problems that spyware designers face .
People who face the same technical problems tends to find the same technical solutions .
How do you get software installed against the user ’s wishes ?
You mislead the user about what is being installed , or about the consequences of installation .
Or you install without getting permission at all .
How do you keep software from being uninstalled ?
You do n’t provide an uninstaller .
Or you provide an uninstaller that does n’t really uninstall the whole program .
Or you try to cloak the software so the user does n’t even know it ’s there .
Of course , you do n’t have to resort to these tactics .
But if you do n’t , your software will have trouble getting onto users ’ computers and staying there .
If your whole business model depends on installing unwanted software and preventing its uninstallation , you ’ll do what ’s necessary to make that model work .
You ’ll resort to spyware tactics .
( Or you ’ll quit and go into another business . )
Having set off down the road of CD copy protection , the music industry should n’t be surprised to have arrived at spyware .
Because that ’s where the road leads .
On the shelves at Trixie & Peanut , a boutique in Manhattan , are indulgences for dog owners concerned with image : pink sequined tank tops , moss - green lizard - skin collars , rhinestone barrettes shaped like tiny bones .
Then there are specialty products for a different kind of shopper :
People who do n’t want their pet to be electrocuted .
For them , the shop ’s owner recommends $ 79 hiking boots with thick black rubber soles that might protect them if they should walk over one of the city ’s unpredictable sites of stray voltage .
Add this to your list of urban anxieties :
During the snowy months of late winter , when salt mixes with slush , electric current escaping through uninsulated wires can be conducted up to the street through manholes , streetlights , service boxes , grates or cracks in the sidewalk .
New Yorkers became painfully aware of the phenomenon two winters ago , when a 30 - year - old woman named Jodie Lane was electrocuted while walking her dogs in the East Village .
Lane ’s death opened people ’s eyes to the risks posed by the wires that weave in and out of the city .

But dogs -- whose skin touches the ground -- have known it all along .
For years , Garrett Rosso wrote it off as eccentric behavior on the part of his Rhodesian Ridgebacks , Java and Kai .
They would startle and run ahead or strain on the leash , refusing to go near certain spots on the sidewalk around his apartment .
Paul Schwartz , an East Side veterinarian , would see dogs that had burns on the bottoms of their paws , or , in one case , a dog whose spinal cord had degenerated so badly that it died .
At the time , “ I chalked it up to God only knows what disease .
Now that it ’s happened year after year after year , ” he said the cause was no longer a mystery .
New Yorkers were reminded of the phenomenon last week , when a chow - collie mix named Barkis was electrocuted near Prospect Park in Brooklyn .

The dog ’s owner , a music producer named Danny Kapilian , was walking Barkis when the dog “ started yelping and jumping ” and lunged into the street .
Assuming the dog was reacting to rock salt on the street , Kapilian bent down to wipe his paws .
For a moment , Barkis seemed calm .
Then he went into a fury -- eyes flaring , teeth gnashing , so violently that Kapilian was afraid his sweet - natured dog would attack him .
Barkis then fell , flopping on to the sidewalk , and went into convulsions .
Kapilian sat beside his dog for 40 minutes , a crowd gathering around him , while he waited for help .
When two animal technicians reached down to try to move Barkis , they too were shocked .
“ I was screaming at people , ‘ Leave us alone .
Get away from me , ’ ” Kapilian said .
Barkis had walked over a section of sidewalk conducting 70 volts of electricity intended for a streetlight -- which had been removed in 1999 .
Con Edison had been informed that the city planned to remove the streetlight but had not discontinued the electricity supply , said Michael Clendenin , a spokesman .

Barkis died an hour and 20 minutes after he was shocked .
Kapilian said he was considering suing Con Edison .
“ It was a horrible , painful death , ” he said .
At the heart of the problem is the aging infrastructure of a densely built city in which nearly all electrical wiring is located underground .
After Lane ’s death , Con Edison began doing something it had never done before : testing hundreds of thousands of sites each year for stray voltage , which typically escapes when casing around wires has disintegrated or corroded .
Surveys of 410,000 pieces of equipment in 2004 , after Lane ’s death , turned up more than 1,400 sources of stray voltage , which were then repaired .
Then , last year , a survey of more than 730,000 sites turned up about 1,100 sources of stray voltage , most of them streetlights , overwhelmingly in the outer boroughs of the city .
Advertisement
Although workers can neutralize sites , Clendenin said there was no guarantee they would remain safe -- or that other sites would not become dangerous , because of the ongoing effects of vibrations from traffic and subways and the effects of water and salt .
In the wake of this month ’s blizzard came a cluster of electric shocks :
Four pedestrians , including a 15 - year - old runway model , were stunned Feb. 11 while walking near Times Square ; Barkis died a few days later ; and on Thursday , a Brooklyn dog trainer was shocked while walking over a manhole belonging to a private company .
Clendenin said Con Edison ’s safety record was among the best in the nation for electric delivery systems .
“ We know there is some risk in delivering electricity , ” he said .
“ We strive every day to deliver it as safely as humanly possible . ”
Advertisement
Roger Lane , who immersed himself in the subject of electrical engineering after his daughter Jodie ’s death , said annual testing was no substitute for a system that would warn Con Edison and the public -- in real time -- of leaking electricity .
The current system “ implies a certain failure rate , ” he said .
“ That failure rate is discovered by dogs and people . ”
And dog owners , more than any other group , have begun to gather evidence .
Rosso collects and displays photographs of exposed wires sticking out of lampposts in his neighborhood .
Dog owners post information about hot spots to blogs such as Shock and Paw .
Greg Komar , a part - time dog walker in the same East Village community , got a note from one of his clients asking him to make sure the dog did n’t step on metal plates .
Eric Miranda , a songwriter who was a friend of Jodie Lane ’s and saw her die , wo n’t take his dog down a street unless he knows where all of the sewer caps are .
“ My life was changed dramatically from the event , ” he said .
“ There ’s always people flocking to this neighborhood .
It almost seems pathetic how naive they are , but we were naive too . ”
Given what ’s in those documents , it was astonishing to hear Mr. Gonzales continue to insist yesterday that he had no personal knowledge of discussions involving the individual attorneys .
Senator Charles Schumer , Democrat of New York , was right on the mark when he said that if Mr. Gonzales did n’t know what Mr. Sampson was doing , “ he does n’t have the foggiest idea of what ’s going on ” at his department .
Fortunately , last year ’s election left Democrats like Mr. Schumer in the majority , with subpoena power .
Otherwise , this and so many other scandals might never have come to light .
Mr. Gonzales , who has shown why he was such an awful choice for this job in the first place , should be called under oath to resolve the contradictions and inconsistencies in his story .
Mr. Gonzales is willing to peddle almost any nonsense to the public ( witness his astonishingly maladroit use of the Nixonian “ mistakes were made ” dodge yesterday ) .
But lying to Congress under oath is another matter .
The Justice Department has been saying that it is committed to putting Senate - confirmed United States attorneys in every jurisdiction .
But the newly released documents make it clear that the department was making an end run around the Senate  for baldly political reasons .
Congress should broaden the investigation to determine whether any other prosecutors were forced out for not caving in to political pressure  or kept on because they did .
There was , for example , the decision by United States Attorney Chris Christie of New Jersey to open an investigation of Senator Bob Menendez just before his hotly contested re-election last November .
Republicans , who would have held the Senate if Mr. Menendez had lost , used the news for attack ads .
Then there was the career United States attorney in Guam who was removed by Mr. Bush in 2002 after he started investigating the superlobbyist Jack Abramoff .
The prosecutor was replaced .
The investigation was dropped .
In mid-December 2006 , Mr. Gonzales ’s aide , Mr. Sampson , wrote to a White House counterpart that using the Patriot Act to fire the Arkansas prosecutor and replace him with Mr. Rove ’s man was risky 
Congress could revoke the authority .
But , he wrote , “ if we do n’t ever exercise it , then what ’s the point of having it ? ”
If that sounds cynical , it is .
It is also an accurate summary of the governing philosophy of this administration :
What ’s the point of having power if you do n’t use it to get more power ?
LogoMaid Rips Off Dan Cederholm ’s SimpleBits Logo , and Then Things Get Weird
LogoMaid is an outfit that sells off - the - shelf logos and corporate identities for a couple hundred bucks a pop .
Unsurprisingly , their work is not very original or good , and in some cases , is a flat - out rip - off .
Dan Cederholm spotted this knock - off of his SimpleBits logo , on sale at LogoMaid for $ 199 , and posted it to his Flickr account .
It ’s not a blatant pixel - for - pixel copy , but clearly it ’s a shameless knock - off .
They took his logo and added a fake mustache , as it were .
Here are the two logos , side - by - side :
Cederholm ’s SimpleBits logo is on the left , the LogoMaid knock - off is on the right .
Paul Viluda , the proprietor of LogoMaid , could have nipped this in the bud by simply removing the offending logo from LogoMaid ’s store .
Instead , almost unbelievably , he responded by accusing Cederholm of ripping his logo off from LogoMaid , and , laughably , threatening “ a lawsuit against SimpleBits . ”
The comment thread at Flickr is long , but fascinating .
( Note that the users “ ledo_bridgeportwv ” , “ pretty_petra ” , and “ midster_05 ” , are all apparently sock puppet Flickr accounts created within the last day by Viluda . )
Intellectual property thieves have much in common with other vermin , such as cockroaches and rodents : they do n’t like the light .
Expose them and they hide .
The last thing a site like LogoMaid wants is a high - PageRank site — like , oh , say , this one — spreading the word that they peddle ripped - off logos .
A graduate student in MIT ’s Department of Engineering , Tiffany A. Groode , performed a life cycle analysis on the production of corn ethanol , as others have done .
Groode , however , incorporated the uncertainty associated with the values of many of the inputs .
A recent MIT analysis shows that the energy balance of corn ethanol is actually so close that several factors can easily change whether ethanol derived from that process ends up a net energy winner or loser .
Further analysis shows that making ethanol from cellulosic sources such as switchgrass has far greater potential to reduce fossil energy use and greenhouse gas emissions .
Following a methodology developed by recent MIT graduate Jeremy Johnson ( Ph.D. 2006 ) , she used not just one value for each key variable ( such as the amount of fertilizer required ) , but rather a range of values along with the probability that each of those values would occur .
In a single analysis , her model runs thousands of times with varying input values , generating a range of results , some more probable than others .
Based on her most likely outcomes , she concluded that traveling a kilometer using corn ethanol does indeed consume more energy than traveling the same distance using gasoline .
However , further analyses showed that several factors can easily change the outcome , rendering corn - based ethanol a greener fuel .
One such factor is the much - debated co-product credit .
When corn is converted into ethanol , the material that remains is a high - protein animal feed .
One assumption is that the availability of that feed will enable traditional feed manufacturers to produce less , saving energy ; ethanol producers should therefore get to subtract those energy savings from their energy consumption .
When Groode put co-product credits into her calculations , ethanol ’s life - cycle energy use became lower than gasoline ’s .
Another factor that influences the outcome is which energy - using factors of production are included and excluded — the so - called system boundary .
A study performed by Professor David Pimentel of Cornell University in 2003 includes energy - consuming inputs that other studies do not , one example being the manufacture of farm machinery .
His analysis concludes that using corn - based ethanol yields a significant net energy loss .
Other studies conclude the opposite .
To determine the importance of the system boundary , Groode compared her own analysis , the study by Pimentel and three other reputable studies , considering the same energy - consuming inputs and no co-product credits in each case .
The results show that everybody is basically correct .
The energy balance is so close that the outcome depends on exactly how you define the problem .
— Tiffany Groode
The results also serve to validate her methodology — results from the other studies fall within the range of her more probable results .
Growing more corn may not be the best route to expanding ethanol production .
Other options include using corn stover , or growing an energy crop such as switchgrass .
Using her methodology , Groode performed an initial analysis of switchgrass and , drawing again on Johnson ’s work , corn stover .
She found that fossil energy consumption is far lower with these two cellulosic sources than for the corn kernels .
Farming corn stover requires energy only for harvesting and transporting the material .
( Fertilizer and other inputs are assumed to be associated with growing the kernels . )
Growing switchgrass is even less energy intensive .
It requires minimal fertilizer , its life cycle is about 10 years , so it need not be replanted each year , and it can be grown almost anywhere , so transport costs can be minimized .
Groode and supervisor supervised by John Heywood , Sun Jae Professor of Mechanical Engineering , now view the three ethanol sources as a continuum .
In the future , cellulosic sources such as corn stover and ultimately switchgrass can provide large quantities of ethanol for widespread use as a transportation fuel .
In the meantime , ethanol made from corn can provide some immediate benefits .
I view corn -based ethanol as a stepping - stone .
People can buy flexible - fuel vehicles right now and get used to the idea that ethanol or E85 works in their car .
If ethanol is produced from a more environmentally friendly source in the future , we ’ll be ready for it .

Black Hole in M81
To many it seems unlikely that a universe could spring into being from chaos , and achieve a level of organization advanced enough to allow for life⁠⁠ — let alone intelligence .
After all , if an electron were only twice the size that it is , chemistry as we know it could n’t exist .
If the Strong and Weak nuclear forces were out of proportion , stars may n’t work .
Over the centuries a number of theories have cropped up to try to explain life , the universe , and everything , but almost none propose to explain how it all came together .
As with many problems that are too grandiose to grapple , however , sometimes it ’s best to start on a smaller scale .
Evolutionists and naturalists have long observed Earth ’s “ natural selection ” where most creatures create offspring with slightly different characteristics than their own .
Those with characteristics better suited to the environment will thrive , procreate , and pass on their heritage ; whereas offspring less suited will wither , reproduce less , and their traits will fade and vanish .
Theoretical physicist Lee Smolin looked at the simple , functional elegance found in the the theory of natural selection , and thought that maybe such a concept could be applied on a universal scale .
Thus the theory of Cosmological Natural Selection was born .
In order to tackle how complexity came into being , most scientific theories postulate that there are an infinite number of universes , and each of them are host to its own set of physical laws .
Some would therefore have laws where chemistry cannot function , and thus are home to nothing more complex than a vast field of hydrogen .
Some would have to be like ours : rife with complexity where a star larger than 1.44 times the size of ours can collapse into a black hole .
And the black hole is the point where Cosmological Natural Selection begins .
Many people mistakenly attribute the concept of the Black Hole to Albert Einstein , however the earliest proposition of the Black Hole ( called a “ dark star ” at the time ) was presented by a fellow named John Michell in 1784 ⁠⁠ — a hundred - forty years before General Relativity was published .
Nevertheless , it was Einstein who refined the idea into its modern incarnation .
According to General Relativity , when an object achieves enough mass , it crushes down to an inconceivably small point called the singularity .
It is so weighty that the escape - velocity from it is greater than the speed of light , and since nothing exceeds the speed of light …
As good as it sounds , it ’s been found that Einstein ’s work does n’t function so well when one starts exploring items smaller than the atom .
Modern acolytes of Quantum Physics and String Theory have suggested that it ’s highly unlikely that there ’s a singularity in there at all .
Instead they propose a 4 - dimensional tube opens to a new region of space / time .
The introduction of the black hole ’s material in this virgin space / time is analogous to a Big Bang⁠⁠ — the genesis of a new universe .
Here , at the dawn of a new universe is where Smolin ’s theory fits .
He postulates that the new universe ’s laws are influenced by those of the parent .
Thus , our universe which has complexity and is therefore very successful at creating black holes / new universes is spawning universes that also have complexity , and will pass that trait onto their progeny … much like evolution .
However , unlike evolution , there are no known universe - predators culling the ill and unfit universes from the multiverse , therefore “ Cosmological Natural Selection ” might be a less apt name than “ Fecund Universes ” ; it ’s not a race for survival , just reproduction .
Some sectors of science dismiss the notion , calling it inherently untestable .
There is no way to peek into other universes to see if they are related to their parent … yet .
Smolin responds by asking that his peers to seek out any natural law that shows that our universe is n’t adapted to easily create black holes .
After all , if there is a basic principle that inhibits the formation of black holes it would be a pretty big hole in the idea .
This portion of the Working Psychology website offers a brief introduction to a big topic : social influence , the modern , scientific study of persuasion , compliance , propaganda , " brainwashing , " and the ethics that surround these issues .
Although these topics are n't always simple ( it is , after all , science ) , I 've done my best to make this introduction interesting .
Since Aristotle recorded his principles of persuasion in Rhetoric , humans have attempted to define and refine the principles of successful influence .
Persuasion has been studied as an art for most of human history .
The comparatively young science of social influence , however , can trace its roots to the second world war , when a social psychologist named Carl Hovland was contracted by the U.S. Armed Forces to bolster the morale of soldiers .
President Roosevelt was concerned that Americans would lose the will to fight after winning victory in Europe .
It was Hovland 's job to motivate soldiers to continue fighting against Japan .
Since World War II , social influence has become a vastly expanding field of study devoted to discovering the principles that determine our beliefs , create our attitudes , and move us to action .
In this introduction , I approach the topic of influence from a scientific viewpoint -- you wo n't hear me talking about my hunches , fabricating entertaining distinctions , constructing pseudo - scientific systems , or offering anecdotes as substitutes for hard evidence .
Social scientists attempt to support any assertion with facts .
As empiricists , we do n't guess , we test -- and the result of decades of testing , by thousands of scientists who study human behavior , has yielded a rich body of knowledge - - facts !-- on how and why people are persuaded by another person 's arguments , or decide to comply with another person 's request .
This website presents a very small fraction of what is known about influence by today 's influence experts .
Want a few examples of how social influence works in the real world before you continue ?

Claim : New U.S. dollar coins were designed with the motto “ In God We Trust ” omitted .
FALSE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , February 2007 ]
Since the 1950’s , “ In God We Trust ” has been our National Motto , and has been inscribed on the front of all coins and the back of all paper currency .
Since the 1950’s , “ In God We Trust ” has been our National Motto , and has been inscribed on the front of all coins and the back of all paper currency .
This new coin came out this month .
The U.S. Mint hopes the redesigned $ 1 coin will win acceptance with consumers .
It does not have “ In God We Trust ” on it .
Here ’s another way of phasing God out of America .
U.S. Government to Release New Dollar Coins
You guessed it
‘ IN GOD WE TRUST ’
IS GONE !!!
Who originally put ‘ In God We Trust ’ onto our currency ?
My bet is that it was one of the Presidents on these coins .
All our U.S. Government has done is Dishonor them , and disgust me !!!
If ever there was a reason to boycott something , THIS IS IT !!!!
DO NOT ACCEPT THE NEW DOLLAR COINS AS CHANGE
Together we can force them out of circulation .
Origins : In 2007 the U.S. Mint began the release of a series of coins similar in concept to the 50 State Quarters Program launched in 1999 .
This new series , the Presidential $ 1 Coin Program , features dollar coins identical in size , color , and composition to the
earlier Sacagawea dollar , each one bearing the likeness of a former U.S. President on the obverse ( front ) and a representation of the Statue of Liberty on the reverse ( back ) .
The Presidential $ 1 coins will be released in series of four per year ( in order corresponding to the presidents ’ terms of office ) beginning in February 2007 .
Just as the first Presidential $ 1 coins rolled out of the Mint in early 2007 , e-mails began to circulate spreading the erroneous assertion that the new dollar coins did not include the phrase “ In God We Trust ” in their design .
In fact , the Presidential dollars neither omitted the phrase “ In God We Trust ” nor demonstrated a plot to “ phase God out of America . ”
As specified by Presidential $ 1 Coin Act of 2005 , in order to allow for “ larger and more dramatic artwork ” on the coins ’ faces , the new Presidential $ 1 coins incorporated a few design features not found on other current U.S. coinage , one of which is that elements typically displayed on either the obverse or reverse of U.S. coins — the year of minting , the mint mark , the motto from the Great Seal of the United States ( “ E Pluribus Unum ” ) , and the current national motto of the United States ( “ In God We Trust ” ) — were instead included as edge - incused inscriptions .
That is , all of these elements appeared on the edges of the new dollar coins rather than on their fronts or backs :
The following photograph shows how the national motto is stamped as an edge - incused inscription on a dollar coin blank :
( Small quantities of the George Washington and John Adams presidential dollars were discovered to be missing their edge inscriptions shortly after the initial release of those coins , but those examples were the result of minting errors and were not reflective of the new dollars ’ intended standard appearance .
The stamping of the faces and the adding of the edge inscriptions are separate steps in the minting process and involve the use of different machinery . )
With the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 , Congress reversed its previous specifications and instructed the U.S. Mint to move the “ In God We Trust ” motto from the edge to the front or back of the presidential $ 1 coins “ as soon as is practicable . ”
Beginning with the first Presidential $ 1 coin issued in 2009 ( which bore the likeness of the ninth U.S. President , William Henry Harrison ) , the motto was repositioned to the bottom left - hand portion of the obverse :
One traditional feature that has been left off the new dollar coins is the appearance of the word “ Liberty . ”
The U.S. Mint explained the change by noting that “ each coin represents this important value by depicting the Statue of Liberty on the reverse ” :

But beating is strictly forbidden by the United States Army ’s Field Manual , as well as American and Iraqi laws .
When the Americans learned about the beating , they were quick to condemn it .
The use of torture by American soldiers and contractors at Abu Ghraib only compounded Iraqi hatred of Americans and further undermined American moral claims in Iraq .
It also produced little valuable information .
Most experts , including in the military , say they believe that coerced confessions are an unreliable way to learn about enemy operations because people being tortured will often say whatever they think it will take to stop the pain .
This joint security station in Ghazaliya opened on March 15 , about a month after the latest increase in American troops began .
The station , inhabited by about 70 soldiers of Company D of the Second Battalion , 12th Cavalry , and their Iraqi counterparts , is named for Specialist Robert Thrasher , a member of the unit killed by sniper fire on Feb. 11 when the company was scouting for a station site .
Thrasher , as the station is known , sits in the southern part of Ghazaliya , one of the roughest areas of western Baghdad .
In the northern part , Shiite militias , led by the Mahdi Army , have been driving out Sunni Arabs through raids and assassinations .
Sunnis have pushed Shiites out of the southern part .

The outpost ’s location , along one of the main arms smuggling routes from Falluja , was chosen because it was next to a litter - filled lot that was a dumping ground for bodies .
When they first arrived , the American soldiers found 30 bodies there , among them women and children .
Now it is rare to find more than one or two , said Captain Fowler , who keeps photos of every one on his computer as a reminder of how much worse it was before his company took up residence .
He can also point to other signs of progress : children have begun to play outside again , and women walk to the market .

How does the rational science of biological evolution make sense of the man who gets off on this ?
It ’s a vital question .
You can call this guy a freak of nature , but there are many like him , seeking similar strange kicks , far removed from “ reproductive success . ”
Despite the recent efforts of the Kansas Board of Education , many people understand the basic tenet of evolutionary theory — the interaction of a species ’ genetic makeup with its environment is the process that is responsible for the vast configurations of life on the planet .
We call it natural selection .
Sociobiologists , accordingly , have attempted to elucidate the spectrum of human behaviors in terms of evolution , but they find themselves facing big problems when explaining sexual activities .
This is certainly ironic , since the act that transmits our genetic code would seem most effectively described by evolutionary theory .
Indeed , we modern humans do very odd and problematic things with our sexuality , things that ca n’t be satisfactorily explained as mere “ mistakes ” of evolution .
We commit to celibacy , have sex with the same gender , use birth control , and fetishize our lifestyles beyond anything a Darwinian geneticist can possibly explain .
The confounding and seemingly anti-Darwinian nature of contemporary sex practices is one of many issues explored in Susan Blackmore ’s The Meme Machine .
This book expands the field of memetics , pioneered by popular science writer Richard Dawkins , into new areas , and provides powerful explanations for cultural dynamics that have long perplexed evolutionary scientists .
According to Blackmore ’s theory , memes — like genes — are “ replicators . ”
They seek , at all costs , to make copies of themselves .
In the process , they affect the behavior of the “ vehicles ” that carry them — humans .
But unlike genes , they can spread “ horizontally ” ( from one brain to another , regardless of the genetic relationship ) as well as “ vertically ” ( from parent to child , and even child to parent ) .
For instance , the thesis of this article is a meme that has copied itself from my brain , to the Internet , to your brain , even though we ’ve never met and are probably not related .
Genes , on the other hand , can only copy themselves vertically , from generation to generation , through biological reproduction .
Also , unlike genes , the biological fitness of the meme carrier does n’t necessarily impact on the spreading of the meme .
If someone commits suicide in political or religious protest and witnesses are so impressed they take up that person ’s cause , then the meme he was carrying has won .
It has successfully copied itself , perhaps more successfully than if that person had not committed suicide .
Genes , on the other hand , rely on biological reproduction .
While they ’re apathetic about the fate of their vehicles after they reproduce ( note the bodily effects of the female who is no longer of reproductive viability ) , breeding is an imperative for gene survival .
If a given person dies before reproducing , regardless of political or religious intent , the genes lose .
This means that the two replicators , the genes and the memes , are often in competition for the resources of the human vehicles .
This may account for the bizarre behaviors for which biological evolution cannot .
( Blackmore uses the “ second replicator ” theory , a major aspect of her thesis , to elucidate all sorts of phenomena , from human brain size , to the origins of language , to the Internet . )
So , let ’s return to our man who deliberately seeks out cock and ball torture .
Electrifying his scrotum might actually make him impotent — a definite genetic disadvantage .
But from the memetic perspective , his action makes perfect sense .
You see , he is the carrier of the “ genital torture ” meme .
The man has either heard about or seen images of this behavior at some point .
When this “ informational unit ” entered his brain , it found a comfortable home ( perhaps he has other memes that caused him to perceive himself as deserving of punishment ) .
The man is likely to now serve the cause of the meme further .
Maybe he ’ll meet others in the fetish community and communicate the practice , and a few will practice it themselves .
We have successful memetic replication !
From a wider perspective , the memes are now harnessing the biological energy of sexual desire to serve themselves at the expense of genes .
Instead of devoting their lives to their genes ’ survival by breeding offspring and raising kids who in turn might start families , people bathe themselves in the information - rich behavior of fetishes , associating with other fetishists who are susceptible to being infected with ever - more fetishistic memes .
Until the memes finally work out a way to do away with the need for humans altogether , I think it ’s clear that the further we wander from our genetic imperatives without sacrificing our ability to spread memes , the more useful we are to our true masters .

Google positioning for move into U.S. radio LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) 
Web search leader Google is hiring scores of radio sales people and is spending heavily in a bid to expand its position in the $ 20 billion radio industry .
Google spokesman Michael Mayzel said this week that the company will begin a public test of Google Audio Ads by the end of the year .
Advertisers will be able to go online and sign up for targeted radio ads using the same AdWords system they use to buy Web search ads .
Google is generally testing its ability to move into offline media , this week saying it would help customers buy advertisements in 50 U.S. newspapers .
It made a clear move into radio in January when it agreed to pay more than $ 1 billion , depending on performance , for dMarc Broadcasting , which connects advertisers to radio stations through an automated advertising system .
It 's all part of what Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt has said is an investment in radio advertising that could grow over time to include up to 1,000 Google employees — not just in ad sales , but also in engineering and operations .
The fast - growing Silicon Valley Internet company had 9,378 employees in September .
" Google is hiring salespeople in most major markets and they 're hiring sales people to sell radio .
They 're paying about 50 % more than a typical radio sales person might make , " said Bill Figenshu , chief operating officer of privately held Software Media Exchange Inc.
Figenshu said three people he had spoken with believed Google was in talks to buy about $ 1 billion in radio advertising inventory from Clear Channel Communications .
Software Media Exchange sells radio ads online and competes with Google 's dMarc .
Google declined to elaborate on its plans .
Google 's move into radio comes at a time when Clear Channel , the biggest radio station operator , is weighing a possible sale of the company .
Clear Channel , which controls an estimated 20 % of local radio industry revenues , declined to comment on recent reports that Google could take a stake in the radio company , perhaps as part of a buyout led by private equity firms .
In a recent research report , RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank said he was perplexed by Google 's hirings , since they are being made before it has significant radio advertising inventory to sell .
" While there are other possibilities , we believe there 's a reasonable chance Google Audio is establishing critical mass in anticipation of a major acquisition of prime inventory .
Our sense from recent discussions with industry players has been most radio operators are reluctant to offer prime inventory to Google Audio , " he said .
Bank said Clear Channel 's size and potential sale make it a likely source of inventory for Google , either through Google taking a modest investment in a leveraged buyout or by taking a stake in the company 's current incarnation .
Two private equity consortia are looking into making bids for Clear Channel , sources familiar with the matter said late last month .
Analysts estimated an offer could approach $ 40 per share , valuing the company at just under $ 20 billion .
Other industry sources said Google had been approaching all the radio operators in recent weeks .
" They 've been going around to all the radio groups , trying to do deals .
It seems like a good time to be doing this because business is so slow , There 's a lot of inventory , " said one industry executive .

[ Update 3/13/07 ] .
I changed the title of this post from " A Nosedive Into the Desert " to " A Nosedive Toward the Desert " to better reflect the conclusion of the post .
Summary
In this post , I extend my analysis of Saudi Arabian production backwards four years earlier than my post of last week .
I explain in detail how the evidence strongly suggests that since late 2004 , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ( KSA ) has entered rapid decline of their oil production , at least for the time being .
The headline graph summarizes my conclusions , which are as follows .
Saudi production can be divided into two eras .
In the first , prior to the third quarter of 2004 , KSA had spare capacity and acted as the swing producer , making large voluntary changes in their production to stabilize the market .
During this era , all major features of the production graph can be well understood based on demand side needs .
Since late 2004 , KSA have entered a new era where they cannot raise production in response to demand side needs , and instead the major features of the production curve correspond to supply side events .
During 2002 , KSA was increasing production to accomodate increasing demand as the world recovered from the recession of 2001 .
In 2003 , there was a major spike in oil production immediately preceding and during the US invasion of Iraq : this was a voluntary action to stabilize oil prices in the face of the loss of Iraqi production .
As combat wound down , and Iraqi oil production resumed , Saudi production declined back to levels slightly higher than before the war .
Oil prices increased due to increasing US , Chinese , etc demand in the strong economy of 2003 and early 2004 .
Once it became clear that oil prices had risen pronouncedly above OPECs desired $ 22 - $ 28 price band , KSA initiated a large voluntary increase in production in the spring of 2004 in an attempt to bring prices back into the band .
They were not able to raise production by more than 1 million barrels per day ( mbpd ) , however , and this was not sufficient to stabilize prices , which have never returned to the price band .
The band was abandoned a year later .
After continuing to increase production very slightly for several more months , Saudi production began to decline in late 2004 .
This was only arrested by the arrival of the first KSA oil " megaproject " , the 800 thousand barrel / day ( kbpd ) output from the combined Qatif / Abu Sa'fah fields ( 690 kbpd of new crude and condensate production ) .
This 690 kbpd arrested declines during early 2005 , but never sufficed to raise production above the peak achieved in 2004 .
There was no sign of Saudi increases in production in response to the high prices of 2005 and since , nor to the loss of production from the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes in 2005 .
Production began to decline again in 2005 , and at greater rates through 2006 .
This was only arrested briefly by the arrival of oil from the 300 kbpd Haradh III development in late spring of 2006 .
If these trends were to continue , Saudi oil production would halve over the next five years .
However , it seems more likely that KSA will find ways to bring smaller fields on line and start to mitigate the decline within this time period .
The Production Data
EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.1
The US Energy Information Agency , in their monthly publication International Petroleum Monthly give a variety of data tables conveniently available in spreadsheet form .
Table 1.1a provides monthly oil production estimates for OPEC countries , including Saudi Arabia .
The EIA generally produces estimates about two months after the end of the month in question and revises them relatively little later .
The data series includes crude oil , together with lease condensate , but not natural gas plant liquids ( NGPLs ) .
About half of neutral zone production is included .
The EIA lists its sources as " Dow Jones , Middle East Economic Survey , Petroleum Intelligence Weekly , Monthly Oil Data Service from the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , Monthly Oil Market Report from OPEC , Oil & Gas Journal , Platts , and Reuters . "
It 's unclear what algorithm the EIA uses to compute their final estimate from these sources .
IEA Oil Market Report Table 3
The OECD International Energy Agency produces a monthly Oil Market Report , available for free only as individual PDF files .
Table 3 ( Table 4 in older reports ) contains a summary of oil production for a variety of countries , including Saudi Arabia .
The IEA generally produces a preliminary estimate quite quickly after the end of a month , but then revises it multiple times in subsequent versions of the OMR , sometimes quites significantly .
For Saudi Arabia , the production estimate excludes condensates and other NGLs .
The exclusion of condensates probably makes the IEA 's numbers systematically lower than the EIA's .
The IEA does not document its sources or methods for its estimates of Saudi production , to my knowledge .
JODI
The Joint Oil Data Initiative is a global collaborative attempt to reconcile data from various agencies and improve transparency in the oil markets .
They tabulate monthly oil production data , for many countries , including Saudi Arabia .
Generally the data are a couple of months behind and do not get revised , but what is particularly interesting about JODI data is that it is based on self - reports by the countries .
Thus since January 2002 , when the JODI series begins , the Saudis have been making an assertion about their own production via the JODI process .
This is of interest since the Saudis are in much the best position to know what their own oil production is .
On the other hand , there is considerable reason to question the integrity of Saudi reports on their oil industry ( discussed later ) , and they have incentives to distort their production data at times .
JODI definitions of oil production includes condensates , but excludes other NGLs .
In theory , the JODI data should thus be comparable to the EIA data .
JODI data is available in convenient CSV or spreadsheet form .
OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries publishes a Monthly Oil Market Report ( as individual PDFs ) which includes data on OPEC member country production .
This is in a table in the section on " World Oil Supply " , but the table number varies from issue to issue .
The sources of the data are listed only as " based on secondary sources " , and OPEC does not document whether or not condensates are included , but apparently separately accounts for NGLs .
OPEC data are generally produced within a couple of weeks of the end of the month , but then are significantly revised .
Let me justify each of these points in detail .
Saudi Aramco has not historically published detailed data on its oil production , and so data is inferred by third parties from a variety of indirect methods ( eg counting tankers - but see below on JODI data ) .
Here , I consider four data series that are published by various agencies , and none of which agree perfectly .
The series are :
The four production estimates are reproduced in this graph , together with their average :
Clearly the data situation is scientifically quite unsatisfactory .
We have four data series which are undocumented , of uncertain veracity , do not agree , and yet the differences cannot rightly be interpreted as statistically independent noise .
They do not measure quite the same thing , but lack the auxiliary information to make them commensurable .
Nonetheless , for lack of any other way to make progress , in this essay I take it that trends that appear in all or most of the data series are veridicial .
Having no a-priori reason to favor one series over another , I generally take the average of the four as the best overall estimate .
I also assume that the spread of the series is some kind of estimate of the uncertainty in the values .
I now turn to justifying the narrative explanation of the data given in the summary .
Economic Growth
When economies grow well , people build more houses , take more vacations , and buy more goods and services .
Businesses hire more workers , send staff on more business trips , and open new offices and factories .
All these things increase the demand for oil to power cars , trucks , planes , heating systems , etc .
Thus the usage of oil is highly sensitive to economic growth - indeed economic growth has a far stronger effect on oil demand than the price of oil ( an economist would say that the income elasticity of oil demand is much larger than the price elasticity ) .
As the swing producer , historically Saudi Arabian oil production has varied widely based on oil demand - they reduce production the most when demand drops , and they were best placed to make very large increases in production when there was a sudden need in the market for more oil .
The next graph shows the history of real GDP growth in three key developed economies : the US ( quarterly ) , the European Union ( yearly ) , and Japan ( also yearly ) , together with the Saudi production estimate for comparison .
Top : Percentage growth of real GDP over same period prior year for United States ( quarterly ) and the European Union and Japan ( annual ) .
Data are plotted as of the middle of the period .

US GDP growth from the Bureau of Economic Affairs .
European and Japanese GDP growth from the European Commission .
In 2001 , there was a recession in the US , and probably in the global economy , as a result of the bursting of the Internet stock bubble .
The US recession officially ended in November 2001 .
So in 2002 , economic growth resumed and gradually increased from a low base .
Economic growth continued to increase until it reached a peak in mid 2004 , after which it moderated , but remained overall healthy .
A - priori , in the face of steady economic growth like this , we would have expected world oil usage to increase several percent a year throughout the period of interest , and we might have expected Saudi production in particular to increase .
The production increase in 2002 may well have this character , as may the increase from 2002 to 2004 and then to 2004 ( though other factors enter the picture here as discussed in a moment ) .
However it is striking that increases in production essentially ceased after a last step up in mid 2004 , despite continued economic growth .
This is surprising in the historical context .
It is possible that the failure to increase oil supply ( and resulting high prices ) are the cause of economic growth being lower after mid 2004 - at any rate the two events coincide in onset .
It is also likely , as discussed below , that the very strong economic growth of late 2003 and early 2004 led to the price increases which triggered the step - like Saudi production increase of mid 2004 .
At any rate , it is important to note that there were no recessions during the study interval and no sizeable periods of low growth after 2002 .
Thus production declines in Saudi Arabia in the period of study cannot be due to weakness in global economic growth .
The Iraq War
The next graph is concerned with the large spike in KSA oil production in early 2003 .
It 's fairly clear that this is due to the Saudi 's increasing production to compensate the market for the loss of Iraqi production due to the US invasion , and to some extent the Venezuelan oil strike .
Iraqi production is shown above Saudi production , and the spikes match up well .
Top : Iraqi oil production Jan 2002 - Nov 2006 .
Bottom : Saudi Arabian oil production , Jan 2002 - Jan 2007 , from four different sources .
Saudi graph is not zero - scaled to better show changes ; both graphs have the same vertical scale .

Right fragment shows detail of all data sources for the early 2003 Saudi spike .
Source : See above for Saudi production .
Iraqi production is from US EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.1 .
All sources agree this spike began in January 2003 ( the Venezuelan oil strike began in December 2002 ) , peaked in April ( the US invaded in March ) , and declined by June to a new , but higher level from which it sloped down through the remainder of 2003 ( see the graph fragment to the right ) .
Once the war was over and Iraqi production began to recover , the Saudis ramped down again - initially quickly , and then more gradually ( OPEC was reducing quotas at the time ) .
There does not seem too much to say about this interval .
Clearly the Saudis were acting as swing producer and demonstrated an ability to raise production by 2 mbpd in a fairly short interval to a total of somewhere around 9.5 mbpd .
Breaking the OPEC Price Band
Now we come to what I think are the critical events in the story .
With the very strong economic growth in late 2003 and early 2004 , oil prices started to rise .
The next graph shows oil price in the top panel - with OPEC 's intended price band of $ 22 - $ 28 shown in blue - and the Saudi production curve in the bottom panel .
My price is the export weighted OPEC average from the EIA , not the official OPEC basket , but I do n't think the difference matters too much .
Top : Export weighted average OPEC oil price .
Blue box is OPEC agreed price band of $ 22 - $ 28 .
Bottom : Saudi Arabian oil production , Jan 2002 - Jan 2007 , from four different sources .
Graphs are not zero - scaled to better show changes .

Sources :
See above for production data .
Price data are from the EIA .
We are going to focus now on explaining the large ( roughly 1 mbpd ) rise in production in the May / June 2004 timeframe .
Reading through OPEC publications from the early 2004 timeframe is quite enlightening .
In February 2004 , the OPEC Oil Market Report gave the recent history of price , which was above the price band :
The OPEC Reference Basket started 2004 on a firm footing , with an average of $ 30.33 / b in January .
The Basket gained 89¢ / b over the previous month but dropped 1¢ / b lower compared to the same month for 2003 .
On a weekly count , the Basket put in a strong performance early in the month gaining 55 ¢ / b or 1.9 % during the first week , followed by another rise of 67¢ / b or 2.2 % in the second .
Then the Basket made a downturn losing 8¢ / b to average $ 30.67 / b in the third week , followed by a hefty loss of 85¢ / b at the end of January for an average of $ 29.82 / b .
The fall extended to the first half of February when the Basket shed a substantial 3.9 % of its value , averaging $ 28.67 / b in the second week of the month , yet remained comfortably above the upper limit of the OPEC price band .
However , although technically above their policy , this is not a high enough price to alarm OPEC , and concerns are mainly about the risk of making stocks too large and causing prices to collapse :
Therefore , despite the uncertainties inherent in any forecast of the supply / demand balance , the range of opinion among regularly published oil market reports points to the inevitability of a higher - than - normal build in stocks in the 2Q of this year to minimum 2.7 mb/d with a mean of 3.6 mb/d , close to OPEC ’s February figure of 3.4 mb/d .
Moreover , no reasonable further upward revision in demand or a drop in non-OPEC supply is likely to change the consensus on the balance for 2Q 2004 .
If this surplus is not handled in a timely and effective manner , there is likely to be excessive downward pressure on prices .
Such a development cannot be left unattended , as it would lead to a protracted spell of volatility in the market , something that is in no one ’s interest .
The $ 32.35 / b April ’s OPEC Reference Basket price is second only to the all - time high monthly average of $ 34.32 / b registered in October 1990 .
The constant strength of the Basket since the beginning of 2004 , combined with the pronounced drop seen in March and April of last year , considerably widened the 2004 year ’s year - to - date average with respect to 2003 .
The Basket averaged $ 31.13 / b to 30 April of this year versus $ 29.02 / b during the same period in 2003 .
Early in May , following a surge in crude prices , the Basket added another 5 % or $ 1.66 / b to average $ 34.91 / b in the week ended 6 May and rose by another $ 1.25 / b to $ 36.16 / b in the following week .
As of 17 May , the Basket ’s daily average had risen to $ 37.72 / b , or about $ 1.20 below the all - time high , driven primarily by geopolitics , security concerns , the gasoline situation in the USA , high demand for petroleum products and rampant speculation .
and , responding to these concerns , OPEC quotas were lowered and Saudi production in March and April fell slightly .
However , this proved to be the wrong direction to move in : by May , prices had continued to rise , and we read and OPEC is now worried - sneaking a few bucks above the price band was apparently viewed as a harmless good time for the membership , but $ 35 oil is worrying them .
They are going to do something about the situation :
OPEC crude oil production in April , based on secondary sources , is estimated at 28.05 mb/d , 0.26 mb/d lower than the revised March figure .
However , May nominations and tanker movements indicate much higher volumes , and OPEC Member Countries are considering further production increases as part of their commitment to respond to market realities .
This is the lead in to the large Saudi increase - it goes up 1 mbpd by June .
By June 3rd , OPEC is having an extraordinary meeting to officially sanction what is being done , and consider what more to do .
The meeting summary reports :
Having reviewed market developments since its 130th Meeting , held on March 31 , 2004 , as well as the supply / demand outlook , the Conference noted with concern that , as a result of several factors , prices have continued to escalate , despite the efforts by OPEC Member Countries to meet market requirements .
These factors are mainly the robust growth in demand in the USA and China , which had not been fully anticipated ; geopolitical tensions ; and refining and distribution industry bottlenecks in some major consuming regions , coupled with more stringent product specifications .
Combined , these factors have led to unwarranted fear of a possible future supply shortage of crude oil , which has , in turn , resulted in increased speculation in the futures markets with substantial upward pressure on crude oil prices .
Given current high and volatile prices and prevailing concerns regarding supply security , and in order to ensure continued , robust , global economic growth , especially in the economies of fellow Developing Countries , the Conference decided to increase the OPEC production ceiling ( excluding Iraq ) to 25.5 mb/d , with effect from July 1 , 2004 , and to 26 mb/d , with effect from August 1 , 2004 , in order to ensure adequate supply and give a clear signal of OPEC ’s commitment to market stability and to maintaining prices at acceptable levels to both producers and consumers .
The Conference also decided to convene an Extraordinary Meeting in Vienna , Austria , on July 21 , 2004 to review market developments .
Ok .
So as of June 2004 , OPEC and Saudi Arabia are doing all the right swing - producer things - flooding the market with extra oil to damp down prices and bring them back within reasonable range of the price band .
However , as the price fragment to the right shows , it did n't work .
Prices dropped a bit in May and June , and then shot up again .
What went wrong ?
I think the basic dynamic here is that futures market traders were essentially saying to Saudi Arabia : " show us what you got " .
This is six months after Matt Simmons gave his first presentation on his concerns about the future robustness of Saudi production , China and the US were both growing very fast , and prices were being bid up challenging the Saudis to show they could put enough oil on the market to rein prices in .
Let 's look at what happened .
Here is oil stocks in the US , and the rest of the OECD , expressed as an anomaly relative to the average over the period .

Oil stock numbers from EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.5 .
As you can see , in spring 2004 , stocks increase a little , but then , critically , they stop increasing in the third quarter of 2004 .
This coincides with the Saudis stopping increasing production .
The Saudis cannot pump any more , and it's not enough to drive stocks up further .
The point is even clearer in this EIA picture Euan found :
No matter in which time - frame is considered — monthly , weekly , daily — the OPEC Reference Basket in July and early August broke records all across the board .
On a monthly basis , the rise of $ 1.68 / b in July brought the monthly average to an unprecedented level of $ 36.29 / b.
Besides the previous monthly high of $ 36.27 / b reached in May this year , the Basket has never been above $ 34 / b since October 1990 .
On a weekly basis , the $ 37.40 / b average for the week ending 29 July constitutes an all - time weekly high , while the daily average of $ 40.08 / b on 11 August now holds the Basket ’s daily record .
As you can see , all through 2004 , stocks were at a low , and the Saudis production hike was not enough to change that .
Thus , the oil market bulls celebrate , bears retreat , and by August 2004 , the OPEC OMR has this to say but the bulletin was , unusually , silent on what anyone should do .
There was nothing to be done .
OPEC had lost control of the price of oil .
They would effectively acknowledge this in Janauary 2005 when they suspended the price band .
I think it 's important to stress that OPEC had every reason in late 2004 to think that these prices would hurt the world economy .
Their literature at the time says they thought so , and as recently as 2000 , $ 35 oil had caused massive civil unrest and an economic crisis in Europe .
This seems endearing looking back from the era of $ 60 + oil , but there 's little doubt that people at the time believed oil prices above $ 35 were going to cause serious problems , and that 's why Saudi Arabia made a real effort to contain them .
Entering the Supply Constraint Era
This third quarter of 2004 was the point when Saudi Arabia , and by extension OPEC , crossed from being a swing producer , to being supply constrained .
And , as is typical of oil production in some region , once production cannot go up any more , it starts to go down .
In the fourth quarter of 2004 , Saudi production drops sharply : my hypothesis is that after nearly six months of running flat out , parts of the oil fields really needed to be rested to prevent water breakthroughs ( producing a field too fast can allow water to find channels to the wells and then flow straight into them , instead of pushing the oil ahead of it ) .
This is in the absence of any suggestion in the September OPEC OMR , or the press release from the 132nd OPEC meeting on September 15th 2004 , that anyone should do anything but keep increasing production .
In fact , the meeting decided on yet another quota hike :
In light of the foregoing , the Conference decided to raise the OPEC production ceiling ( excluding Iraq ) by 1.0 mb/d , to 27.0 mb/d , with effect from November 1 , 2004 , in order to bring prices down further to a more sustainable level , whilst , at the same time , vigilantly monitoring market developments .
In taking this decision , the Organization reiterated its commitment to take action to stabilize the market at prices reasonable to both producers and consumers .
Saudi Arabia appears to have been obliged to do the opposite , dropping production by around 400,000 barrels per day between October 2004 and January 2005 .
As the next graph shows , it was this quarter - the fourth quarter of 2004 - when the rig count began its rise above the long term very modest number of rigs that the Saudis had needed to maintain their production ( given the extraordinary permeability of some of their large reservoirs - a point Euan helpfully reminds us of ) .

See above for production sources .
Rig count is from Baker Hughes .
It is at this point that megaprojects come into the story .
After the initial development of the Shaybah field , which came on stream in 1998 , the next major development the Saudis took on was the redevelopment of the Qatif and Abu Sa'fah fields .
Qatif had been produced from 1951 to 1982 , but was in serious decline at the end of that time and was mothballed during the low production years of the 1980s .
It was then redeveloped using all the latest technology ( horizontal drilling , multilateral completions ) from 2002 to 2004 , with official inaguaration in December 2004 .
A similar project rehabilitated the nearby offshore Abu Sa'fah field .
Together , these were intended to produce 800,000 barrels per day of crude , plus 40 kbpd of condensate , which was 690 kbpd of new production , since Abu Sa'fah was already producing 150 kbpd .
My suggestion is that the production bump that started in early 2005 should be interpreted as the new flows from Qatif / Abu Sa'fah being used to offset declines elsewhere .
However , they did not allow Saudi production to rise above the almost 9.5 mbpd attained in October 2004 - instead that level was just matched for a few months in the summer of 2005 .
This suggests that the rest of the production base was being produced 690 kbpd lower than it had been 10 months earlier .
That 's about an 8 % decline rate in the underlying base production , compensated for by the new field to give an overall roughly flat production profile .
By the end of 2005 , beginning of 2006 , the new projects were presumably fully in production and there was nothing to offset declines , which therefore show through into the top line production again .
As I discussed at length last week , during 2006 we saw declines in the base production accelerate to 14 % , offset to 8 % as a net decline rate after addition of the smaller Haradh III megaproject .
Alternative Explanations
Next , I 'd like to look at alternative explanations that have been proposed for what is happening , most of which stem from the Saudi's and OPEC 's own explanation for what is occuring ( with Euan and Robert Rapier adding wrinkles to this ) .
It will be impossible to look at all variants , so let me try to string together the strongest possible narrative along these lines , and then point out why I do n't believe it 's plausible .
That narrative would go something like the following :
Due to long - standing under - investment in production capacity , Saudi Arabia did indeed temporarily fail to increase production as much as oil markets might have liked in the fall of 2004 .
This caused prices to rise very high , driven primarily by speculators in the futures market .
However , KSA has now rebuilt significant spare capacity by utilizing more of their ample reserves .
In the interim , it became clear that the world economy could in fact continue to grow with oil prices in the $ 60 + range , and so they realized that there was no point in increasing their production again to lower prices .
In fact , as western oil stocks have been increasing since then , the market is overall well supplied , and in recognition of this fact , the Saudis have been lowering production voluntarily .
If the onset of new megaprojects shows up in the production statistics , that is just because they waited to be sure that the new production was working before resting existing production .
Nonetheless , they could increase production further if they really wanted to , eg. if oil prices became high enough to cause serious distress to the world economy .
That ( Haradh III ) probably is what it was .
They probably brought that production on line .
But , you want to prove your production rate before you take other production offline .
You do n't take the other production offline as you are bringing the new production on , because you do n't know for sure if things are going to work out like you think they will .
You can see this same pattern on their prior production declines .
There will be a decline , and then a little step up , and then more declines .
Let me start with the idea that the visibility of the Qatif and Haradh megaprojects in the data is not significant .
As Robert Rapier at one point put it : I found this completely implausible from a theoretical perspective .
Aramco , a very sophisticated high - tech company , has several decades of experience running the oil infrastructure for a swing producer that participates in political arrangments dependent on changing their oil output regularly .
We have to assume that they would have made it easy to centrally control the amount of oil output .
Indeed we see many occasions in the past when they 've changed production by 1 mpbd up or down from one month to another .
So it has to be , from a technical standpoint , easy for them to adjust the level of their base production , assuming they are not operating at capacity .
This means they can mask the effects of new production in the curve .
Furthermore , according to Robert 's hypothesis , these declines ( in 2006 for example ) are voluntary .
The declines occur every month according to the production statistics .
Therefore , the level of production must be being adjusted at least every month under normal circumstance to implement the decline schedule .
So again , if they are being adjusted every month , how can it be so difficult to change the adjustment to do a little extra ramping down on existing production when new production is coming on line ?
And the failure to match the intended production has real consequences : extra tankers must be ordered and paid for to take the extra oil away , and that extra oil will affect prices in the marketplace .
It 's hard for me to believe that it 's easier to face these consequences than just turn the base production down a little at the outset of turning on the new megaproject , and then turn it back up again if there 's a problem with the new field .
However , in my modus operandi , empirical evidence trumps theoretical prejudice every time .
So I went back and looked at the inauguration of the Shaybah field .
This was a megaproject to bring on a brand new field , 500 kbpd , during the swing producer era .
Specifically , first oil was in July 1998 and the official inauguration of the completed facility was in March 1999 .
Presumably the new oil came on to varying degrees between those dates , or perhaps a little after , but we do n't know exactly how much when .
I made a graph of the 1998 - 1999 period , and I plotted two things : the official OPEC allocations for Saudi Arabia , which is the schedule that production is supposed to be following .
I also plotted the average of IEA and EIA production estimates ( JODI did n't exist back then and I do n't have the OPEC production series done back that far yet and it's particularly time consuming to compile ) .
Saudi Arabian oil production , Jan 1998 - Dec 1999 , average of two different sources , together with official OPEC quota for Saudi crude oil production .

Source : US EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.1 and IEA Oil Market Report Table 3 , for production data , and OPEC for quotas .
As you can see , at the time Saudi Arabia was tracking its quota pretty well .
OPEC was ramping down production in response to the Asian financial crisis , and the Saudis were behaving as well - disciplined members of the cartel .
The new megaproject has no apparent impact on their ability to follow the schedule - they are never more than a couple of hundred kbpd off , usually less , and they are particularly close to the line during the interval whan Shaybah came on stream .
( Note that it is just a coincidence that both first oil and inauguration of Shaybah are in the same month as OPEC production cuts ) .
To me , this strongly demonstrates my contention : when KSA is not operating at capacity , they can control base production so that a new megaproject does not influence their total production level .
Thus the fact that they did not achieve that control for the onset of Qatif and Haradh III continues to strike me as highly significant .
For reference , here is the production profile and quota for the last five years ( on the same vertical scale ) :

See above for production data , and OPEC for quotas .
In general , KSA was not following its quota so closely during this era - in particular , they seem to have responded much more aggressively than OPEC required to the market need for more oil during the Gulf war , and also in response to the loss of control over prices in mid 2004 .
However , as the two circled regions show , there was nothing in the quota curve to explain these events .
Now , let 's turn to the issue of rising OECD stocks :
Top : End of month oil stocks for US and OECD ex-US , Jan 2002 - Jan 2007 .

Oil stock numbers from EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.5 .
It 's certainly true that stocks have been rising from 2004 until last summer , both on an absolute and a days of supply basis - though the rise is not historically outrageous .
OPEC is fond of claiming this mean that the market is well supplied and so nobody needs any more oil .
Clearly , the average minimum wage worker forced to cut short on driving because they can't afford the gas would have a very different perspective .
The problem is in the supply constraint era , inventories just do not mean what they used to mean .
The price rises of the last few years have frequently come from the long end of the futures market - the market has often been in contango in which the right to have a barrel of oil in five years is more expensive than the right to have a barrel today .
When the far future oil contracts are driving up like that , two things happen : one is that it makes it more profitable to store oil , so stocks rise .
The other is that the current price of oil has to rise too ( because otherwise even more oil would be stored , which tends to drive the far future price and the current price towards one another ) .
So the historical role of inventories as the main signal OPEC used to balance the market has broken down .
But I find it hard to believe that OPEC does n't know how the futures markets work .
But obviously , none of this would happen if the futures markets thought that there was going to be ample oil in the future .
$ 60 is high enough that demand has flattened out , despite decent economic growth .
Thus there are certainly additional customers who would drive further and turn up the heating oil thermostat if only oil was a bit cheaper and they could afford it .
The fact that there 's no - one available to supply it to them is why prices have remained so high .
If OPEC had the capacity and convincingly demonstrated their ability to flood the market with all the oil anyone anywhere would pay for , oil market bulls would have no choice but to run screaming for the hills - selling their long positions cheaper and cheaper lest they be faced with the prospect of tankers heading up Long Island Sound trying to deliver to their hedge fund offices .
Ok , but what about the idea that the Saudis , having recognized that the world can cope with $ 60 + oil , are now deliberately holding production down in order to maintain prices at that level .
At one level , I think it 's incontrovertible that OPEC has gotten very fond of the high prices .
There does seem to be some evidence that some countries did actually make very small cuts specifically in response to the recent OPEC cuts .
Could the Saudis simply have decided that being the swing producer is a mugs game , and they 're just going to take all the money they can ?
Well , that hypothesis has some problems , I think .
One is , why do n't they cut even further , and make even more money ?
Knock another few mbpd off , and oil will be $ 150 , which is even better for the treasury .
Ok , they can't do that all at once , or they'd throw the world into recession .
But after prices peaked at almost $ 80 last summer , why did the newly greedy Saudis let them come down again .
Why not have managed them slowly higher to find the point of maximum profitability , which is almost certainly higher than $ 60 ?
Or if they are n't that greedy , and $ 60ish is the new price band , the new balance between the interests of producers and consumers , why'd they let the price go almost to $ 80 over the summer ?
Why not ramp up to 10.5 mbpd for a few months and scare the markets back down to $ 65 ?
In short , if the Saudis had spare capacity , we 'd expect the production profile to show some intentionality around managing the price in some way that they perceive to benefit them .
But that 's not what we 've got .
If we focus on price and production over just the last three years :

Sources :
See above for production data .
Price data are from the EIA .
I just ca n't see Euan 's contention that the peak in Saudi production and price coincide .
From my perspective , declines in Saudi production start a year earlier than the peak price , gradually at first , and then accelerating .
Instead of some rational looking approach to price management , we see a profile of drops interrupted by each new megaproject .
Thirdly , if the Saudi's were indeed sitting on 716gb of ultimately recoverable oil , there 's some serious risks in running prices so high now , so early in the history of their production .
In particular , they are triggering a huge boom in investment in trying to find alternative forms of energy ( this is going gangbusters here in the SF Bay Area ) .
That 's pretty risky for them - who 's to say that Silicon Valley wo n't solve the electric car battery problem and the cheap solar panel problem ?
It 's not usually a good business strategy to price your product so high that your customers are driven to furiously trying to invent an alternative .
In the past , they understood this which was why they created a moderate $ 22 - $ 28 price band which balanced the needs of producers and consumers .
They had the experience of the 1980s when the price spikes of the 1970s caused a huge shift away from oil and contraction in demand , which absolutely killed their revenues for years .
Why would they repeat that experience ?
So , at this point , I 'm pretty strongly persuaded that this can't be the explanation .
The Future of Saudi Production
The Saudi Arabian crude supply estimate for December was revised down by 100 kb/d to 8.7 mb/d in light of updated tanker data and reported production levels .
January supply is assessed unchanged , although Aramco has signalled to Asian term buyers that exports will be curbed by between 10 - 13 % in February compared with 8 - 9 % in January .
Moreover , steep price increases for March exports suggest supply remaining constrained next month .
The very near term future is generally agreed to be continued declines .
The most recent IEA Oil Market Report ( from Feb 13th , 2007 ) says : For the medium term , if you just project the underlying linear decline rate in 2006 out for the next five years and add in the known megaprojects , you get the red line in the following graph :
Saudi Aramco production 2002 - Jan 2007 as before , together with a hypothetical scenario ( red line ) where base production declines linearly at 120 kbd per month , but is augmented by production from all planned megaprojects starting on their currently intended date , and not changing thereafter .

Source : see above for KSA oil production sources .
Megaproject dates and amounts are from press releases from Saudi Aramco and Rembrandt Koppelaar .
If that were true , production would have halved by 2012 .
However , it 's very hard to believe that declines would continue at that rate .
Eg , if they continued all the way to zero after ten years , that would only be another 16 billion barrels of oil production .
No-one is that sceptical of Saudi oil reserves .
Eg Hubbert linearization suggests there 's about another 80 gb or so of oil there .
ASPO estimates 170gb still to produce ( though based on a fairly generous recovery factor ) .
So rather than declines continuing at the present rate all the way into the ground , more likely , I think , is that there are a large number of small fields , and pockets in big fields , which carry the remaining reserves .
Hitherto , these have been beneath the attention of Saudi Aramco , which prefers to engage in massive heroic engineering projects - they have n't gone below about a 5 gb field in recent publicly announced projects .
Just as in other regions , the addition of increasingly large numbers of increasingly small fields to the backside of the production peak should serve to moderate the decline rate .
How quickly Saudi Arabia will move to exploit the remaining smaller fields is anyone 's guess , but the green line on the chart above is intended to suggest that the present decline rates should moderate at some point .
Parting Thoughts
No -one has taken me up on my bet , but since I feel even more confident of my conclusions , I 'm raising the offered stakes to $ 2000 .
I need to go find some cornucopians to take the other side of it .
Which reminds me .
For those of you doomers keen to see this as the end of civilization as we know it , it 's going to take more than this for me to join you .
While it 's certainly worrying , we need to keep some perspective : 8 % of Saudi production is 1 % of global production , and as long as global declines are less than a few percent a year they are well within society 's proven capacity to adapt .
Probably the biggest potential issue is the political stability of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia once this news becomes clear to everyone .
I vividly remember one of my first sightings of a large software project .
I was taking a summer internship at a large English electronics company .
My manager , part of the QA group , gave me a tour of a site and we entered a huge depressing warehouse stacked full with cubes .
I was told that this project had been in development for a couple of years and was currently integrating , and had been integrating for several months .
My guide told me that nobody really knew how long it would take to finish integrating .
From this I learned a common story of software projects : integration is a long and unpredictable process .
But this need n't be the way .
Most projects done by my colleagues at ThoughtWorks , and by many others around the world , treat integration as a non-event .
Any individual developer 's work is only a few hours away from a shared project state and can be integrated back into that state in minutes .
Any integration errors are found rapidly and can be fixed rapidly .
This contrast is n't the result of an expensive and complex tool .
The essence of it lies in the simple practice of everyone on the team integrating frequently , usually daily , against a controlled source code repository .
When I 've described this practice to people , I commonly find two reactions : " it ca n't work ( here ) " and " doing it wo n't make much difference " .
What people find out as they try it is that it 's much easier than it sounds , and that it makes a huge difference to development .
Thus the third common reaction is " yes we do that - how could you live without it ? "
The term ' Continuous Integration ' originated with Kent Beck 's Extreme Programming development process , as one of its original twelve practices .
When I started at ThoughtWorks , as a consultant , I encouraged the project I was working with to use the technique .
Matthew Foemmel turned my vague exhortations into solid action and we saw the project go from rare and complex integrations to the non-event I described .
Matthew and I wrote up our experience in the original version of this paper , which has been one of the most popular papers on my site .
Although Continuous Integration is a practice that requires no particular tooling to deploy , we 've found that it is useful to use a Continuous Integration server .
The best known such server is CruiseControl , an open source tool originally built by several people at ThoughtWorks and now maintained by a wide community .
Since then several other CI servers have appeared , both open source and commercial - including Cruise from ThoughtWorks Studios .
The result of doing this is that there is a stable piece of software that works properly and contains few bugs .
Everybody develops off that shared stable base and never gets so far away from that base that it takes very long to integrate back with it .
Less time is spent trying to find bugs because they show up quickly .
If a clash occurs between two developers , it is usually caught when the second developer to commit builds their updated working copy .
If not the integration build should fail .
Either way the error is detected rapidly .
At this point the most important task is to fix it , and get the build working properly again .
In a Continuous Integration environment you should never have a failed integration build stay failed for long .
A good team should have many correct builds a day .
Bad builds do occur from time to time , but should be quickly fixed .
However my commit does n't finish my work .
At this point we build again , but this time on an integration machine based on the mainline code .
Only when this build succeeds can we say that my changes are done .
There is always a chance that I missed something on my machine and the repository was n't properly updated .
Only when my committed changes build successfully on the integration is my job done .
This integration build can be executed manually by me , or done automatically by Cruise .
Once I have made my own build of a properly synchronized working copy I can then finally commit my changes into the mainline , which then updates the repository .
With a good build , I can then think about committing my changes into the repository .
The twist , of course , is that other people may , and usually have , made changes to the mainline before I get chance to commit .
So first I update my working copy with their changes and rebuild .
If their changes clash with my changes , it will manifest as a failure either in the compilation or in the tests .
In this case it's my responsibility to fix this and repeat until I can build a working copy that is properly synchronized with the mainline .
A detailed handbook on the details of how to do Continuous Integration .
After outlining the core principles of the practice , it explains how CI reduces risks by building software at every change .
It then looks at a full - featured CI environment comprising continuous database integration , testing , inspection , deployment , and feedback .
Once I 'm done ( and usually at various points when I 'm working ) I carry out an automated build on my development machine .
This takes the source code in my working copy , compiles and links it into an executable , and runs the automated tests .
Only if it all builds and tests without errors is the overall build considered to be good .
Now I take my working copy and do whatever I need to do to complete my task .
This will consist of both altering the production code , and also adding or changing automated tests .
Continuous Integration assumes a high degree of tests which are automated into the software : a facility I call self - testing code .
Often these use a version of the popular XUnit testing frameworks .
The above paragraph will make sense to people who use source code control systems , but be gibberish to those who do n't .
So let me quickly explain that for the latter .
A source code control system keeps all of a project 's source code in a repository .
The current state of the system is usually referred to as the ' mainline ' .
At any time a developer can make a controlled copy of the mainline onto their own machine , this is called ' checking out ' .
The copy on the developer 's machine is called a ' working copy ' .
( Most of the time you actually update your working copy to the mainline - in practice it 's the same thing . )
I begin by taking a copy of the current integrated source onto my local development machine .
I do this by using a source code management system by checking out a working copy from the mainline .
The easiest way for me to explain what CI is and how it works is to show a quick example of how it works with the development of a small feature .
Let 's assume I have to do something to a piece of software , it does n't really matter what the task is , for the moment I 'll assume it 's small and can be done in a few hours .
( We 'll explore longer tasks , and other issues later on . )
Practices of Continuous Integration
The story above is the overview of CI and how it works in daily life .
Getting all this to work smoothly is obviously rather more than that .
I 'll focus now on the key practices that make up effective CI .
Maintain a Single Source Repository .
Software projects involve lots of files that need to be orchestrated together to build a product .
Keeping track of all of these is a major effort , particularly when there 's multiple people involved .
So it 's not surprising that over the years software development teams have built tools to manage all this .
These tools - called Source Code Management tools , configuration management , version control systems , repositories , or various other names - are an integral part of most development projects .
The sad and surprising thing is that they are n't part of all projects .
It is rare , but I do run into projects that do n't use such a system and use some messy combination of local and shared drives .
So as a simple basis make sure you get a decent source code management system .
Cost is n't an issue as good quality open - source tools are available .
The current open source repository of choice is Subversion .
( The older open - source tool CVS is still widely used , and is much better than nothing , but Subversion is the modern choice . )
Interestingly as I talk to developers I know most commercial source code management tools are liked less than Subversion .
The only tool I 've consistently heard people say is worth paying for is Perforce .
Once you get a source code management system , make sure it is the well known place for everyone to go get source code .
Nobody should ever ask " where is the foo- whiffle file ? "
Everything should be in the repository .
Although many teams use repositories a common mistake I see is that they do n't put everything in the repository .
If people use one they 'll put code in there , but everything you need to do a build should be in there including : test scripts , properties files , database schema , install scripts , and third party libraries .
I 've known projects that check their compilers into the repository ( important in the early days of flaky C++ compilers ) .
The basic rule of thumb is that you should be able to walk up to the project with a virgin machine , do a checkout , and be able to fully build the system .
Only a minimal amount of things should be on the virgin machine - usually things that are large , complicated to install , and stable .
An operating system , Java development environment , or base database system are typical examples .
You must put everything required for a build in the source control system , however you may also put other stuff that people generally work with in there too .
IDE configurations are good to put in there because that way it 's easy for people to share the same IDE setups .
One of the features of version control systems is that they allow you to create multiple branches , to handle different streams of development .
This is a useful , nay essential , feature - but it 's frequently overused and gets people into trouble .
Keep your use of branches to a minimum .
In particular have a mainline : a single branch of the project currently under development .
Pretty much everyone should work off this mainline most of the time .
( Reasonable branches are bug fixes of prior production releases and temporary experiments . )
In general you should store in source control everything you need to build anything , but nothing that you actually build .
Some people do keep the build products in source control , but I consider that to be a smell - an indication of a deeper problem , usually an inability to reliably recreate builds .
Automate the Build Getting the sources turned into a running system can often be a complicated process involving compilation , moving files around , loading schemas into the databases , and so on .
However like most tasks in this part of software development it can be automated - and as a result should be automated .
Asking people to type in strange commands or clicking through dialog boxes is a waste of time and a breeding ground for mistakes .
Automated environments for builds are a common feature of systems .
The Unix world has had make for decades , the Java community developed Ant , the .NET community has had Nant and now has MSBuild .
Make sure you can build and launch your system using these scripts using a single command .
A common mistake is not to include everything in the automated build .
The build should include getting the database schema out of the repository and firing it up in the execution environment .
I 'll elaborate my earlier rule of thumb : anyone should be able to bring in a virgin machine , check the sources out of the repository , issue a single command , and have a running system on their machine .
Build scripts come in various flavors and are often particular to a platform or community , but they do n't have to be .
Although most of our Java projects use Ant , some have used Ruby ( the Ruby Rake system is a very nice build script tool ) .
We got a lot of value from automating an early Microsoft COM project with Ant .
A big build often takes time , you do n't want to do all of these steps if you 've only made a small change .
So a good build tool analyzes what needs to be changed as part of the process .
The common way to do this is to check the dates of the source and object files and only compile if the source date is later .
Dependencies then get tricky : if one object file changes those that depend on it may also need to be rebuilt .
Compilers may handle this kind of thing , or they may not .
Depending on what you need , you may need different kinds of things to be built .
You can build a system with or without test code , or with different sets of tests .
Some components can be built stand - alone .
A build script should allow you to build alternative targets for different cases .
Many of us use IDEs , and most IDEs have some kind of build management process within them .
However these files are always proprietary to the IDE and often fragile .
Furthermore they need the IDE to work .
It 's okay for IDE users set up their own project files and use them for individual development .
However it 's essential to have a master build that is usable on a server and runnable from other scripts .
So on a Java project we 're okay with having developers build in their IDE , but the master build uses
Ant to ensure it can be run on the development server .
Make Your Build Self - Testing Traditionally a build means compiling , linking , and all the additional stuff required to get a program to execute .
A program may run , but that does n't mean it does the right thing .
Modern statically typed languages can catch many bugs , but far more slip through that net .
A good way to catch bugs more quickly and efficiently is to include automated tests in the build process .
Testing is n't perfect , of course , but it can catch a lot of bugs - enough to be useful .
In particular the rise of Extreme Programming ( XP ) and Test Driven Development ( TDD ) have done a great deal to popularize self - testing code and as a result many people have seen the value of the technique .
Regular readers of my work will know that I 'm a big fan of both TDD and XP , however I want to stress that neither of these approaches are necessary to gain the benefits of self - testing code .
Both of these approaches make a point of writing tests before you write the code that makes them pass - in this mode the tests are as much about exploring the design of the system as they are about bug catching .
This is a Good Thing , but it's not necessary for the purposes of Continuous Integration , where we have the weaker requirement of self - testing code .
( Although TDD is my preferred way of producing self - testing code . )
For self - testing code you need a suite of automated tests that can check a large part of the code base for bugs .
The tests need to be able to be kicked off from a simple command and to be self - checking .
The result of running the test suite should indicate if any tests failed .
For a build to be self - testing the failure of a test should cause the build to fail .
Over the last few years the rise of TDD has popularized the XUnit family of open - source tools which are ideal for this kind of testing .
XUnit tools have proved very valuable to us at ThoughtWorks and I always suggest to people that they use them .
These tools , pioneered by Kent Beck , make it very easy for you to set up a fully self - testing environment .
XUnit tools are certainly the starting point for making your code self - testing .
You should also look out for other tools that focus on more end - to - end testing , there 's quite a range of these out there at the moment including FIT , Selenium , Sahi , Watir , FITnesse , and plenty of others that I 'm not trying to comprehensively list here .
Of course you can't count on tests to find everything .
As it 's often been said : tests do n't prove the absence of bugs .
However perfection is n't the only point at which you get payback for a self - testing build .
Imperfect tests , run frequently , are much better than perfect tests that are never written at all .
Everyone Commits
To the Mainline Every Day Integration is primarily about communication .
Integration allows developers to tell other developers about the changes they have made .
Frequent communication allows people to know quickly as changes develop .
The one prerequisite for a developer committing to the mainline is that they can correctly build their code .
This , of course , includes passing the build tests .
As with any commit cycle the developer first updates their working copy to match the mainline , resolves any conflicts with the mainline , then builds on their local machine .
If the build passes , then they are free to commit to the mainline .
By doing this frequently , developers quickly find out if there 's a conflict between two developers .
The key to fixing problems quickly is finding them quickly .
With developers committing every few hours a conflict can be detected within a few hours of it occurring , at that point not much has happened and it 's easy to resolve .
Conflicts that stay undetected for weeks can be very hard to resolve .
The fact that you build when you update your working copy means that you detect compilation conflicts as well as textual conflicts .
Since the build is self - testing , you also detect conflicts in the running of the code .
The latter conflicts are particularly awkward bugs to find if they sit for a long time undetected in the code .
Since there 's only a few hours of changes between commits , there 's only so many places where the problem could be hiding .
Furthermore since not much has changed you can use diff - debugging to help you find the bug .
My general rule of thumb is that every developer should commit to the repository every day .
In practice it 's often useful if developers commit more frequently than that .
The more frequently you commit , the less places you have to look for conflict errors , and the more rapidly you fix conflicts .
Frequent commits encourage developers to break down their work into small chunks of a few hours each .
This helps track progress and provides a sense of progress .
Often people initially feel they can't do something meaningful in just a few hours , but we 've found that mentoring and practice helps them learn .
Every Commit Should Build the Mainline on an Integration Machine Using daily commits , a team gets frequent tested builds .
This ought to mean that the mainline stays in a healthy state .
In practice , however , things still do go wrong .
One reason is discipline , people not doing an update and build before they commit .
Another is environmental differences between developers ' machines .
As a result you should ensure that regular builds happen on an integration machine and only if this integration build succeeds should the commit be considered to be done .
Since the developer who commits is responsible for this , that developer needs to monitor the mainline build so they can fix it if it breaks .
A corollary of this is that you should n't go home until the mainline build has passed with any commits you 've added late in the day .
There are two main ways I 've seen to ensure this : using a manual build or a continuous integration server .
The manual build approach is the simplest one to describe .
Essentially it's a similar thing to the local build that a developer does before the commit into the repository .
The developer goes to the integration machine , checks out the head of the mainline ( which now houses his last commit ) and kicks off the integration build .
He keeps an eye on its progress , and if the build succeeds he 's done with his commit .
( Also see Jim Shore 's description . )
A continuous integration server acts as a monitor to the repository .
Every time a commit against the repository finishes the server automatically checks out the sources onto the integration machine , initiates a build , and notifies the committer of the result of the build .
The committer is n't done until she gets the notification - usually an email .
At ThoughtWorks , we 're big fans of continuous integration servers - indeed we led the original development of CruiseControl and CruiseControl .
NET , the widely used open - source CI servers .
Since then we 've also built the commercial Cruise CI server .
We use a CI server on nearly every project we do and have been very happy with the results .
Not everyone prefers to use a CI server .
Jim
Shore gave a well argued description of why he prefers the manual approach .
I agree with him that CI is much more than just installing some software .
All the practices here need to be in play to do Continuous Integration effectively .
But equally many teams who do CI well find a CI server to be a helpful tool .
Many organizations do regular builds on a timed schedule , such as every night .
This is not the same thing as a continuous build and is n't enough for continuous integration .
The whole point of continuous integration is to find problems as soon as you can .
Nightly builds mean that bugs lie undetected for a whole day before anyone discovers them .
Once they are in the system that long , it takes a long time to find and remove them .
Fix Broken Builds Immediately
A key part of doing a continuous build is that if the mainline build fails , it needs to be fixed right away .
The whole point of working with CI is that you 're always developing on a known stable base .
It 's not a bad thing for the mainline build to break , although if it 's happening all the time it suggests people are n't being careful enough about updating and building locally before a commit .
When the mainline build does break , however , it 's important that it gets fixed fast .
Continuous Integration Certification Continuous Integration is a popular technique in software development .
At conferences many developers talk about how they use it , and Continuous Integration tools are common in most development organizations .
But we all know that any decent technique needs a certification program — and fortunately one does exist .
Developed by one of the foremost experts in continuous delivery and devops , it ’s known for being remarkably rapid to administer , yet very insightful for its results .
Although it ’s quite mature , it is n’t as well known as it should be , so as a fan of the technique I think it ’s important for me to share this certification program with my readers .
Are you ready to be certified for Continuous Integration ?
And how will you deal with the shocking truth that taking the test will reveal ?
A phrase I remember Kent Beck using was " nobody has a higher priority task than fixing the build " .
This does n't mean that everyone on the team has to stop what they are doing in order to fix the build , usually it only needs a couple of people to get things working again .
It does mean a conscious prioritization of a build fix as an urgent , high priority task .
Often the fastest way to fix the build is to revert the latest commit from the mainline , taking the system back to the last - known good build .
Certainly the team should not try to do any debugging on a broken mainline .
Unless the cause for the breakage is immediately obvious , just revert the mainline and debug the problem on a development workstation .
To help avoid breaking the mainline at all you might consider using a pending head .
When teams are introducing CI , often this is one of the hardest things to sort out .
Early on a team can struggle to get into the regular habit of working mainline builds , particularly if they are working on an existing code base .
Patience and steady application does seem to regularly do the trick , so do n't get discouraged .
Keep the Build Fast
The whole point of Continuous Integration is to provide rapid feedback .
Nothing sucks the blood of a CI activity more than a build that takes a long time .
Here I must admit a certain crotchety old guy amusement at what 's considered to be a long build .
Most of my colleagues consider a build that takes an hour to be totally unreasonable .
I remember teams dreaming that they could get it so fast - and occasionally we still run into cases where it 's very hard to get builds to that speed .
For most projects , however , the XP guideline of a ten minute build is perfectly within reason .
Most of our modern projects achieve this .
It 's worth putting in concentrated effort to make it happen , because every minute you reduce off the build time is a minute saved for each developer every time they commit .
Since CI demands frequent commits , this adds up to a lot of time .
If you 're staring at a one hour build time , then getting to a faster build may seem like a daunting prospect .
It can even be daunting to work on a new project and think about how to keep things fast .
For enterprise applications , at least , we 've found the usual bottleneck is testing - particularly tests that involve external services such as a database .
Probably the most crucial step is to start working on setting up a deployment pipeline .
The idea behind a deployment pipeline ( also known as build pipeline or staged build ) is that there are in fact multiple builds done in sequence .
The commit to the mainline triggers the first build - what I call the commit build .
The commit build is the build that 's needed when someone commits to the mainline .
The commit build is the one that has to be done quickly , as a result it will take a number of shortcuts that will reduce the ability to detect bugs .
The trick is to balance the needs of bug finding and speed so that a good commit build is stable enough for other people to work on .
Continuous Delivery
The definitive book on Continuous Delivery , which outlines the practices needed to bring code into production rapidly and safely .
The key aspects are collaboration between everyone involved in the release process and automating as many aspects of that process as you can .
The book goes through the foundations of configuration management , automated testing , and continuous integration - on which it shows how to build deployment pipelines to take integrated , tested code live .
The book details the delivery ecosystem , managing infrastructure , environments and data .
Once the commit build is good then other people can work on the code with confidence .
However there are further , slower , tests that you can start to do .
Additional machines can run further testing routines on the build that take longer to do .
A simple example of this is a two stage deployment pipeline .
The first stage would do the compilation and run tests that are more localized unit tests with the database completely stubbed out .
Such tests can run very fast , keeping within the ten minute guideline .
However any bugs that involve larger scale interactions , particularly those involving the real database , wo n't be found .
The second stage build runs a different suite of tests that do hit the real database and involve more end - to - end behavior .
This suite might take a couple of hours to run .
In this scenario people use the first stage as the commit build and use this as their main CI cycle .
The second - stage build runs when it can , picking up the executable from the latest good commit build for further testing .
If this secondary build fails , then this may not have the same ' stop everything ' quality , but the team does aim to fix such bugs as rapidly as possible , while keeping the commit build running .
As in this example , later builds are often pure tests since these days it 's usually tests that cause the slowness .
If the secondary build detects a bug , that 's a sign that the commit build could do with another test .
As much as possible you want to ensure that any later - stage failure leads to new tests in the commit build that would have caught the bug , so the bug stays fixed in the commit build .
This way the commit tests are strengthened whenever something gets past them .
There are cases where there 's no way to build a fast - running test that exposes the bug , so you may decide to only test for that condition in the secondary build .
Most of time , fortunately , you can add suitable tests to the commit build .
This example is of a two - stage pipeline , but the basic principle can be extended to any number of later stages .
The builds after the commit build can also be done in parallel , so if you have two hours of secondary tests you can improve responsiveness by having two machines that run half the tests each .
By using parallel secondary builds like this you can introduce all sorts of further automated testing , including performance testing , into the regular build process .
Test in a Clone of the Production Environment
The point of testing is to flush out , under controlled conditions , any problem that the system will have in production .
A significant part of this is the environment within which the production system will run .
If you test in a different environment , every difference results in a risk that what happens under test wo n't happen in production .
As a result you want to set up your test environment to be as exact a mimic of your production environment as possible .
Use the same database software , with the same versions , use the same version of operating system .
Put all the appropriate libraries that are in the production environment into the test environment , even if the system does n't actually use them .
Use the same IP addresses and ports , run it on the same hardware .
Well , in reality there are limits .
If you 're writing desktop software it's not practicable to test in a clone of every possible desktop with all the third party software that different people are running .
Similarly some production environments may be prohibitively expensive to duplicate ( although I 've often come across false economies by not duplicating moderately expensive environments ) .
Despite these limits your goal should still be to duplicate the production environment as much as you can , and to understand the risks you are accepting for every difference between test and production .
If you have a pretty simple setup without many awkward communications , you may be able to run your commit build in a mimicked environment .
Often , however , you need to use test doubles because systems respond slowly or intermittently .
As a result it 's common to have a very artificial environment for the commit tests for speed , and use a production clone for secondary testing .
I 've noticed a growing interest in using virtualization to make it easy to put together test environments .
Virtualized machines can be saved with all the necessary elements baked into the virtualization .
It 's then relatively straightforward to install the latest build and run tests .
Furthermore this can allow you to run multiple tests on one machine , or simulate multiple machines in a network on a single machine .
As the performance penalty of virtualization decreases , this option makes more and more sense .
Make it Easy for Anyone to Get the Latest Executable
One of the most difficult parts of software development is making sure that you build the right software .
We 've found that it 's very hard to specify what you want in advance and be correct ; people find it much easier to see something that 's not quite right and say how it needs to be changed .
Agile development processes explicitly expect and take advantage of this part of human behavior .
To help make this work , anyone involved with a software project should be able to get the latest executable and be able to run it : for demonstrations , exploratory testing , or just to see what changed this week .
Doing this is pretty straightforward : make sure there 's a well known place where people can find the latest executable .
It may be useful to put several executables in such a store .
For the very latest you should put the latest executable to pass the commit tests - such an executable should be pretty stable providing the commit suite is reasonably strong .
If you are following a process with well defined iterations , it 's usually wise to also put the end of iteration builds there too .
Demonstrations , in particular , need software whose features are familiar , so then it 's usually worth sacrificing the very latest for something that the demonstrator knows how to operate .
Everyone can see what 's happening Continuous Integration is all about communication , so you want to ensure that everyone can easily see the state of the system and the changes that have been made to it .
One of the most important things to communicate is the state of the mainline build .
If you 're using Cruise there 's a built in web site that will show you if there 's a build in progress and what was the state of the last mainline build .
Many teams like to make this even more apparent by hooking up a continuous display to the build system - lights that glow green when the build works , or red if it fails are popular .
A particularly common touch is red and green lava lamps - not just do these indicate the state of the build , but also how long it 's been in that state .
Bubbles on a red lamp indicate the build 's been broken for too long .
Each team makes its own choices on these build sensors - it 's good to be playful with your choice ( recently I saw someone experimenting with a dancing rabbit .
)
If you 're using a manual CI process , this visibility is still essential .
The monitor of the physical build machine can show the status of the mainline build .
Often you have a build token to put on the desk of whoever 's currently doing the build ( again something silly like a rubber chicken is a good choice ) .
Often people like to make a simple noise on good builds , like ringing a bell .
CI servers ' web pages can carry more information than this , of course .
Cruise provides an indication not just of who is building , but what changes they made .
Cruise also provides a history of changes , allowing team members to get a good sense of recent activity on the project .
I know team leads who like to use this to get a sense of what people have been doing and keep a sense of the changes to the system .
Another advantage of using a web site is that those that are not co-located can get a sense of the project 's status .
In general I prefer to have everyone actively working on a project sitting together , but often there are peripheral people who like to keep an eye on things .
It 's also useful for groups to aggregate together build information from multiple projects - providing a simple and automated status of different projects .
Good information displays are not only those on a computer screens .
One of my favorite displays was for a project that was getting into CI .
It had a long history of being unable to make stable builds .
We put a calendar on the wall that showed a full year with a small square for each day .
Every day the QA group would put a green sticker on the day if they had received one stable build that passed the commit tests , otherwise a red square .
Over time the calendar revealed the state of the build process showing a steady improvement until green squares were so common that the calendar disappeared - its purpose fulfilled .
The Dialectic of Post - Traumatic Investment Scenarios
Outside observers : groups that set standards for nonprofit performance .
This survey examines about a dozen published standards to evaluate nonprofits .
It 's the first time all these standards have been brought together for easy reference and comparison .
You will be surprised by the types of concerns reflected in these standards .
How outsiders see nonprofits is different than how they see themselves .
Imagine sitting in your favorite Japanese restaurant before a plate of sushi , chopsticks poised .
You take in its fragrance and the beautiful cut of the fish , the shapely rice and nori rolls .
Those delectable smells and sights tell your brain that the meal will be enjoyable , and the brain responds by pushing your salivary glands into high gear and ordering your stomach to secrete more gastric juices .
Result : you get more nutritional bang for your buck than you would , say , faced with a platter of lutefisk .
In that case , your brain might send fewer messages to your mouth and stomach , causing the food to be less thoroughly digested and metabolized .
Does this mean we should be reaching for the Krispy Kremes and forgoing the raw cauliflower ?
No .
The food has to have nutritive value in the first place .
But maybe we could take a lesson from the French , whose level of heart disease is lower than ours despite their richer diet .
The French savor the taste and texture of food and the experience of eating ; we tend to eat dutifully ( how much cauliflower can you choke down ? ) , on the run ( hardly realizing what we 're eating ) , or rebelliously ( devouring a whole box of Entenmann 's because we feel deprived ) .
In fact , we 're hard - wired to enjoy food ; it 's a survival mechanism .
Volunteers in the 1946 University of Minnesota Starvation Study , who spent six months at half rations , developed a slew of peculiar rituals around eating .
They devoted hours to meals that might normally take a few minutes , cutting a slice of bread into tiny bits with a knife and fork , arranging the bits on the plate , chewing each mouthful 200 times -- all behaviors engineered to prolong both the act of eating and the enjoyment of the limited food available .
The health writer Lawrence Lindner tells of a committee that gathered to hammer out the wording of the United States Dietary Guidelines in 1995 .
One committee member suggested that the first guideline read " Enjoy a variety of foods " -- language that was rejected as " too hedonistic . "
( In the end , Mr. Lindner wrote , the committee " opted for the apparently less giddy ' Eat a variety of foods . ' " )
So let 's vow to enjoy our food , not wolf it down in the car with a heaping order of guilt .
Call it Slow Food , conscious eating , or eating the French way , the point 's the same : eating well and with pleasure is more than hedonism -- it 's good nutritional policy and practice .
Bon appétit !
Charles Knight at Read / Write Web has an interesting post about the top 100 alternative web search engines .
That 's right , the top 100 ... there are many more that did n't make the list .
I took Mr. Knight 's list plus my own list , mashed them together and categorized the search engines by major area .
Entrepreneurs are trying everything they can think of to beat Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft Live .
Here are some of the approaches and the companies that are trying .
User Interface ( UI ) enhancements attempt to improve the user experience and visual representation .
Companies working in this area include ; Snap , Live.com , and SearchMash .
Another , Quintura , presents search results in a " visual cloud " that clusters results by meaning and intent .
AskVox and Ms. Dewey use talking females to coach you through your search .
Technology advancements include ; Hakia , Powerset , Lexxe , Mindset , Surfwax , Swoogle , which search based on meaning or intent .
I have seen the Powerset demo , and if the model can scale to handle billions of documents on the web , Powerset has a good shot at breaking out and becoming a star .
Cluster Search - Vivisimo and Ask.com present results in clusters that allow you to refine or expand your search .
Also see ; Clusty , Kartoo , Mnemomap , Mooter , Webbrain , and Wisenut .
Social / Personalized Search - Findory , Jookster , Swicki , Collarity , and Rollyo do personalized or social search that present results based on your personal preferences or circle of friends .
There are also a bunch of companies doing " tag " or " voting " based search ... companies like Technorati , Digg , TailRank , and others .
Mobile search engines include ; AskMobile , Boing , Google Mobile , Windows Live Mobile , Yahoo Mobile
Shopping Search - Like , Slifter , TheFind
Visual or Video Search - Blinkx , Clipblast , Ditto , Exalead , Girafa , Pagebull , Retrievr , Riya
Continuous search engines store your search terms and update you whenever something new fits your search .
Examples are ; Allth.at , Swamii and Searchbots .
Meta search engines submit your query to multiple search engines and present all the results on one screen .
This has got to be the most over done , and marginal category in search .
Examples include ; Dogpile , CrossEngine , Gnosh , GoshMe , GoYams , Grokker , Ixquick , Mamma , Mrquery , PlanetSearch , PolyMeta , Pronto , Srchr , TurboScout , Whonu , and ZapMeta .
Vertical market segment search has lots of players in each category ;
Jobs : SimplyHired.com Indeed.com , Bixee.com ( India ) , Eluta.ca ( Canada ) , Recruit.net ( Hong Kong )
Travel : Sidestep.com , Kayak.com , Mobissimo.com
Health : Amniota.com , CloserLookSearch.com , GenieKnows.com , Healia.com , Healthline.com , Kosmix.com , MammaHealth.com , Google Health
Classifieds : Edgeio.com , Oodle.com
Blogs : IceRocket , Technorati , Bloglines , Blogger Search , Sphere , Feedster , Rollyo
Source Code : Koders.com , Krugle , Google Code
Venture Capitalists , over the past 5 years , have poured billions of dollars into search engine startups hoping to hatch the next Google .
There are probably more than 200 search engines today , trying all sorts of different approaches to search .
Still , nothing beats the traditional big three of Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft Live .

Do n’t focus on how you think your new idea can help them be better .
Instead , focus on whether they have an urgent problem that your new idea can fix .

This is the first part of “ What I ’ve Learned From Sales . ”
In this part , “ Do n’t Feed the Trolls , ” I present my explanation for why people act like “ trolls , ” raising objection after objection to new ideas , and I suggest how to side - step this behaviour and deal directly with their concerns .
( Part II , Wanna Bet ? , describes how to handle one very common form of objection .
Part III , How to use a blunt instrument to sharpen your saw , describes the mind - set that there are opportunities for improvement to be found everywhere . )
“ Oh no , ” you must be thinking , “ another Guy Kawasaki wanna - be trying to tell me how to sell things . ”
Well , yes to the wanna - be accusation , but no to the proposition that this is a general - purpose article about sales .
I am not going to pretend to tell you how to promote your business , turn your product idea into a money - maker , or even how to sell yourself to an employer .
What I am going to share with you is some experience I have had with sales that strongly parallels my experience discussing new ideas with people .
( I know , reasoning by analogy is often faulty .
But it ’s what we humans do , we ’re pattern - matching machines . )
If you find that people seem unreasonably resistant to good ideas like more powerful programming languages putting people before process , or valuing working code above documents , you may find this helpful .
Our model here is that the mental process of considering a new idea is the same as the mental process behind buying something .
If you are discussing a new idea with someone — even if you are n’t actively trying to “ sell ” it to them — they are still going through the buying process .
And if they have trouble accepting the idea , they will resist , or in sales jargon , they will “ raise objections .
” Do you think this is specific to sales ?
No , when we see new ideas like the Ruby programming language , we encounter objection after objection .
Some are ironic : Some Java enthusiast objects to Ruby on performance grounds : perhaps they are too young to remember when the C/C++ folks objected to Java on performance grounds ?
Or perhaps it will be the IDE support objection , or the Not Invented By Microsoft ( a/k/ a Not a Corporate Standard ) objection , or any of a million others that are not completely unreasonable , but are also usually irrelevant .
On the face of it , an objection is an expression of a discrepancy between your idea and what someone wants .
So if they say “ Lisp has too many parentheses , ” you might think that they are saying “ I would use Lisp if it did n’t have so many parentheses .
” The great secret we can learn from sales is that this is not true .
As we will see below , people say what they think other people want them to say .
So someone might be thinking “ Lisp is too hard for me , all this talk ofandand closures and tail recursion is confusing . ”
But they are embarrassed to admit this , so they seize on something that sounds more reasonable , like “ the syntax is weird .
” We need to understand this , because the absolute worst thing you can do with an objection is answer it directly .
If someone is really thinking “ Lisp is too hard , ” what good does it do to try to persuade them that parentheses are their friends ?
They do n’t really care .
Worse , if you trot out the benefits of homiconicity and its applications to macros and introspection and meta - circularity , you ’re actually making Lisp sound harder , not easier .
Let me give you an example from my own experience in sales .
At one time I was a Macintosh salesperson .
I used to sell Mac SEs and Mac IIs in “ The Dark Times ” after Steve Jobs was expelled from Apple by the vile and treacherous Prince John … but I digress .
I was a Macintosh salesperson at a time much like this time : nineteen out of twenty computer sales were PCs .
You would think that selling Macintoshes would be a lonely existence .
But no , the phone would ring regularly and customers would visit the office on a daily basis , always with the same question , Why should I buy a Macintosh instead of a PC ?
And at first , I would answer this question .
Macintoshes were superior to PCs in every way .
( Actually , this was technically very true at that time .
Why , you could run as many as six monitors on a Macintosh II !
But I am digressing from my digression . ) I learned a funny thing about answering people ’s questions .
I would answer their questions , and they would argue with me .
I would say that you could run multiple monitors on a Macintosh II , making yourself more productive .
And they would say “ but I do n’t need to be that productive , so that does n’t count . ”
Or I would say that the mouse and windowing interface is easier to use , you can learn to use more programs .
And they would say “ but all I need is a word processor and a spreadsheet , so I do n’t need to learn new programs .
” ( Why would they do that ?
It was so that if someone asked them , “ did you shop around and make an intelligent decision ? , ” they could reply , “ why yes , I shopped around , I checked out Macs and PCs , I did a lot of research , and surprise surprise , I ended up with the exact same thing that my neighbour Bob has , except mine is running at 12 Mhz and poor Bob is stuck with 10 Mhz . ”
It may sound to you like they are doing an awful lot of work just to be able to say that one thing with a straight face , but I can tell you that there is this multi-billion dollar automobile industry that works on this principle : people want to be a little better than their neighbour , but not so much better that they are different than their neighbour . ) I can give you many more examples , but the interesting thing is not whether people wanted this stuff or not , but no matter how convincingly I answered their question , they would just ask another one .
Their questions had nothing to do with how they were making up their mind .
I learned very quickly that what people think often bears no relationship to how they behave .
People usually say the things that they think other people expect them to say , but they go ahead and do whatever it is they always wanted to do .
In the case of buying computers , my observation is that most people want to buy whatever it is that most people are buying .
They want to belong , to fit in .
So they are going to buy a PC .
Or an iPod .
So what was really on their mind was fitting in , even though they argued about the Macintosh ’s technical merits .
The lesson I learned is that before we can introduce a new idea to someone , we first need to understand what is really on their mind .
Salespeople call this “ uncovering the hidden objection ” .
They have all these elaborate techniques for figuring out what ’s really on a prospect ’s mind when they encounter resistance to the sales pitch .
I ’m not going to suggest we do that .
Instead , I ’m going to suggest we avoid the objections in the first place by “ qualifying . ” Many people say the most important step is “ closing , ” the art of getting the prospect to hand over the money , the end of the sale .
If you judge by the behaviour of people selling time shares , fitness club memberships , and automobiles , this is the only thing salespeople work on : haranguing prospects and ‘ overcoming objections ’ by arguing .
Experienced and successful salespeople follow a different path .
Experienced salespeople believe that the most important step is qualifying , the art of discovering whether a prospect has an actual need for the product , the beginning of the sale .
Salespeople who are strong qualifiers spend almost no effort on closing because they are always working with prospects who want to buy .
On the other hand , if you do not discover their real problem , you extol virtues that have no attraction for them and neglect to address any perceived issues in their mind .
The principle at work is that if you know what someone really needs , you address their needs from the very beginning .
When you arrive at the conclusion , you have already addressed any questions they may have .
This is true for sales .
It is also true for new ideas .
If someone fears that an idea like learning Lisp ( or meta - programming , or designing a program in the technical interview ) would be too difficult for them , you will only be successful if you first explain how easily they will learn the new idea , and only then explain how wonderful the idea is .
Although there are various models for understanding people ’s motivations — such as Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs , or the Greed - Belonging - Exclusivity - Fear Quartet — for development tools and methodologies my experience is that the simplest model fits best : people are motivated to : if you can identify a problem they think they have , you can show them how to solve it .
People without problems are not good prospects for lightweight development methodologies , new development tools , programming languages , or any other “ change for the better . ”
Just the other day I was lunching with Dmitri from Opalis .
We were talking about a development tool I am trying to build , and Dmitri was suggesting that it was a “ vitamin ” and not an “ aspirin ” I was taken aback .
Is n’t improving software development important for everyone ?
Then I remembered my sales training and asked him about how things were going at Opalis .
Dmitri admitted that his team was performing well and that he had built a lot of trust with his organization .
So he did n’t have a problem .
Quite simply , if someone does n’t have a headache , you cannot establish the value of an aspirin for them .
Now , even Dmitri ’s team has room for improvement , so it is not correct to say that there is no value in improved methodologies , tools , languages , or anything else for him .
However , such things may not be a priority right now .
This is exactly the same case as trying to sell a Macintosh to Bob ’s neighbour : I believed that absolutely everyone could have benefited from owning a Macintosh .
However , Bob ’s neighbour did n’t think he had a usability problem , he thought he had an urgent “ keeping up with Bob ” problem .
And there ’s the key :
Do n’t focus on how you think your new idea can help them be better .
Instead , focus on whether they have an urgent problem that your new idea can fix .
Discovering their priorities should n’t difficult .
Why do n’t we simply ask them ?
Well , there ’s a trick to asking someone about their priorities .
Remember , they will tell you what they think other people want to hear , not what they are thinking .
Here ’s an example concerning agile development : : “ What ’re your priorities for the development team in the next 60 - 90 days ? ” : “ I have a total commitment to process improvement and faster response to business initiatives , ” …… CMM Level Four — or , God willing , Level Five — will get me a higher profile and a shot at the CIO position .
I need some consultants in here to start imposing some bondage and discipline over our development processes .
The trick is to get specific and objective .
Never take objections as evidence of their real needs , and never accept vague feel - good values at face value .
Top salespeople do n’t .
Try calling a busy estate agent and saying you ’d like to buy a house .
I guarantee that the agent will ask you , “ when do you need to buy a new house ? ”
And so it is with new ideas :
You cannot position lightweight development , tools , languages , or any other type of change without being able to fit them into the specific and objective problems someone is trying to solve .
You need to relentlessly pursue the immediate , urgent priority : : “ I ’ve heard that Agile stuff is crap — it only works for star programmers who would be good no matter how you manage them . ” :
“ Well , there ’re a lot of opinions out there .
Tell me , what would you say is the most pressing issue facing your development team right now ? ” : “ Well , we have hacked together some great stuff , but we need to scale , and to scale without imploding we ’ll need some discipline , some real management of the development team .
That ’s why we need a real methodology . ” : “ I can understand the importance of scaling up .
So , have you set some specific objectives for scaling up over the next month or two ? ” : “ For the next couple of months ?
Oh , it ’s all about recruiting , definitely recruiting .
I need another two or three top people to work on a new project that could be worth millions .
We ’ve identified some good candidates , but it ’s very difficult to get them to accept an offer from a start up . ” :
“ You know , we really ought to consider whether using Agile might help you recruit — have you considered the possibility that some star candidates might be looking for an environment that is more Agile than the one they are leaving ? ” : “ Hmmm … ” As you can tell , once you have a specific problem with specific dates attached to when the problem needs to be resolved , you can discuss a specific solution .
You ’ve side - stepped the useless “ objections . ”
One more time : do not accept vague objectives , get specific objectives with near - term dates attached to them .
If someone really does n’t have any applicable near - term objective , you will not be able to introduce a new idea to them .
So do n’t be surprised if they express very little interest .
But when you have an immediate , specific objective in hand , you can position the idea as a solution to their problem .
And that works for almost any idea .
Say you had a new programming language designed for set - top boxes .
But it turns out nobody has a “ programming set top boxes ” problem .
So they raise objections about the speed of your virtual machine , or the fact that programmers cannot manage memory in your language , so they cannot squeeze programs into very small spaces .
Should you keep pounding away at that ?
Or go looking for an immediate problem people have , like building web applications ?
If you side - step their objections — like memory management — and get to the root of their immediate needs , you might be able to introduce a new popular programming language .
Good luck !

While in public Mr. Rove showed little evidence of concern about his plight , lawyers in the case said that Mr. Luskin was waging a fierce battle behind the scenes to stave off the prosecution .
The lawyers said the prosecutor seemed at times to be at the brink of bringing charges against Mr. Rove over his failure to volunteer early in the inquiry a conversation about Ms. Wilson with the Time magazine reporter , Matt Cooper .
Mr. Rove had testified that he had initially forgotten about that conversation , and that his memory had only been jogged after his lawyers found an e-mail from Mr. Rove to Stephen J. Hadley , then the deputy national security adviser — now the chief security adviser — referring to a conversation with Mr. Cooper .
Mr. Rove had essentially argued that it would have been legal suicide to knowingly lie to a grand jury about a conversation with a reporter .
That argument seems to have been crucial in staving off an indictment .
Mr. Fitzgerald , according to several lawyers in the case , believed — at least initially — that Mr. Rove 's effort to find the e-mail meant that he must have already known of its existence .
But Mr. Luskin offered an alternative account , at one point switching from his role as a lawyer , offering himself as a witness .
Last fall , Mr. Luskin provided a sworn deposition to Mr. Fitzgerald saying that had been told by Viveca Novak , a friend at Time magazine who is not related to the columnist Robert Novak , that Mr. Rove may have talked to Mr. Cooper .
That provided Mr. Luskin with a reason to search for any record of such a conversation .
Mr. Rove himself was said by associates to be ebullient today .
Mr. Rove declined comment , but the White House did tip photographers that he would be walking from the White House to the Old Executive Office Building , providing imagery of Mr. Rove , all smiles ..
The leak investigation , several associates said , had been a heavy burden for him and his wife and son , whose home was frequently visited by scrums of reporters and cameramen on indictment watches .
Officials said Mr. Rove had remained focused on his work throughout , but he was also said to have often seemed less jovial , and less inclined to engage in his usual practical jokes .
Associates said Mr. Rove had seemed to loosen up some in recent weeks , apparently as he and his lawyer grew more confident that no indictment would come — even as the liberal blogosphere and some commentators predicted an imminent indictment , based in part on a recent report on Truthout.org .

Gov. James Douglas , acting as Middlebury ’s moderator , tried to stop a vote on a resolution calling for President Bush ’s impeachment and withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the town ’s annual meeting Monday night , according to several residents who attended .
Douglas argued that the two resolutions , which were brought up under the “ new business ” portion of Middlebury ’s town meeting , were not warned and therefore only a discussion , but not a vote , could occur , according to witnesses .

White House Seeks Gonzales Replacements
President Bush this morning telephoned Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , one of the few remaining Texans who came to Washington for Bush 's first term , to try to buck up his friend after word leaked that GOP officials operating at the behest of the White House have begun seeking a possible successor .
The president called Gonzales from the Oval Office at about 7:15 a.m .
" They had a good conversation about the status of the U.S. attorney issue , " deputy White House press secretary Dana Perino said .
" The president also reaffirmed his strong backing and support for the attorney general . "

A Republican source said Tuesday that Bush is " unmoved " and that Gonzales will not be pushed or fired , but instead will depart if he concludes he has lost his effectiveness because of the furor over the firing of eight U.S. attorneys .
At the same time , the president will be prepared if Gonzales steps aside .
Republicans close to the White House continued to discuss potential replacements , including John Danforth , an Episcopal minister and former Republican senator from Missouri .
" I think it is going to come down to who is willing to take the job , " said an official close to the process .
Among the names floated Monday by administration officials were Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and White House anti-terrorism coordinator Frances Townsend .
Former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson is a White House prospect .
So is former solicitor general Theodore B. Olson , but sources were unsure whether he would want the job .
On Monday night , Republican officials said two other figures who are being seriously considered are Securities and Exchange Committee Chairman Chris Cox , who is former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and is popular with conservatives ; and former Attorney General William P. Barr , who served under President George H.W. Bush from 1991 to 1993 and is now general counsel of Verizon Communications .
Perino Tuesday denied that the White House is searching for possible successors to Gonzales .
" Those rumors are untrue , " she said .
Republican sources also disclosed that it is now a virtual certainty that Deputy Attorney General Paul J. McNulty , whose incomplete and inaccurate congressional testimony about the prosecutors helped precipitate the crisis , will also resign shortly .
Officials were debating whether Gonzales and McNulty should depart at the same time or whether McNulty should go a day or two after Gonzales .
Still known as " The Judge " for his service on the Texas Supreme Court .
In a sign of Republican despair , GOP political strategists on Capitol Hill said that it is too late for Gonzales ' departure to head off a full - scale Democratic investigation into the motives and timing behind the firing of eight U.S. attorneys .
" Democrats smell blood in the water , and ( Gonzales ' ) resignation wo n't stop them , " said a well - connected Republican Senate aide .
" And on our side , no one 's going to defend him .
All we can do is warn Democrats against overreaching . "
A main reason Gonzales is finding few friends even among Republicans is that he has long been regarded with suspicion by conservatives who have questioned his ideological purity .
In the past , these conservatives warned the White House against nominating him for the Supreme Court .
Now they 're using the controversy over the firing of eight federal prosecutors to take out their pent - up frustrations with how he has handled his leadership at Justice and how the White House has treated Congress .
Complaints range from his handling of immigration cases to his alleged ceding of power in the department to career officials instead of movement conservatives .
Without embracing Gonzales , Republicans pointed out that presidents are free to replace U.S. attorneys at will .
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) noted on MSNBC that some of those who were replaced " have n't whined or complained about it " and added , " I think that there 's a lot of politics , but I do n't think it 's just on one side . "
But officials on Capitol Hill said that after the Justice Department failed to turn over a batch of e-mails about the prosecutors on Friday as expected , Republican senators became less likely to defend Gonzales or the White House .
They feared the delay signaled more damaging information was in the pipeline .
" We have a crisis where there does n't need to be one , and now Democrats have an issue where they can open up the subpoena floodgates , " said an exasperated Republican aide .
" Once these investigations start , there always ends up being a lot of messy collateral damage . "
Now the White House is girding for a confirmation battle at the same time it is coping with Democrats ' threats to subpoena aides to Bush , including senior adviser Karl Rove .
Among the contenders to replace Gonzales , Chertoff is a former U.S. circuit judge for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals , based in Philadelphia .
Before that , he was confirmed by the Senate in 2003 as assistant attorney general for the criminal division .
Under this scenario , Chertoff 's successor at the Department of Homeland Security might be Townsend , who now works in the White House as assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism .
Townsend held senior Justice Department posts under Attorney General Janet Reno during the Clinton administration and is also a potential nominee for attorney general .
Republican sources said other widely respected Republican lawyers have been considered for attorney general , although some of them may not be interested in taking the job .
These names include :
-- Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee , the " Law & Order " star who is now considering seeking the Republican presidential nomination .
-- Olson , who was Bush 's first solicitor general and now is a partner at Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher in Washington .
-- Larry Thompson , who has been general counsel of PepsiCo Inc. since leaving his first - term job as deputy to Attorney General John Ashcroft .
-- Senior status federal judge Laurence H. Silberman , who was named by Bush to be co-chairman of the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction .
-- George J. Terwilliger III , a former deputy attorney general and acting attorney general who was a leader of Bush 's legal team during the Florida election recount .
Asked if Gonzales will stay , White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said Monday : " We hope so .
He has the confidence of the president . "
But Snow also revealed that the president had not talked to Gonzales since a conversation the two had when Bush was in Mexico last week .

The tragic irony of the 21st century is that just as faith in technology collapsed on the world 's stock markets in 2000 , it came to power in the White House and Pentagon .
For the Project for a New American Century 's ambition of " full - spectrum dominance " - in which its country could " fight and win multiple , simultaneous major - theatre wars " - was a monster borne up by the high tide of techno euphoria of the 1990s .
Ex-hippies talked of a wired age of Aquarius .
The fall of the Berlin wall and the rise of the internet , we were told , had ushered in Adam Smith 's dream of overflowing abundance , expanding liberty and perpetual peace .
Fukuyama speculated that history was over , leaving us just to hoard and spend .
Technology meant a new paradigm of constant growth without inflation or recession .
But darker dreams surfaced in America 's military universities .
The theorists of the " revolution in military affairs " predicted that technology would lead to easy and perpetual US dominance of the world .
Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters advised on " future warfare " at the Army War College - prophesying in 1997 a coming " age of constant conflict " .
Thomas Barnett at the Naval War College assisted Vice - Admiral Cebrowski in developing " network - centric warfare " .
General John Jumper of the air force predicted a planet easily mastered from air and space .
American forces would win everywhere because they enjoyed what was unashamedly called the " God 's - eye " view of satellites and GPS : the " global information grid " .
This hegemony would be welcomed as the cutting edge of human progress .
Or at worst , the military geeks candidly explained , US power would simply terrify others into submitting to the stars and stripes .
Shock and Awe : Achieving Rapid Dominance - a key strategic document published in 1996 - aimed to understand how to destroy the " will to resist before , during and after battle " .
For Harlan Ullman of the National Defence University , its main author , the perfect example was the atom bomb at Hiroshima .
But with or without such a weapon , one could create an illusion of unending strength and ruthlessness .
Or one could deprive an enemy of the ability to communicate , observe and interact - a macro version of the sensory deprivation used on individuals - so as to create a " feeling of impotence " .
And one must always inflict brutal reprisals against those who resist .
An alternative was the " decay and default " model , whereby a nation 's will to resist collapsed through the " imposition of social breakdown " .
All of this came to be applied in Iraq in 2003 , and not merely in the March bombardment called " shock and awe " .
It has been usual to explain the chaos and looting in Baghdad , the destruction of infrastructure , ministries , museums and the national library and archives , as caused by a failure of Rumsfeld 's planning .
But the evidence is this was at least in part a mask for the destruction of the collective memory and modern state of a key Arab nation , and the manufacture of disorder to create a hunger for the occupier 's supervision .
As the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported in May 2003 , US troops broke the locks of museums , ministries and universities and told looters : " Go in Ali Baba , it 's all yours ! "
For the American imperial strategists invested deeply in the belief that through spreading terror they could take power .
Neoconservatives such as Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle and the recently indicted Lewis " Scooter " Libby , learned from Leo Strauss that a strong and wise minority of humans had to rule over the weak majority through deception and fear , rather than persuasion or compromise .
They read Le Bon and Freud on the relationship of crowds to authority .
But most of all they loved Hobbes 's Leviathan .
While Hobbes saw authority as free men's chosen solution to the imperfections of anarchy , his 21st century heirs seek to create the fear that led to submission .
And technology would make it possible and beautiful .
On the logo of the Pentagon 's Information Awareness Office , the motto is Scientia est potentia - knowledge is power .
The IAO promised " total information awareness " , an all - seeing eye spilling out a death - ray gaze over Eurasia .
Congressional pressure led the IAO to close , but technospeak , half - digested political theory and megalomania still riddle US thinking .
Barnett , in The Pentagon 's New Map and Blueprint for Action , calls for a " systems administrator " force to be dispatched with the military , to " process " conquered countries .
The G8 and a few others are the " Kantian core " , writes Barnett , warming over the former Blair adviser Robert Cooper 's poisonous guff from 2002 ; their job is to export their economy and politics by force to the unlucky " Hobbesian gap " .
Imperialism is imagined as an industrial technique to remake societies and cultures , with technology giving sanction to those who intervene .
The Afghanistan war of 2001 taught the wrong lessons .
The US assumed this was the model of how a small , special forces - dominated campaign , using local proxies and calling in gunships or airstrikes , would sweep away opposition .
But all Afghanistan showed was how an outside power could intervene in a finely balanced civil war .
The one - eyed Mullah Omar 's great escape on his motorbike was a warning that the God 's - eye view can miss the human detail .
The problem for the US today is that Leviathan has shot his wad .
Iraq revealed the hubris of the imperial geostrategy .
One small nation can tie down a superpower .
Air and space supremacy do not give command on the ground .
People can't be terrorised into identification with America .
The US has proved able to destroy massively - but not create , or even control .
Afghanistan and Iraq lie in ruins , yet the occupiers cower behind concrete mountains .
The spin machine is on full tilt to represent Iraq as a success .
Peters , in New Glory : Expanding America 's Supremacy , asserts : " Our country is a force for good without precedent " ; and Barnett , in Blueprint , says : " The US military is a force for global good that ... has no equal . "
Both offer ambitious plans for how the US is going to remake the third world in its image .
There is a violent hysteria to the boasts .
The narcissism of a decade earlier has given way to an extrovert rage at those who have resisted America 's will since 2001 .
Both urge utter ruthlessness in crushing resistance .
In November 2004 , Peters told Fox News that in Falluja " the best outcome , frankly , is if they 're all killed " .
But he directs his real fury at France and Germany : " A haggard Circe , Europe dulled our senses and fooled us into believing in her attractions .
But the dugs are dry in Germany and France .
They deluded us into prolonging the affair long after our attentions should have turned to ... India , South Africa , Brazil . "
While a good Kleinian therapist may be able to help Peters work through his weaning trauma , only America can cure its post 9/11 mixture of paranoia and megalomania .
But Britain - and other allied states - can help .
The US needs to discover , like a child that does not know its limits , that there is a world outside its body and desires , beyond even the reach of its toys , that suffers too .

A team of highly creative Volkswagen designers based in California have unveiled their own unique take on the future of modern transportation .
The result is the Volkswagen Nanospyder .
Futuristic nanotechnology supported by hydrogen fuel cells , solar power , wheel - mounted electric motors and inflatable organic body panels combine to form the unusual shape of the two - seater concept .
Nanospyder is the work of a team of three young designers – Patrick Faulwetter , Daniel Simon and Ian Hilton - based at the Volkswagen Design Center in Santa Monica .
They created the Nanospyder in response to a challenge laid down by ‘ Design Los Angeles ’ , a conference set to take place at the upcoming Los Angeles Motorshow in November .
The brief – unlike the solution – was simple .
To design a vehicle able to make the most of California without harming the environment .
The team met its brief by thinking well beyond current manufacturing techniques .
According to its creators the Nanospyder would be formed out of a latticework of billions of tiny programmable nano devices measuring less than half a millimetre in diameter .
Each of these tiny devices can be programmed to be as strong or weak as required meaning active crumple zones can be created .
The ‘ spine ’ of the vehicle , onto which the rest of the components are attached , remains immensely strong .

Clothing the nano - lattice are panels formed out of a mix of organic materials some of which can inflate to provide further cushioning in the result of an impact .
The material doubles as a power source as polysynthesis generates small amounts of electricity .
This coupled with hydrogen fuels generates power to drive the tiny electric motors mounted within the hubs of all four wheels .
The Nanospyder , although purely intended as a concept vehicle , gives an insight into the depth of thinking going into the search for sustainable forms of modern transport .
The concept was created to be entered in the third Los Angeles Design challenge – the winner of which will be announced on November 30th at the Los Angeles Motorshow .
The Volkswagen studios , established in 1991 , won the very first challenge in 2005 with the innovative Mobile Lounge concept .

I 'm not the most organized person around , but when it comes to my computer I 'm set in my ways of folders within folders within folders .
I 'd bet you 're much the same way .
But a few months back I abandoned my hierarchical folder tree , and now , all my files are dumped into the Documents folder .
It 's ugly , and I do n't really like to look at it .
Ever .
Yet these days I 'm able to locate the files I want faster than ever before .
How is this possible ?
Metadata .
Advertisement
Yes , metadata - information about information - is the answer .
You already know about the Web 2.0 phenomenon called tagging .
We tag our music , photos , blog posts , and everything else , so why not apply the same theories to the files on our hard drive ?
That 's what I 've done .
It took a bit of getting used to , but after some tweaking , I 've seen the light .
Metadata and file tags is the future for me .
Methodology
It 's common in webapps to tag things to the nth degree .
I prefer to control my tag vocabulary .
I despise one - off tags such as blog , blogs , weblog , weblogs - just do n't look at my del.icio.us account - so I 've adopted the approach of using the singular form of words wherever possible .
For instance , ' letter ' , ' project ' , and ' photo ' , but sometimes where the plural is the common term , I 'll use it - such as ' taxes ' .
Advertisement
I use general categories ( as you 've just seen with ' letter ' , ' project ' , and ' photo ' ) but I also apply more specific tags where it suits my needs .
If I 'm working on a large project , I might tag files related to the project with ' projectName ' and ' logo ' so that I can find the logo more easily than if I were to start at a higher level of ' projectName ' .
Ultimately , it 's what works for you .
I 've been tweaking my methodology for a few months now and am still making small changes to suit my working style .
Applications
So how do we tag our files , then ?
You can add comments and keywords to files in Windows XP , but searching on those fields is not easy .
The next version of Windows , Vista , supposedley will have much better file metadata support .
In fact I 've heard - though can't personally confirm - that Vista will have ( in some form ) a metadata entry window , possibly in the save screens of applications .
I 'm not a real Windows fan , but this would be huge !
This image was lost some time after publication , but you can still view it here
OS X has supported metadata for over a year - since 10.4 ( Tiger ) came out - in the form of Spotlight .
At the OS level , there are a couple of ways to add your custom metadata tags .
Advertisement
You can go to the Get Info screen of any file and add a Spotlight Comment - Apple 's dialogue for metadata , or tags .
You can create an Automator
There have been suggestions around the internet that Apple add a Spotlight Comments entry box to their save windows ( possibly in Leopard , 10.5 ? ) .
In the meantime , I 've been told that Default Folder X may be working on a similar implementation for their shareware application .
Right now I use a third option which has proven the fastest and most efficient way to accomplish this task : Quicksilver .
Along with a handful of plugins and tweaks , Quicksilver is the perfect solution for a metadata - centric organizational scheme .

( Quicksilver is a fantastic tool - for the uninitiated - but we could spend weeks going over the setup and use .
If you 'd like to learn more , I 've begun a periodic video tutorial segment on The Apple Blog which should help you get up to speed . )
Advertisement
Workflow
Since OS
X is the only operating system ( that I use regularly ) which works with metadata , and since there are a few options available for tagging files , I 'm going to speak to that .
Advertisement
The biggest thing to get used to with this process is actually tagging all your files !
You just have to make it a routine .
It will feel like an extra step at first , but you 'll pick it up .
Since there is n't yet a way to add tags when you save a file , you 're stuck having to touch the file wherever it resides on our hard drive after creating or downloading it .
To handle this , I save all new files to my Desktop .
This works for me because I keep my desktop clutter - free , so the files are staring me in the face , waiting to be moved ; and I know that any file on my Desktop needs to be tagged .
If I saved the file right to the mess that is now my Documents folder , it would be nearly impossible to remember which files were in need of tagging and which were n't .
Since I know the files on my desktop are untagged , I use Quicksilver ( and a couple plugins ) to grab the file and add my tags to it .
( I can also grab multiple files and tag them all the same to save time . )
The tag is added to the Spotlight Comments portion of the file 's Get Info screen , which is then indexed in Spotlight .
Then a quick move to the Documents folder completes my process .

Finding Stuff
Since Spotlight indexes everything ( text , dates , file names , etc , etc ) the results were n't as precise as I would have liked .
A common practice is to use the syntax , @tagname , but I found that Spotlight did n't narrow the results properly - as if it were ignoring the @ sign .
I did n't want to have to get creative with my tags names because then it would be easier to forget them and the whole system would fail .
I played around a bit and found that prepending tags with an ampersand ( & ) did the trick .
So where ' project ' and ' @project ' would bring up any files that Spotlight had indexed which had the word ' project ' in them , ' &project ' only returns files that I 've tagged as such .
Nice !

Quicksilver does us ten times better with this requirement .
The tagging plugin gives you the option to prepend a symbol or text to a tag .
So any time you add keywords to a file using Quicksilver and the tagging plugin , the symbol or text you 've chosen is automatically stuck to the front of your tags .
Advertisement
This image was lost some time after publication , but you can still view it here
So with this scheme you can use Spotlight and get fairly specific search results .
That 's helpful .
However , using Quicksilver , I can bring up the catalog of tags that have been created ( still part of the one plugin 's capabilities ) and instantly search those through them , choosing to display all the relevant files .
Being that I prefer keyboard to mouse , this is faster for me than using Spotlight , though both are pretty efficient .

Smart Folders
Smart Folders are just like Smart Playlists in iTunes .
You set some parameters based on the stuff you want in each , and it automatically fills them as those parameters are met .
Using Smart Folders may be slightly regressing , but it may also ease you into the whole metadata world from the hierarchies that make you feel so secure .
You can create Smart Folders in OS X that will dynamically fill with files that meet the criteria of your search .
( Use the ' Spotlight Comments ' field available under the OTHER option when selecting from the drop down list . )
Create a few Smart Folders for the tags that you use most often and put those " folders " in a conveniently accessible place .
Advertisement
I can also have the tag of choice - from Quicksilver - open a created - on - the - fly Smart Folder with all the appropriately tagged files .
This then allows me to save that &tagname as a new Smart Folder .
See why I love The App That Begins with ' Q ' and Which I Wo n't Say Its Name Anymore so much ?
This image was lost some time after publication , but you can still view it here

Moving Forward
In the future , I 'd like Smart Folders created for me and on the fly .
Meaning , I 'd like something like a Folder Action which watches my Documents folder every time a new file is moved into it .
When this Action finds that I 've got n or more files with the same tag , a Smart Folder is automatically created for them on my desktop .
Take that a step further , and match n tags on files that have been touched in the past week , and you 've got relevant information brought to your attention without having to manually seek it out .
( Any coders / Apple Scripters out there willing to take a shot at this ??? )
Advertisement
There are a lot of directions to take this now that I 'm immersed in it .
As I 've mentioned , I continue to tweak and evolve my process .
I doubt it 's something that will ever be perfected , but I 'm sure going to keep trying .
Which is Better ?
Once you 're trained to do things the ' metadata way ' , and you 're in a vanilla environment - that is , a basic Spotlight ( and potentially Automator ) type setup in OS X - the speed with which you are able to access your files is probably only slightly better than browsing through a folder hierarchy .
I 'll reiterate my mantra though , " Your mileage may vary ! "
Advertisement
Using Quicksilver on the other hand , the results I 've gotten are impossible to ignore .
I can tag , move , and find my files faster than ever before .
It takes time to implement this new system into your workflow .
I think it took me about 4 - 6 weeks before I got things ironed out to a point where it became effortless in execution and actually useful to me .
Using a metadata filing system as opposed to folders requires a slight shift in the way you think .
It 's not difficult , but it is something you have to work at a bit to truly acquire the habit .
Advertisement
For now , get thinking in a metadata frame of mind , because it 's the future of modern operating systems .
And let me know in the comments if you 're interested in Quicksilver setup specifics - I 'm happy to detail those out , too .
Nick Santilli can be found writing shamelessly about his Quicksilver addiction at The Apple Blog .

The military ’s relationship with the chimps began in the 1950s , when the U.S. Air Force collected more than 100 chimpanzees from Africa .
More than 65 of them were shipped to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico to undergo tests on the effects of space flight .
The chimps were exposed to adverse conditions in order to make space travel possible .
The tests included spinning the chimps in a giant centrifuge , exposing them to powerful G - Forces , and measuring how long it took one of the animals to lose consciousness in a decompression chamber .
Strapped into small capsules , they were spun , jettisoned , and catapulted on track courses .
During those years some of the monkeys were literally used as crash test dummies .
According to some
In 1961 , three months before Alan B. Shepard became the first U.S. astronaut to travel in space , an American chimpanzee named Ham rocketed beyond the earth ’s atmosphere in a Mercury capsule .
Ten months later , another chimp , named Enos , successfully orbited the earth .
But once America made it to space , the chimps were no longer of any use , so the Air Force began leasing its chimp colony to medical laboratories .
Since 1970 , more than a hundred of the chimps were awarded to the Couston Foundation , a toxicology lab in New Mexico that used chimps in AIDS and hepatitis experiments .
The chimps were poked , injected with diseases and operated .
Many lived for several decades in small cages , and most of them became sick and depressed .
Fortunately , Dr. Carole
Noon thought that the captive chimps deserve better and sued the Air Force for custody , with the help of some important primatologists .
After a year - long court battle , Noon gained permanent custody of 21 chimps , survivors of the " chimpanaut " program , and founded “
Since 1997 , the vision of Save the Chimps was - and remains - to create a Sanctuary where rescued chimpanzees can live out their lives without the threat of ever returning to a laboratory .
These chimpanzees , who once had the " right stuff " for the space program , are now free to live out their lives in a more natural , peaceful environment .
However - and that 's for sure - they will never be able to forget the nightmare of those Space years .
Between 1948 and 1970 , upto 32 monkeys were trained and sent to space in order to investigate the biological effects of space travel .
Most of them , litlle rhesus and squirrel monkeys , died of suffocation , collision or a failure of the parachute .
Another group , the monkeys wich never travelled to space , were injured or killed in tests conducted by the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) as part of the Air & Space Research program .
Some of those veterans survived and live today in a Florida Refuge .
This is the story :

Strapped into small capsules , they were spun , jettisoned , and catapulted on track courses .
During those years some of the monkeys were literally used as crash test dummies .
According to some sources , some of the capsules were designed to accelerate to speeds of 400 miles per hour before coming to an abrupt halt .
A sudden stop at such high speeds caused the chimpanzee ’s brain to literally smash against the skull , resulting in massive trauma and death .
In 1961 , three months before Alan B. Shepard became the first U.S. astronaut to travel in space , an American chimpanzee named Ham rocketed beyond the earth ’s atmosphere in a Mercury capsule .
Ten months later , another chimp , named Enos , successfully orbited the earth .

Ir with canon slr 's is easy .
My roomate just got a tiffen IR filter
and by setting the exposure really long and using a tripod he has been getting great shots .
Note : for a really interesting effect take a picture of something green like grass without the IR filter then use the green photo for a custom white balance then shoot your IR , it 's really really odd .

i hope to God that you had all that stuff lying around and that the entire thing took no more than 5 minutes .
Any more time spent on him indicates you are a monster dork .

WASHINGTON -- Gerrymandering was supposed to cement Republican control of the House of Representatives , offering incumbents a wall of re-election protection even as public opinion turned sharply against them .

Adam 's zsh page
zsh is a great UNIX shell .
It has all the benefits of other standard shells , and a hell of a lot more on top .
I 'm interested in the interactive features in particular , because they can save you a lot of time and effort .
OK , here 's some of the really cool stuff .
A few of the other shells have some of these features , although in general zsh does it more comprehensively .
A mind - bogglingly powerful new completion system , complete with out of the box completion heuristics for many standard UNIX commands .
Very little effort is required to utilise this system , which can save hours of typing in the long run .
Globbing -- extremely powerful , basically an easier - to - type replacement for find , e.g. to find all ssh - agent sockets owned by yourself : zsh % ls /tmp/ssh-*/*( =U )
, e.g. to find all ssh - agent sockets owned by yourself : Coloured menu completion ( just bounce on the TAB key until what you want appears )
Multi-line commands editable as a single buffer ( even files ! )
Variable editing ( vared ) -- finally you can easily edit your $ PATH interactively
) -- finally you can easily edit your interactively Command buffer stack -- halfway through typing a complex command on a crappy old terminal and suddenly realise you need to do some other stuff first ?
Just hit M-q ... your command gets pushed onto the stack to be automatically popped off next time you hit enter .
... your command gets pushed onto the stack to be automatically popped off next time you hit enter .
Print text straight into the buffer for immediate editing ( print - z )
)
Inline expansion of variables and history commands
Advanced history handling , included incremental sharing with multiple simultaneous shells
Handling of multiple redirections ( simpler than tee )
Large number of options for tailoring ( see my .zshrc )
Spelling correction
Manipulation of arrays ( including reverse subscripting )
Comprehensive integer and floating point arithmetic
Adaptable messages for : spelling correction , watching of users logging on / off , new mail in multiple mailboxes , time as well as prompt ( including conditional expressions )
Dynamically loadable modules including one providing command - line - based ftp client functionality .
A themeable prompts system full of silly prompts , some pinched from bashprompt and improved , others written from scratch .
There is a screenshot available which demonstrates this system .
To use it , simply install zsh 4 , and then do the following at your prompt : zsh % autoload promptinit zsh % promptinit zsh % prompt -h Please note that you 'll need the relevant X terminal fonts installed so that your X server can get at them .
I 've made up a tarball of the fonts I use and a README which briefly explains how to install the fonts .
Someone else did a similar page before me too .
Countless other improvements .
The zsh FAQ currently mentions some of them .
Versions of zsh
Confused about the various versions of zsh available ?
Here 's a quick summary :
4.0.4
The latest stable release , at the time of writing .
You can always get the latest stable version from zsh 's file area on sourceforge .
net .
SourceForge CVS
The latest development tree is available via CVS from sourceforge .
net .
zsh also has a project home page on this site .
4.1.x - dev-y
The latest official development release branch , at the time of writing .
These are official intermediate development versions compiled by Peter Stephenson ( pws ) from patches selected from zsh - workers and committed to the HEAD branch in CVS .
They are sometimes released once a week , sometimes less often , and are available in the development subdirectory of your local mirror site ; see www.zsh.org to find out which mirror site is nearest to you . )
If you were to put them on a scale , it would be something like this :
4.x.y , x even 4.x.y , x odd intermediate devel CVS at ( e.g. 4.0.2 ) ( e.g. 4.1.0 ) releases ( dev , pws ) sourceforge.

My personal shell configuration files and other useful utilities
Wondering how to get more out of your UNIX shell ?
Have a look at this UNIX shells page I wrote a while ago .
Peter Stephenson has written an excellent , user - friendly user 's guide to zsh which is very helpful for those who really want to get to grips with the power features of zsh .

Yesterday was Thanksgiving in America !
It is a holiday that marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping season .
Canadians and others , here is a serious question for you : Without Thanksgiving in late November , how do stores know when to start putting up Christmas decorations ?
Discuss
RECENTLY , at one of the fast - proliferating conferences devoted to the “ digital home ” , John Burke , an executive at Motorola , a maker of mobile phones and digital gadgets , showed a video that presented his company 's version of this vision .
In the clip , a youngish man wakes up to a rock video that automatically starts playing on a screen next to his bed .
He gets up to have breakfast and the rock video follows him to a screen in the kitchen .
He moves into the living room and up pops the rock video on yet another screen .
When he leaves his flat and gets into his car , the video starts playing on a screen in the steering wheel .
To ordinary humans this sort of thing must seem like silly — or downright frightening — marketing claptrap .
In fact , even Mr Burke 's audience of self - selected technophiles seemed sceptical .
“ Did you notice that the guy was a bachelor , ” said Tim Dowling , the boss of Pure Networks , a software firm in Seattle that helps users to set up and troubleshoot home - computer networks .
“ That alone tells you that they 're out of touch .
I thought : How dumb . ”
Real people do not want to be hounded through their home and their life by some video stream , he argues ; they just want help with basic headaches , such as getting the kids ' laptop , mom 's Apple Macintosh and dad 's Windows machine to share the family 's printer .
Whether or not computer , software , consumer - electronics , telecoms , cable and internet companies are in fact out of touch with consumers may be the biggest question facing these industries today .
That is because the “ digital home ” , a concept and category hugely hyped in executive circles but still rarely heard in discussions among consumers , represents their greatest hope for revenue growth .
Demand from corporate buyers of technology has barely recovered from the dotcom bust and is widely expected to be unimpressive for years .
By contrast , the homes of consumers appear to technology vendors as a barely tamed analogue wilderness .
Darcy Travlos , an analyst at CreditSights , a research firm , estimates the market opportunity of the digital home at $ 250 billion in America alone and $ 1 trillion worldwide in three to seven years .
“ We view the digital home as critically important , ” says Craig Mundie , one of three chief technology officers at Microsoft , the world 's largest software company .
“ The home is much more exciting than the workplace . ”
Computers have already led to small revolutions in boosting productivity in the office and helping people to communicate and to be creative , he says , so “ we 're pretty confident ” that computers will have a similar effect on the way people consume entertainment .
Intel , the world 's largest semiconductor maker , recently reorganised itself into new business divisions including , prominently , one called “ digital home ” .
Last week it formally launched Viiv , a bundle of chips intended for use in digital - home PCs .
Consumer - electronics firms such as Sony , computer - makers such as Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) and Apple , telecoms giants such as Verizon or SBC , cable companies such as Comcast , internet firms such as Yahoo ! , networking - equipment companies such as Cisco — all agree that the digital home is where the action will be and are investing furiously to make sure they have a good chance of playing a leading role .
Their first challenge in stimulating any sort of consumer interest is the difficulty of merely explaining what the digital home is supposed to be .
You might think , for instance , that the term refers to the long - established trend away from analogue and towards digital media .
In music , most people have completed their migration from vinyl records and tapes to digital CDs .
In films , the trend from videotapes to DVDs is not far behind .
In photography , traditional film is fast being replaced by digital cameras and pictures .
TV and radio broadcasters are also shifting to digital transmissions , with Britain leading the way .
Confusingly , however , that is not what vendors mean when they talk about the digital home .
Instead , they invariably mean a home in which all sorts of electronic devices — from the personal computer ( PC ) to the TV set - top box , the stereo , the game console and , in some versions , even the garage door and refrigerator — are connected , both to one another and to the internet .
Hence the Motorola marketing video that Mr Burke was showing .
Its purpose was to illustrate what Motorola , like Microsoft , calls “ seamlessness ” , as digital content hops automatically between various devices and screens .
The excitement , therefore , is not so much about content being digital , but about its delivery switching from physical things ( such as CDs ) to photons ( such as wireless downloads or streaming ) , because this requires consumers to buy new gadgets .
Believers in this future point to encouraging statistics .
Parks Associates , a research firm in Texas that specialises in the digital home ( and which organised the conference at which Mr Burke gave his keynote address ) surveyed a group of internet users and found that 84 % of them use their PCs to store digital photos , 59 % to store music , 36 % for video clips and 26 % for personal videos .
If one includes devices other than PCs — such as TiVo , a popular digital video recorder — 17 % also store movies and TV shows .
In theory , these people could soon avail themselves of new wireless - networking technologies , such as an emerging standard called “ ultrawideband ” , to pipe all this content from their collections to electronic picture frames , screens and portable devices .
Joined - up thinking
That is not at all what they want to do today , however .
Another study by Parks Associates found that 89 % of people with a home - computer network felt that the relatively modest goal of sharing internet access is its most important function , with printer - sharing the second priority .
Worse , 27 % of people who bought network gear said that they ran into problems during configuration , leading many to call the help desk of their internet service provider ( who may or may not be responsible for the problem ) at an estimated annual cost of $ 1.4 billion to that industry .
Even downloading entertainment , as opposed to buying it on discs , appears over - hyped .
According to a study by the OECD , there were over 230 websites offering 1 m tracks in America and Europe at the end of 2004 .
But these online sales accounted for less than 2 % of total music revenues ; even with fast growth , they are projected to rise only by 5 - 10 % by 2008 .
All this points to a huge problem with the digital - home vision : the lack , among most consumers , of any sense of crisis about the status quo in entertainment .
“ We do n't think many folks are looking for an electronic nerve centre in their homes , ” says Pip Coburn , who runs Coburn Ventures , a technology - consulting and investment firm .
After all , popping in a DVD , say , is so easy and works so well .
By contrast , getting a digital home up and running promises several lost weekends of fiddling with manuals and settings , and hefty expenses in new gear .
According to Mr Coburn 's formula for evaluating new technologies , whereby adoption is a function of the users ' sense of crisis ( ie , motivation to change ) outweighing their perceived pain of switching , the digital home ranks as a clear “ loser ” .
This miscalculation — if that is what it is — by the large vendors stems from their history of catering to companies rather than people , says Pure Networks '
Mr Dowling ( who used to be at Intel and who hired some 40 of his 60 employees from Microsoft ) .
During the information - technology boom , the industry sold its wares mostly to chief information officers or chief technology officers with big budgets .
These are customers who tend to be receptive toward buying “ solutions ” rather than products , and often hire consultants such as IBM Global Services to pull together hardware and software from various vendors .
But “ consumers do n't buy as an IT manager does , ” says Mr Dowling .
“ They buy spur - of - the - moment and hodge podge ; they buy things , not systems . ”
To the extent that the digital home is not a thing but a solution , he thinks , “ the vendors are all fooling themselves . ”
The vendors , naturally , disagree vehemently .
“ When you ask customers what they want , they will never tell you .
You have to show them first , ” says Microsoft 's Mr Mundie .
That is why Microsoft has , since 1994 , had an impressive ( or , to some people , intimidating ) mock digital home on its campus in Redmond , Washington State , which it updates with the latest gadgets .
Intel , NETGEAR , HP and most other self - respecting technology firms have similar mock - ups for display .
There is , argues Motorola 's Mr Burke , a huge “ need to educate consumers about the value of a connected home and lifestyle . ”
Talking the same language
Outside the controlled environment of a mock home or conference demonstration , however , educating consumers tends to backfire .
That is because real - world digital homes usually do not work very well .
The premise of the entire vision , remember , is that heterogeneous devices talk to one another and readily transfer content to wherever the consumer wants to access it .
This requires compatibility — “ interoperability ” in the jargon — among vendors involved in two technological categories .
The first is file formats and codecs ( short for coder - decoders ) , which encode digital information — such as a picture , song or film — compress it for transmission and storage , and decompress it again for viewing and listening .
The second is digital - rights management software , or DRM , which protects such content against piracy and unauthorised copying .
DRM allows the copyright holders of content — film studios and record companies , in essence — to define such parameters as when a film or song that is downloaded “ expires ” , or how many times it can be copied to another device , such as a portable player .
The trouble starts here , with a bewildering list of acronyms that no ordinary consumer should ever have to know , but currently needs to know , to set up a digital home .
The Moving Picture Experts Group ( MPEG ) is an industry body that defines widely used codecs such as MPEG - 2 for video and MP3 for audio .
But the big vendors prefer their own codecs — Microsoft its WM9 ( short for Windows - Media - 9 ) , Apple , the market leader in online music sales , its AAC , and so on .
In DRM , the situation is even more chaotic .
Microsoft pushes its Windows DRM ; RealNetworks , which makes rival media software , has Helix ; Sony has OpenMG ; Apple likes FairPlay , and so on .
The upshot is that consumers cannot mix online services , gadgets and software from different vendors and be sure that the content they have paid for actually works .
Music bought online from Microsoft's MSN or Yahoo ! , for instance , does not work on Apple 's iTunes or iPod , and vice versa .
This challenge is daunting because DRM technologies should not only be compatible today , but for all eternity .
Otherwise , consumers will be afraid to pay for content , and will stick with CDs and DVDs , which seem painless and safe by comparison .
“ If consumers even know there 's a DRM , what it is , and how it works , we 've already failed , ” says Peter Lee , an executive at Disney .
The same goes for codecs .
“ The user should n't know or care what format they 're using , ” says James Poder , an engineer at Comcast , America 's largest cable company and broadband internet service provider , because “ consumers do n't want to be IT administrators for their own home . ”
Prisoner 's dilemma
It may seem ironic , therefore , that vendors are refusing to make their technologies interoperable , thus potentially killing their own vision .
On the other hand , it makes sense for each to try to make its own proprietary technology the winner , in order later to grab a disproportionate share of the market .
The starting point of cable and telecoms companies , for instance , is as providers of broadband pipes into the home .
So they are investing in IPTV ( internet - protocol television ) , a vision in which content resides on the network and is pulled into the home on demand .
Thus , says Cyrus Mewawalla , an analyst at Westhall Capital , a broker in London , America 's Verizon and SBC and others are investing hugely in laying fibre - optic cables to homes ( at a cost of about $ 1,000 per household ) , hoping that IPTV and the necessary set - top box could “ evolve into the primary gateway to the digital home . ”
By controlling this gateway , they could offer a bundle of telephony , internet and entertainment , in effect “ owning ” the customer .
This would at the same time help them to parry their biggest threat : Microsoft .
Microsoft has itself invested in IPTV , ostensibly in partnership with telecoms and cable companies .
Like its loss - making investment in game consoles ( called Xbox ) , however , Microsoft intends this as a purely defensive hedge , says Matt Rosoff , an analyst at Directions on Microsoft , an independent research outfit near Seattle .
Instead , thinks Mr Rosoff , Microsoft 's strategy is to establish the Windows - run PC as the uncontested hub of the digital home .
Hence its all - out push to establish its codecs and DRM as the standard .
This would allow Microsoft to keep selling Windows upgrades and to earn royalties from hardware and from consumer - electronics companies that make “ spokes ” for the Windows hub , such as portable music and video players , screens and online services .
Microsoft 's most explicit attempt so far is a version of its current operating system called Windows Media Centre Edition ( MCE ) , which puts a simplified menu on top of the desktop screen for use with a remote control from the sofa .
The MCE was first launched in October 2002 , and has been upgraded several times since , but it has so far been mostly a dud , running fewer than 1 % of all PCs sold last year .
Microsoft now hopes to make MCE more relevant by selling “ extenders ” , little devices that can hook on to a TV set or stereo and communicate with the PC over a wireless network .
Its biggest hope , however , is for Vista ( previously known by the code name of Longhorn ) , the next version of Windows , which is due to be released late next year ( after several delays ) .
According to Microsoft's Mr Mundie , there is no question that the Windows PC will win this fight to become the central repository for all digital content , for a simple reason .
The cable and telecoms companies , he says , are hampered by their business model , in which the set - top boxes sit on their own balance sheet and are leased , at subsidised rates , to consumers .
This means that their incentive will always be to make the boxes cheaper .
By contrast , Microsoft 's incentive is to make its operating system more sophisticated , in everything from parental controls to usability .
By the same logic , Microsoft will beat the consumer - electronics companies ( such as Sony and Samsung ) .
Their business model relies on selling devices rather than on recurring licence revenues .
This leads to clutter in the home , without organisation of the content .
Tom Berquist , an industry analyst at Citigroup , broadly agrees that the PC is likely to win .
The on - demand world on offer from , say , Comcast , is simply not portable enough , he thinks .
By contrast , he says , moving content to PCs potentially “ liberates you from proprietary technology and lets you use content on any device . ”
In this sense , the only real competition to Microsoft is Apple , whose Macintosh operating system is widely considered to be more elegant and user - friendly than Windows , and which has a considerable headstart with the huge popularity of its iTunes music service and iPod player .
Apple 's problem , however , is that it has only 2.6 % of the world market for PCs , whereas Windows runs on almost all the rest .
Apple also differs from Microsoft in that it simultaneously wants to be the main portable - device maker .
It is , in other words , a software , hardware and consumer - electronics company all at once , and that does not leave much room for alliances with other industries to manufacture spokes for an Apple hub .
There are signs that Apple is becoming more agnostic in order to compete with Microsoft .
It has a deal with HP , traditionally a Microsoft ally ( HP was , for instance , the first computer maker to ship Windows Media Centre Edition ) , under which HP bundles Apple 's iTunes software on to PCs running Microsoft Windows .
In a surprising announcement in June , Apple also said that it would start using microprocessors from Intel , another traditional Microsoft ally .
Winner takes all ?
For the foreseeable future , the only certainty is that all these mighty companies will continue to preach interoperability while pursuing proprietary hegemony .
This could lead to several scenarios .
One is that one company , or camp , wins .
The digital home , unified by the winner 's standards , might then become a reality in the mass market .
For this to happen , however , several companies and industries would first have to make huge strategic mistakes , and consumers would have to accede , in effect , to a repeat of the “ Wintel ” ( Windows and Intel ) near monopoly in the PC industry today .
Another possibility is that the technology wars end with a truce , perhaps brokered by industry consortia that push open standards .
This would be infinitely preferable for consumers and would probably make the digital home a reality much sooner , since it would mean that consumers could shop incrementally for new gadgets , all of which will fit with the others .
The catch for providers is that this is much less exciting for their own bottom lines .
There is a third possibility .
This is that the wars continue , but consumers continue not to care .
As John Barrett , research director at Parks Associates , says , “ it seems that we 've concocted a new variant of the ‘ paperless ' office . ”
This , you recall , was the consensus a decade or so ago among technophiles ( but almost nobody else ) , that computer technology would save our forests by freeing us from having to read and write on paper .
Today 's variant , says Mr Barrett , is “ no more tapes , CDs , DVDs , discs . ”
In other words , expect them to be around for a very long time to come .

The evolution of an extension language : a history of Lua
by Roberto Ierusalimschy , Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo , Waldemar Celes
Abstract .
Since its inception , in 1993 , the Lua programming language has gone far beyond our most optimistic expectations .
In this paper , we describe the trajectory of Lua , from its creation as an in - house language for two specific projects , until Lua 4.0 , released in November 2000 .
We discuss the evolution of some of its concepts and the main landmarks in its implementation .
Introduction
There is an old joke that says that " a camel is a horse designed by a committee " .
Among programming - language people , this joke is almost as popular as the legend about programming languages designed by committees .
This legend is supported by languages like Algol 68 , PL/ I , and Ada , all designed by committees , which did not fulfill the expectations of their sponsors .
However , apart from committees , there is an alternative theory for the partial failure of those languages :
All of them were born to be big .
Each of them followed a top - down design process , where the language was fully specified before any programmer could try it , even before any compiler was built .
Most successful languages , on the other hand , are raised rather than designed .
They follow a bottom - up process , starting as a small language , usually with modest goals .
As people start using the language , design flaws surface , new features are added ( or , eventually , removed ) , controversial points are clarified ( or , eventually , obscured ) .
The way languages evolve , therefore , is an important topic of study in programming languages .
For instance , SIGPLAN has already sponsored two conferences on history of programming languages [ 31,3 ] .
In this paper , we report the history of the Lua programming language .
Since its inception , as an in - house language for two specific projects , Lua has gone far beyond our most optimistic expectations .
We think that the main reasons for this success lie in our original design decisions : keep the language simple and small ; keep the implementation simple , small , fast , portable , and free .
Lua was designed ( or , more exactly , raised ) by a committee ; a rather small one , with only three members , but a committee .
With hindsight , we consider that being raised by a small committee was very positive for the language .
We only include a new feature when we reach unanimity ; otherwise , it is left for the future .
It is much easier to add features later than to remove them .
This development process has been essential to keep the language simple , and simplicity is our most important asset .
Most other qualities of Lua – speed , small size , and portability – derive from its simplicity .
Since its first version Lua has had " real " users , that is , users others than ourselves .
They always gave important contributions to the language , through suggestions , complaints , use reports , and questions .
Again , our small committee plays an important role .
Its structure gives us enough inertia , so that we can listen to the users without following all their suggestions .
We organized the rest of this paper chronologically .
We start with our previous experiences that led to the creation of Lua , in 1993 , and proceed through eight years of discussions , decisions , work , and fun .
The Beginning
Our first experience at TeCGraf with a language designed in - house arose in a data - entry application .
The engineers at PETROBRAS ( the Brazilian oil company ) needed to prepare input data files for simulators several times a day .
This process was boring and error - prone because the simulation programs were legacy code that needed strictly formatted input files – typically bare columns of numbers , with no indication of what each number meant .
Of course , each number had a specific meaning , which the engineers could grab at a glance , once they saw a diagram of the particular simulation .
TeCGraf was asked by PETROBRAS to create several graphical front - ends for this kind of data entry .
The numbers could then be input interactively , just by clicking at the relevant parts of the diagram – a much easier and meaningful task than editing columns of numbers .
Moreover , it opened the opportunity to add data validation and also to compute derived quantities from the input data , reducing the amount of data needed from the user , and increasing the reliability of the whole process .
To simplify the development of these front - ends at TeCGraf , we decided to code them all in a uniform way , and so we designed a simple declarative language to describe each data entry task [ 12 ] .
Here is a section of a typical program in this language , which we called DEL ( data entry language ) :
:e gasket " gasket properties " mat s # material m f 0 # factor m y f 0 # settlement stress t i 1 # facing type :p gasket .m> 30 gasket .
m< 3000 gasket .y> 335.8 gasket .y< 2576.8
:e
gasket
:
p
gasket
An entity in DEL is essentially a structure or record in conventional programming languages .
The difference is that its name also appears in a graphical metafile , which contains the associated diagram over which the engineer does the data entry , as described above .
This simple language proved to be a success , both in TeCGraf , because it simplified the development , and with the users , because it was simple to tailor data entry applications .
Soon users began to demand more power from DEL , such as boolean expressions for controlling whether an entity was active for input or not , and DEL became heavier .
When they began to ask for conditional control and loops , it was clear that we needed a true programming language .
At about the same time we started working in another project for PETROBRAS , called PGM , a configurable report generator for lithology profiles .
As the name suggests , the reports generated by this program are highly configurable : the user can create and position the tracks , choose colors , fonts , and texts ; each track may have a grid , which also has its set of options ( log/ linear , vertical and horizontal ticks , etc. ) ; each curve has its own scale , which has to be changed automatically in case of overflow ; and so on .
All this configuration was to be done by the end users , typically geologists or engineers , and the program should run on small machines , such as a PC running MS - DOS .
We decided that the best way to configure this application was through a specialized description language , which we called Sol : an acronym for Simple Object Language , which also means sun in Portuguese .
Because the report generator had many different objects , each one with many different attributes , we did not fix those objects and attributes in the language .
Instead , the language allowed type declarations .
The main task of the interpreter was to read a description , to check whether the given objects and attributes were correctly typed , and then to present the information to the main program .
To allow this communication between the main program and the interpreter , the latter was implemented as a C library , linked to the main program .
Thus , the main program could access all configuration information through an API in this library .
Moreover , the program could register a callback function for each type , so that the interpreter would call this function whenever it created an object of the given type .
The following chunk shows a typical piece of code in Sol :
-- defines a type `track ' , with numeric attributes `x ' and `y ' , -- plus an untyped attribute `z '. `y ' and `z ' have default values .
type @track { x:number , y: number= 23 , z=0} -- defines a type `line ' , with attributes `t ' ( a track ) , -- and `z ' , a list of numbers .
-- `t ' has as default value a track with x=8 , y=23 , and z=0 .
type @line { t:@track=@track{x=8} , z:number*} -- creates an object `t1 ' , of type `track ' t1 = @track { y = 9 , x = 10 , z= " hi ! " } -- creates a line `l ' , with t=@track{x=9 , y=10} , -- and z= [ 2,3,4 ] ( a list ) l = @line { t= @track{x=t1.y , y=t1.x} , z= [ 2,3,4 ] }
In March 1993 we finished a first implementation of the Sol language , but we never delivered it .
By mid-1993 , we realized that both DEL and Sol could be combined into a single , more powerful language .
The program for visualizing lithology profiles would soon require support for procedural programming to allow the creation of more sophisticated layouts .
On the other hand , the data - entry programs also needed descriptive facilities for programming its user interface .
So , we decided that we needed a real programming language , with assignment , control structures , sub - routines , and the like .
The language should also offer data - description facilities , such as those offered by Sol .
Moreover , because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers , the language should avoid cryptic syntax ( and semantics ) .
Finally , the implementation of the new language should be highly portable .
The portability requirement turned out to be one of its main strengths :
Those two applications should be fully portable , and so should the language .
The state - owned PETROBRAS could not choose specific hardware because it could only purchase equipment under very strict rules for spending public money .
PETROBRAS thus had a very diverse collection of computers , and so the software developed at TeCGraf for PETROBRAS should run on every machine they had , which included PC DOS , Windows ( 3.1 , at that time ) , Macintosh , and all flavors of Unix .
At that point , we could have adopted an existing language , instead of creating a new one .
The main contenders were Tcl [ 25 ] and , far behind , Forth [ 26 ] and Perl [ 30 ] .
Perl is not an extension language .
In 1993 , Tcl and Perl ran only on Unix platforms .
All three have highly cryptic syntax .
And none of them offers good support for data description .
So , we started working on a new language .
Soon we realized that , for our purposes , the language did not need type declarations .
Instead , we could use the language itself to write type - checking routines , provided that the language offered basic reflexive facilities ( such as run- time type information ) .
An assignment like
t1 = @track {y = 9 , x = 10 , z= " hi ! " }
track
Because the new language was a modified version of Sol ( sun ) , a friend at TeCGraf suggested the name Lua ( moon , in Portuguese ) , and Lua was born .
Lua inherited from
Sol the syntax for record and list constructions , but it unified their implementation using associative tables : Records use strings ( the field names ) as indices ; lists use integers .
Apart from these data description facilities , Lua had no new concepts ; we wanted just a light generic language .
So , we settled for a small set of control structures , with syntax borrowed from Modula ( while , if , and repeat until ) .
From CLU we took multiple assignment and multiple returns from function calls ( a much cleaner concept than in - out or reference parameters ) .
From C++ we took the neat idea of allowing a local variable to be declared only where we need it .
One of the few ( rather small ) innovations was the syntax for string concatenation .
Because the language allows coercion of strings to numbers , a + signal would be ambiguous ; so , we created the syntax .. ( two dots ) for that operation .
A polemic point was about the use of semicolons .
We thought that requiring semicolons could be a little confusing for engineers with a FORTRAN background , but not allowing them could confuse those with a C or Pascal background .
At the end , we settled for optional semicolons ( a typical committee solution ) .
Initially , Lua language had seven types : numbers ( implemented as floats ) , strings , ( associative ) tables , nil ( a type with a unique value also called nil ) , userdata ( a generic C pointer to represent C structures inside Lua ) , Lua functions , and C functions .
( After eight years of continuous evolution , the only change in Lua types was the unification of Lua functions and C functions into a single function type . )
To keep the language small , we did not include a boolean type .
Like in Lisp , nil represents false , and any other value represents true .
This is one of the few economies that we sometimes regret today .
Lua also inherited from Sol the concept of being implemented as a library .
The implementation followed a tenet now supported by Extreme Programming : " the simplest thing that could possibly work " [ 1 ] .
We used lex for the scanner and yacc for the parser .
The parser translated the program to a bytecode form , which was then executed by a simple stack - based interpreter .
The language had a very small pre-defined library , as it was easy to add new functions in C .
Despite this simple implementation – or possibly because of it – Lua surpassed our expectations .
Both PGM and the Data Entry ( ED ) projects used Lua successfully [ 16 ] ( PGM is still in use today ) .
Soon , other projects inside TeCGraf began to use Lua , too .
The First Years ( 1994 –1996 )
New users create new demands .
Not surprisingly , one of the first demands on Lua was for better performance .
The use of Lua for data description posed unusual challenges for typical scripting languages .
As soon as we started using Lua , we identified its potential use as the support language for graphics metafiles .
The data description facilities of Lua allow its use as a graphics format .
Compared with other programmable metafiles , Lua metafiles have the advantage of being based on a truly procedural language .
The VRML format , for instance , uses Javascript to model procedural objects , resulting in a heterogeneous ( and consequently unclean ) code [ 2 ] .
With Lua , incorporating procedural objects in a scene description is natural .
Procedural code fragments can be combined with declarative statements to model complex objects , while preserving clarity .
The data - entry program ( ED ) was the first one to use Lua for its graphics metafiles .
It was not uncommon for a diagram to have several thousand parts , which were described with a Lua constructor with several thousand items , in a file with hundreds Kbytes .
That meant that Lua had to cope with huge programs and huge expressions , from a programming - language perspective .
And , because Lua pre-compiled such programs on the fly ( a " just - in - time compiler " ) , it also meant that the Lua compiler had to be very fast .
The first victim of this quest for performance was lex .
Replacing the scanner generated by lex with a hand - written one almost doubled the speed of the Lua compiler .
We also created new opcodes for constructors .
The original code for a list constructor like
@ [ 30 , 40 , 50 ]
CREATETABLE PUSHNUMBER 1 # index PUSHNUMBER 30 # value SETTABLE PUSHNUMBER 2 # index PUSHNUMBER 40 # value SETTABLE PUSHNUMBER 3 # index PUSHNUMBER 50 # value SETTABLE
CREATETABLE PUSHNUMBER 30 # value PUSHNUMBER 40 # value PUSHNUMBER 50 # value SETTABLE 1 3 # set elements from index 1 to 3
SETTABLE
( Since then , we have always tried to improve compile time .
Today , Lua compiles a program with 30000 assignments six times faster than Perl , eight times faster than Python . )
We released a new version of Lua , with those optimizations , in July 1994 , with the name Lua 1.1 [ 19 ] .
This version was made available for download by ftp .
The previous version , which was never publicly released , then got the name Lua 1.0 .
Around that time , we also published the first paper describing Lua [ 10 ] .
Lua 1.1 had a restrictive user license .
It was free for academic uses , but not for commercial uses .
( Despite the license , it was always open source . )
But that license did not work .
Most competitors , such as Perl and Tcl , were free .
Moreover , the commercial restriction discourages even academic uses , as several academic projects plan to eventually go to the market .
So we released the next version of the language , Lua 2.1 , as free software .
Lua version 2
Lua 2.1 ( released in February 1995 ) , brought many important changes .
One of them was not in the language itself , but in the process of language development :
We decided that we should always try to improve the language , even at the cost of small incompatibilities with previous versions .
In version 2.1 we actually introduced big incompatibilities with version 1.1 ( but we provided some tools to help in the conversion ) .
We dropped the @ from constructors , and unified the use of curly brackets both for records and for lists .
Dropping the @ is a trivial change , but it actually changed the feel of the language , not merely its looks .
More importantly , we simplified the semantics for constructors .
In Lua 1.1 , the expression @track{x=1 , y=10} had a special meaning .
In Lua 2.1 , the expression track{x=1 , y=10} is just syntactic sugar for track ( {x=1 , y=10} ) , that is , it creates a new table and passes it as the sole argument to function track .
Since the beginning , we designed Lua as an extension language , in the sense that C programs can register their own functions to be called from Lua transparently .
In this way , it is easy to extend Lua with domain - specific primitives , so that the end user uses a language tailored to her needs .
In version 2.1 , we introduced the notion of fallbacks : User - defined functions that are called whenever Lua does not know how to proceed .
Lua then became a language that could be extended in two ways : by extending its set of " primitive " functions and by extending its semantics with fallbacks .
That is why we now call Lua an extensible extension language .
We defined fallbacks for arithmetic , comparison , string concatenation , table access , etc .
When set by the user , the corresponding fallback function is called whenever the operands to these operations are not of the required type .
For instance , whenever two values are added and one of them is not numerical , a fallback is called and its return value is used as the result of the addition .
Of special interest – and actually the main reason for introducing fallbacks – are the fallbacks for table access : in the statement x=a[ i ] , if a [ i ] is nil , then a fallback is called ( if set ) and its return value used as the value of a [ i ] .
This simple new feature allowed the programmer to implement different semantics for table access .
In particular , one could implement several kinds of inheritance , the simplest one being single inheritance by delegation :
function Index ( a , i ) if i == " parent " then - to avoid loop return nil end local p = a.parent if type ( p ) == " table " then return p[ i ] - may trigger Index again else return nil end end setfallback ( " index " , Index )
This code follows a chain of " parents " upwards , until a table has the required field or the chain ends .
With the " index " fallback set as above , the code below prints red even though b does not have a color field :
a=Window{x=100 , y=200 , color= " red " } b=Window{x=300 , y=400 , parent=a} print ( b.color )
There is nothing magical or " hard - coded " about delegation through a " parent " field .
This is a programmer choice .
She could use a different name for the " parent " field , or implement more complicated multiple inheritance by allowing the " parent " field to be itself a table of parents that are tried in order , or anything else .
Different fallbacks were called for the expression a [ i ] when a is not a table .
There was a " gettable " fallback , triggered to get the value of a [ i ] , as in x=a[ i ] ; and a " settable " fallback , triggered to set the value of a [ i ] , as in a [ i ] =x .
There are many possibilities for exploiting these table fallbacks ; cross-language inheritance is a very powerful one :
When a is a userdata value ( a pointer in the host C program ) , table fallbacks can give the programmer transparent access to values in data structures residing in the host program .
Our decision not to hard - code any of those possible behaviors led to one of the main design concepts of Lua : meta-mechanisms .
Instead of littering the language with lots of features , we provided ways so that the user could program the features herself , in the way she wants them , and only for those features she needs .
The fallback meta-mechanism allowed Lua to support object - oriented programming , in the sense that ( several kinds of ) inheritance ( and also operator overloading ) could be implemented .
We even added a piece of syntactical sugar for defining and using " methods " : functions can be defined as a : f ( x , y, z ) and a hidden parameter called self is added to a.f , in the sense that a call to a : f ( 10,20,30 ) is equivalent to a. f( a,10,20,30 ) .
In May 1996 we released Lua 2.4 .
A main feature of this new version was an external compiler , called luac .
This program pre-compiles Lua code and saves bytecode and string tables to a binary file .
The format of this file was chosen to be easily loaded and portable across different platforms .
With luac , programs can avoid parsing and code generation at run-time , which can be costly , specially for large , static programs such as graphical metafiles .
Our first paper about Lua [ 10 ] already anticipated the possibility of an external compiler , but we only needed it after Lua became widely used at TeCGraf and large graphical metafiles were written in Lua , as the output of graphical editors .
Besides faster loading , luac also allows off - line syntax checking and the protection of source code from user changes .
However , pre-compiling does not imply faster execution because Lua chunks are always compiled into bytecodes before being executed – luac simply allows those bytecodes to be saved in a file for later execution .
luac is implemented in " client mode " , that is , it uses the modules which implement Lua simply as a ( polite ) client , even though it does include the private header files to have access to the internal data structures that need to be saved .
One advantage of this policy is that it helped to structure the implementation of Lua 's core into clearly separated modules .
In particular , it is now easy to remove the parsing modules ( lexer , parser , and code generator ) , which represent 40 % of the core code in Lua 4.0 , leaving just the tiny module that loads pre-compiled chunks .
This can be useful for tiny implementations of Lua to be embedded in small devices such as mobile devices or robots ( Crazy Ivan , a robot that won RoboCup in 2000 and 2001 in Denmark , has a " brain " implemented in Lua ) .
International Exposure ( 1996–2000 )
In June 1996 we published an academic paper about Lua in Software : Practice & Experience [ 18 ] .
In December 1996 , the magazine Dr. Dobb 's featured an article about Lua [ 11 ] .
These publications , aimed at different communities , started to make Lua internationally known .
Soon after the article in Dr. Dobb's , we received several messages about Lua .
One of the first messages was the following :
From : Bret Mogilefsky < mogul@lucasarts.com >
To : " 'lua@icad.puc-rio.br ' " < lua@icad.puc-rio.br >
Subject : LUA rocks !
Question , too .
Date : Thu , 9 Jan 1997 13:21:41 - 0800
Hi there ...
After reading the Dr. Dobbs article on Lua I was very eager to check it out , and so far it has exceeded my expectations in every way !
It 's elegance and simplicity astound me .
Congratulations on developing such a well - thought out language .
Some background : I am working on an adventure game for the LucasArts Entertainment Co. , and I want to try replacing our older adventure game scripting language , SCUMM , with Lua . [...]
rec.games.programmer
comp.ai.games
Due to its small size , good performance , portability and ease of integration , Lua has gained great popularity for extending games .
Nowadays , several game companies use Lua ( e.g. , LucasArts , BioWare , Slingshot Game Technology , and Loewen Entertainment ) and knowledge of Lua is a marketable skill in the game industry .
We estimate that half of the Lua users are in some way involved in game programming , but it is hard to be more specific because there is a lot of secrecy in the game industry .
For instance , Bret Mogilefsky adapted Lua for Grim Fandango , but the details were of course proprietary .
There are several benefits from embedding a scripting language into a game .
The scripting language can be used for defining sprite and object physics , for managing object AI and character control , and for handling input device events .
For instance , the engine may know nothing about such things as " damage " , " speed " , " weapons " , etc .
The choice of a simple language can also give game designers access to programmable tools .
This is crucial for game development , because the designers can experiment their creations .
Scripting languages also allow rapid prototyping and facilitates the implementation of debugger tools .
More recently , in 2000 , LucasArts released another game using Lua : Escape from Monkey Island , which was the fourth in the Monkey Island series of adventures .
In this game , as a homage to Lua , they renamed a bar inside the game from SCUMM ( the language they used previously ) to Lua Bar .
Besides its wide use in computer games ( e.g. , Grim Fandango , Baldur 's Gate , MDK2 , Escape from Monkey Island ) , Lua has been used around the world in many different fields .
One of the first uses of Lua outside PUC - Rio was at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory .
They designed a generalized aperture program to simulate the effects on the incident photon stream of physical obstructions , and used Lua to model the geometry and the interactions of the incident photon stream with the apertures [ 23 ] .
This program was part of the efforts to support the AXAF program ( the Advanced X- ray Astrophysics Facility ) – the third of NASA 's four Great Space Observatories .
Performance Technologies used Lua to implement the command - line interface of CPC4400 , a hot - swappable Ethernet switch .
By exposing Lua as the scripting language of the CPC4400 , the user is able to associate events ( such as link status , detection of topology changes and RMON alarms ) with Lua scripts .
Tollgrade Communications used Lua in its next - generation telephony network testing products , DigiTest .
Lua was used for user interfaces , automated test scripts , and results analysis .
Lua is also used at the InCor Heart Institute ( Instituto do Coração , São Paulo ) , in Brazil ; CEPEL ( the Research Center of ELETROBRAS , the state electricity company ) , also in Brazil ; the Weierstrass Institute , in Berlin ; the Technische Universität Berlin ; and many other places .
In 1998 , Cameron Laird and Kathryn Soraiz , in their column about scripting languages in SunWorld magazine , estimated that " there might be only a few tens of thousands of Lua programmers in the world " [ 20 ] .
What they considered " a small user base " was , for us , a strong sign of the growing popularity of the language .
Lua version 3
Lua 3.0 ( July 1997 ) replaced fallbacks with the more powerful concept of tag methods .
Fallbacks were global by nature :
User functions were called every time an event occurred , and there was only one function for each event .
This made it hard to combine Lua modules that had different notions of inheritance , for instance .
Although it was possible to chain fallbacks , chaining was slow and error - prone , and in practice nobody did it .
Since Lua 3.0 , the programmer can create tags , and associate tables and userdata to tags .
Tag methods are essentially fallbacks that are selected according to the tag of the operator .
With tags and tag methods , different tables ( and userdata ) may have different fallbacks for their operations .
The tag concept essentially provides Lua with user - defined types .
In other words , a tag is simply a number that represents a new type .
When you associate a table with a specific tag , you are actually defining a new type for that table :
The type ( or the tag ) of the table specifies how it implements its operators .
When we introduced fallbacks , most of them described the behavior of Lua for otherwise erroneous events , such as indexing a non -table value or calling a non-function value .
So , we thought about fallbacks as an exception - handling mechanism .
With the introduction of user - defined tags , fallbacks ( now called tag methods ) became mainly a mechanism for describing the behavior of new types , even though we still can use them to extend the behavior of basic types .
Despite this new status , for a long time we still perceived tag methods as exception - handling mechanisms , and we did not connect tags with types .
Only recently we realized the full significance of user - defined tags and tag methods as a mechanism for creating user - defined types .
Lua 4.1 will seal this recognition by allowing the user to provide names for these new types ( currently , only the basic types have names ) .
Lua 3.0 also brought support for conditional compilation , in the form of a C - like preprocessor .
Like any language feature , it was too easy to add it ( although it did complicate the lexer ) and soon programmers began to use it ( programmers will use any language feature ) .
Once a feature begins to be used , demand for more power comes right behind it .
One of the most frequent requests was the addition of macro expansion , but no clean proposal emerged from the long discussions in the mailing list and among ourselves .
Every such proposal would imply a large change in the lexer and parser , and the benefits were not clear .
So , the preprocessor remained static from Lua 3.0 until version 3.2 ( two years ) .
In the end we decided that the preprocessor was causing more harm than good , making the code bulkier and inviting endless discussions from users , and we removed it in Lua 4.0 .
We feel that Lua is now cleaner without the preprocessor .
Over the years , we have striven to make Lua simpler and have removed dark corners of the language that we once regarded as features , but which few programmers really used and which were later recognized as misfeatures .
Lua version 4
Until version 3.2 , only one Lua " state " could be active at a time .
We did have an API function to change the state , but it was a little awkward to use .
For simplicity , when we designed the API , we did not include an explicit state parameter in the functions – there was single , global state .
In retrospect , that was a mistake .
By the time Lua 3.2 was out , it was clear that many applications would be simpler if they could run multiple Lua states in a convenient way .
For instance , we had to make a special version of Lua 3.2 to be included in CGILua , an extension of web browsers for dynamic page serving and CGI programming in Lua .
Earlier , LucasArts did something similar for Lua 3.1 .
When we were discussing our plans for Lua 3.3 , an API with explicit states was our highest priority .
However , this raised compatibility questions .
In the end , because there would have to be several incompatibilities , we decided to rewrite the API and the next version became Lua 4.0 .
The API now not only includes explicit states , but it is also easier to use and more efficient .
We feared that the transition to the new API would be a little traumatic , since it was the first time we really changed the API since Lua 1.1 .
We did have a few complaints in the mailing list , but on the whole the change was not at all traumatic .
Most Lua programmers have no contact with the API , many use it only through automatic tools , and many considered that the benefits outperformed the transition costs .
We released Lua 4.0 in November 2000 .
Besides the new API , this version brought many other small enhancements , among them the for loop .
Everyone that works with programming languages knows how easy it is for people to start " religious wars " about the subject .
An interesting characteristic of those wars is that , usually , the more mundane the subject , the hotter the discussion .
For instance , people get much more excited discussing semicolons than discussing higher - order functions .
Of course , one reason for that is that many more people have opinions about the former than the latter .
But another , more important reason is that mundane details have a strong impact in how comfortable people feel with the language .
It is no use to create a marvelous , well - thought tool , if it does not have a good grip – no one will use it .
Since version 1.1 , a for statement was in the wish - list of most Lua users .
The most common complaint was that people forget to write the increment at the end of a while loop , thus leading to infinite loops .
It did not take too long for us to agree .
But , while we all agreed about the need of a for loop , we could not agree about any particular construction .
We considered a Pascal - like ( or Modula - like ) construction too restrictive , as it does not contemplate iterations over the elements of a table or over the lines of a file .
Moreover , turning the identifier to into a reserved word would be an unacceptable incompatibility .
On the other hand , a for loop in the C tradition did not fit in Lua .
With the introduction of closures and anonymous functions , in version 3.1 ( July 98 ) , we decided to use higher - order functions for iterations .
( In fact , the need for iterators was one of the main reasons for introducing anonymous functions in Lua . )
Lua 3.1 came out with two pre-defined functions for iteration :
foreach ( table , f ) foreachi( table , f )
foreach
f
foreachi
More than two years after the introduction of these iteration functions we realized that , although it was easy to create new iterators , almost nobody did .
The first reason is that most programmers do not feel comfortable with anonymous functions and higher order functions , mainly inside a procedural language .
But the second and , in our view , most important reason was that almost nobody needed other iterators .
That meant that , for many years , we had been trying to achieve an orthogonality that no real user really cared about .
With this understanding , we quickly designed a for loop , with two formats , one for a numeric loop , the other to traverse tables .
The for statement was one of the most successful changes in the language since its first version .
First , it really covers most common loops ; for a really generic loop , there is the while loop .
Second , because of its rigid format , it is easy to create specific opcodes to implement the loop , so that a numeric for loop with an empty body runs more than twice as fast as the equivalent while construction .
Conclusions
Currently , Lua has a well - established user base .
Lua has an active discussion list , with almost 500 people from more than 30 different countries .
Its web site ( www.lua.org) receives around 500 visits per day , from 50 countries .
Its uses range from adventure games to web - servers to telephony - network testing to Ethernet switches .
Several ftp sites offer the original Lua source code , and several other sites distribute versions for specific platforms , such as DLLs for Windows , SIS for EPOC , RPM for Linux , binaries for RISC OS , etc.
Moreover , several magazines have distributed Lua in supplementary CDs ( e.g. Dr. Dobb's , Linux Magazine France , and Japan 's C Magazine ) .
As a language , Lua main contributions are a consequence of the decision to provide meta-mechanisms instead of features .
As a product , Lua success comes from its simplicity , small size , and from the portability of the implementation , which allows Lua to be used in many different platforms , including small devices , such as palmtops , handhelds , specialized boards , and robots .
Cameron Laird and Kathryn Soraiz predicted , in 1998 , that " the imminent explosion of ubiquitous embedded processing ( computers in your car , in your plumbing , and in your kitchen appliances ) can only work in favor of Lua " [ 20 ] .
At that time , we did not pay much attention , but they were right .
Lua also made several academic contributions , through several thesis and papers both about Lua and using Lua as a relevant technology [ 4,29,14,17,13,28,15,22,6,27,9,5,7,8 ] .
Success has its costs .
Through the evolution of the language , compatibility with previous versions has been increasingly a deterrent to innovation .
Nevertheless , we do not allow compatibility to stop progress ; it is only one more ingredient ( albeit a strong one ) in the alchemy of language design .
Finally , to keep a language is much more than to design it .
Complete attention to detail is essential in all aspects : language design , implementation , documentation , setting up a community of users and listening to them , while at the same time keeping to the original design decisions .

The GAMMA 10 tandem mirror at the University of Tsukuba in Japan is the world ’s largest tandem - mirror plasma - confinement experimental device .
In the future , such a device may use the cooling concept presented in this study by Nathaniel Fisch .

Since the development of the hydrogen bomb in the ‘ 50s , scientists have speculated that the power of fusion might serve as a renewable energy resource .
Research has revealed the challenges of this goal , and although nothing close to such an application exists , recently , Professor Nathaniel Fisch from Princeton University has come up with a new idea for efficient fusion energy production based on the old concept of magnetic mirror machines .
“ Now that we know that we can get to the high temperatures need for fusion , we are more concerned with the next engineering steps , like shoveling fuel in and taking the ash and heat out of the machines , ” Fisch explains to PhysOrg.com .
“ In the long run , I would not be surprised if people eventually came back to improved open system concepts for economical fusion energy such as the mirror . ”
In fusion , light particles ( often hydrogen nuclei ) fuse into heavier ions ( such as helium nuclei , or alpha particles ) and release their excess mass as energy .
In order to fuse , the particles must reach a very high temperature ( e.g. tens of millions of degrees ) , transforming into the highly conductive plasma phase .
Without any control of the energy being produced , though , continuous chain reactions would result in a massive explosion like the hydrogen bomb .
Popular in the ‘ 70 s but in little use today , magnetic mirror machines consist of a magnetic field with high strength at the magnetic axis in the center and low strength on the periphery .
This set - up enables confinement of charged particles — and now , as Fisch finds , can allow an efficient method for cooling , which is important for controlled fusion .
Fisch explains that his cooling method — called an alpha - channeling effect — is similar to an effect that he and his colleague Professor Jean Marcel Rax predicted in 1992 for use in tokamaks , which are arguably the most popular candidate for producing fusion energy today .
Like magnetic mirrors , tokamaks also employ magnetic fields to confine the hot plasmas required for fusion .
“ In the 1980s , there was a big shoot - out between tokamaks and mirrors , ” Fisch explains .
“ The tokamak concept won out because it simply confined heat better , and now the mirror concept is practically gone within the US .
But in the 1980s people just wanted to resolve the ‘ proof - of - concept ’ — whether or not you could bring plasma up to thermonuclear temperatures .
The tokamak simply had a better shot at this because it had the better seal on heat and particles .
“ Now that we know that we can get to those temperatures , we are more concerned with the next engineering steps , like shoveling fuel in and taking the ash out , ” Fisch continues .
“ But that means opening up that seal on the tokamak to accomplish these goals .
The mirror machine is already ‘ open ’ — that was its problem — so these tasks are easy .
In a way , the development path for the mirror was unfortunate , since the problems it solved easily were the engineering issues which were not at the top of the then - list . ”
In the cooling scheme , Fisch uses one - meter - long radio frequency waves to control nuclear fusion by cooling the alpha particle byproduct of fusion .
This cooling wave resonates with specific alpha particles , cooling them and reducing their energy so that they diffuse to the periphery and quickly exit the machine .
The alphas ’ lost energy could possibly even heat the remaining hydrogen ions to repeat the process .
Fisch ’s magnetic mirror idea would allow the alpha particles to travel both perpendicular and parallel to field lines due to the open geometry of mirror machines .
Torus - shaped tokamaks , on the other hand , bend the magnetic field lines back on themselves for confinement , prohibiting axial movement of particles .
Fisch explains that implementing alpha particle channeling would require two conditions .
Because not all particles will be affected by the radio wave ( only those with identical resonances ) , a connection must exist between high energy particles in the center and low energy particles near the periphery so that the center particles have a path of escape .
Second , too much energy gain could cause energy losses ( e.g. from collisions ) , but since high energy particles are pulled to the magnetic axis , a particle ’s distance to the axis would limit its energy gain .
Fisch also predicts that , by arranging for several regions of radio waves at different frequencies , a full range of particles can be cooled and ushered to exit .
He estimates that quickening this ash removal process could increase fusion reactivity in certain designs by almost three times by making more room for hydrogen fuel ions .
“ Right now what we have is not quite a full - fledged concept , but it is certainly an idea for a concept , ” he says .
“ I like this cooling effect , simply because it is a ‘ cool ’ effect .
It is just very interesting , either for tokamaks or for mirrors , or even more generally than that . ”
To take the next step and use these ideas in a mirror machine applicable for confining fusion , Fisch cautions that , while there is the potential to improve efficiency using these ideas , the appropriate waves need to be identified in detail .
“ We ’re still a long way from application , ” he says .
“ The largest challenges in controlled fusion will be to make a device that has engineering simplicity , which is where the open confinement concepts have the advantage .
The open confinement concepts need to work better as confinement devices , though . ”

230 year old rare tortoise dies
A rare 230 - year - old tortoise died at Shanghai Zoo recently , where it lived for 35 years , leaving only four of the species left in the world .
The zookeeper said the tortoise was found in Gejiu , Yunnan Province , in 1971 .
The rare species has only been found in two regions in China the Taihu Lake in Jiangsu Province and the Honghe River in Yunnan Province .

A major part of Don Q's job is to fly out to construction sites and setup their computer network .
Weeks before doing this , Don meets with the project manager to make sure that every one knows what needs to be done and how to do it .
It 's up to the project manager to make sure that the workstations , server , cabling , power , etc. are all in place before Don arrives , and Don makes sure to give concise but not insultingly - simple instructions on how to accomplish that .
One of these tasks is simply : install the server in a secure and well - ventilated location .
Don had dolled out that task to construction project managers countless times , and they had always complied without issue : the server was installed in a secure and well - ventilated location .
After all , where else would one put a $ 15,000 + computer running $ 100,000 + software to manage a $ 50,000,000 + construction project ?
When Don arrived at one particular location to setup the network , he discovered that the project manager had a slightly different interpretation : The Men's Room .
Of course , it was n't just any men's room ; it was the men's room in a construction site trailer where various construction workers trudged in all day long to do their nasty business .
What 's not visible in the photographs is the 3 " hole in the floor where network cabling exits the trailer .
Being that it 's unsealed , a nice cold draft , along with a small family of mice , have no problem getting through .
Also not visible in the photograph is the mice turds littered across the men's room floor .
Even after confronted and explained the issues with this , the project manager saw no problem with this set up .
Fortunately , Don was able to convince the higher - ups and get the server moved to a more suitable location .

Dear audiophiles , what you are about to read is a very unusual review .
You know us for our sincere , frank and independent approach to HiFi reviewing .
In the past we reviewed many HiFi components that , for one reason or another , did n't get enough press coverage on traditional HiFi media .
We drove your attention towards new products , many of these available online only , always having in mind VFM ( Value For Money ) and sound quality .
We are proud to have had the temper and the courage to make things differently , always far from the usual mainstream HiFi hype .
Forgive me for this blatant preamble but first - time readers may need some introduction to our approach , before reading what follows .
Among many unusual reviews ( here on TNT - Audio ) this one will stand out , not because it is somehow " different " from our previous ones , rather because the product is DIFFERENT .
It is so different than the rest that I dare to call it a real revolution .
I 'm talking of a sub - 30 $ ( no typo ! ) integrated amplifier that embarasses the competition .
Which competition , you may ask !
There are no integrated amplifiers below , say , 150 $ !!!
Indeed , the Sonic Impact T - Amp finds its natural competitors in a price range that is 100 times its price .
At least .
Now relax and read on .
This is NOT an April 's Fool , a bad taste joke or a test to see how many of you blindly believe in what we say .
No , this is the first part of a series of articles devoted to the most insane piece of equipment I 've ever come across during the last 25 years of HiFi addiction .
A battery - operated 6 watts per channel IC - based integrated amplifier that is so damn good sounding to cause harassment to many expensive products .
Description and tech specs
The Sonic Impact T - Amp is a so - called Class T integrated amplifier , based on the Tripath TA 2024 chipset .
As claimed by Tripath and then by Sonic Impact , the chip makes use of a kind of " Digital Power Processing " .
In layman 's words , this is , more or less , a Class D amplifier with high rate switching properties .
That is why they put the word " digital " into it .
Actually , there 's nothing really digital inside , not in terms of D/ A conversion .
You can view the official TA2024 datasheet , with detailed tech specs , power and distortion measurements at the Tripath website .
The Sonic Impact T - Amp is nothing else than a pure and simple application suggested by the chipset datasheet .
No magic .
Tripath makes other , more powerful chipsets , used for example by BelCanto Design for their Evo2 power amplifier ( 3200 $ ) and by Audio Research on their 150.2 power amp .
Also Teac makes a 3 - channel power amp with the very same kind of chipset .
The TA2024 and hence the Sonic Design T - Amp delivers 6 watts on a 8 ohm load and 9 watts on a 4 ohm load .
Forget the fancy and optimistic 15 watts claim since this refers to the max power on 4 ohm at a 10 % distortion rate !
It can be powered by 8 1.5V AA batteries or via an external 1.2 ampere / 13 Volts AC adapter ( not supplied ) available at 20 $ , only for the US market .
The T - Amp has just one mini - jack line input and 2 spring clips speaker posts that barely can accept anything above 1.5 - 2.0 mmq .
A volume knob - that works also to switch the unit on - is the only human interface supplied .
No input selection ( there 's only one ! ) , no tone controls , no mute , no remote .
A red led lights up when the unit is on .
These are the claimed tech specs :
Output power ( with batteries ) : 9 watt / channel @ 4 ohm - 6 watt / channel @ 8 Ohm - 15 watt / channel @ 4 ohm , with 10 % THD
Output power ( with external Ac adapter ) : 15 watt / channel @ 4 ohm
THD : 0.04 % ( @ 1 kHz , 9 watt , 4 ohm )
Dynamic range : 102 dB
Weight : 300g approx , without batteries
Size : 16 ( W ) x 10 ( H ) x 8 ( D ) ( cm )
The manufacturer , Sonic Technologies , is a San Diego ( USA ) based Company , though production is located in China .
I 've tested the amplifier for a long while as if it were a standard HiFi component ( which is n't ) , hooking up sources and speakers costing 200- 300 times its price .
The manufacturer 's website sells it online for 39 $ but the toy can be bought at other online stores for much less , even as low as 19.45 $ ( at www.ecost.com).
Worldwide shipping may be a problem though .
The only website that deals with international orders I know of is www.thinkgeek.com ( price : 23 $ ) .
This is the place where I anonimously bought the unit(s ) under test .
Certain websites list it as Sonic Impact ( or SI ) Model 5066 : it is exactly the T - Amp , not a different version .
Since this article has been firstly published on our Italian section ( causing a stir ! ) it seems the availability at ThinkGeek may be a concern .
Perhaps you can try with www.partsexpress.com as well .
At present day the amp seems sold - out .
If you want to know why , please read on :-)
Before you think I 'm out of my head you 'd better browse the Internet putting " Sonic Impact T - Amp " on Google and read through the results .
If I 'm mad , I 'm certainly NOT the only one out there .
True Giant - Killer
First things first : this toy delivers 6 watts on a classic 8 ohm load .
Low efficiency loudspeakers owners beware : if your speakers have less than 90 dB/w / m and / or your listening room is large , this amplifier is not for you .
Owners of >90 dB speakers , small listening rooms or moderate listening level habits ... please read on carefully and leave all of your prejudices at home .
This amplifier is STUNNING .
And the review could stop here .
Considering shipping , customs fees , VAT etc you can pay 25 - 30 € max for this item ( non -EU Countries , make your conversions ) .
This means the T - Amp costs more or less than a Music CD .
At this price , it should deliver a multimedia - like kind of sound and should n't even be considered on a HiFi mag like this one .
I understand you can find it hard to believe but I can assure you I found it harder , being the skeptic and investigative guy I am .
Warning : this has been the most thrilling and incredible experience I 've had with a component in , say , 25 years of HiFi listening .
This website has existed since 1995 , I 've reviewed hundreds of HiFi components , inexpensive and ridiculously overpriced ones .
I never - repeat - NEVER came across such a stunning piece of gear in all of these years .
It is not easy to describe how a 20 $ amplifier performs .
First of all , as said , it has no competitors .
The cheapest integrated amplifier I can think of costs 6 - 7 times the T - Amp .
Trust me , it is NOT this kind of amps you should have in mind when comparing the T - Amp .
In order to evaluate it you need to forget its price .
Difficult ?
Not at all !
It becomes very easy once you listen to it : tonal balance , dynamics , 3D imaging , transparency , detail ... consider all these parameters critically and you 'll be amazed by the results .
The tonal balance , with AA batteries , tends to be on the warm side .
It shifts towards neutrality when powered with an external AC adapter .
I 've not tested it with external batteries so I can refer to stock alkaline AA batteries versus AC adapters ( of various sizes ) .
I 've always found the AC adapter power supply better than ( fresh and new ) alkaline batteries .
Thus , my listening notes refer to a T - Amp powered by an external AC adapter ( details on this later ) .
The first feeling is that the mid-high range sounds harsh and sterile .
This attitude changes over time as break - in proceeds .
Many suggest at least 100 hours of break - in ... in my opinion things get better ( and interesting :-) ) ) after a couple of days .
Harshness disappears and what you get is an extreme transparency and detail in the mid and high range .
Voices , in particular , appear crystal clear and very natural .
Even tiny details , such as the sound of opening lips , are revealed effortlessly .
Take for example " Dante 's prayer " ( Loreena McKennitt , from " The book of secrets " - WEA 0630 - 19404-2 - 1997 ) .
When Loreena sings " Please remember me " the P and the B are preceded by the sound of her lips , when opening to sing .
The T - Amp reproduces this " sound " with a sense of presence that is simply stunning .
You feel as the singer is there , right in front of you .
Overall performance on voices was the first of my main concerns .
I expected a kind of harsh and metallic reproduction , considering the " target " of this product but I had to change my mind quickly .
Male and female voices and even choirs do possess a realism that belongs to high class amplifications only .
I 'm not referring to a particular price range here , I 'm talking in absolute terms .
Only from time to time , especially when pushed hard to deliver all of its power , the T - Amp reveals traces of hardness and harshness .
The very same kind of transparency helps in reproducing stringed instruments such as violas , cellos , violins and guitars .
Audiophiles used to the ubiquitous warmness and smoothness of low powered tube amps may initially find strings on the T - Amp too ... metallic .
Actually , in real world and most of the times , strings are made out of metal , rather than silk and wool :-)
What I hear through the T - Amp are extremely realistic strings , rich in harmonic content and low in harshness .
And this was my second main concern : normally , inexpensive HiFi components ( speakers and amplifiers , mainly ) do add an unnatural coloration to stringed instruments .
They make those artificial , almost electronic .
You lose the harmonic content of the notes and find it difficult to detect if it's a real acoustic instrument or a synth that produces those notes .
I 'm sure you are familiar with this tedious effect .
Hence , I was prepared to experience the very same effect with the T - Amp .
And I was wrong , for the second time in a row .
Transparency , presence and realism are in top class here .
Hard to believe , I know , but damn true .
The third point I was going to investigate was the bass range .
If you know my listening habits you should be aware of the fact I 'm a bass - freak : power , depth and control are of paramount importance to my ears .
Considering the target of the T - Amp I was ready for a boom - boom kind of sound .
Overinflated 100 Hz and nothing else to talk about .
Despite all my stupid prejudices the T - Amp delivers a tight and fast bass with excellent extension and impact .
Of course , within the 6 watt limitation !
On the first track of the already cited McKennitt 's album there 's a big drum in the background that makes the air vibrate .
I was listening to this track together with an audiophile friend ... at the very first drum beats we stared in each other 's eyes without saying a word .
We were simply speechless .
Not only the air in the listening room was vibrating but also our listening seats were .
The natural decay of the big drum was so realistic that we could n't believe to our ears .
We could n't help but laugh .
We audiophiles are used to big amplifiers with massive power supplies , heavy cabinets etc in order to make our woofers dance .
Now , looking at the way the Morel woofer of these Merlin 's TSM moves back and forth driven by this tiny - weenie amp is something that destroys , in a second , all our well - established HiFi faiths .
I do n't know how this can be possible but it's here , in front of me and I can't help but try to describe it !
And no , I 'm not driven mad by the low cost of this amp .
Quite the contrary !!!
I 'm somehow irritated by its performance .
I can't tolerate my beloved references finding hard to justify their cost against this plastic toy .
For this reason , I decide to try everything I can to find this amp 's limits and faults .
What can be better than the third track of Rage against the machine 's first album ?
Oh well , this track is such a torture field for many amplifiers , especially if you want all the power and realism this recording can deliver .
Bass and drums are simply devastating .
Well , provided you stay below clipping levels , the T - Amp gets the dirty job done : clean attacks and decays , grooving electric bass tunes glued together to form an explosive mixture .
You want bass ?
You got it .
Deep , powerful , tuneful and articulated till its deeper end .
OK , the first thing that comes to mind is that perhaps I 'm affected by some kind of quickly developing aural disease .
I decide to visit a friend , owner of a mid-class set - up : Rega Planet CD player , Sonus Faber Quid integrated amplifier and DIY speakers with top- class Audax and Focal drivers .
The Sonus Faber Quid was / still is a very good amplifier : pacey , dynamic , extremely revealing and detailed .
Apart from the obvious power output difference ( speakers are of the low efficiency kind ) the T - Amp trashes the Quid , bar none .
Apart from overall dynamics and impact in the bass ( thanks to the extra power ) everything else is done better by the T - Amp : more realistic , cleaner , more natural and with a WAY BIGGER soundstage ( more on this later ) .
Believe me , being the owner of that amp ( given to my friend on permanent loan ) this head to head comparison wss deeply saddening .
I did n't expect such a sad result .
The beloved Sonus Faber of my early years trashed by a plastic toy .
And do n't think the Quid is too old to be good .
It still outperforms a Puccini SE Remote amplifier of these days .
I still can't believe what I 've heard .
Not satisfied and deeply saddened by the results of the listening tests I decide to contact the TNT - Audio staff of reviewers worldwide , our dirty dozen .
And , surprise surprise , Geoff Husband was testing the T - Amp and ... guess what ?
he was getting the very same results .
Everyone must hear or have one , he replied .
If you 're asking our opinion because you think you 've suddenly become deaf ... well , you 're not deaf , my friend , this is a giant - killer .
Here 's his brief opinion on this little marvel .
We 're a competitive lot at TNT - Audio .
Often we find something interesting and sort of spring it on the others on the staff as our " find " .
So you can imagine my annoyance when I received an email from our illustrious editor - quote : " BUY a Sonic Impact T - Amp .
At 20 $ it is the most incredible thing I 've ever come across in 25 years of HiFi Passion .
I 'd like to receive feedback from other trained ears .... "
Damn ...
You see I 'd been sitting on the same amp for a month and was just getting round to doing some serious playing with it and getting very excited in the process .
Lucio's email meant he beat me to it , but it also showed something that I 'd experienced myself , a certain need to check I was n't losing the plot before going to print .
So Lucio - here 's my take on the thing ...
Regular readers will know that my main system is powered by am Audionote M3 pre / Quest Silver 300b SE monoblocks driving a pair of Loth-x Polaris full - range horns .
Now rumours on the web had the Sonic - Impact ( SI ) competing with megabuck single - ended valve amps so I guess I was perfect for the comparison .
The Polaris have got to be one of the most efficient , and easiest to drive speakers out there so the SI would be in it 's element , never needing to draw more than a couple of watts .
So purely in the interests of research I unplugged the Audionotes , wired the Audionote Zero CD player direct into the SI via a pair of cheapo cables and a phono - jack adaptor ( not even gold plated ! ) .
As the usual Sonic Link hosepipe would n't cram enough of its strands into the naff spring clips I used some really cruddy thin speaker cable I got with some cheap car speakers I 'd bought years ago .
Switch on and of course the thing was silent , none of the hiss and hum of the valves .
Putting on a bit of Steely Dan ' Aja ' I sat back .
Holy s**t!
For less than half the cost of one of the cheapest 300b valves this thing was making music .
Huge soundstage width , detail right up there with the Audionote pairing , fast and punchy .
This would seriously impress the neighbours .
Obviously it'd go really loud .
This is n't my review , and I 'm not going to go into great detail here , but to put this into perspective ( did I really say that ?
A $ 30 amp against a $ 15,000 combo ? ) if tomorrow I invited one of you readers into my home and wired up half a dozen of the big - buck valve amps I 'd had here over the last couple of years and , sight unseen , slipped in the SI as one of the test amps it would n't have been out of place .
But , and it's a big BUT , it does n't sound like an SE .
Crippled as it was by the worst possible cables and connectors it managed to sound hard and flat next to my own amps , I can't measure emotion , but some of it was gone .
It lacked the warmth and soul and ambience that they bring to the party .
The 3 - d imaging was limited but the soundstage width stunning , the detail top notch and the music relatively undamaged , it also lacked the grain of any transistor amp within 30 x its price .
That said I would take it over some very expensive amps I 've heard , and if I was forced to " downgrade " my system by $ 15,000 it would be the SI that would make it bearable .
But think on - what would it do with decent cabling ?
What about playing with better power supplies ?
( the Graham Slee PSU 's from his phono stages might be perfect ) .
What about swapping a couple of components / connectors for decent stuff .
What about buying two and bi-amping , or four and quad amping ?
What about running one as a power - amp using a high - end pre ?
Buy an active x-over and go mad .
What about buying a really flash box , putting on some blue LED's and some chunky binding posts and sockets , a BIG volume knob and selling it for $ 10,000 muha , muhaha !
muhahahaha argh gurgle !
But seriously folks - how 's this for an idea ?
Buy two .
Build some high efficiency boxes , maybe our TNT BFB and run " monoblocked " with one channel from each amp driving a full - range driver and the other a supertweeter ?
High - end for $ 150 ?
I 'm not going to tell you what or how to do it because at this money you can just PLAY !
Me ?
I 've just hit Ebay for a pair of 40 year - old Goodman 401 full - rangers ( 12 " ) for $ 50 and I have plans .
After three years of disappearing up my own backside with more and more expensive equipment I feel like hi-fi is suddenly exciting again .
GO BUY ONE , then write a thankyou note to Lucio .
Geoff Husband - www.tnt-audio.com
Now , reassuered about the state of my ears ( and mind ) by Geoff 's words I was ready to try everything to get the best out of this tiny marvel .
First of all , a decent " oversized " power supply was necessary .
Sonic Impact 's AC adapter should be capable of 1.2 - 1.5 amperes max on 12 Volts but is available for 120 Volt only .
I needed something more .
For a mere 30 € I 've found an Italian - made stabilized AC adapter which delivers 5 amperes of current on 13.8 Volts .
I would n't recommend to get any closer to 14 volts than that .
With this power supply I can feed two or three T - Amps for passive bi-amping or tri-amping .
For those who can be interested in details , the product is the ZetaGi HP 145 .
Other power supplies are available hence I 'm not saying this is the best one can buy .
It is rather inexpensive , nicely built and ... powerful :-)
Powered by this AC adapter the T - Amp starts to sing seriously : power output and impact increase and , most notably , the bass range earns weight , punch and grunt .
That 's the way - ah ah - I like it ! :-)
Dynamics
As said , everything is in relation with the low power output .
Within its power limitations , the dynamic performance of this amplifier is impressive : perhaps not as fast and punchy as the best things out there but you 'll find it hard to believe - in a blind test - this is just a 6 watts amplifier .
It should be remarked , though , that ideal partners are mid-to - high sensitivity loudspeakers ( say , above 92 - 93 dB ) , provided you want to listen to realistic Music levels .
On the other hand , it is well know that many audiophiles , even with 88 - 89 dB loudspeakers , only use 5 - 6 watts , no more that that , during usual listenings .
Perhaps not extremely fast , the T - Amp can still pump much Life into Music , in a very natural way , effortlessly , I 'd say .
With high sensitivity speakers ( see what Geoff writes ) things can be much better than that .
I 'm planning further tests with higher sensitivity loudspeakers and report back ( please be patient :-) ) .
The bass range , especially the first octave , appears slow from time to time and smoother than it should be .
Even attacks and decays could be crisper .
BUT !!!!
I 'm talking of a 23 $ amplifier .
Repeat after me : 23 dollars !
Music CDs can be much more expensive than that !
3D Imaging and soundstage
Oh My !
Was it me who wrote good imaging is something possible with expensive amplifiers only ?
Shame on me .
This little plastic thing reproduces a HUGE soundstage , especially in terms of width .
Hard to believe , again , but the width of the stage is on a par with top class amplifications .
Height and depth are still extremely good though not so excellent .
Actually this is the aspect of the overall T - Amp performance that leaves me mostly speechless .
You get everything you may wish from a high - end amplifier : several , distinct virtual planes , good focus and geometrically realistic proportions .
There 's air , too !
The friend with the Sonus Faber Quid amp phoned me a couple of days ago saying he discovered imaging and soundstage on CDs he considered totally flat and zero- dimensional .
If this is not MAGIC , please tell me how to call it .
I 'm still very confused .
Well , dudes , this is a first , perhaps not 100 % accurate , listening test .
Of course I need more time to fully understand what 's happening but I wanted to share this ( incredible ) findings with you .
I will test the T - Amp on very different situations , partners , rooms etc .
I will try tweaks and any sort of thing to make it sound at its best but , even out of the box , this is a MARVEL .
Just to state things clearer : I 'm not saying this is a sort of new NAD 3020 .
No , this is MUCH , MUCH MORE .
This is an amplifier that , if paired with sensitive speakers , can make you forget the need for expensive amplification systems .
I understand you are skeptic , perhaps you 're thinking this is a joke or an experiment .
Not so .
I 've even tried to limit my enthusiasm , being a " first approach " with the T - Amp .
Anyway , perhaps I 'm 100 % mad but certainly I 'm not alone .
Just put " Sonic Impact T - Amp " on Google and read what other audiophiles think ( I suggest the brilliant www.6moons.com review to start with ) .
Some advice
First of all , DO NOT judge the T - Amp with batteries or with el cheapo cables , especially the one supplied .
This gem can sound MUCH better than that .
Add a decent AC adapter , better if stabilized and with good current delivery (> 2A ) .
If possible , avoid switching power supplies , in order to limit RF garbage going through the mains .
Warning : on the DC inlet there 's no indication of the correct polarity : the central pin is " positive " (+ ) .
Use your own interconnects , buy a minijack - RCA adapter like the one you can see in the pic .
It costs a couple of euros and can be found at any megastore near you .
If you hate adapters you can to build your own interconnect or use the minijack - RCA cables made by Monster Cable for portables ( Interlink 200 and 400 ) .
Unluckly , these cables are directional so the shielding - with the T - Amp - will be connected the wrong way .
Not a real problem , the cable works , even if the shielding properties are greatly reduced .
Anyway , the best thing to do in order to fairly compare the T - Amp with your own reference amp is to use the minijack - RCA adapter with your own reference interconnects .
The T - Amp is extremely light , heavy cables can make it fall or flip upside down .
Four , small drops of blue - tac will help keeping it stable .
I 'm trying different feet and getting very good results with the Bright Star Audio Isonodes .
Break - in and warm - up are strictly necessary .
Some say 100 hours of break - in at least ... I 'd say even 50 hours are sufficient .
Things get better slowly , though .
Do not be in a hurry !
The TA2024 chipset is hyper - protected so there 's no risk of burning it up with excessive heat .
Anyway , try to stay far from clipping .
Even excessive voltages can kill it .
Max voltage should be 13.2 .
Mine is playing at 13.8 and is doing well .
I 've even tried 12 V but I tend to prefer 13.8 .
Anyway , perhaps I 've been lucky !
Stay below 13.2 and you 'll be home and safe .
I 've tried to power it with a 19.6 switching power supply ... the amp survived , despite the excessive voltage .
Anyway , there 's no reason to exceed specifications .
As for batteries , I 've tried 8 AA alkaline batteries .
Perhaps better batteries will make the amp sound better ... I do not know , feel free to experiment .
One can use the t- Amp as headphone amp , with caution : first of all , there 's no output jack so one has to adapt the speakers posts to a female jack .
Secondly , frequency response rises at the highs as the load increases .
Tripath claims the output filter should be designed to make the amp linear till 16 ohms .
Hence , I 'd suggest using extremely low impedance headphones or ask a techinician to modify the output filter settings .
Finally , the T - Amp uses distinct L - R grounds , while headphone normally connect these together .
This can destroy the T - Amp .
If you are thinking to bridge it in order to get a mono amp with more power ... forget it !
The T - Amp can't be bridged !
Finally , of course you can use the T - Amp to power your PC sound card but , trust me , it deserves much more than cheap PC speakers .
If you use more than one Music source ( e.g. CD player , PC , tuner or turntable ) you may need a preamplifier .
You might wish this to be small , inexpensive and supplied with a built - in phono stage .
It exists !
It is the T - Preamp and it can be powered with the same power supply the T - Amp uses ( 12 Volts ) .
Tweakings
Before you ask , audiophile versions of this unit are already available .
As an excellent and brilliant example , have a look at Vinnie Rossi's Clari - T - Amp .
If you feel you just need a fancier metallic case , with standard RCA inputs and speaker posts , look no further than the T - Amp cabinet .
If you want more , do n't ask , just browse the Net , it is plenty of pages and discussions related to the T - Amp and Tripath - based amps .
A complete tweaking session ( new box , new volume pot , new posts , connectors etc ) is now available here on TNT - Audio .
Tons of pics and a fool - proof step_by_step procedure , useful even for absolute beginners !
Complaints
Manufacturing and finish .
What do you expect I should say ?
It is damn cheap , anyway it is nicely built and finished .
For sure it possesses one of the highest WAF ( Wife Acceptance Factor ) ever seen on Planet Earth :-)
The loudspeakers spring clips are flimsy and easy to break .
Plus they do n't accept anything else than 1.5 - 2.0 mmq bare wire .
As the T - Amp so small , there 's not enough room between the input minijack and the DC power inlet .
The volume knob is n't exactly user - friendly though extremely precise :-)
Sound .
Uhm , here are my notes : output power is too low , sometimes it sounds harsh in the highs and slow in the first octave .
The bass range , from time to time , lacks control , especially when pushed too hard .
Overall dynamics not excellent .
Now , re-read thinking at the 23 $ - price target .
I know , I 'd better keep my mouth shut :-|
Conclusions ( sort of )
If you have read till now without feeling the urge of buying one , I 've failed my goal :-)
This is something everyone should own or test at least once in a lifetime .
It helps in building a totally new perspective .
I 'm not saying : sell your Mark Levinson , Audio Research , Halcro or Jadis ...
I 'm just saying this amp is a wonder , something that can cause serious trouble even to mid class amplifications .
In other words , after you listen to the T - Amp , you need to reset your " best - buy " parameters .
Compared to it , many best - buys are simply meaningless .
The term " best buy " itself becomes meaningless .
In case you wo n't like it , you can give it to a non-audiophile friend or to your son for an entry - level audiophile system .
This is a TRUE audiophile - grade amplifier , it will rock your World like no other HiFi component you 've come across till now .
Please , do not take my words as gospel , buy one and listen without prejudice ( if you can ! ) .
You 'll agree .
We 've started collecting and publishing your opinions on this amplifier .
We have even published a review from a high - end turntables and tonearms designer , Carlo Morsiani .
