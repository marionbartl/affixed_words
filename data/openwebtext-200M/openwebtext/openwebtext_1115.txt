The Los Angeles wildfire known as the Station Fire has consumed 42,500 acres of land , burned down 18 homes , and it ’s only 5 % contained as of this writing .
Being as this fire is going on about three miles from The Drill Down recording studios , I thought I ’d take this opportunity to share with you some pretty cool time - lapse videos of the fire that have popped up across the tubernets .
YouTube user TimCJ1215 shot this first one .
Watch as the fire heads downslope , eventually consuming the entire hillside .
Eric Spiegelman shot this one , showing the endless billowing smoke filling the sky .
Dan Finnerty used a Canon EOS 5D2 to capture this eerie churning sight .
Here ’s another great one by Dan Finnerty that spans the time from day to night .
Much thanks to these terrific videographers / photographers for a beautiful look at a terrible disaster .

Stress Testing Microsoft's Free Anti-virus Offering
Microsoft 's free new anti-virus product is earning decent marks in preliminary tests , putting it roughly on par with many other stand - alone anti-virus products available today .
A number of readers seem keen to try out Microsoft Security Essentials ( MSE ) , but are eager to hear how the program stacks up against other free anti-virus tools in terms of detecting and removing malware .
While the results of early testing may not provide that side - by - side comparison , they do offer a glimpse of how effective MSE may be in blocking and tackling some of the most common threats currently in circulation .
The MSE performance analysis comes from av-test.org , a group that routinely publishes the results of anti-virus stress tests .
AV - Test ran MSE against 3,732 samples of malware that are currently infecting PCs around the world , and found that the program blocked all of them , both when the samples were opened or accessed and when the malware was manually scanned .
Using Windows XP as a testbed , AV - Test also dunked MSE into a hostile environment of more than 545,000 current computer worms , viruses , backdoors , bots and Trojan horses , and found that it was able to detect more than 98 percent of those samples .
Pitted against threats labeled adware and spyware , MSE earned a detection score of just over 90 percent .
AV - Test 's Andreas Marx said the group 's testing found MSE had no effective " dynamic detection " against a handful of very recently released malware samples .
Still , Marx said , other anti-virus - only offerings do n't appear to offer much in the way of dynamic detection either .
" In most cases they are only available in the Internet Security Suites editions of the products , " Marx said .
Marx said testing showed that MSE 's scanning speed was about average , but that the product excelled at detecting and removing " rootkits , " stealthy software designed to burrow deep into the operating system in a bid to hide the presence of malicious files .
AV - Test also found that the product effectively removed malware threats , but often times left behind certain inactive components of the threat ( e.g. some inactive executable files , empty " Run " entries in the Registry , the Windows firewall remains disabled , the " hosts " file remains modified ) .
Windows users should bear in mind that no matter how well an anti-virus product performs in the most rigorous of tests , no anti-virus product can secure the system against reckless or high - risk security behavior .
By " reckless , " I 'm talking about installing software of dubious origin , downloading executable programs from peer - to - peer file - sharing networks , and clicking on attachments in unsolicited e-mail .
Update , Oct. 1 , 9:43 a.m. ET : Here 's a shocker : Anti-virus industry giant Symantec Corp. continues its free - av - ain 't - up - to - snuff claim , with a blog entry that labels MSE " little more than a bad rerun of Microsoft 's infamous history of offering consumers incomplete and ineffective protection .

Curious new remedy for obesity implemented by scientists of British Empire College will suppress appetite and look as a chewing gum .
Its major component , pancreas gland hormone , is well - known as a remedy for obesity .
This hormone emulates a satiety feeling and blocks digestive ferments forming in pancreas gland .
Being injected with this hormone , volunteers consumed 15 - 20 per cent of their regular daily nutritional ratio , and the weight losses reached 15 per cent of the initial measurements .
To successfully manufacture the remedy , the scientists are to discover how to prolong its effect up to 24 hours which is possible if the new medication appears in pharmacies in the form of injections .
The project supervisor Professor Blum thinks that the new remedy of natural origin will prove as safer and more effective when compared to the existing methods of obesity treatment .
Besides , this hormone is capable of reducing chances to develop diseases which co-exist with obesity , namely diabetes , cancer and cardio - vascular pathologies .

We got word of a brand new Special Infected coming to Left 4 Dead 2 from reader Josh , which we promptly followed up with Valve to get official confirmation .
Those attending PAX will be the first to witness the arrival of The Jockey , perhaps the most annoying - yet - awesome sounding Special Infected of them all .
The Jockey is a smaller zombie who jumps on the backs of Survivors and tears them apart from behind .
Not only that , but he gets to control the movements of the Survivor while he 's doing it , meaning that Versus Mode just got a whole lot crazier .
Sounds like a helpful little guy who'll help guide the Survivors into ambushes and other desirable locations .
That 's all we know so far .
We 'll get to see him in the flesh at PAX .
Bosko Balaban
In 2001 , the Aston Villa manager John Gregory spent £ 6 m on Balaban , a player who did n't start a single league game in two - and - a - half years and was given a £ 1 m pay - off when he left in 2004 , announcing that " Villa is all bullshit " .
Gregory thought Balaban was the last piece of the jigsaw .
He might well have been , but it was a completely different puzzle : Balaban was one of a number of signings around the period who were palpably not suited to the muck and bullets of English football

Deposed Honduras President Manuel Zelaya and his supporters have had to live on biscuits and are unable to wash , a Brazilian diplomat says .
Mr Zelaya has been taking refuge in Brazil 's embassy in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa since making a surprise return on Monday .
About 50 people are believed to be with him , including family and supporters .
Diplomat Francisco Rezende Catunda told the BBC that the situation inside the embassy was " precarious " .
" We have survived a few days eating biscuits , a very irregular diet , " he told the BBC's Brazilian service , adding that the group had their first proper meal on Thursday .
" I would n't say that we are starving , but the situation is extremely precarious . "
We support Mr Zelaya , but we are unable to accommodate so many people
Francisco Rezende Catunda Mr Catunda said the people inside had no soap or towels and no changes of clothes .
He said the military , which is surrounding the building , had allowed only eight of the embassy 's 12 staff to leave .
" Many of us have family obligations and need to leave , but are being prevented from doing so . "

He said the troops were not respecting passes issued to people on the outside to allow access to the compound .
" They have not stated categorically that entry is forbidden , they just are n't responding to anything , " he said .
' Inhuman '
The embassy building has been surrounded by police and troops since Mr Zelaya first appeared there on Monday , saying he had slipped back into Honduras on foot to restore democracy .
Some food aid is being allowed into the embassy building
He had been in exile for nearly three months , after being driven from the country at gun point .
At least one person has died in protests around the embassy - Mr Zelaya 's supporters put the figure at 10 .
A curfew order on Tegucigalpa was lifted on Thursday .
Mr Catunda said that in the early days , about 300 people were in the embassy with Mr Zelaya .
He said 50 or 60 people now remain , including Mr Zelaya 's wife and other relatives , who are receiving food deliveries from the UN .
" It is a delicate situation , " said Mr Catunda .
" We support Mr Zelaya , but we are unable to accommodate so many people . "
Milton Benitez , a Zelaya supporter inside the embassy , said the deposed leader was sleeping on an inflatable mattress while many people were spending the nights on the floor .
I will submit myself to any trial because my hands are clean and my chin is up
Manuel Zelaya
Zelaya speaks to BBC Transcript : Micheletti interview Views from Honduras
" We are living in inhuman conditions , " Mr Benitez told the AP news agency .
But he said Mr Zelaya had been encouraging everyone to " stay calm and be patient " .
On Friday , Mr Zelaya and the interim government , led by Roberto Micheletti , held informal talks in a bid to end the stand - off .
Mr Zelaya said the meeting was a positive first step , but the interim government has stressed the talks are not about returning him to power .
The crisis erupted after Mr Zelaya tried to hold a non-binding public consultation in July , asking people whether they supported moves to change the constitution .
His opponents said the move was unconstitutional and was aimed at removing the current one - term limit on serving as president , so paving the way for Mr Zelaya 's possible re-election .
He has denied this .

" Buket , " the daredevil tagger who gained Internet notoriety for his brazen , daylight tagging of a sign over the 101 Freeway and vandalism of a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus , was sentenced today to three years and eight months in state prison .
Cyrus Yazdani , 26 , was on probation after pleading guilty in December to 32 felony vandalism counts .
In July , he pleaded no contest to one count of felony vandalism and accepted financial responsibility for five vandalism incidents .
Four of the counts were dismissed today .
Yazdani must pay $ 117,196 in restitution .
Los Angeles County sheriff 's transit investigators arrested Yazdani in May after " Buket " tags appeared on the 7th Street Bridge , the Cesar Chavez Bridge and in the 4200 block of South Broadway .
Sheriff 's officials said Yazdani was found in possession of scribers , which are used in tagging .
He also had paint splatter on his clothing .

Apple 's WebKit HTML rendering engine has gained experimental support for WebGL , an emerging standard that aims to bring native 3D graphics to the Web .
The WebGL implementation has landed in the WebKit source tree , but the feature is not yet enabled by default in nightly builds , indicating that it is still at a very early stage of development .
The WebGL standard is being devised by a coalition of browser vendors and other interested parties in collaboration with the Khronos Group , an industry consortium that oversees OpenGL and a number of other standards relating to graphics and media .
The goal of WebGL is to expose the low - level OpenGL ES 2.0 APIs through JavaScript so that they can be used to draw hardware - accelerated 3D graphics in the HTML Canvas element .
The WebGL standardization effort first emerged last year when a Mozilla developer built a proof - of - concept Firefox plugin that demonstrated 3D graphics in the browser .
A team at Seneca College began working on a complementary initiative to build a high - level 3D library called C3DL on top of the plugin .
Mozilla and Khronos teamed up in March to explore the potential for turning the concept into a standard .
Last month , Khronos officially announced the formation of the WebGL working group and invited the industry to participate in the standards process .
Apple is clearly on board with the effort and is actively working on its own implementation for WebKit .
Jeffrey Rosen , a developer at independent game studio Wolfire Games , noticed the new WebGL code while compiling a recent revision of WebKit trunk .
He recorded a video that shows WebKit running Apple 's WebGL tests , which include spinning 3D shapes such as the famous Utah teapot .
" In the same way Gmail is killing desktop mail applications , full - fledged 3D video games could start migrating to the web , " wrote Rosen in a blog entry .
" Flash gaming would have a serious run for its money as more advanced , standards - based , hardware - accelerated games started popping up .
This would have huge implications for the entire PC gaming market , which I might explore in a separate blog post . "
Apple 's support for WebGL in WebKit demonstrates that the concept is gaining traction among browser vendors .
Google also recently affirmed its commitment to support the standard despite having its own 3D Web initiative .
Apple has shown considerable interest in the potential of 3D graphics on the Web .
Previous to its effort to implement WebGL , Apple devised its own CSS extensions for applying 3D animations to Web elements .
The company 's novel 3D CSS transforms are already relatively mature and supported on the iPhone and in the version of Safari that is included in Snow Leopard .
Although it will take time for WebGL to gain robust support across the full spectrum of modern browsers , there appears to be considerable progress and swift forward momentum .
Between Apple and Mozilla , there are now two open source implementations that can push 3D graphics to the screen .
As these implementations mature , it 's likely that more sophisticated demos will emerge .
This is a major victory for the open Web as it will expand the range of rich content that can be delivered with vendor - neutral standards - based technologies without needing proprietary plugins .

A listener from down - under sent us a PDF attachment from the vaccine manufacturer CSL Group detailing information on Panvax inoculation procedures for healthcare workers .
CSL is one of the main producers of Panvax in the southern hemisphere .
Here is the link to the PDF posted on their website .
After a quick scan of the Powerpoint presentation , I prepared a list of the more interesting slides .
Slide 3 : Refers to targeted groups as herds .
Slides 4 & 5 : Lists of priority tiers
Slide 16 : What is Panvax ?
( Note image from presentation below )
Slides 18 to 24 : Lists ingredients including thiomersal .
Slide 19 : Admits that is causes toxic effects .
Slide 25 : “ Previously —
The vaccination course consists of 2 doses of 15 ug of antigen at least 21 days apart … .
This now no longer applies .
The vaccination course consists of 1 dose of 15 ug of antigen for those aged 9 years of age and older . ”
Slide 26 : “ Children aged 6 months to ( 9 years of age require 2 doses with a minimal interval of 21 days ) . ”
Slide 28 : Recommends that children under 10 wait for the “ thiomersal free vaccine , ” however Slide 20 says “ There is no evidence that thiomersal has caused any developmental or neurological abnormalities , such as ADHD or Autism . ”
Slide 47 : Shows picture of heavily armed police and ties them to vaccine protection .
Slides 57 to 61 : Section titles “ Who should not get the vaccine ? ”
Slides 66 & 67 : List Guillian - Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) as vaccine side effect .
Slides 76 & 77 : Talks about consent .
There is plenty of food for thought about the vaccines , according to Dr. Mayer Eisenstein , ( see his Do n’t Vaccinae !
Before You Educate “ Do n’t Vaccinate Before You Educate )
From the CSL website :
The CSL Group has a combined heritage of outstanding contribution to medicine and human health with more than 90 years experience in the development and manufacture of vaccines and plasma protein biotherapies .
With major facilities in Australia , Germany , Switzerland and the US , CSL has over 10,000 employees working in 27 countries .

Riding high : Bike enthusiast develops electric Penny - farthing that travels up to 13mph
Fifteen seconds was all it took to snap everything into place .
One moment it lay folded neatly , the next - like a magic trick - it was ready for the road .
A little lever here . . . a tug on the saddle there . . . a press on the button to start it .
That was the easy bit .
Now , try to imagine you are sitting on a bar stool that suddenly takes off at 10 mph .
The wind blows your hair and forces your face into a grin that resembles something between joy and terror .
And then , gradually , the grin turns into a smug smile .
I have just become the first British journalist to road test the YikeBike , billed as a mini penny - farthing for the 21st century .
Easy ride : Paul Harris puts the YikeBike through its paces without ever breaking a sweat due to the electric motor
It might look like a collision between a praying mantis and a child 's scooter , but it 's the result of five years of work to reinvent the wheel , with one important addition : an electric motor .
It 's a bicycle , but not as we have come to know it .
For a start , you sit upright and steer with your hands at your side .
Your feet remain static on the folding footrests and your fingers work the controls , principally an accelerator and a brake .
The seating arrangement and dimensions mean you do n't so much ride it as wear it .
Crucially , you can fold it into a bag and carry the whole 22lb package anywhere .
True , it takes a little while to get used to riding it , especially if you 've been raised on the kind of configuration that has so far proved perfectly adequate for everyone from Miss Marple to Sir Chris Hoy .
But there 's one word which summarises the sensation of blatting along so quickly and so effortlessly on this rather clever piece of engineering : Yikes !
Convenience : The YikeBike can be folded into a bag and at 22lb is an easy package to carry around anywhere
Traditional cyclists move cautiously to one side as I approach .
One of the Lycra brigade gives a snooty look as he whizzes past on his racing bike , but I can't help noticing he 's sweating a lot .
I 'm wearing a linen suit and I 'm perfectly relaxed .
Meanwhile everyone - from children to City gents - stands and looks in wonder as I float by .
You can't really blame them .
Viewed head on , it looks as if the rider is running without moving his legs .
Then they notice the noise .
The 1.2 kilowatt motor sounds a little like a miniature milk float when you take off but changes to a satisfying , muted whoosh once it picks up .
Even though I 've ridden motorcycles for decades , commuted on a bike , fallen off a circus unicycle , and once drove Sir Clive Sinclair 's doomed C5 through the London rush hour , I could n't recommend a novice to risk traffic on the YikeBike without appropriate tuition and practice .
Victorian design : People with their penny - farthing bicycles in London
So I have a question for inventor Grant Ryan and engineer Peter Higgins , in London from their native New Zealand prior to launching the YikeBike at the Eurobike trade fair in Germany today .
Why change a design which has been around since Victorian times and is preferred by an estimated billion cyclists around the world ?
' We 're not trying to compete with traditional bikes , ' says Grant .
' We aimed to produce an electric bike that was portable , lightweight , compact , practical and fun .
' We wanted something you could ride to the bus stop in the morning , take to the office and charge up under your desk .
' The simplest choice would be a unicycle but they 're really difficult to ride .
So we went back to the future and came up with the penny farthing .
' The main difference is that the original penny - farthing was so tall , if you fell off from that height , you could die .
The YikeBike is smaller , simpler , safer , faster and lighter .
' In all the time we 've been teaching people to ride it , we 've never had anyone hit the dirt . '

Two vicious young thugs tortured a pair of friends during a sickening attack that left one of them on the brink of death .
The wicked brothers , aged 10 and 11 , subjected their innocent victims to a horrendous ordeal during which they beat them with bricks , tried to throttle them and forced them to carry out vile sex acts on each other .
One of the boys , aged 11 , had a ceramic sink dropped on his head before being left unconscious .
He was 30 minutes from death .
Earlier he pleaded with the thugs : " Let me die . "
His nine - year - old friend , also his nephew , had his eyes and ears burned in the attack at Edlington , South Yorks .
After the yobs admitted GBH yesterday , the youngster 's furious dad said : " I want them hanged . "
It is claimed the pair were such a handful their mum would put cannabis in their food in a bid to get some peace .
The vile thugs who tortured two young boys tormented their terrified victims by threatening to kill them as they begged for mercy .
After the brothers , aged 10 and 11 , had subjected the friends to a sickening session of violence they turned to walk away .
The victims , aged 11 and nine , thought their ordeal was over .
But prosecutor Graham Measures told how one of the yobs cruelly sneered : " We ca n't go yet , we have n't killed them . "
It was all too much for the 11 - year - old who pleaded with the brothers : " Leave me to die . "
The youngster was 30 minutes from death when found halfnaked in a stream after a catalogue of abuse that included having a ceramic sink dropped on his head and being forced to perform sex acts on his friend .
His dad said yesterday he had no doubt the pair intended to kill the boys and " should be hanged " .
He added : " They tried to kill my son .
They were trying to kill both of them .
It was premeditated .
" They had tied barbed wire from one tree to another and strangled them .
They smashed a sink over his head .
They set it up . "
The victims ' ordeal began when they were lured to waste ground near their homes in Edlington , South Yorks , in April .
The thugs said there were toads in the area .
But when they got there the boys were beaten with bricks and sticks , forced to eat nettles , had cigarettes stubbed out in open wounds , and were almost throttled by the barbed wire .
The 11 - year - old fell unconscious and was so badly injured he had to be airlifted to hospital .
He also had a noose placed around his neck .
His friend , who is also his nephew , had his ear and eyelids burned with cigarettes and rocks thrown at him .
His genitals and face were stamped on and he was forced to smoke by the yobs .
The court heard how one brother broke a branch from a tree and rammed the sharp end into his arm , ripping his skin to the bone .
One of the thugs then pushed cigarettes into the wound which needed plastic surgery .
He was then told to " go away and kill himself " by the brothers .
The terrified youngster plunged a stick down his own throat .
The boys ' tormentors tried to force them to perform sex acts on each other and kiss .
Rescuers eventually found the 11 - year - old after his nephew fled the scene and got help .
He stumbled across neighbours but was so covered in blood only his eyes showed .
Prosecutor Mr Measures said at an earlier youth court hearing : " Both of them were subjected to a horrific , violent , sustained physical attack . "
One court official burst into tears after listening to the eldest victim 's ordeal .
It was also revealed the thugs carried out a similar assault on another boy a week before their sickening attack .
The parents of the older victim believe that the youngsters may never fully recover mentally from their ordeal .
His mum added : " Our son is trying to put it behind him , but he 's not managed it really . "
And she said of the thugs ' actions : " It 's up to the parents .
They should have been there for them in the first place . "
The depraved brothers both admitted GBH , robbery and inciting the boys to engage in sexual activity .
Yesterday , the older boy yawned in Sheffield crown court as the details of his horrific crimes were outlined .
They could face life .
Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell said the pair were not charged with attempted murder as there were doubts a jury could conclude they intended to kill .
But he added : " The maximum sentence for GBH with intent and attempted murder are the same . "
Last night the brothers were being held separately in secure accommodation .
They will have psychiatric tests which could last three months before being sentenced .
At the time of the assault , the brothers should have been at a police station answering questions about an earlier attack .
The details of their crimes were revealed at the earlier hearing , three days after they tortured the boys , but they could only be reported yesterday .
None of the boys can be named for legal reasons .
But the 11 - year - old 's father , 44 , said : " I want the thugs ' names plastered across the papers so the world can know what they did . "
Det Supt Mick Mason said later : " This crime was extremely shocking and it ranks up there with the most serious I have ever dealt with . "

China 's new model of ' model workers ' By He Na ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-09-28 09:26
As China entered the 1990s , more and more manual labor began to be replaced with machines .
This was especially true after the promulgation of the Labor Law in 1994 , which clearly prohibited unlimited overtime .
More importantly , entrepreneurs and managers with insight and courage began to play a more important role in China 's switch from a planned to a market economy .
More than 340 entrepreneurs and managers were elected during the eighth National Model Worker Conference in 1989 .
In 1995 , 2,873 people were elected as national model workers , among whom heads of enterprises numbered 409 .
" It is not surprising that nowadays when you open the resumes of most of the entrepreneurs and managers of large - scale enterprises , they were all once elected as model workers , " says You Zhenglin , associate professor of sociology at China University of Politics and Law .
" Few frontline workers get the honor now , because they have been left far behind by the intellectual group in creating wealth for the country , " says You .
In a bid to balance the proportion of model workers from different fields , the State Council decided before the opening of the 1989 conference to guarantee that at least a third of the elected model workers would be frontline workers .
It also revised and standardized the selection criteria for model workers .
In 2005 , the model worker title was bestowed on basketball player Yao Ming and hurdler Liu Xiang , and Liu Yonghao , one of China 's richest men then .
The same year , the people 's government of Dalian honored seven foreign managers working in the Dalian Development Zone with the title of model worker .
Today 's model workers are not laborers in the traditional sense .
Those who work in air - conditioned rooms , frequent five - star hotels and drive luxury cars are also deemed entitled to the honor .
Dissatisfaction over the changing profile of model workers has sparked quite a heated debate on the Internet .
According to Professor Zhou Xiaozheng of Renmin University of China , it is a little strange to honor athletes as model workers .
" We can not take athletes as common people , for their success and achievements owe not only to their efforts , but also a lot to the physical quality they are born with , " he says .
" It is not easy for common people to follow their model . "
Some online posters have even sarcastically suggested new selection criteria such as being good at flattery , able to win the hearts of leaders and being skilled at self - promotion .
But many continue to support the new breed of model workers , saying they do n't necessarily have to imply meager incomes and low living standards .
" The assessment procedures to select model workers need to be revised , because today 's society needs knowledgeable and skilled workers , " says professor Zhou Yunlong , of Northeast China Institute of Electric Power Engineering .
" A model worker is one who excels in his field of work , reflecting the values most cherished by a society at a particular period in time .
" Although Yao is not a laborer , he works very hard and worked his way to win honors for the country .
He truly is a model worker . "

Many readers have made this point about that amazing Palin beauty - queen photo here :
It was n't Palin in red that grabbed my eye in the photo - it was the use of the American flag in the photo .
It 's not proper to display the flag to have it draped over a chair .
Just imagine the outrage on Fox News if there was a photo of Obama and an improper display of the Stars and Stripes !
Here 's an online guide to flag etiquette which Palin clearly violates .
But in one of her recent calendars , she is literally draped in it like a shawl .
I 'm not a stickler for this kind of thing , and do n't think it 's that big a deal , but many are , especially Palinites .
And my reader is right .
If Obama had done this , it would be non -stop on Fox .

Mark Kiesel saw the real estate crash coming .
Kiesel , a managing director at investment firm Pimco , was n’t alone in his 2006 warning of a looming housing market meltdown .
But he was among the few who put his money -- in his case , a lot of it -- where his mouth was .
Kiesel and his wife , Amy , sold their Newport Beach house in the summer of 2006 for 20 % more than they had paid and moved into an apartment one - fifth the size .
Now , news reports highlight signs of a real estate market bottom .
And the Kiesels are still renting .

Just as experts could n’t precisely time the bursting of the housing bubble , no one claims to know exactly when the market will hit its bottom .
There are plenty of pundits weighing in with predictions on when the housing crisis will end , but knowing what to do is tougher than knowing what to say .
For those who sold homes during the bubble , actions can be as telling as words .
“ We ’re not there yet , ” Kiesel said , referring to the bottom in housing prices .
“ I plan to buy when I can get a place for 50 cents on the dollar ” compared with the market peak , he said .
Kiesel turned out to be right about the housing bubble .
But three years ago , he did n’t think the crash was going to be as prolonged as it has turned out to be .
The Kiesels probably will stay in the apartment longer than planned , he said , perhaps even until 2011 .

Declining prices are driving home sales up over last year ’s levels in Southern California and statewide .
Nationally , sales are still below year - earlier levels but have been inching up .
Nobel laureate and Princeton University economist Paul Krugman and his economist wife , Robin Wells , bought a $ 1.7 - million Manhattan apartment this month .
The New York residence had earlier been listed for close to $ 2.5 million .
Dean Baker , a Washington economist , also bought recently .
Baker began warning of a housing bubble in 2002 and got even more nervous as prices kept rising .
Baker and his wife , Helene Jorgensen -- also an economist -- sold their Washington apartment in 2004 and rented a place a couple of blocks away .
Although they got about three times the 1997 purchase price , Baker and Jorgensen might have made more if they had held on a year or two longer .

“ I was n’t trying to time the peak , ” Baker said , because he does n’t think it ’s possible to perfectly time markets .
( After all , he was three to five years off in his crash prediction . )
That ’s why Baker and Jorgensen bought a house recently in Washington .
The bottom is n’t here yet , he says , but it ’s close enough for him .
Baker said he ’s psychologically prepared for his house to fall 10 % more in value .
That risk , he said , was offset a bit by the 4.25 % mortgage rate he obtained and an $ 8,000 federal tax credit .
He also emphasized that a house is n’t just a financial instrument but something one might decide to spend money on for enjoyment .
“ I really value having a porch , a yard , other things like that , ” he said , and he ’s willing to pay a price for them -- just not any price .

UCLA public policy professor Mark Kleiman also thinks markets ca n’t be precisely timed .
“ I ’m always happy to get in late and get out early , ” he said .
Kleiman sold his house in 2005 and warned on his blog that real estate prices had zoomed into bubble territory .
He did , in fact , get out early -- the buyer flipped the Mulholland Drive house a year later for an additional $ 300,000 , Kleiman said .
But Kleiman was happy to walk away with a hefty profit on the house he bought for $ 465,000 in 1997 and sold eight years later for nearly $ 1.4 million .
( Kleiman notes he spent heavily on remodeling , so it was n’t all profit . )
Although prices are down , he thinks the safe position is to hold off for now .
Kleiman is still renting the Brentwood apartment he moved into after selling .
“ Two years ago it was clearer we were still headed down .
Now it ’s not so clear how much more we ’re heading down , but it ’s also not clear we ’re at the bottom , ” he said .

That ’s because Westside prices , Kleiman said , are still above what incomes can realistically support .
“ When I moved here in 1995 , I could afford the house I bought , ” he said .
Now , even though prices have come down , Kleiman said he could n’t afford houses near UCLA on his salary , unless he made an unusually large down payment .
Some people who had been saving for years may be doing just that ; others have taken advantage of recent record - low interest rates .
That could be putting a floor under home prices .
Still , Kleiman thinks “ we may not necessarily be at a natural bottom , ” because “ I still think houses in Los Angeles are expensive on an absolute basis . ”
The “ natural bottom ” would be the level at which homes would be affordable to people with a down payment of about 20 % and fixed monthly payments that could be sustained on their incomes .
The Westside is not close to that level yet , Kleiman said .

Kleiman and Kiesel may be more likely to wait because they live in markets far pricier than Baker , who paid $ 650,000 for his three - bedroom , 1,500 - square - foot Washington house .
In Southern California , sales are brisk for homes priced near or below the current $ 265,000 median .
The majority of those homes are foreclosures , so prices are often low enough to draw multiple offers from potential buyers .
Richard Toscano , who in 2004 started a popular San Diego housing - bubble blog called Piggington ’s Econo - Almanac , lately has been posting data showing home prices are favorable compared with incomes and rents in lower - priced parts of San Diego .
He ’s drawn fire from some , but others who have followed the blog for years have recently posted comments detailing home purchases .
Toscano , who sold his San Diego condominium in 2002 ( he said the sale was due more to a job transfer than his belief in a bubble then ) , is still holding off on buying for various personal reasons , he said .
Advertisement
But he thinks it ’s no longer dangerous to buy in some areas .
“ We have this weird , disparate bottoming , ” he said .
“ In some areas we may be there already , but others are not nearly as close . ”
Kiesel thinks places such as his home turf in Newport Beach are among those headed for steeper price drops .
Interest rates for jumbo mortgages are still relatively high , and lenders are routinely requiring 35 % down payments on loans greater than $ 729,000 , limiting the pool of people who can afford homes in the millions of dollars , he said .
Kiesel did n’t want to talk about the price details of his own home sale and purchase , but said that when he buys again , he will require jumbo financing .
Advertisement
In that segment , Kiesel said , demand is low because few people have the income and savings to afford the high prices and obtain loans .
Supply will grow , he said , as owners of expensive homes purchased during the bubble years find they must sell at a loss or be foreclosed on .
Although widespread foreclosures have brought prices down in lower - priced areas , more affluent homeowners have been able to avoid defaulting on mortgages thus far .
That ’s about to change , Kiesel says , because falling property values are putting more wealthy homeowners underwater , where the value of the home is less than the mortgage .
He estimates 35 % to 40 % of homeowners nationwide will , by the end of next year , owe more on their homes than the properties are worth .
As prices continue to fall at the high end and those homeowners get deeper underwater , they ’ll have to sell at prices well below today ’s levels , or get foreclosed on , which will result in the homes being resold by lenders at cut rates .

Meanwhile , rents are falling .
Kiesel ’s rent has n’t increased and others in his building have gotten rent reductions recently , Kiesel said .
The house Kiesel sold in 2006 has been back on the market for about six months , he said .
Would he buy it back ?
Only if the owner “ would sell it to me for 50 cents on the dollar , ” Kiesel said .
He does n’t expect that to happen soon .

Ottawa is sending mixed messages about how soon it might help Suaad Hagi Mohamud return home from Africa .
On one hand , the Canada Border Services Agency said this morning it is working to issue the Toronto woman travel documents , tacitly admitting that Canadian authorities made a mistake in voiding her passport in Nairobi , Kenya , nearly three months ago .
On the other hand , no government politician has acted to get the woman home , instead leaving the federal court to sort out details .
" In terms of the federal position , I was told nothing , " Mohamud 's Toronto lawyer Raoul Boulakia said on emerging from a conference call with a federal lawyer and federal court judge just before noon today .
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms grants every Canadian citizen the right to leave the country and return , he said .
" The Canadian government obstructed ( Mohamud ) from doing that by telling the Kenyan government to charge and prosecute her , " Boulakia said .
What Ottawa must do now , he said , is issue her new travel papers , ask the Kenyan government to drop false charges against her of not being the rightful owner of a Canadian passport , and repatriate her — meaning put her on a flight to Toronto at government expense .
Boulakia is asking Ottawa in federal court to do just that .
Two more lawyers - and - judge meetings are scheduled before a scheduled formal court hearing on the matter Thursday , Boulakia said .
" All I know is this nightmare will be over , " Mohamud said over a bad phone line from Nairobi , Kenya , when asked her feelings about Ottawa 's statement that travel papers are being prepared .
" I 'm glad it 's finished . "
There was no way to tell her of the court delays .
Definitive DNA tests exonerated the woman yesterday after Canadian authorities in Kenya stubbornly rejected her claims to Canadian citizenship .
Results show a 99.99 per cent match with her 12 - year - old son Mohamed Hussein , who has been waiting for his mother since an airport official in Nairobi stopped her for not looking like her Canadian passport picture .
For every Canadian , Mohamud 's ordeal raises the question :
What proof of identity will Ottawa accept from a stranded citizen abroad ?
On May 21 , after a Kenyan airport official suggested that Mohamud 's lips and eyeglasses were different from her four - year - old passport photo , the hapless traveller laid out all her ID at the Canadian high commission .
She displayed her Ontario driver 's licence , OHIP card , social insurance card and Canadian citizenship certificate .
She showed her credit card , two bank cards , Shoppers Drug Mart " Optimum " card , Humber River Regional Hospital Card and a recent dry- cleaning receipt from Bright Cleaners on Lawrence Ave. , W. , near her Toronto address .
She produced a letter from her Toronto employer , ATS Courier , about a recent promotion .
The high commission rejected them all .
Worse , instead of helping Mohamud , they sent her voided passport to Kenyan immigration authorities to help them prosecute her .
" We have carried out conclusive investigations including an interview and have confirmed that the person brought to ( us ) on suspicion of being an imposter is not the rightful holder of the aforementioned Canadian passport , " Canadian vice - consul Liliane Khadour wrote to Kenyan immigration authorities on May 28 .
Mohamud faced serious charges : being in Kenya illegally and using a passport not her own .
The penalty would be either jail in Kenya or deportation to her native Somalia .

On two occasions , federal officials in Canada appeared to suggest that Mohamud had switched identities with a sister .
She has four half - sisters by the same father .
But the DNA results confirm Mohamud is not an aunt .
In statistical terms , she is 282 times more likely to be the boy 's mother as an aunt , says a letter faxed to her lawyer from laboratory director Debra Davis of the Vancouver testing company Orchid Cellmark .

" Smack My Bitch Up " was the thirteenth single released by the British Big Beat band The Prodigy in 1997 .
The song was highly controversial because its lyrics , title and music video were believed to promote violence against women .
The lyrics " Change my pitch up / Smack my bitch up " are repeated through the whole song .
The song was banned by the BBC .
The video , directed by Swede Jonas Åkerlund , was as controversial and popular as the song itself .
The film depicts a night out in the city filmed from a first - person perspective , portraying drinking and driving , snorting cocaine , violence , vandalism , nudity and sex .
The unedited version also includes a scene of heroin use and a hit and run incident .
The protagonist takes a stripper ( played by model Teresa May ) home and has sex with her .
As the stripper leaves with her stuff , the protagonist glances in the mirror , is revealed to be a woman , and passes out on the bed .
Though universally banned from television , massive demands on MTV eventually had them relent and show the video , but only after midnight and following an MTV News warning .
In mid-2002 , the full unedited version of this video was aired on MTV2 as part of a special countdown showing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV .
This countdown was only shown late at night because of the graphic imagery of " Smack My Bitch Up " and several other videos on the countdown .
This video was at # 1 on the countdown and therefore named the " Most Controversial Video " in MTV 's history .
Despite the controversy , the video would be nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards , and eventually won Best Dance Video and Breakthrough Video .
Were Abu Ghraib abuses learned from Israel ? / Palestinians think so , but Shin Bet interrogators scoff at U.S. methods
2004-06-27 04:00:00 PDT
Jerusalem --
Palestinians who have spent time in Israeli detention say the images of sexual abuse and humiliation from Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib prison are painful reminders of their own experience at the hands of Israeli interrogators .
Some , like Hisham Abdel Razzaq , the Palestinian minister for prisoners , believe the similarity is more than coincidental .
" I am inclined to think that the Americans copied the Israeli techniques , " said Abdel Razzaq .
" I can't prove it in an objective manner , but the striking similarities are overwhelming . "
But veterans of Israel 's Shin Bet secret service , which conducts most of the country 's anti-terrorist investigations , scoff at such charges and say sexual humiliation of the type seen in photos from Abu Ghraib is not even a useful tool in interrogating suspects .
" Under questioning , a terrorist should be made to yield , " said Ami Ayalon , a former director of the Shin Bet .
" Sexual abuse goes too far by breaking him , so it 's not an option .
A broken man will say anything .
That information is worthless . "
The Shin Bet and other Israeli law enforcement bodies operate under detailed interrogation guidelines set in a 1999 Supreme Court ruling , which resulted from a lawsuit filed by human rights advocates .
Israel is a signatory to the 1991 International Convention Against Torture .
Under the ruling , interrogators , who had been given permission to use " moderate physical and psychological pressure " to extract information from detainees , were barred from a long list of coercive practices reported by former prisoners .
Specifically , the ruling prohibited violent shaking , sleep deprivation , hooding and exposure to extreme temperatures , including freezing baths in winter , as well as a form of constraint known as shabah , in which the prisoner is tightly shackled for long periods .
Loopholes in the law allow the Shin Bet to use " moderate physical pressure , " including sensory deprivation and shaking that stops short of causing permanent damage , on " ticking bombs " -- suspects it believes have information about imminent attacks .
Both Israeli security officials and human rights campaigners who have closely monitored the treatment of prisoners in Israeli detention say the abuses at Abu Ghraib were categorically different from techniques used by Israelis .
" I think the Americans have their own experience with interrogation .
They do n't need the Israeli security service for such matters , " said Hannah Friedman , executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel , or PCATI , one of the groups whose lawsuit led to the 1999 court ruling .
Friedman said a couple of cases documented by her group involved apparent sexual humiliation , but not on the systematic level apparent from the photographs taken at Abu Ghraib .
" We have some evidence of prisoners or detainees stripped naked and evidence of one Israeli prisoner who was stripped four times , but not like the pictures we saw from Abu Ghraib , " said Friedman .
" Most of the time when prisoners are stripped , it is before they are moved from one location to another and done on the pretext of searching for weapons , not during interrogation .
For Muslim people , it is very degrading because it is against their religious values . "
Ayalon insisted that Shin Bet interrogators exhibit more " professionalism " than the U.S. military police accused of mistreating prisoners at Abu Ghraib and are more sensitive to Muslim culture .
Interrogators undergo almost three years of Arabic and psychology training before confronting their first suspect , he said .
Some Palestinian and other Arab prisoners held by Israel have alleged more serious sexual abuse .
Mustafa Dirani , a leader of the Lebanese Hezbollah who was released in a prisoner swap earlier this year , said he was raped by a military intelligence officer he knew as " George , " but the charge was never proved .
Friedman said that abuses dipped after the Supreme Court ruling , but they have risen since the Palestinians began a wave of suicide bomb attacks against Israel in 2001 .
" In September 2001 , PCATI estimated that the total number of detainees being subjected to torture and other forms of ill treatment reached ' only ' dozens , " the committee said in a report last year .
But the report continued : " Since the beginning of 2003 there has been a sharp rise in the torture , ill treatment , humiliation and incarceration in inhuman conditions of Palestinian detainees by the Shin Bet . "
Friedman 's committee continues to voice concern about Israeli interrogation techniques , including the alleged use of banned techniques such as shabah , in which a prisoner is locked in tight handcuffs and leg irons and forced to sit in a contorted position with a stinking sack over the head and loud music playing nonstop .
Abed al - Ahmar , a Palestinian human rights worker from Bethlehem who has been detained for most of the past three years on suspicion -- as yet unproven -- of being involved with the banned Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , said he experienced shabah even after its use was banned .
" The shabah position caused terrible tightening in my back muscles , and I felt that my stomach was being ripped out from my body , " said al - Ahmar .
Israelis are divided on the use of torture , but most agree that it is permissible in the case of " ticking bombs . "
Even before the current intifada began in September 2000 , 64 out of 120 members of Israel 's Knesset parliament said they supported the use of torture in questioning suspected terrorists .
The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group says that with the rise in suicide attacks , Israelis are becoming less sensitive to the issue of maltreating prisoners .
" Since the start of the ( latest ) intifada , there are even more arrests , which means more interrogations and illegal detentions , and at the same time greater silence among the public in its compliance with Israeli violations of human rights , " the group said in a recent report .
The Palestinian rumor mill has been rife with accusations that Israel was involved in the Baghdad prison abuses , but Yossi Melman , a journalist who is regarded as one of Israel 's best - informed experts on intelligence matters , dismisses such allegations .
" U.S. documents ( related to the prison abuse scandal ) and Shin Bet history clearly show that Israel is not aiding the United States in the torture of Iraqi prisoners , " he said .
Indeed , some former Israeli intelligence officers derided practices seen at Abu Ghraib , such as photographing nude prisoners , which observers have suggested was intended to allow intelligence officers to blackmail detainees and encourage them to turn informant after their release .
" An informant risks being caught and killed by his countrymen , so he will only be effective if he works of his own free will , feeling it is worth his while , " said Menachem Landau , a retired Shin Bet officer who supervised Palestinian collaborators .
" Someone acting out of fear will be unreliable and could even end up attacking his handler to clear his name . "
Micah Halpern , author of " What You Need to Know About : Terror , " agreed that the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse did not serve any useful purpose .
" What happened in that Iraqi prison was not interrogation -- it was intimidation for the sake of intimidation , " Halpern said .
" It was gratuitous humiliation .
It was for kicks . "

OFTEN when news breaks , I look around a few blogs I know well to take the temperature of how it 's playing .
The National Review has long been my temperature gauge for mainstream conservativism — it 's about as orthodox as Republican outlets get .
The writers at the Corner blog seem to get up early : there are already 16 posts up today .
As of this typing ( 10:02 am ) , there is a post laughing at the Obama administration 's efforts to " ban " the phrase " war on terrorism " ( of course nothing is being banned : the administration has just decided , sensibly , to stop using the phrase . )
Cliff
May gets in a non-sequitur joke , that now we should start calling the two world wars " Overseas Contingency Operation I " and " Overseas Contingency Operation II " .
Curiously unmentioned on the blog is that the CIA has killed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban .
The actual war on terrorism ( if you must ) is , apparently , of no interest to modern conservatives .
Playing lame word - games to show that the administration is not serious about terror is more important than noting , in any form whatsoever , the killing of the man believed to be behind Benazir Bhutto 's assassination and countless terror attacks .
It 's the biggest one - man death since Abu Musab al - Zarqawi was killed .
And at National Review , crickets , tumbleweed and , for Pete 's sake , two posts already today on Trotsky .
Maybe that is indicative .
During the struggle against communism , William F. Buckley 's magazine cared deeply about the outcome .
It was a necessary publication in a scary world .
Perhaps better to think about those good old days .
Baitullah who ?
Hey , look over there !
A Mexican immigrant !
Update :
The story was posted to the Corner , without comment , at 11:11 , the 24th post of the day .
Update II : One commenter says that killing one leader of the bad guys is not significant .
This is partly true , partly not .
New leaders step forth , but they are inexperienced , and less trusted by the rank - and - file .
Anyway , the point here is about American partisanship .
How significant did the Corner find Zarqawi's death ?
45 posts that day .
Admittedly , Zarqawi was far more famous than Mehsud. 45 times as famous or important ?
Was Zarqawi killed 45 times deader ?
That said , I 've looked around more blogs and found far less commentary than I 'd have expected .
The Daily Kos homepage also features nothing about this killing .
( At least they 're consistent ; they pooh - poohed the killing of Zarqawi .
For what it 's worth , The Economist thought that deserved a cover , though it happened on a Thursday , the day we go to press . )
So let me update my rant : Americans are so uninterested in foreign policy that the left cannot shunt healthcare aside for one moment to talk about this , and the right only cares if it 's good for Republicans .
Sigh .
Bilski v. Doll : it does n't sound exciting , but when the US Supreme Court hears the cast later this term , patent lawyers and software engineers around the country will scrutinize it closely .
It 's one of the few patent cases that the justices have taken over the last decade , and it has the potential to put the smackdown on many kinds of " business method " and software patents .
Cato Institute adjunct scholar ( and sometime Ars contributor ) Tim Lee has a nice discussion of what 's at stake in the case , and he makes an impassioned plea for an end to software patents .

The Victorian Opposition has accused the Government of using speed cameras to raise revenue .
Figures from the Department of Justice show one driver is fined by a camera every 25 seconds in Victoria .
More than 300,000 speeding fines were issued between April and June this year , a 21 per cent increase on the same period last year .
The Opposition 's transport spokesman , Terry Mulder , says speed cameras are being placed in areas with heavy traffic .
" It starts to move into areas that the speed camera protocols said , when they started , that should n't be targeted and that 's on high volume roads , the bottoms of hills , " he said .
" There 's always the question , what is the real speed camera tolerance today ?
Motorists do n't know and the road rule that motorists do n't understand is the one that frustrates them the most . "
But Police Minister Bob Cameron says police decide where speed cameras are used .
He says they play a vital role in reducing Victoria 's road toll .
" Since speed cameras came in in 1989 the road toll has halved , they are a very critical part of keeping the road toll down and keeping it going lower , " he said .
" Police decide where speed cameras go , and it shows in the road toll where we continue to see a reduction . "
We all know that rules for TV commercials in the US are far more uptight than most other countries .
Maybe it is because of the political clout of the religious right or maybe it is because of MAFC ( Mothers Against Funny Commercials ) .
I do n't really know .
But I do know that US audiences are missing out on some very funny commercials because of it .
At McCafferty 's
Pub we purchased one of those really huge , high - powered satellite dishes that brings in TV from all over the world .
So when you stop in our pub you do not have to worry about TV censorship .
And remember that we always warn you if anything we present approaches the raunchy grade .
None of these commercials do .
Our first video is a commercial for air conditioning in a Toyota Corolla , but do not hold your breath waiting for this one to reach the US .
It just is not politically correct enough to satisfy the US censors .

I just had to explain to my father , how having two screens plugged into my computer does n't use more internet .
" Small is beautiful " has for decades been a mantra for environmentalists committed to building ecologically sound communities , economies and agriculture .
But does the phrase apply to nuclear power plants ?
Some experts think so .
They say small reactors are the right fit in the global push for carbonless energy .
What is a small nuclear plant ?
Measured against plants that kick out 1,000 megawatts or more and power a million homes , " right sized " reactors might supply a small city or large industrial facility .
" Several technical and manufacturing innovations make this reactor a potential game - changer for the global clean energy market , " said Christofer Mowry , president and CEO of Babcock & Wilcox Modular Nuclear Energy .
He cites small reactors ' baseload profile as a good match with intermittent renewable - energy generation .
Mowry 's company is among several working on designs for such reactors .
They see a market in servicing large electric utilities that want to incrementally expand their generation capacity , developing countries that cannot afford or make good use of traditional reactors , and off - grid and hard - to - power sites .
Here is what 's happening :
Babcock & Wilcox announced the development in June of a 125 - megawatt reactor for which it plans to request Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) approval in 2011 .
Hyperion Power Generation is advertising a 25 - megawatt " power module " that it compares to a large battery and says would be the size of a hot tub .
The company says its units will cost $ 25 million to $ 30 million , with " delivery dates starting in 2013 . "
South Africa 's Eskom utility and Westinghouse are working on a 200 - megawatt " pebble bed " modular reactor design .
NRC has also received small - reactor applications from NuScale Power Inc. , Toshiba Corp. , and GE Hitachi .
And the Defense Department is also interested in small reactors -- thanks , in part , to mandates that its bases become more self - sufficient and to its head start with the nuclear technologies used to power naval vessels .
Why all this activity ?
The existing model of the nuclear plant -- featuring massive , concrete - domed reactors -- is at a crossroads in the United States .
Despite the nuclear industry 's talk about a " nuclear renaissance " and the promise of generous federal loan guarantees , the industry faces constraints in breathtaking construction costs and risks .
Proponents of the miniature reactors see their lower cost and potentially smaller risks -- some could even be buried underground , reducing the need for " guns , gates and guards " -- as a way forward .
" Small reactors are not there to replace the big reactors , " said Deborah Blackwell , Hyperion 's vice president of licensing and public policy .
She cited applications like providing power for metal mining or oil sands development where " temporary baseload , heavy - duty power " is needed , as ideal for the technology .
" It 's also good for remote communities that are so far off the grid that it does n't make sense to try to run transmission wires to them , " she added , " as well as military bases , so they can be independent of the grid ... and not be susceptible to a terrorist [ attack ] or something going on in the big grid .
It 's not a good idea for our military bases to be operating on the same grid that you and I live on . "
Diplomatic tool ?
Blackwell is not the only person bullish on the security - related aspects of building small .
Tom Sanders , president of the American Nuclear Society and manager of Sandia National Laboratories ' Global Nuclear Futures Initiative , has been stumping for small rectors for more than a decade .
American - made small reactors , Sanders insists , can play a central role in global nonproliferation efforts .
" Our role at Sandia is the national security - driven notion that it's in the interests of the U.S. to be one of the dominant nuclear suppliers , " Sanders said .
While U.S. companies have been exiting the industry over the past decades as government and popular support for new construction has waned , Sanders maintains that strong U.S. participation in the nuclear energy marketplace would give diplomats a new tool to use with would - be nuclear powers .
" It 's hard to tell Iran what to do if you do n't have anything Iran wants , " he explained .
Sanders said mini-reactors are ideal to sell to developing countries that want to boost their manufacturing might and that would otherwise look to other countries for nuclear technologies .
If the United States is not participating in that market , he said , it becomes hard to steer buyers away from technologies that pose greater proliferation risks .
Sanders been promoting this view since the 1990s , he said , when he realized " we were no longer selling nuclear goods and services , so we could no longer write the rules . "
The domestic nuclear industry had basically shut down , with no new construction in decades and a flight of talent and ideas overseas .
There is a silver lining in that brain drain , though , he believes , in that U.S. companies getting back into the game now are less tied to the traditional , giant plants and are freer to innovate .
A feature that several of the new product designs share is that the power plants could be mass - produced in a factory to minimize cost , using robots to ensure consistency .
Also , with less design work for each installation , the time to complete an order would be shortened and some of the capital and other costs associated with long lead times avoided , Sanders said .
Another feature he favors is building the plants with a lifetime supply of fuel sealed inside .
Shipped loaded with fuel , such reactors could power a small city for 20 years without the host country ever handling it .
Once depleted , the entire plant would be packed back up and shipped back to the United States , he said , with the sensitive spent fuel still sealed away inside .
Sanders is working on a reactor design hatched by the lab with an undisclosed private partner .
He believes it is feasible to build a prototype modular reactor -- including demonstration factory components and a mockup of the reactor itself -- as early as 2014 , for less than a billion dollars .
A mini-reactor could ring up at less than $ 200 million , he said , or at $ 300 million to $ 400 million with 20 years of fuel .
At $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 per kilowatt , he said , that would amount to significant savings over estimates of $ 4,000 to $ 6,000 per kilowatt for construction alone with traditional plant designs .
To get a design ready to build , Sanders is urging a partnership between the government and the private sector .
" If it 's totally a government research program , labs can take 20 to 30 years " to finish such projects , he said .
" If it becomes a research science project , it could go on forever . "
New approach , old debates
So far , there is no sign that the government 's nuclear gatekeeper , NRC , is wowed by the small - reactor designs .
NRC's Office of New Reactors warned Babcock & Wilcox in June that the agency " will need to limit interactions with the designers of small power reactors to occasional meetings or other nonresource - intensive activities " over the next two years because of a crowded schedule of work on other proposals .
Meanwhile , opponents of nuclear technologies are not convinced that small reactors are an improvement over traditional designs .
Arjun Makhijani , who heads the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research , a think tank that advocates against nuclear power , sees disseminating the technology as incompatible with controlling it .
" A lot of the proliferation issue is not linked to having or not having plutonium or highly enriched uranium , but who has the expertise to have or make bombs , " Makhijani said .
" In order to spread nuclear technologies , you have to have the people who have the expertise in nuclear engineering , who know about nuclear materials and chain reactions and things like that -- the same expertise for nuclear bombs .
That does n't suffice for you to make a bomb , but then if you clandestinely acquire the materials , then you can make a bomb . "
Peter Wilk , acting program director for safe energy with Physicians for Social Responsibility , an anti-nuclear group , argues that expanding nuclear power use runs counter to the goal of nonproliferation .
" The whole proposition presupposes an ... international economy in which more and more fuel is produced and more and more waste must be dealt with , which only makes those problems that are still unsolved larger , " he said .
" It may or may not do a better job of preventing the host country from literally getting their hands on it , but it does n't reduce the amount of fuel in the world or the amount of waste in the world , " Wilk added .
And then there is the issue of public opinion .
" Imagine that Americans would agree to take the waste that is generated in other countries and deal with it here , " Makhijani said .
" At the present moment , it should be confined to the level of the fantastic , or even the surreal .
If [ the technology 's backers ] could come up with a plan for the waste , then we could talk about export . "
Makhijani pointed to a widely touted French process for recycling nuclear waste as a red herring ( ClimateWire , May 18 ) .
" It 's a mythology that it ameliorates the waste problem , " he said .
According to Makhijani 's calculations , the French recycling process generates far more radioactive waste than it cleans up .
One category of highly radioactive material , which ends up stored in glass " logs " for burial , is reduced , he said .
But in processing the waste , about six times the original volume of waste is produced , he said .
Much of that must be buried deep underground , and the discharge of contaminated wastewater used in recycling has angered neighboring countries , he said .
Operational risk , of course , is another major concern .
" One has reduced the amount of unnecessary risk , " Wilke said , " but it 's still unnecessary risk . "
He added , " I get the theory that smaller , newer , ought to be safer .
The question is :
Why pursue this when there are so many better alternatives ? "
To Sandia 's Sanders , Wilke is asking the wrong question .
With the governments of major economies like China , Russia and Japan putting support and cash into nuclear technologies , the power plants are here to stay , he believes .
" There 's going to be a thousand reactors built over the next 50 years , " he said .
" The question is : Are we building them , or are we just importing them ? "

Didier Drogba scored in Chelsea 's 2 - 0 victory over Inter Milan and declared captain John Terry will turn down Manchester City and stay in London .
Drogba , making his first appearance in pre-season , played his part as Chelsea dominated former boss José Mourinho 's side in the World Football Challenge friendly tournament , watched by 81,224 fans at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena .
And as Terry played the full 90 minutes for new head coach Carlo Ancelotti in California , despite Manchester City 's continuing efforts to coax him to Eastlands , Drogba said the England captain was going nowhere .
" He 's our captain and we need him and we know he 's going to stay with us and win more trophies , " Drogba told ESPN .
Of his side coming face to face with Mourinho , Drogba said : " It 's always nice to see him : he was a big part of Chelsea 's success and now we 're moving on .
We have a new manager now and we 're all happy for him because he won his second game out of two , so it 's all good .
We 're working hard , this is only the start and we want to be ready for the start of the season . "
Goals from Drogba in the 11th minute and a Frank Lampard penalty just after half - time gave Chelsea the victory over the Italian champions .
The impressive nature of the Blues ' performance more than the scoreline , however , will have delighted new head coach Ancelotti , especially coming against his former cross-city rivals .
Drogba 's future has been in question while the offer of a new three - year contract remains unsigned , but Ancelotti revealed the striker has indicated he will stay to form a key part of the Italian 's new - look team .
" Drogba is a very important player for us and we want him to play for Chelsea , " Ancelotti said .
" He 's irreplaceable as no other striker in the world can do the same job .
I 've spoken with Drogba and know what he wants .
He told me he 's happy to stay . "
However , Ancelotti offered less encouragement to Andriy Shevchenko , who made his name playing for him at AC Milan .
" I speak to Shevchenko every day and the situation is this : he 's with us until 31 August and then we take a decision together .
I do n't know what will happen as the club has not received any offers . "

“ We live in a world obsessed with image .
What we look like , what our clothes look like , houses , cars …
I like to conter this obsession with superficial appearance by stripping back the layers and showing what it is like under the surface
Often the integral beauty adds intrigue to the familiar .
We all make assumptions based on the external visual aspects of what surrounds us and we are attracted to people and forms that are aesthetically pleasing .
I like to challenge this automatic way that we react to just physical appearance by highlighting the , often surprising , inner beauty . ”

Sydney residents woke up to an ethereal scene on Wednesday
A storm which blew in from the Australian outback blanketed Sydney in a layer of orange dust .
Here , residents describe the bizarre and frightening scene .
Tanya Ferguson said the dust was the weirdest thing she had seen in her life , turning the city into a scene from another planet .
" It was like being on Mars , " she told the BBC News website .
" I have n't been there , obviously , but I imagine that 's what the sky would look like . "
It was like being in the outback , but it was right here in the city
Tanya Ferguson
Your pictures : dust storm
She said she woke to a massive gust of wind blowing through her windows early in the morning .
" The whole room was completely orange .
I could n't believe my eyes , " she said .
Ms Ferguson said she initially thought there was a bush fire .
When she finally decided to venture outside , she said the entire city was covered in a film of orange dust .
" All the cars are just orange - and the orange was so intense , " she said by phone from Sydney , where she has lived for the past six years .
" It was like being in the outback , but it was right here in the city . "
Ms Ferguson said the sky was overcast and it was very dusty , making her sneeze a lot .
Public transport was disrupted and the roads were clogged as drivers struggled in the difficult conditions , but she said some people went to their jobs , and she saw a few residents wearing face masks .
By evening , Ms Ferguson said there were blue skies over Sydney and that it was returning to a normal day .
' Pink until noon ' Fellow Sydneysider Nick Beaugeard said his four young children were really frightened when they woke up on Wednesday morning .
" There was a really red glow inside the house , really crimson " he said .
" It looked like the end of the world . "
It was like driving through a pea soup of fog , except it was bright red
Nick Beaugeard
After the initial shock , he said the children got really excited and went off to school where they said it was " pink until noon " .
Mr Beaugeard - who moved to Australia from the UK in 1998 - had to drive to work from the Northern Beaches area because the ferries were closed .
" It was like driving through a pea soup of fog , " he said , " except it was bright red " .
He said the lights looked blue because it was so red outside .
Mr Beaugeard said his wife - who is an asthmatic - was fine despite the blanket of dust and fog .
" She went out with a scarf over her mouth and she came back without it , " he said .
He said the dust left everyone with a dry mouth , and a really gritty taste , but caused no breathing problems for his wife .
' Armageddon ' Andrew Hawkins , who lives in Northmead , about 20 km from the centre of Sydney , says he was scared at first because it looked like the end of the world .
" This morning 's dust storm was unbelievable
It was like waking up to see that Armageddon is upon us , " he wrote in .
Pictures fail to capture the eerie nature of the scene which surrounded us this morning
Andrew Hawkins Mr Hawkins said he thought his eyes were playing up , or that there had been a nuclear explosion or a bush fire .
He described an ethereal scene of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House as he rode the train to work .
" To see a city of such beauty shrouded in red , was a sight which cannot be described - even pictures fail to capture the eerie nature of the scene which surrounded us this morning , " Mr Hawkins added .
Another Sydney resident , Kirsty Ainsworth , said it was like being in a film .
" It was really , really bizarre .
It was actually like being in a movie - the Day After Tomorrow or Armageddon , " she said .
Ms Ainsworth said there had been storm warnings on Monday and Tuesday , but the dust storm took everybody by surprise .
" It came out of nowhere , " she said , adding that visibility had improved enough for her to make it to work by around 0830 local time .
" Everybody 's cars were caked in orange dust , and there 's still sand everywhere , " she said .

[ digg - reddit - me ] About a year and a half ago , looseheadprop at Firedoglake posted about a speech he called “ Our Lady of the Law . ”
I ’ve contacted Governor Cuomo ’s offices a number of times in the past year asking if they could provide me a copy , and allow me to publish it on this blog , and last week , they graciously did .
Governor Cuomo gave this speech at a dark moment in the winter of 2007 as George W. Bush ’s radical national security policies undermined the Rule of Law at home – from warrantless wiretapping to torture to the misuse of signing statements to the politicization of the Department of Justice to the unsupervised jailing of non-combatants under the authority of the executive branch .
At the same time , the Lawyers Movement in Pakistan fought to restore the Rule of Law in Pakistan and marched against President Musharaff .
looseheadprop quoted a line which is n’t in the prepared text I was given in which Governor Cuomo called on lawyers in America to follow the example of their brethren in Pakistan :
If US lawyers are marching in the streets in support of the rule of law in Pakistan , why are n’t we marching in support of the rule of law here ?
Knowing human nature and his history , Governor Cuomo pointed out the George W. Bush was attempting to subvert the Rule of Law and “ inflate the presidency into unconstitutional shape and power . ”
In this dark time , the winter of 2007 , as revelation after revelation of George W. Bush ’s misdeeds became public , Governor Cuomo called on the lawyers to fight for the Rule of Law – for Our Lady of the Law .
He concluded with a call to arms – not against George W. Bush but to protect the institutions that enable us to be a state of consent and the liberal democracy that the Founding Fathers envisioned :
Surveys tell us that we believe our nation is not heading in the right direction and we have no clear notion as to how to change course .
It ’s more than just the war in Iraq and threats of still another war that concerns us .
We have no heroes , no heroines , no soaring ideologies .
We are tired of , and frustrated by , political answers that seem impertinent , too shallow , too short - sighted or too harsh .
We are not even sure what we wish to be as a nation .
We ’re tempted to see ourselves as 300 million disassociated individuals struggling for survival and dominance in a dog - eat - dog world , instead of seeing ourselves as a fully integrated society , interconnected , interdependent , growing stronger together .
Some of us are frightened by 9/11 and terrorism into thinking we can be saved by a more powerful presidency even at the risk of creating the kind of monarchial power the Founding Fathers sought to protect us from in the Constitution .
We need something more ─ something better to believe in .
To hold onto .
To be guided by .
Something wiser than our own quick personal impulses .
Something sweeter than the taste of a political victory .
It would take more than the time we have now ─ and perhaps more than the wisdom that resides here today ─ even in this very gifted group ─ to find and to describe all we must do to relieve this profound discomfort .
But there is one thing we lawyers know will help relieve the unsureness that troubles us .
And that is “ Our Lady of the Law , ” as she comes to us in our Constitution ─ the nation ’s bedrock .
Our 200 year old legacy of law and justice has been the foundation on which we have built all that is good about America .
We must not allow that foundation to be weakened or even defaced by a political system whose claim to morality is the latest urge of the American people ─ however distracted , however mislead we may be on occasion .
We must not allow our eager presidents and timid Congress people to combine to weaken our system of checks - and - balances and threaten our republic by allowing a single individual to exercise monarchial powers .
For 200 years “ Our Lady of the Law ” has proven stronger than the sins of her acolytes and has made us better than we would have been .
Now she must be lifted above the political melee and the confusion before she is brought down and her guiding light is no longer visible to us .
Someone must lend their shoulders in the effort to do that .
If not , the lawyers , then who ?
As we continue to experiment with national security laws , this message still rings true .
We still need a Lawyers Movement in America to keep Barack Obama and our government honest – to ensure that they continue to protect the Rule of Law .
I ’ve published the full text of the speech below the jump .
GOVERNOR MARIO M. CUOMO RECIPIENT OF THE
FEDERAL BAR COUNCIL’S EMORY BUCKNER MEDAL
FOR “ OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVICE ”
WALDORF -ASTORIA HOTEL
WEDNESDAY , NOVEMBER 21 , 2007
Like most of you , I have a lot to be grateful for on this Thanksgiving Day eve… family , friends , health , fond memories and continuing prospects .
And I am especially grateful for the privilege of being an attorney for more than half a century .
And so , thank you Mark for that generous introduction .
My parents would have been pleased to hear it although my Mother , as well as my Father , was never as pleased with me as she might have been .
And she told me so .
When I became a lawyer , my parents were ecstatic ; it was more than they had hoped for .
But some years after that , when I announced I was entering politics , they were indeed shaken .
All they knew about politics and politicians was that ─ except for Franklin Roosevelt ─ politicians did n’t seem to be worth much .
Trying to find a way to soothe my parents , I told them : “ Do n’t feel bad , this is the way I can get to be a judge . ”
Well , that relieved them considerably .
My Mother said ─ in Italian ─ “ Mario , now you ’re making sense . ”
Somehow she had concluded that being a judge was a whole other thing .
The judge was special : the judge was respected … that ’s why the judge wore a robe , but politicians just wore suits .
Then I lost a couple of elections , won a couple and found myself standing on a platform with my Mother next to me , Pop was gone , and the person at the microphone , introducing me on an exciting , improbable election night said , “ Mario Cuomo is the first Italian - American ever to be elected to a full term as Governor of the State of New York … . ”
I turned to my Mother , put my arm around her and said “ Mama , what do you think now ? ”
She said , “ Is not bad .
But when you gonna be judge ? ”
In those days at least , my Mother was n’t far from the dominant view of other Americans about their judiciary .
Most believed there was indeed something special about the people in robes and the work they did .
And surely that ’s how the Founding Fathers felt it should be : that ’s inescapably clear from the care they took in describing the role of the judiciary in the Constitution .
They wrote two main parts : a political side ─ the Congress and the presidency ─ to which voters would elect people they expected would reflect their ideas and desires on a day - to - day basis .
And to anchor and stabilize the nation , a second part : a Supreme Court and a federal judicial system to assure that the decisions and rules made by the political branches complied with the Constitution .
They made sure the judicial branch would be immunized from the importunings of the two political branches by giving the judges lifetime terms .
The judges would be guided by the Constitution and the facts of the specific case or controversy before them and not by the wishes of the Congress or the president .
They were to remain beyond the reach of politicians but be always available to interpret and declare the meaning and applicability of the words and intent of the Constitution as to which they ─ and not the Congress or the president ─ were to have the last word .
Without that Constitutional Rule of Law our great experiment in democracy would have failed .
And , it would fail today !
It ’s clear from current world experience that elections do n’t create democracy ; it ’s the Rule of Law that creates and assures democracy , and serves as the foundation of the miraculously successful democratic republic we have become .
As Benjamin Franklin noted : “ Only by keeping the Constitution and its Rule of Law intact , would we continue to have a republic instead of a monarchy . ”
That is not to say the Constitution was not made adaptable to significant changes in the nation ’s circumstances .
In Article 5 , the Founders provided for needed amendments although , eager to keep the Constitution strong , they required difficult to achieve approvals from both the federal government and the states .
The use of that prescribed process over the last 200 years has accommodated changing conditions in America in a difficult but orderly and legal fashion , at the same time that the Founders ’ basic rules for a national government remained intact .
In recent years various political individuals and groups have proposed ─ and continue to urge significant changes in the Constitution .
Some argue we should amend the Constitution to provide that any judicial decision , including the Supreme Court ’s , should be subject to being overridden by a majority vote of each House of Congress .
That , to many of us , is an alarming position .
It suggests an entirely different America from the one we have enjoyed for more than 200 years , and it would be a giant step backward and downward .
If popular sentiment as enacted by a simple majority in Congress could have overruled the Supreme Court , would the Congress of the time have overruled Brown v. The Board of Education thereby restoring segregation ?
Almost certainly .
Would today ’s Congress ─ so eager to do what the polls say is currently popular ─ wriggle its way past the First Amendment into extensive censorship , all in the name of “ family values ” ?
Perhaps .
Would surveys showing large majorities of the public wanting to get rid of the presumption of innocence , lead to its repeal ?
Probably .
Would the sound of “ Gideon ’s Trumpet ” be silenced , freedom of the press chilled ?
Some statistics suggest it would .
Fortunately so far , that drastic proposal has n’t become popular enough to persuade Congress or the states to activate the Constitutional amendment process : we ’re apparently not ready for the “ future shock ” of an America built on changes like the ones I ’ve noted , especially with regard to our vital justice system .
But that does not mean that we ought not take seriously Ben Franklin ’s caution by protecting our Constitution and especially its Rule of Law from being depleted , distorted and weakened , not just by the prescribed Constitutional amendment process , but de facto , particularly by power - seeking Presidents and inadvertent or unwise members of Congress .
We should keep in mind that in allocating Constitutional power the Founders deliberately and carefully limited the powers of the presidency .
The oppression they had suffered at the hands of the British king had turned their love of liberty into a passionate concern about excessive power in the executive .
The language they chose makes that clear .
They knew what kings could do ─ because in fact kings had done them .
Nevertheless , ambition is difficult to restrain and despite the Founders ’ intent , in recent years efforts have been made by both Democrat and Republican presidents to throw - off Constitutional restraints written by the Founders and enhance presidential powers in ways that the Founders would certainly have found objectionable .
“ Signing statements ” have been used to defy legally adopted laws ; secret White House task forces ; presidential orders to hold non-combatants in jail for as much as five years without charges against them ; unprecedented politicization of the Department of Justice , government spying on Americans without court supervision , as well as other excesses , have combined to inflate the presidency into unconstitutional shape and power .
And perhaps the most egregious presidential excess and the most costly , has been the seizure by both Democrat and Republican presidents of one of the most dangerous of all government powers … the power to declare war .
For obviously good reason , the question of who should have the power to declare war was treated by the Founding Fathers as one of the most serious to be dealt with in the Constitution .
How much more serious must it be today in this age of nuclear weapons and the threat of instant obliteration they pose ?
The language chosen by the Framers was unambiguous .
Article I Section 8 gives Congress ─ not the President ─ “ the power to declare war . ”
Most of the Framers were opposed to giving the power to a single leader because of the fear that ambition , ignorance , poor judgment , misinformation or inadvertence could produce an unnecessary and unwise war .
Abraham Lincoln described the Framers ’ rationale for choosing Congress cogently and concisely when he said “ allow the President to invade a … “ nation whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary , and you allow him to make war at pleasure ” … “ no one man should hold the power to bring this oppression upon us . ”
That observation seems chillingly prescient after more than four years of war in Iraq .
Despite the clarity of the constitutional language , since the Second World War timid Congresses have combined with eager presidents on several occasions to violate the clear language and intention of the Constitution by handing over this non-delegable power passed by Congress to the President .
Remember Korea and Vietnam ?
In fact that is precisely what happened with respect to Iraq .
Congress , without itself declaring war , said they approved of the President doing it if he chose to .
In so doing they defied the strong view of the Founding Fathers made plain in the clear language they chose .
They violated the Constitution !
The Supreme Court has never approved of those actions by our Congress and President in Iraq or in previous similar situations .
The only way it could have would have been to deem in effect , that persistent evasion can repeal the plain language of the Constitution , and that would reduce the Constitution ’s Rule of Law to nothing more than an anemic collection of suggestions .
But the Supreme Court has never condemned the illegal actions either and lower federal courts have been reluctant to because they suspect the Supreme Court considers the “ war power ” question to be what some justices have called a “ political question ” not suitable to be addressed by the courts .
This “ political question ” theory is not explicitly written in the Constitution .
Indeed , Alexis de Tocqueville observed that most political questions in the United States usually became judicial issues .
And he was right .
Remember Bush v. Gore ?
At the very least it must be said that the refusal by the federal courts to intervene because the war power issues are considered to be “ political ” in nature produces an awkward result : it denies us the vitally important review of the conduct of the Congress and the President with respect to one of the most serious questions ever to face the nation ─ the decision to start a war … the decision to start killing people and having our own people killed perhaps by nuclear weapons , from one side or the other or both !
Who is to blame for this most recent departure from constitutionality in Iraq ?
Certainly the Congress ─ Republicans and Democrats ─ who ignored their clear obligation to make the decision themselves .
Certainly the President who seduced them into ignoring that obligation .
Certainly the press that failed to make an issue of what was happening .
And I believe it is fair to say we must share the blame ─ all of us who are privileged to be lawyers with all the advantages that gives us , and all the opportunities it provides to assist the rest of our society with our special knowledge and ability to communicate .
“ There ’s a time to be silent and a time to speak ” and I believe this was ─ and remains ─ a time for the nation ’s lawyers to speak … loudly and clearly .
Even if it is as a practical matter too late for the courts to prevent the loss of lives and treasure in Iraq , it is not too late to avoid other possible unconstitutional military actions by our President and an unconstitutionally compliant Congress , in Iran , Pakistan or elsewhere .
Bar Associations should examine these issues and practices and their leaders should energize litigation of the type that led to Supreme Court decisions concerning military tribunals , torture and Guantànamo in 2006 .
Declaratory judgment litigation should be instituted to bring the Congress and the President into conformity with the Constitution , calling on the Supreme Court and other federal courts to assert their authority and decide the issues raised here to restore the people ’s right to have Congress determine our wartime destiny .
The urgency of these actions is underscored by our government ’s efforts to link Iran ’s actions in Iraq to Al Qaeda and attacks on our troops in Iraq .
Unless there is a judicial intervention , it is painfully conceivable that the President might claim authority under the 2001 and 2002 congressional resolutions to launch ─ or to be complicit in launching ─ a nuclear attack on Iran with unimaginable consequences .
As officers of the Court , the burden of persuasion is on us to make the case for the Constitution .
But it is a burden that we should carry with delight because in making the case for proper use of our Constitution and our judicial system , we will be making the case for the lawyers who helped design the system , helped implement it , and have sustained it ─ as judges and as advocates ─ for 200 years .
After all , it was the lawyer ’s passion for predictable and equitable standards that taught our ancestors in this country to make the political system subject to the legal system , so as to assure , as nearly as possible , that politics would be required to serve the ends of justice , instead of justice having to bow to politics .
Yes , there have been setbacks .
At times the law has protected slavery , permitted segregation , discouraged unions , tolerated exploitation , injustice , unfairness .
At times , lawyers have manipulated the law , using it to further their own ambitions or their clients ’ greed .
But if our ranks have included a quota of rogues , they have also included a far greater number of heroes — real heroes .
Thousands - upon - thousands of men and women who have defended the helpless , the dispossessed , the disenfranchised , who ’ve bucked popular opinion and faced even death to insist that the law take precedence over prejudice , over privilege , over revenge .
Even if the people they were defending were impoverished , uneducated Americans .
Let me conclude with one final , fundamental observation .
Surveys tell us that we believe our nation is not heading in the right direction and we have no clear notion as to how to change course .
It ’s more than just the war in Iraq and threats of still another war that concerns us .
We have no heroes , no heroines , no soaring ideologies .
We are tired of , and frustrated by , political answers that seem impertinent , too shallow , too short - sighted or too harsh .
We are not even sure what we wish to be as a nation .
We ’re tempted to see ourselves as 300 million disassociated individuals struggling for survival and dominance in a dog - eat - dog world , instead of seeing ourselves as a fully integrated society , interconnected , interdependent , growing stronger together .
Some of us are frightened by 9/11 and terrorism into thinking we can be saved by a more powerful presidency even at the risk of creating the kind of monarchial power the Founding Fathers sought to protect us from in the Constitution .
We need something more ─ something better to believe in .
To hold onto .
To be guided by .
Something wiser than our own quick personal impulses .
Something sweeter than the taste of a political victory .
It would take more than the time we have now ─ and perhaps more than the wisdom that resides here today ─ even in this very gifted group ─ to find and to describe all we must do to relieve this profound discomfort .
But there is one thing we lawyers know will help relieve the unsureness that troubles us .
And that is “ Our Lady of the Law , ” as she comes to us in our Constitution ─ the nation ’s bedrock .
Our 200 year old legacy of law and justice has been the foundation on which we have built all that is good about America .
We must not allow that foundation to be weakened or even defaced by a political system whose claim to morality is the latest urge of the American people ─ however distracted , however mislead we may be on occasion .
We must not allow our eager presidents and timid Congress people to combine to weaken our system of checks - and - balances and threaten our republic by allowing a single individual to exercise monarchial powers .
For 200 years “ Our Lady of the Law ” has proven stronger than the sins of her acolytes and has made us better than we would have been .
Now she must be lifted above the political melee and the confusion before she is brought down and her guiding light is no longer visible to us .
Someone must lend their shoulders in the effort to do that .
If not , the lawyers , then who ?

The Government ’s War On Craigslist ( and Sex )
They ’re at it again .
Scarcely two months after warning Craigslist.com to censor personal ads government bureaucrats say are actually solicitations for prostitution , the same morality police are threatening tougher action .
What has Craigslist done so far in response ?
The online advertising site has changed its “ erotic services ” category to “ adult services , ” and has further reputedly banned some of the more graphic photos .
However , this wo n’t satisfy Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart , who earlier this year filed a lawsuit against the San Francisco - based company , citing it as being , in his estimation , America ’s largest source of prostitution .
Dart ’s attorney , Dan Gallagher , says that some of the Craigslist ads offer escort services for as little as 15 minutes .
“ They go to great lengths to say this is just a site so that people can meet one another to fulfill their romantic aspirations , ” Gallagher said .
“ I do n’t think having an escort for 15 minutes is a fulfillment of romantic aspirations . ”
Therein lies the problem .
If Gallagher and Dart do n’t find anything romantic or appealing about a short tryst with a consenting adult , that ’s strictly their business , and there ’s nothing necessarily wrong with holding that opinion .
However , they are obviously not content with keeping their feelings to themselves .
They are attempting to use coercive violence – the power of the “ law ” – to prevent others from pursuing peaceful desires .
What ’s the difference between a simple date that ends in a sexual encounter , and one in which some money or other form of compensation changes hands ?
Whose business is that other than those directly involved ?
What incursion upon life , liberty , or property is being initiated by capitalistic acts taking place between two or more consenting adults ?
Perhaps the questions go beyond any supposedly moral arguments ( and I would argue that there is nothing moral to begin with in using violence to alter peaceful behavior ) , and have to do more with government ’s inability to profit from such activities .
In the War on Drugs , since anyone can grow marijuana , it is too difficult logistically to license , regulate , and tax growers – unlike with liquor and tobacco , which both require more complicated and expensive processing in order to produce products of marketable quality .
So it is with the War on Sex – even in jurisdictions of legalized prostitution , such as Nevada , countless unlicensed sex workers ply their trade without paying taxes or following other governmental regulations .
This is perhaps the greater part of the reason why , in addition to Dart and Gallagher ’s lawsuit , no fewer than 40 state attorney generals are currently examining further and more aggressive actions against Craigslist .
One of the axioms among anarchists is that governments are little more than organized theft and violence .
Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in government ’s war on human sexual activity .
Not ever content in the scope of their power , government bureaucrats are even so brazen as to intervene in this most private and personal realm of human affairs .
Such egregious invasions upon liberty , on top of all other ways in which governments involve themselves in our affairs , ought to prompt us not to look for ways in which such an institution might be best limited – as with constitutions that have done nothing of the sort in practice – but how to most expediently , and without compromise , affect its summary dissolution .
Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase , two of the nation ’s biggest banks , announced plans on Tuesday to drastically overhaul their debit card programs by lowering or eliminating fees , changing the way they credit transactions and allowing customers to opt out of overdraft protection .
The moves come as lawmakers and regulators in Washington push proposals to reform what critics say are excessive charges of which consumers are unaware .
The penalties , known as overdraft fees , bring the banking industry tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually .
Bank of America said it would allow current customers to turn off the ability to spend when their account hits zero , starting Oct. 19 .
Next June , the bank plans to limit the number of times each year that current customers can overdraw their accounts when using a debit card at a store .
It will let new customers choose whether they want overdraft protection when they are opening their account .
Chase plans to eliminate by the first quarter of next year a common industry practice that enraged many consumers .
Instead of lumping a day ’s worth of debit card and A.T.M. transactions together and then processing the highest amounts first  a practice that has caused large numbers of consumers to overdraw more quickly and pay more fees  it will credit the transactions chronologically .
Chase also plans to allow customers to opt out of overdraft coverage .
So begins the final act of the enchanting little play working titled Waiting for Gordtogo , with rumours concerning the Prime Minister 's mental wellbeing infusing the internet .
Gossip of the kind often afflicts PMs .
Margaret
Thatcher was regarded as deranged by the late 1980s , even by her admirers , and some concluded that Mr Tony Blair was bananas long before he went off to sprinkle the fairy dust of peace upon the Middle East .
The salient difference between the familiar sense that leaders are in some indistinct , undiagnosed way off their chumps and the concerns about Gordon is that there are unusually specific hints about the latter .
Senior Whitehall bods are reported as noting that he was recently given a long list of things he absolutely must avoid , and that among these are Chianti and cheese .
Both are well - known for causing a violent , even lethal reaction to a specific group of heavy duty antidepressants known as MAOIs ( Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ) .
Fans of Horace Rumpole may recall a story in which the old boy gets a young GP off the charge of murdering his wife , only then discovering that the woman was on just such a drug , and that on the night she died her adoring husband had cooked her a cheese soufflé .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
MAOIs are a long outmoded strain of drug , but might still be prescribed for a patient not responding to the Prozac generation of serotonin inhibitors .
In the absence of David Miliband or Alan Johnson arriving for a Cabinet meeting with a wicker - clad bottle of Spanish red and a Pizza Express Quattro Formaggi , there is no obvious way of confirming this , since any opposition or media enquiry would blithely be deflected with a non-denial denial .
You'd have thought that whether our Prime Minister is severely clinically depressed falls loosely under the public interest header , but what can you do ?
Our political system regards secrecy less as desirable than its raison d'etre .
Whether literally the case or not , however , this rumour carries the kind of psychological truth that tends to be more damaging than fact .
John Major never tucked his shirt into his knickers , despite the claims of that fierce enemy of trivialising political journalism Alastair Campbell .
Nor , so far as we know , was he a martyr to a frozen pea addiction .
What mattered was that he seemed the kind of chap who might .
So it is with Gordon .
He may not be on anything stronger than St John 's wort ... but if not , you can't help feeling , he bleeding well ought to be .
In fact , contemplating the near future – and if Joseph Heller were still with us , he could probably coin a catchy phrase for this paradox – the only way he might begin to persuade us of his sanity is by publicly admitting to being on psychiatric medication .
For the prospect of another eight months of this is enough to drive the sunniest - natured among us – yes , even Kriss Akabusi – into the most savagely distempered of Churchillian Black Dogs .
The script for the period between now and early summer next year is already written , if not quite set in stone , and it could n't be gloomier .
The next few weeks will be devoted to a revival of speculation about whether his Cabinet will take their final chance to put him out of their misery .
It 's already starting .
Fuelled by Gordon 's classically adroit handling of the Libyan bomber 's release , whispers of a putsch in the aftermath of a dismal party conference gently mount .
Much as you relish the novelty , what with it being a full three months since the last abortive coup , it is impossible to picture him going now .
Deftly transferring the medical analogising from the mental to the physical , Labour is the terminal patient offered radical surgery that at best will slightly improve the quality of life , but can not save it .
With a few months left , who needs the additional agony , not to mention the risk that the operation might be fatal itself ?
Less traumatic , surely , to up the diamorphine dosage , float off on the fantasy of a last minute miracle cure , and eke out whatever crumbs of pleasure are still to be had .
By the middle of October , that last window will have closed , and the party will grudgingly accept that it 's stuck with Jolly Jack Tar at the helm .
At that point , two wars will begin ... the phoney electoral battle , already decided , against the Tories , and the real one for Labour 's future in opposition between the various factions within .
Even the Baron Mandelson , noblest and cleverest of his generation , will find it beyond his cocktail of charm and menace to keep the lid on that , and should turn in earnest to fixing the succession for his preferred candidate .
Six months of internecine skirmishing between the rump armies of puritan Brownites and cavalier Blairites will ensue , while Gordon pursues his own fight ( also lost ) with the increasingly independent Alistair Darling over how frank to be with us about the extent of hardship ahead .
Both will rejoice to tell us that the recession is over , but with the rise in employment lagging miles behind any recovery this will do them little good .
In fact , it will do them harm .
If the economy is back in growth , or about to be , they lose their most effective argument against voting in those novice Tories .
What motivation remains to hold on to such a gruesome nurse ( Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest is n't in it ) if there is nothing worse in view ?
The economy was booming in 1997 , and much electoral joy that brought Mr Major .
And then , possibly after an anaemic pastiche of a US televised presidential debate , it ends in May or June ... not with a bang but with a whimper of despair .
What is uniquely depressing here is that the prospect of being rid of an exhausted , discredited , useless and despised government offers not one iota of excitement , enthusiasm or optimism .
In 1964 , after 13 years of the Tories , Harold Wilson was powered into office , albeit by a whisker , by his white heat of technology .
In 1979 even those who loathed and feared Mrs Thatcher were a little thrilled by the energy she promised to bring to annihilating the post - war consensus .
Eighteen years later , Mr Tony Blair 's new dawn momentarily warmed even those of us who had grave doubts .
This time round , there is n't even a pretence that Mr Cameron is what our former possession across the Atlantic knows as an agent of change .
While Obama fights his dramatic rearguard to salvage universal health care for Americans , the Conservative leader strives to save thruppence ha'penny by cutting subsidies in parliamentary canteens .
Like a boxer with a huge points lead as the bell for the final round clangs , all he has to do is coast and hide his chin .
He knows he need do nothing to win well , and doing nothing other than affect an aura of paternalistic competence will , we must assume , be the hallmark of his administration .
Eight months of this , then , followed by eight years of that .
If Gordon is n't on the pills , he 's an even bigger meshuggenah than we thought .
The only worthwhile question left for him to answer is whether he 's stockpiled enough to spare a few for the rest of us .

Apollo 11 Mission
Science Experiments - Laser Ranging Retroreflector
The Laser Ranging Retroreflector experiment was deployed on Apollo 11 , 14 , and 15 .
It consists of a series of corner - cube reflectors , which are a special type of mirror with the property of always reflecting an incoming light beam back in the direction it came from .
A similar device was also included on the Soviet Union 's Lunakhod 2 spacecraft .
These reflectors can be illuminated by laser beams aimed through large telescopes on Earth .
The reflected laser beam is also observed with the telescope , providing a measurement of the round - trip distance between Earth and the Moon .
This is the only Apollo experiment that is still returning data from the Moon .
Many of these measurements have been made by McDonald Observatory in Texas .
From 1969 to 1985 , they were made on a part - time basis using the McDonald Observatory 107 - inch telescope .
Since 1985 , these observations have been made using a dedicated 30 - inch telescope .
Additional measurements have been made by observatories in Hawaii , California , France , Australia , and Germany .
Laser beams are used because they remain tightly focused for large distances .
Nevertheless , there is enough dispersion of the beam that it is about 7 kilometers in diameter when it reaches the Moon and 20 kilometers in diameter when it returns to Earth .
Because of this very weak signal , observations are made for several hours at a time .
By averaging the signal for this period , the distance to the Moon can be measured to an accuracy of about 3 centimeters ( the average distance from the Earth to the Moon is about 385,000 kilometers ) .
The Laser Ranging Retroreflector experiment has produced many important measurements .
These include an improved knowledge of the Moon 's orbit and the rate at which the Moon is receding from Earth ( currently 3.8 centimeters per year ) and of variations in the rotation of the Moon .
These variations in rotation are related to the distribution of mass inside the Moon and imply the existence of a small core , with a radius of less than 350 kilometers , somewhat smaller than the limits imposed by the passive seismic and magnetometer experiments .
These measurements have also improved our knowledge of changes of the Earth 's rotation rate and the precession of its spin axis and have been used to test Einstein 's theory of relativity .
And he wants people to vote for him when he does n’t even understand basic facts ?
Via Townhall :
Former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden denied the existence of organized Antifa groups during the first presidential debate in Cleveland , Ohio on Tuesday .
Fox News anchor Chris Wallace had asked President Trump if he was willing “ to condemn white supremacists and militia groups , and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities , as we saw in Kenosha and as we ’ve seen in Portland ? ”
“ Sure , I ’m willing to do that .
I would say almost everything I see is from the left - wing , not from the right - wing , ” Trump replied , telling the Proud Boys to “ stand back and stand by . ”
“ But I tell you what , somebody has got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right - wing problem , this is a left - wing problem , ” Trump added .
“ Antifa is an idea , not an organization , that ’s what his FBI director said , ” Biden replied .

Tikee torch not included but will sale for 25.00 .
You can get all sexy on a discount if you ’re so inclined .
The 99 Cents Only Store is a much naughtier place than you think .
For those unfamiliar specifically with the 99 Cents Only Store , it ’s the big chain of dollar - or - less stores in the California / Arizona / Nevada / Texas region .
Other than its name , it ’s identical to the dollar store in your city .
( Although with a little more Latin flair .
Let ’s just say I ’m pretty sure they sell Sabor de Soledad cheese puffs . )
I went there and purchased the 11 sexiest , naughtiest and most intimate products I could find .
My goal was to buy 11 items for $ 11 , or , with the new Los Angeles sales tax , 11 items for $ 975 .
I almost cleared out for that much ( as you ’ll see in the Spice Girls section , I splurged and purchased four items ) .
Enjoy … and be seduced .
1 | Feminine Deodorant Mist
I did n’t even realize there was spray - on deodorant for lady parts .
So I learned something during my 99 Cents shopping trip .
Just for a test , I decided to spray some of this on my arm .
It smells almost exactly like Febreze .
I will probably hang on to the stuff and use it to get odors out of my sweaters .
There ’s a bad joke somewhere in there .
2 | Fishnets
The 99 Cents
Only store has a wide variety of women ’s underthings , all of which looked pretty sexy .
But none of them are on this list .
Mostly because , while I was at the store , a 65 +
Asian woman and her husband were monopolizing the whole women ’s underwear section , and I could n’t bring myself to paw through the stuff while they were there .
The integrity of this list was NOT worth cockblocking that guy .
Instead , I bought these fishnets .
And then , to prove to you how sexy they are , I yanked them up over my giant foot and hairy leg .
Fishnets are hard to get on .
I would n’t last five minutes in a Rocky Horror troupe .
Or as a fisherman .
3 | Fantasy Condoms
I like that they realized they can only pick one condom niche — ultra thin ?
large - sized ?
ribbed for her pleasure ?
garbage bag thickness for extra security ? — and the niche they chose was “ colored . ” I opened one Fantasy Condom and it was blue .
I never really understood the colorful condom phenomenon .
Who exactly drives this market ?
What ’s the point ?
Is the color supposed to seduce a woman ?
( “ Well , I was questioning my decision to have sexual intercourse with you , but now that I see your penis covered in blue I can just tell my friends we Smurfed . ” )
I do n’t get it .
But apparently the 99 Cents Only braintrust does .
4 | Warm Touch Personal Lubricant
Ever since I fell for the old “ put Gold Bond on your testicles ” trick at age 14 , I ’ve been wary of products that induce drastic genital temperature changes .
I put a dollop of this on my arm ( which , at this point , has now taken two different vaginally - oriented bullets for this list ) … and I ’m happy to say the warm was a very smooth , mild burn .
It was more like a bit of warmed maple syrup falling from a fork onto my skin than being jabbed with a lit cigarette .
So that ’s pretty good .
5 | Spice Girls Figurines
Those are some scantily - clad Spice Girls , huh ?
The copyright on the back is from 1998 , which explains why they only had Sporty , Scary , Posh and Baby — Ginger left the Girls in May of 1998 , so these must be from the first post - Ginger run of toys .
I feel really bad for Mel C ( aka Sporty Spice ) here … because , while her body looks nice and sexy , the people at Toymax really effed her on the face .
She looks horribly snaggletoothed .
It ’s like Sporty Spice got replaced by the girl from CakeFarts .
[ WARNING : NSFW LINK ] <
6 | Nipple Brush
I ’m not sure what one uses a nipple brush for ( I ’m assuming it ’s something related to being pregnant ; there ’s a whole universe of pregnancy products that I ca n’t even begin to understand ) .
But I feel like there ’s definitely a fetish toy out there called the Nipple Brush as well .
And if they end up in court , never doubt the fetish lobbyists .
The pregnancy Nipple Brush is going to have to change its name , just like the WWF .
7 | Generic Axe Body Spray
“ Designed to seduce the ladies . ” Nope .
Regular Axe Body Spray is already guaranteed to keep you from seducing the ladies *… cheaper , worst - smelling generic Axe Body Spray gives you an even worse chance .
*- guarantee not valid in New Jersey .
8 | Pregnancy test
But if you do seduce someone using ZSZ Body Spray … then use a Fantasy Condom whilst holding sexual congress with her… you should swing back to pick up one of these 99 - cent pregnancy tests .
9 | Summer ’s Eve Ultra Douche
Someone in the comments called me an ultra douche the other day .
At least now we can all pretend he was just giving this list a shoutout .
10 | Butt Aid
Do n’t care what it ’s supposed to be used for .
From a distance all I saw were the words “ BUTT AID . ”
By the time I picked it up and found out it was designed to treat diaper rash , my mind had already run WILD on what it was designed for .
11 | Finger Blaster
For the win .

REGINA–Canada 's premiers are firmly behind Prime Minister Stephen Harper in his bid to counter protectionist trade policies being adopted in the U.S .
In a rare show of unity , premiers of all political stripes yesterday vowed to help Harper as he fights the so - called Buy America provisions being applied by American state and local governments that prevent Canadian companies from bidding on projects funded by President Barack Obama 's $ 787 billion ( U.S. ) stimulus package .
Harper is to meet with Obama on Sunday in Mexico , and with the premiers ' endorsement in hand , he is expected to tell the president Canada is ready to move ahead in the effort to neutralize the Buy America problem .
This will lay the groundwork , sources say , for International Trade Minister Stockwell Day to send a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Ronald Kirk next week indicating that Ottawa is ready to begin bilateral negotiations aimed at solving the issue .
Premier Dalton McGuinty said it 's essential the premiers give Harper a " strong hand " for the meeting with the U.S. president and Mexican President Felipe Calderon in Guadalajara , Mexico .
" We can not escape our interdependence .
This is an era of globalization .
We 're in this together , " McGuinty said at the annual Council of the Federation meeting .
" The appeal that we have to make to our American cousins is one based on their enlightened self - interest , " said the Ontario Liberal .
Manitoba Premier Gary Doer , a New Democrat , strongly opposed calls from unions for retaliatory Buy Canada policies to protect Canadian jobs .
" We have to back up our prime minister and I believe all premiers will , " said Doer .
" We should back Canada up by ensuring that it 's clear that we have nothing to fear on procurement in provinces and municipalities and we want access to states and cities in the United States , " he said .
Quebec Liberal Premier Jean Charest criticized Obama for failing to live up to trade agreements designed to prevent discriminatory policies against Canadian firms .
" If they cannot on this issue come to an agreement with their major trading partner , their ally , their friend , their neighbour , then what does that say about the Americans ' attitude worldwide ? " said Charest .
" We will speak forcefully and we will speak with great determination on this issue , but we will also do it having in mind that the Americans will have a test in front of them
British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell said the onus is on Canadian jurisdictions not to respond with similar trade sanctions .
" We have to speak with one voice and we have to act .
We can't say to Americans : `have no exceptions , make an exception for Canada , ' make sure we have free open access to their markets .
We still have work to do in Canada , " said Campbell .
Darrell Dexter , Nova Scotia 's newly elected NDP premier , distanced himself from a crusade by the Canadian Labour Congress , Canadian Auto Workers , and other groups to attach Buy Canada conditions to domestic infrastructure funding .
" We 're looking at protecting Canadian jobs that are in manufacturing , that are in technology industries that need access to that marketplace in order to be successful , " said Dexter .
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said " working people , whether they 're unionized or not , benefit " from freer trade in exporting nations like Canada .

A former US soldier has been sentenced to life in prison for raping a teen and murdering her and her family while on active duty in Iraq .
The jury failed to reach the unanimous verdict required for the death penalty sought by the prosecution .
[...] if I had never gone to Iraq I would never have got caught up in anything like this — Steven Dale Green
According to testimony given by two soldiers , Steven Dale Green was part of a group who decided they wanted to rape a girl they had seen walking through her village , 14 - year - old Abeer Qassim al - Janabi .
They walked to her house while disguised as insurgents and separated her from her parents and younger sister .
Green then shot dead
Abeer 's family while two other soldiers raped the girl .
He then raped her himself while she wept before covering her face with a pillow and fatally shooting her .
The gang then covered her naked body with a blanket soaked in kerosene , using a lighter to start a fire before walking 200 yards to a nearby checkpoint where they cooked a meal .
Green had already been discharged from the army when his crimes were discovered .
He had previously spoken of a desire to murder Iraqi civilians and his defence argued he should never have been allowed to return to duty .
A nurse had decided he would not carry out his desires .
A US civilian court tried him , the first such prosecution of a soldier under a law allowing servicemen to be charged with crimes carried out abroad .
The judge described his actions as " unimaginable , unjustified and inexcusable " and sentenced him to five consecutive life sentences without possibility of parole .
Four others had already been sentenced .
Three are all serving life with parole after ten years , and a fourth who acted as a lookout is serving a 27 - month sentence .
It took months for the offences to be discovered , even though Green had quickly confessed to a sergeant .
Soldiers speaking to stress counsellors talked of the crimes after the abduction and murders of two other soldiers .
When news of the soldiers ' actions broke , insurgents killed several American servicemen in revenge .
The prosecution described Green as " criminal and perverse " while the defence called him a " broken warrior . "
Green said he was acting upon orders from former Specialist Paul Cortez , another of the attackers , and told the court " Y'all can act like I 'm a psychopath or a sexual predator or whatever .
But if I had never gone to Iraq I would never have got caught up in anything like this . "

Even one member of the Japanese Parliament , Kazumi Ota , was a hostess .
That revelation once would have ignited a huge scandal , but it has not .
She will run for re-election on the leading opposition party ticket , the Democratic Party of Japan , in the national election next month , and the ticket is expected to unseat the ruling party .
It is unclear how many hostesses work in Japan .
In Tokyo alone , about 13,000 establishments offer late - night entertainment by hostesses ( and some male hosts ) , including members - only clubs frequented by politicians and company executives , as well as cheaper cabaret clubs .
Hostesses tend to drinks , offer attentive conversation and accompany men on dates off premises , but do not generally have sex for money .
( Men who seek that can go to prostitutes , though prostitution is illegal . )
Hostesses are often ranked according to popularity among clients , with the No. 1 of each club assuming the status of a star .
Mineri Hayashi has made it to the top of her club , Celux , six years after coming to Tokyo from northern Japan .
One recent evening , she readied herself for an elaborate birthday event her club was throwing in her honor .
Outside the club , bigger - than - life posters of Ms. Hayashi adorned the street .
At the club , a dozen men put up balloons and lined up Champagne bottles .
The club ’s clientele is diverse , including workaday salarymen , business owners and other men unwinding after work .
For years , Wal - Mart has been a punching bag for environmental groups , which say that the Arkansas - based company has paid little attention to its sprawling carbon footprint .
Now the nation 's largest retailer is fighting back – with a plan to display eco-ratings alongside its products .
On Thursday , Wal - Mart chairman and CEO Mike Duke said the company was developing an electronic indexing system , which would help customers choose products that are healthy for the planet .
The software , he said , could in the future become the basis for an international eco-rating system .
" We see this as a universal — this is not a U.S. standard , " Mr. Duke told reporters at a gathering at company headquarters in Bentonville , Ark. , according to the Associated Press .
" Across the world , this standard would work across all retailers , all suppliers . "
Customers would not see the ratings in store aisles for a few years , a Wal - Mart researcher said .
How it would work
Wal - Mart has been somewhat vague on the details of the plan .
But as Stephanie Rosenbloom writes in The New York Times , the system would probably be similar to the nutrition labels that adorn packages of food .
The ratings would cover a range of factors , from emissions to water conservation , giving the consumer the widest possible view of how the product was created .
The ratings , Rosenbloom reports , would be compiled and vetted by a group of " scholars , suppliers , and environmental groups . "
Once Wal - Mart had implemented the ratings in its own aisles , other corporations would be encouraged to adopt similar standards .
" Wal - mart is providing the initial funding for this , but we do want other companies to participate , " Duke said .
" Our goal is not to create our own index , but to spur development of a common database ... that all of us can rely upon . "
Reaction
In the blogosphere , the reaction has largely been positive .
" The beauty of the Wal - Mart innovation is that it does n't ask anyone to change anything except the information that is provided and received , " Harvard professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter wrote today .
" If polluters want to keep polluting , they are free to do so as long as they provide that data on their Wal - Mart labels .
And if consumers choose to buy from polluters whose labels they can read , they are free to do so .
In theory . "
Still , Dr. Kanter cautioned that the Wal - Mart initiative could put a lot of stress on some sectors of the market .
The eco-ratings would be " one enormous demand on suppliers , among them many small companies that will feel crushed by the giant 's new non-carbon footprint , " she said .
At Earth2Tech , Katie Fehrenbacher pointed out that although Wal - Mart is taking the lead in the States , there is international precedent :
Underlying the investments by Wal - Mart and venture capitalists is US legislation coming down the pipeline , most notably the cap - and - trade system proposed in the climate bill currently making its way through the Senate after passing the House earlier this year .
In addition to U.S. legislation , other countries in Europe , as well as Japan , already have similar regulations and retailers in those regions have been moving quickly to develop green labels .
Blogger Janne K. Flisrand says she applauds the plan – with reservations .
" Wal - Mart still has a long way to go to gain my trust , " Flisrand writes .
" For the moment , I ’m glad someone is doing it ( even if it is the biggest of the behemoths ) .
It will make a difference . "

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Scientists have uncovered a new role played by Vitamin C in protecting the skin .
Researchers at the University of Leicester and Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology in Portugal studied new protective properties of vitamin C in cells from the human skin , which could lead to better skin regeneration .
The work , by Tiago Duarte , Marcus S. Cooke and G. Don Jones , found that a form of Vitamin C helped to promote wound healing and also helped protect the DNA damage of skin cells .
Their findings have been published in the journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine .
This report is the latest in a long line of publications from these researchers , at the University of Leicester , concerning vitamin C. Previously , the group has published evidence that DNA repair is upregulated in people consuming vitamin C supplements .
The researchers have now provided some mechanistic evidence for this , in cell culture , using techniques such as Affymetrix microarray , for looking at gene expression , and the ‘ Comet ’ assay to study DNA damage and repair .
Tiago Duarte , formerly of the University of Leicester , and now at the Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology in Portugal , said : “ The exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation increases in summer , often resulting in a higher incidence of skin lesions .
Ultraviolet radiation is also a genotoxic agent responsible for skin cancer , through the formation of free radicals and DNA damage .
“ Our study analysed the effect of sustained exposure to a vitamin C derivative , ascorbic acid 2 - phosphate ( AA2P ) , in human dermal fibroblasts .
We investigated which genes are activated by vitamin C in these cells , which are responsible for skin regeneration .
“ The results demonstrated that vitamin C may improve wound healing by stimulating quiescent fibroblasts to divide and by promoting their migration into the wounded area .
Vitamin C could also protect the skin by increasing the capacity of fibroblasts to repair potentially mutagenic DNA lesions . ”
Even though vitamin C was discovered over 70 years ago as the agent that prevents scurvy , its properties are still under much debate in the scientific community .
In fact , the annual meeting of the International Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine , which will be held this year in San Francisco ( USA ) , will feature a session dedicated to vitamin C , entitled “ New discoveries for an old vitamin " .
Dr Marcus S. Cooke from the Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine and Department of Genetics , at the University of Leicester , added : “ The study indicates a mechanism by which vitamin C could contribute to the maintenance of a healthy skin by promoting wound healing and by protecting cellular DNA against damage caused by oxidation ” .
“ These findings are particular importance to our photobiology interests , and we will certainly be looking into this further ” .
These results will be of great relevance to the cosmetics industry .
Free radicals are associated with premature skin aging , and antioxidants , such as vitamin C , are known to counter these highly damaging compounds .
This new evidence suggest that , in addition to ‘ mopping up ’ free radicals , vitamin C can help remove the DNA damage they form , if they get past the cell ’s defences .
The study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of skin lesions specifically , as well as contributing to the fight against cancer .

Preliminary results have been released for a psychological survey taken at Anthrocon 2009 this July . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
The survey team was led by Dr. Kathy Gerbasi , a social psychologist and anthrozoologist at the Niagara County Community College , and supervised by the Kent State University Institutional Review Board .
The team has run surveys at Anthrocon since 2006 , covering topics such as connections with other species , species dysphoria and gender identity disorder , happiness and social rejection , transliminality , the essential characteristics of being a furry , and the reasons furry fans wear ( or do not wear ) fursuits .
[ 6 ]
Many topics were chosen to address prevalent stereotypes .
The first portion of their work was published in the academic journal Society and Animals in 2008 . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
This year 's survey focussed on determining sociability , empathy , sex role identification , and social desirability . [ 9 ]
There were 275 participants ; fewer than in previous years due to IRB restrictions intended to prevent distribution of forms to minors . [ 10 ]
Four gift certificates were awarded to randomly - picked participants , and the team donated $ 100 to the convention 's charity . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
Each participant also received a ribbon , though due to constraints on the identification of subjects , those giving the survey were not permitted to suggest that attendees place them on their conbadges .
Some attendees were concerned by the survey 's use of the Autism Spectrum Quotient ( AQ ) , in part because they felt it was a poor test . [ 12 ]
During the on - site debriefing , the survey team defended their use of such standardized tests , stating that their research would be disregarded if it did not use tests already accepted as valid by the academic community .
Summary of results [ edit ]
This summary was prepared by WikiFur editors , and covers research which has not yet been peer - reviewed or published .
See the sources for full details and caveats .
Survey respondents consisted of 206 furry males , 34 furry females , 18 non -furry males and 8 non-furry females .
[ 1]
There were no significant differences between furries and non-furries on demographic factors such as employment , education or political views .
The mean furry respondent age was 25.3 , while for non-furries it was 30.4 . [ 1 ]
Empathy , social desirability , masculinity / femininity and behavior [ edit ]
Furries scored significantly higher than non-furries on the fantasy and empathic concern sub-scales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index . [ 13 ] [ 2 ]
The difference between furries and non-furries for empathic concern was very significant , at a 0.001 p-value . [ 3 ]
Females also scored significantly higher than males on fantasy .
[ 3 ]
No significant differences were found for any group in the areas of personal distress or perspective - taking . [ 3 ]
There was no significant difference between furries and non-furries or males and females on a measure of social desirability ( the Marlowe - Crowne Social Desirability Scale / Personal Reaction Inventory ) , [ 3 ] or in group averages between males and females or furries and non-furries on a measure of masculinity ( the Bem Sex Role Inventory ) . [ 4 ]
However , furries did score significantly higher than non-furries on femininity , and were also more likely to measure as androgynous . [ 4 ]
Male furries were significantly ( if slightly ) underrepresented in the high masculinity , low femininity group relative to non-furry males ; conversely , non-furry males were underrepresented in other groups . [ 4 ]
No significant difference was found between furries and non-furries in the sub-scales of the Autism Spectrum Quotient relating to social behaviors , attention switching , or imagination .
[ 5 ]
Differences in communication and attention to detail were hinted at , but did not reach the level of statistical significance .
[ 5 ]
When summed using the original scoring system ( merging " strong agree / disagree " responses with normal " agree / disagree " ) the group mean score for furry respondents was slightly higher ( less social ) than for non-furries , though both were within the " average " range for the test .
[ 5 ]
When summed separately on a 1 - 4 scale , no statistically significant difference was found . [ 5 ]
[ 1 ] Identity and sexual orientation [ edit ]
23 % of respondents considered themselves " less than 100 % human " , and would choose to be " 0 % human " , while 42 % gave opposite responses .
These results were similar to those in previous studies .
22 % said they would like to be 0 % human but did n't feel less than 100 % human , and 12 % said they were less than 100 % human , but would not like to be 0 % human .
When asked if they considered themselves more than 100 % human , 32 % of male and 27 % of female respondents agreed .
Of the 121 males and females who said they would like to be 0 % human , only 44 ( 36 % ) said they would like to be non -human all of the time .
When asked if a furry could choose not to be furry , furries tended to say yes ( Yes : 126 , No : 53 ) , while non-furs tended not to say no ( Yes : 12 , No : 1 ) .
The difference between furs ( 67 of 246 ; 27 % ) and non-furs ( 13 of 26 ; 50 % ) who said they did not know was also significant .
Sexual orientation of furry respondents Kinsey scale 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Female furries 8 5 9 8 0 0 0 Male furries 28 29 20 32 17 32 45
The proportion of females identifying as therians ( 24 % ) , otherkin ( 10 % ) and lycanthropes ( 12 % ) was higher than that of males ( 11 % , 6 % , 5 % ) , though no measure of significance was given , and the number of reporting females was small .
For each group , for both males and females , more reported not knowing what a lycanthrope / otherkin / therian was than identified as one .
There was a significant difference between the reported sexual orientation of male and female furries .
Males were distributed across the whole Kinsey scale , while females were either heterosexual or bisexual ; none reported homosexuality .
About 40 % of responding furries indicated a different sexual orientation when in their furry identity as compared to their non-furry identity .
Quotes [ edit ]
The main purpose of using the IRI was to address the stereotype that furries are socially challenged .
The thinking was , that if the stereotype were true then they might score lower on the IRI than other folks .
The comparison between furries and non-furries in our sample does not support this .
-- Dr. Kathy Gerbasi[ 3 ]
... the fact that i come to AC to meet folks , look at , and purchase art and have a good time , does not mean that i have a social disorder because i like humanized animals . --[ 12 ]

223796 Guys And Counting
Last week , NASA and other agencies announced results from instruments aboard three different spacecraft which all indicate that there is water present in the surface soil , or regolith , of the moon .
Although the amount is very small , it is much more than had been predicted .
Associate Professor of Planetary Sciences Benjamin Weiss discusses the implications of the new finding .
Q : How surprising was the detection of water on the surface of the moon , especially in daylight regions ?
A : It was enormously surprising and exciting .
The accepted wisdom has been that the moon is and has always been bone dry .
Although water was identified in the Apollo samples , it was generally discounted as terrestrial contamination .
The three studies last week , which involved spectroscopic data from three different spacecraft taken over a period of 10 years , showed that not only does the lunar soil apparently have up to 0.1 percent by weight of water in its upper layer , but that this water is forming and " exhaling " on timescales of just a lunar day .
This means that much of this water was recently emplaced and is present all over the surface of the moon .
Until now , it has generally been assumed that if there is any water on the moon , it would almost exclusively be in the form of ice located mainly in permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles .
Q : Does this finding suggest that there may be amounts of water in the lunar environment that would be sufficient to be a resource for future astronauts working on the moon ?
A : The spectroscopic evidence for lunar water only reflects the top few millimeters of the lunar surface .
Therefore , these data do not constrain the abundance of lunar water throughout most of the lunar soil .
Nevertheless , if astronauts were to harvest soil containing water with an abundance like that inferred from the spectroscopic data , then they would have to process about a ton of regolith to obtain a liter of water .
Given that water was observed to leave the soil every lunar day due to solar heating up to 100 degrees Celsius , this implies that simply heating the soil to these relatively mild temperatures would be enough to liberate the water for use .
I think this makes it a promising resource for astronauts .
Q : Does this discovery tell us anything new about the formation or evolution of the moon , or raise new questions about it ?
A : It is not yet clear what is the source of this water .
If much of it is indigenous , it suggests that the moon may have been far wetter than we supposed .
This may have important implications for one of the leading hypotheses for the origin of the moon — that is was formed from the debris of a giant meteoroid impact on the young Earth — which predicts that the source material which formed the moon should have been extensively heated .
Alternatively , if the main source of the water is the solar wind or comets , then it says little about the original composition of the moon .

Internet Freedom Bill Introduced in the House Reps. Edward Markey ( D - Mass . ) and Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009 ( H.R. 3458 ) .
The legislation would protect Network Neutrality under the Communications Act , safeguarding the future of the open Internet and protecting Internet users from discrimination online .
Free Press Network Neutrality in Congress , Round 3 : Fight !
The war over Net Neutrality has been fought in the last two Congresses , and with the introduction of the Internet Freedom Preservation
Act of 2009 means that legislators will duke it out a third time .
Should the bill pass , ISPs will not be able to “ block , interfere with , discriminate against , impair , or degrade ” access to any lawful content from any lawful application or device .
Nate Anderson , Ars Technica New Bill Would Stop ISPs from Blocking Content Reps. Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) and Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif . ) introduced a broad Net Neutrality bill that bans Internet service providers from discriminating based on content .
Among other provisions , the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009 would prohibit ISPs from blocking or degrading any lawful content .

The phone and cable companies are scrambling to kill Net Neutrality so they can inspect and filter content , and overcharge you for using the Web in ways they do n’t like .
Over the past six months alone , these companies have hired 500 lobbyists in Washington to try to stop this bill from becoming law .
It ’s up to you to tell your members of Congress to side with the public — not with the corporate lobbyists — and take a final stand for an open Internet by supporting the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009 H.R. 3458 .

Thru You : Two Million for Internet Freedom

August 03 , 2009
Memphis — or Memfrica , as we call it — is a city where all that is fucked up about America is taken to the extreme .
I recently fled this festering dung heap of a ghetto for Russia , where I ’ll be getting educated and properly laid , and the more I think back to my hometown , the more I realize how truly screwed we are as a nation .
I talk to people around here a lot about how ugly and sexless Stateside women are and mock the proud slave mindset of working class middle America .
I tell them about how we have more prisoners than authoritarian China could ever dream off , with about a fifth of the globe ”s prison population .
Sometimes , I start to wonder though .
Am I the crazy one because I think America sucks ass ?
This is home , after all .
But then , a story comes along that once again , regretfully , reaffirms and justifies my hatred .
A few weeks ago , the local Memphis rag produced a blowjob piece about some policewoman who spent a year as an undercover cop .
Memphis , the article tells us , is home to a “ unique ” undercover program in that it focuses on long term immersion rather than just the normal game of entrapping the utterly desperate , i.e. , the only people who would try to buy dope or a blowjob from someone they do n’t know .
( The crackheads and creeps are smart enough to realize American freedom is a myth . )
From my experience there , most undercover cops are pretty easy to spot in the hood .
Last year , I was walking into a Fred ’s ( a general store kinda like a ghetto Walgreen ’s ) when a clean - cut 30 - year - old black dude in a collared shirt came up and asked me if I wanted to buy some “ crack . ”
In Memphis , black dudes that get in the dope game start when they ’re 14 - 15 .
By the time they ’re 30 , they ’re either dead , in prison , wheelchair bound junkies or , rarely , have moved on with their lives .
It ’s nothing against dope , that ’s just the way it is down here .
So , I just said to the guy “ Dude , get the fuck out of here .
You ’re a fucking cop . ”
And he got embarrassed and left as everyone in the parking lot started laughing at him .
But , the more I thought about it , I decided they must have to start programs like this out of necessity .
Because if they want to have any presence in the hood at all , it ’s going to have to be in the form of spies .
In my North Memphis neighborhood , for example , cops are not allowed in .
At all .
There was an easy truce for a while where The Gangster Disciples — the street gang that controls much of North North–allowed periodic daytime patrols .
They put an end to that after the cops ran over and then shot some kid on my street one Friday night awhile back .
I still love the opening paragraph to that story :
“ The death of 18 - year - old Timothy Jones , who was killed in an exchange of gunfire with police Thursday night , was but the most tragic event in an ongoing battle over control of the area near Northside High School , police said . ”
The reality is that , like in Afghanistan and Iraq , no one has a monopoly on violence in Memphis .
Cops wo n’t respond to calls in the area because they ’re usually setups , where someone is waiting behind a building or on a rooftop to pop a couple of shots at whoever shows up in blue .
Not that anyone would want the cops to come anyway .
At night , GD ’s with AK47’s and baseball bats wrapped in barb wire patrol the streets making sure nobody breaks into anything or nobody tries selling drugs or sex that is n’t supposed to be .
You can sure as hell can trust the GD more than the cops .
You never know if a cop is going to turn out to be crooked or not .
A while back , there were some B & E’s in the area that the GD ’s were n’t behind .
A GD who lived across the street from me came over to my house to tell me to keep an eye out for anything strange because “ shit been goin ’ down we ‘ id n’t know ‘ bout . ”
Talk about service .
On the street , you can buy a junk AK - 47 for $ 80 , which I ’m happy to report is cheaper than the going rate in Mogadishu .
So I did n’t see a cop in my neighborhood for six or seven months unless you count nighttime helicopter patrols .
But , they cop the choppers up pretty high , if I may use the local dialect .
But then , one Sunday morning I heard some yelling next door and looked out my kitchen window to see a couple of cops tasering and beating my neighbor with their clubs .
I ’m guessing they were driving by a little earlier and they saw him smoking pot on his front porch , which he did basically all day every day–and then he ran away .
Big mistake .
After they arrested him , one cop drove him off in the backseat of the squad car and the other cop took my neighbor ’s car .
I have n’t seen him or the car since then .
The poor fucker ’s prolly locked up for 20 years in some Nebraska gulag .
It ’s a shame too because he was a nice guy , was n’t a GD and did n’t even deal .
These are the type guys who get taken down in the big busts .
But , if you do n’t want to take my word for it on Memfrica being a fucked up , deadly place to live , then check out this quote from an Iraq war vet who spent six months in town , could n’t handle the heat , and is dropping his tail and balling out on the double :
“ ’I saw a lot in Iraq , ’ Hand said .
‘ I got used to it .
But here , when I go into a convenience store , I get what I need and get out real fast because you never know . ’ ”
I tell all this to paint a picture of just how stupidly brave and pathetic a cop would have to be to go undercover in Memphis .
If the cop got ratted out , his or her head would be buried in the countryside , and the torso tossed into the Mississippi off the Old Bridge , and it ’d be hard to ever find out who actually did it .
But , I guess the “ can do ” attitude of corporate America has even permeated Memphis ’ worst because this undercover cop April Leatherwood spent a year , and I quote ,
“ roam ( ing ) the streets of Memphis in the same foul - smelling shirt .
She did n’t shower , brush her teeth or shave her legs .
She stood outside neighborhood corner stores , smoking , befriending crack addicts so they ’d take her to their dealers .
. .
“ As Summer Smith [ Just about every burnt - out junkie white bitch in Memphis is named Summer–Author ] , Leatherwood followed addicts into houses without electricity or plumbing , where people defecated in buckets .
Sometimes she watched toddlers run around while their drug - dealer dads played video games and sold crack to customers with guns lying on the table .
“ She talked her way out of unwanted sexual advances and always scanned the room for a way out if a deal went bad . ”
And she did it all for a measly $ 45,000 .
That ’s what they pay .
Leatherwood claims to never have gotten fucked / raped or to have done any drugs while undercover .
How she got away with that without losing her cover is beyond me .
The truly horrifying part , if you ’re an American man , is this :
“ Leatherwood ’s work came at a cost .
She lost a three - year relationship . ”
That ’s right , some American women would rather spend a year shitting in trash cans and sleeping beside dumpsters without the stress relief of a little coke than to fuck their men .
Stakeout ?
The cops say Leatherwood ’s undercover work “ . . . resulted in more than 280 arrests — from low - level drug peddlers to big - name dealers . ”
First off , most everything the cops say for PR is pure bullshit .
Second , they did n’t arrest anybody but low level bums and kids because that ‘s who hangs out with and sells to junkies with “ brown , greasy hair “ and “ feet .
. . covered by the same filthy pair of socks for an entire year . ”
What ‘s really fucked up is , this is a city where huge multinationals like FedEx , International Paper and Autozone are headquartered .
You should see the executives ’ vampire castles out in the suburbs .
Yet , Memphis ’ infant mortality rates , hordes of illiterates and crappy public education facilities are comparable to those in the Third World , and the city is perpetually broke .
What little money there is is used to subsidize big business or else it ’s showered on the cops to bust low - level drifters , hustlers and wayward teens .
Just read this fucking quote about Memphis congressman Steve Cohen ’s trip to Liberia and Ghana :
“ Cohen noted that the parts of West Africa he has visited have an infant mortality problem similar to the one in the 9 th Congressional District . ”
The idea of an American city being comparable in anything to a war torn African shithole makes me want to slam my head in a fucking door .
Colonial crackhouse on Princeton Ave .
It turns out the original undercover slave , Joe Pistone a .k.a.
Donnie Brasco is living in Memphis now , directing the undercover center modeled after FBI procedures .
“ Last week , April talked about her undercover experience to a group of police officers from across the country who participated in the Memphis Police Department ’s undercover school .
At the behest of Director Larry Godwin , Sherman created the program 3 - 1/ 2 years ago , modeling it after the FBI ’s undercover certification course at Quantico , Va. , where he trained .
Since then , 10 classes of officers have participated , three at the Regional Counterdrug Training Academy at the Naval Air Station in Meridian , Miss .
There , officers attend presentations and role - play in a small area of the base called Mount City , which is modeled after the FBI ’s Hogan ’s Alley .
It ’s like a movie set , with a two - floor motel , a trailer outfitted to look like an inner-city row house , a pharmacy and other buildings . ”
It sounds like a lot of fucking money being spent to figure out ways to lock up a lot of people who do n’t matter and wo n’t change a fucking thing that ’s tragic in Memphis .
But , just look at the reader comments on the original article .
It ’s all congratulations and glorifying the spy rat fuck .
It ’s what the people want : a police state with no social safety nets where anyone without a “ can do ” attitude who dares to derive a little pleasure from their miserable existence as corporate slaves gets shipped off to the gulags .
I ’ve lived in the hood , and I ’ve lived in the mind numbingly boring , sterile , robotic , sexless , soulless and artless suburbs .
I can tell you , they ’re locking up the wrong people .
Yes , it ’s Friday and time for our weekly , “ Chaos Theory Edition ” round - up of all the week ’s strange and disturbing news items that we were unable to cover in previous posts .
Let ’s get started …
GOODBYE , TEDDY :
It ’s the end of an era…with the passing of Senator Edward Kennedy , the last of the four Kennedy brothers leaves our world and immediately enters the pages of the history books .
He was many things : a staunch liberal , a man well liked by legislators on both sides of the aisle , a skilled negotiator , a survivor of numerous personal tragedies and scandals , and a man who generally favored the pursuit of equality and the betterment of the lives of less - fortunate Americans .
Want to know more of Ted Kennedy ’s accomplishments ?
Here ’s a good write - up of the man often called the “ Liberal Lion of the Senate . “
You ’ve been affected by his work … and may not have even known it : The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) , the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , the Family Opportunity Act of 2006 … all of which are related to his lifelong goal of providing better health care opportunities to more Americans , especially children .

Both Democrats and Republicans have been quick to praise the late senator and his life ’s work .
If you want to hear some remarkable praise from men and women of ALL political leanings … this is a good source .
Some examples : President George W. Bush said , “ In a life filled with trials , Ted Kennedy never gave in to self - pity or despair .
“ President George H.W. Bush said , “ While we did n’t see eye to eye on many political issues through the years , I always respected his steadfast public service .
“ Nancy Reagan had this to say : “ Ronnie and Ted could always find common ground , and they had great respect for one another .
In recent years , Ted and I found our common ground in stem cell research .
“ President Obama praised Kennedy thusly : “ His ideas and ideals are stamped on scores of laws and reflected in millions of lives – in seniors who know new dignity , in families that know new opportunity , in children who know education ’s promise , and in all who can pursue their dream in an America that is more equal and more just – including myself .
“ And Hillary Clinton said Kennedy was , “ a legislator without peer ” who “ inspired generation after generation of young Americans to enter public service , to stand up for justice and to fight for progress , ” while President Bill Clinton described Kennedy as having a “ big heart , sharp mind and boundless energy … gifts he gave to make our democracy a more perfect union . “
political leanings … this is a good source .
President George W. Bush said , “ “ President “ “ Nancy Reagan had this to say : “ “ President Obama praised Kennedy thusly : “ “ And Hillary Clinton said Kennedy was , “ ” who “ ” while President Bill Clinton described Kennedy as having a “ “ For other Republicans … the praise was much more disingenuous and often , opportunistically inaccurate .
Senators McCain , Hatch , and Gregg…used Kennedy ’s passing as an excuse to attempt to drive a stake through health care reform , by intimating that compromise could not be reached without Kennedy ’s help .
The three Republican senators have tried to paint the current failure to arrive at a bipartisan solution as the result of Kennedy ’s lack of involvement , falling just short of saying that Kennedy … would have given up all the parts of the bill they wanted him to , in order to reach agreement .
Rachel Maddow does a good examination of this desire to make one of the most liberal members of the Senate look more “ centrist . ”
One … they are trying to shift the blame from the GOP and its unreasonable demands for concessions from the bill .
The truth is , if there is no bipartisanship on this bill , it has everything to do with them …and nothing to do with Kennedy .
Two … they are afraid .
Afraid that people will admire Kennedy .
Afraid that they will hear about his attempts to secure more equality for women , minorities , and gay citizens … that they will hear about his attempts to garner security and opportunity for America ’s least powerful citizens … that the people will realize that these things are what liberalism is all about , and will come to the conclusion that it must , therefore , be a good thing .
And if there is one thing the GOP does not want … it is liberalism being seen as a good thing .
… they are trying to shift the blame from the GOP and its unreasonable demands for concessions from the bill .
The truth is , if there is no bipartisanship on this bill , it has everything to do with them …and nothing to do with Kennedy .

And if there is one thing the GOP does not want … .
Ok … this is a little bit more bizarre than usual .
Here ’s a list of the “ 8 Strangest Reactions to Kennedy ’s Death . “
Some are real doozies … and Rush made the list .
Showing his usual lack of taste AND sense , Rush praised himself for predicting Senator Kennedy ’s death .
Really ?
Wow …who could have guessed that a 77 - year - old man with a brain tumor , and who keeps having seizures , would die so soon … ?

I Feel Like I ’m Taking Crazy Pills :
With the news of Edward Kennedy ’s passing … the Conservatives for Patients Rights organization has declared that it will temporarily suspend its vicious , and often false , attacks on the health care reform bills , out of respect for the senator .
Of course … it has been pointed out that this “ polite suspension of hostilities ” will save the group millions of dollars in ad money , but …I ’m sure that has nothing to do with it .
THE GREAT HEALTH CARE DEBATE :
We should n’t be surprised at reports that some doctors …are using their offices as “ bully pulpits ” to promote their own political agendas .
Here is a story of a woman who went to see a specialist , only to have him say , “ Well , we ’re in a box , because I ca n’t give you a cortisone shot , because of the valley fever [ an illness the patient had recently suffered ] … Your valley fever doctor would not be happy with me .
But we ’re lucky we ’re not in the Obama box , because if we were , I could n’t treat you because you ’re over 70 . “ This is , of course , a variation on the wildly inaccurate “ death panel ” theme espoused by opponents of reform , and it does not bear any resemblance to the truth … and it goes without saying that the patient was none to pleased to be confronted with partisan politics while seeking treatment for her ills .

You heard it here first : in a note similar to the item above , in both its nature and its inherent unprofessionalism …a Dean of the Vanderbilt School of Nursing , Colleen Conway Welch , saw fit to email ALL THE SCHOOL ’S STUDENTS and faculty a copy of an extremely partisan , anti-reform document .
The document may be viewed here .
If you skip past the non-factual bullet items to the section containing the “ sources ” of the information , you will find that two bullet points came from the now - discredited Lewin Group ( a research group exposed as being wholly owned by United Health Care ) , one point is attributed to the Heritage Foundation ( a partisan , right - wing “ think tank ” ) , and another point is directly sourced to Representative John Boehner and Governor Tim Pawlenty ( who are , of course , motivated by partisan politics ) .
Fortunately , another Dean saw fit to respond , telling the students that health care is an important topic that they should research themselves ( especially for the sake of the 45 million Americans without proper access to care ) … and that they should certainly not be swayed by partisan , chain letter propaganda .

Representative Michele Bachmann thought it a good idea to start her town hall meeting with a long , pointless joke about President Obama playing golf with Tiger Woods … many attendees disagreed and heckled the legislator with chants of “ Health care !
Health care ! “ Clips here .
She would later enchant the crowd with this particular piece of wisdom : “ Sometimes we can sometimes get confused when we hear the terms – millions , billions , trillions .
What does that mean ?
Let ’s just take an example : A million seconds is eleven and a half days .
A second is 32 years .
A trillion seconds is 32,000 years – there ’s a big difference between billions and trillions .
“
And thousands of miles away , Stephen Hawking threw up in his mouth a little bit , and did n’t know why …

Just yesterday , Senator Inhofe joined Senator McConnell in the “ I - have n ’t - read - the - bill - but - will - vote - against - it ” club…today they are joined by Representative Jim Marshall ( D - GA ) , who said that we have to do something or health care will bankrupt the economy … and even though he has n’t read either of the bills , he JUST KNOWS that they do n’t contain the right measures , so he will oppose them .
POLITICIANS BEHAVING BADLY :
Freshman Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins has now apologized : at a recent press conference she stated that Republicans are looking for the “ great white hope ” to come and revitalize the party .
The choice of this phrase is , of course , exceedingly unwise , given it entered usage during the civil rights era , when white Americans were looking for the “ great white hope “ … a white boxer that could defeat the boxing champion , Jack Johnson , who was black .

In a recent interview with NPR , RNC Chairman Michael Steele showed us that it is not hard to for a man who has not thought through any of his positions to get forced into a corner .
The short version : Steele says insurance should be regulated … the interviewer says “ wait a minute you would trust the government to look into that ?
“ … to which a flustered Steele says , “ No , I ’m talking about private .
I ’m talking about citizens .. , ” at which point the interviewer points out the government regulates insurance , not private citizens … Steele says , “ And so what .
Wait a minute .
Hold up .
You ’re doing a wonderful little dance here and trying to be cute .

Sarah Palin …now doing most of her communications , rather bizarrely , through Facebook , recently posted the following : “ FOX News ’ Glenn Beck is doing an extraordinary job this week walking America behind the scenes of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and outlining who is actually running the White House .
Monday night he asked us to invite one friend to watch ; tonight I invite all my friends to watch . “ That ’s right …
Beck is doing such an extraordinary job that over forty of his advertisers have left his show after he called the President a “ racist ” who has “ a deep - seated hatred of white people . “
“ That ’s right … Beck is doing such an extraordinary job that over forty of his advertisers have left his show after he called the President a “ ” who has “ “ Rex Rammell , an Idaho gubernatorial candidate , says he was only joking when he said he ’d buy a license to hunt President Obama .
Not funny … and arguably not legal , Mr. Rammell .
Democratic Party Chairman Keith Roark was overly kind in saying : “ Rex Rammell is pretty shrill , and I do n’t think he represents the mainstream of the Republican Party by any means . “
Mr. Roark … I ’m no longer certain that ’s true .
THE MEDIA – HACKS , PUNDITS , AND OTHER INVETERATE LIARS :
Remember Mark J. Penn … the devious mastermind behind most of the more vicious attacks to emanate from Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign ?
Well , Penn is now president and chief executive of Burson - Marsteller , one of the world ’s largest public relations firms .
Penn ALSO writes as a columnist for the Wall Street Journal .
The problem arose with Penn recently wrote a column for WSJ , about “ luxury camping ” and the impact it could have on the hotel / sporting good / travel industries .
After posting this column … Penn ’s company sends an internal email … suggesting they should use Penn ’s article as an excuse to contact hotel / sporting good / travel industries for their business .
While to you and I this appears to be a fairly clear example of a legal conflict of interest , but “ not so ” says the Wall Street Journal : “ the reality is that freelancers do use their columns as ways of marketing themselves .
“ Ummm … ” marketing themselves ” is perfectly fine … marketing their companies ’ products and / or services … not so much .

A guest on Sean Hannity ’s Fox News show , compares the Obama administration to the Nazis : “ National Socialism is very much what we see today in this administration , it ’s a policy almost line for line .
It ’s the same economic policy , it ’s the same political policy .
And so if they want to talk about Nazis , they better be careful about that conversation because they might find that the swastika is on their own arm . “
Hannity ’s response to this : “ Ok . ” Sean Hannity , folks … continuing to lower the bar of “ responsible journalism , ” one notch at a time .
GHOSTS OF OUR PAST :
The Pentagon … is profiling journalists .
Newly released files prove that , despite the Pentagon ’s claims that reporters were not “ graded ” on their coverage of military events , the Pentagon has been assessing members of the media as “ positive , ” “ neutral , ” or “ negative . ”
So- called “ neutral ” reporters were seen as malleable : a potentially negative story could be “ softened ” just by spoonfeeding them some positive quotes .
Meanwhile , if an action occurred that was a success and the Pentagon wanted to get maximum “ mileage ” out of it … they just had to present it to one of the reporters they knew to be “ positive ” and “ subjective . ”

Meanwhile , if an action occurred that was a success and the Pentagon wanted to get maximum “ mileage ” out of it … they just had to present it to one of the reporters they knew to be “ ” and “ . ” Earlier this week , we covered the disturbing number of Bush - era policies that President Obama has kept in place …or even expanded .
Well , add another to the list : the Obama administration has chosen to preserve the controversial policy that allows the government to search your laptop computer , cellphone , or any other electronic media … without probable cause or warrant while you are travelling .
Elizabeth Goitein , of the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice says , “ Under the policy begun by Bush and now continued by Obama , the government can open your laptop and read your medical records , financial records , e-mails , work product and personal correspondence – all without any suspicion of illegal activity .
“ The ACLU and other civil liberties groups have responded as would be expected .
“ The ACLU and other civil liberties groups have responded as would be expected .
The release of the Inspector General ’s report on American interrogation practices during the Bush administration , has caused many conservatives and conservative media outlets to proclaim that “ torture works , ” simply because the report shows that the torture produced “ information . ”
Well , Frances Fragos Townsend , Homeland Security adviser and close , personal adviser to President Bush states otherwise .
Townsend responds , “ It ’s very difficult to draw a cause and effect , because it ’s not clear when techniques were applied vs. when that information was received .
It ’s implicit .
It seems , when you read the report , that we got the – the – the most critical information after techniques had been applied .
But the report does n’t say that .
“ Oh yeah …and lest we forget : it would n’t even matter if it DID work … it would still be ILLEGAL according to federal and international law .
“ Oh yeah …and lest we forget : it would n’t even matter if it work … it would still be according to federal and international law .
Remember months ago , when former Vice President Cheney said that releasing the CIA documents would show that torture had been very effective ?
Well , they did not show that to be true at all … and they also showed him to be a liar when he said , “ The professionals involved in that program were very , very cautious , very careful – would n’t do anything without making certain it was authorized and that it was legal … and any suggestion to the contrary is just wrong .
Did it produce the desired results ?
I think it did . “
The report clearly shows just the opposite : these “ professionals ” were not cautious , not careful , and did quite a bit that was unauthorized … and it DID NOT produce the desired results .
You ’re batting .000 , Dick .
That wraps up another week .

およそ一年前に夏休みの自由研究として「品格本」リストを作ってみたのを思い出し、その後の一年ではどうだろうと調べてみた。
さすがに 「品格本」も下火だろうと思っていたがとんでもない。まったく懲りずに「品格本」は量産されていた。この一年で刊行されたのをざっと挙げてみる。
もうここまでくると何でも品格といった趣きだが、呆れて終わったのでは芸がない。
実はワタシは以前から『社畜の品格』というタイトルで新書を出せばかなり受けると思っているのだが、どうだろうかこの釣りタイトルは。
日本人の自己卑下とその裏返しの尊大さに見事に表現していると思うのだが、さすがにこれで一冊書きたいと思う人はいないか。
Megrahi is to point the finger
Megrahi ’s early release from prison on compassionate grounds .
Lawyers for the bomber were to argue that an “ elusive ” terrorist codenamed Abu Elias planted the bomb in December 1988 , causing the deaths of 270 innocent people .
Megrahi is now expected to identify the man behind this alias .
The Scottish Sunday Express tracked this man down to his home in the US , and he strongly denied having anything to do with the atrocity .
However , we can reveal that he has connections to at least two international terrorists and a Palestinian terror group , as well as links to the US intelligence services .
The man , who works as a schools engineer for the US government , was to become the central figure in Megrahi ’s aborted appeal .
‘ Elias ’ , a commander in a Palestinian terror organisation , was identified as the CIA ’s primary Lockerbie suspect but was never caught .
Megrahi set to name US ­citizen as prime suspect who hid behind terror alias of Abu Elias
Sources close to Megrahi believe he may actually have been a double agent working for the FBI or the CIA .
Last night the man , who we have chosen not to name , said : “ Sorry , I do n’t think that I can help in this case .
It is a clear case of either mistaken identity and / or fabrication .
“ I do n’t wish my name to be mentioned in any capacity in the press .
I am sure you understand the sensitivity of this matter since I have a family and children . ”
However , Christine Grahame MSP , who visited Megrahi in Greenock prison and campaigned for his release , is believed to be considering naming the man in the Scottish Parliament chamber .
She said : “ It is apparent that US intelligence has known or must have known the primary suspect of the Lockerbie bombing was alive and living safely in Washington .
“ There has been a suggestion made that he is in some way an ‘ intelligence asset ’ for the US and that is why he has been allowed to live in peace .
“ He must be deeply relieved that Megrahi was forced to drop his appeal and that he will never face justice for this atrocity . ”
Yesterday , Megrahi promised that before he dies he will present new evidence gathered for the appeal which will exonerate him .
He said he will call on the British and Scottish people “ to be the jury ” .
The man Megrahi believes was Abu Elias now lives in a suburban neighbourhood near Washington ’s Dulles airport , just a few miles from the White House and the Lockerbie memorial at Arlington National Cemetery .
He even has his own Facebook social network page .
He is the nephew of Syrian terror warlord Ahmed Jibril , the founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command ( PFLP - GC ) .
Jibril was allegedly paid $ 10 million by Iran to bomb an American passenger jet in retaliation for the US Navy accidentally shooting down an Iranian plane earlier in 1988 , killing all 298 pilgrims on board .
The man is also related to Nezar Hindawi , a Syrian currently serving a 45 - year sentence in Whitemoor high - security prison in Cambridgeshire for plotting to blow up an Israeli jet flying from Heathrow to Tel Aviv in 1986 .
A document submitted to the appeal court by Megrahi ’s lawyers states : “ The FBI had apparently investigated ‘ X ’ and knew he was the nephew of Ahmed Jibril .
“ ‘ X ’ had met with FBI special agents [ an appointment was in his diary for August 1988 ] but neither ‘ X ’ nor the Department of Justice would disclose who the agents were or the precise purpose of the recorded meeting .
‘ X ’ admitted the meeting had taken place .
It is inconceivable that he did not produce his Syrian passport for examination .
Only extracts from his US passport were revealed .
“ Once again , the hand of the US government appeared to be guiding matters behind the scenes . ”
‘ Elias ’ was also connected to Mohammed Abu Talb , an Egyptian named by Dumfries and Galloway Police as their chief suspect less than a year after the bombing .
The true identity of ‘ Elias ’ first came to light during a closed hearing at the Lockerbie trial in Holland in 2001 , which led to Megrahi ’s conviction .
However , the defence claim that attempts to investigate further were dismissed as a “ fishing ” exercise by the then Lord Advocate , Colin Boyd .
There is further evidence to link the PFLP - GC to the disaster , as first reported by the Scottish Sunday Express in 2004 .
In October 1988 , following a tip - off from the CIA , German police raided a PFLP - GC safe house in Neuss and discovered a bomb in a Toshiba cassette player , identical to the one which exploded on board Flight 103 , as well as a Pan Am timetable .
Codenamed Autumn Leaves , the raid resulted in 16 arrests including that of cell leader Hafez Dalkamoni , later convicted for a bombing campaign on German railways , and ­Marwan Khreesat , a double agent for the Jordanian intelligence service .

The same technology that lets cars drive themselves allows the blind to drive , too .
Virginia
Tech undergrads packed an all - terrain buggy with technology lifted from the university 's DARPA Urban Challenge entry to create a car the blind can drive .
The semi-autonomous vehicle uses a laser range finder , voice software and other sensory technology , and it worked flawlessly when blind drivers took the wheel on a closed course .
Advocates for the blind joined the lead researcher in calling the vehicle a breakthrough in independent living for the visually impaired .
" We are not only excited about the vehicle itself , but also the potential spinoff technologies from this project that could end up helping the blind , " Dennis Hong , the director of the university 's Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory , told Wired.com .
The car was born of a challenge the National Federation of the Blind 's Jernigan Institute issued in 2004 when it called on universities to develop a vehicle for the blind .
Virginia
Tech accepted the challenge in 2006 — the only university to do so — and received a $ 3,000 grant to begin the project .
The Blind Driver Challenge team at Virginia Tech 's Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory built the buggy .
The steering wheel is hooked up to a distance monitor that gathers information from laser range finders , and it uses voice software to tells the driver how far to turn the wheel .
For example , the monitor will tell the driver " turn left three clicks . "
As the driver does that , the monitor makes three clicking noises .
A vibrating vest provides cues to follow when accelerating and decelerating .
The vest vibrates in different places — the back , the belly and the shoulders — to convey different commands .
When the entire vest vibrates , it means , " Slam on the brakes ! "
" Originally we had a vibrating chair , but the vehicle was also vibrating on account of the motor , so drivers had some difficulty differentiating between the two , " Hong said .
" The 2009 - 2010 team will be applying this technology to an electric vehicle to eliminate the vibration caused by the motor altogether . "
Hong wants to continue working on a tactile map interface .
The system , called Airpix , shoots compressed air through tiny holes on a screen in real time , to provide a layout of the area surrounding the vehicle .
Drivers can " read " the map with a hand , much like Braille .
Hong said he needs more feedback from the blind and visually impaired to refine the system .
All this technology is clearly in its earliest stage , s and we 're a long way from the day when the blind join us in slogging through the morning commute .
But the Federation for the Blind hailed the vehicle and the promise it offers .
" It 's a great first step , " Wes Majerus , an access - technology expert for the federation , said in a press release .
" As far as the differences between human instructions and those given by the voice in the Blind Driver Challenge car , the car 's instructions are very precise .
You use the technology to act on the environment — the driving course — in a very orderly manner . "
Majerus drove the car and said , " It was great . "
Mark Riccobono , executive director of the Jernigan Institute , called his test drive historic .
" This is sort of our going - to - the - moon project , " he said .
Although the technology is progressing , laws prohibiting the blind from driving — not to mention public perception about that possibility — must be changed , Hong said .
That is why the Blind Driver 's Challenge team will be promoting the vehicle 's technology at a National Federation for the Blind–sponsored parade in Washington , D.C .
" People always say , ' What 's the point of this project ? ' "
Hong said .
" But blind people who drive the vehicle always have a big smile on their face afterwards .
It 's therapeutic and gives them hope of being entirely independent . "

Steve Jobs 's rail - thin appearance a year ago shocked Apple watchers .
An Apple flack tried to claim it was " a common bug . "
But Jobs , who has been battling pancreatic cancer , was in mortal danger , according to The Wall Street Journal .
" He was one real sick guy , '' said the Journal 's source .
" Fundamentally he was starving to death over a nine - month period .
He could n't digest protein . "
Jobs is on the mend after a six - month medical leave , and is expected to reassume his post as Apple 's CEO at the end of the month -- a return that investors and Macolytes alike will cheer .
The way the company handled Jobs 's illness , though , leaves lingering questions .
Last December , weeks before Jobs was expected to take the stage at the annual Macworld conference , the company 's highest - profile showcase for new products , Apple belatedly announced that the company 's best showman would be a no - show .
A spokesman tried to pass the decision off as a strategic move to bypass trade shows like Macworld in favor of smaller , more frequent product unveilings .
But Gizmodo , a gadget blog , revealed that Jobs 's rapidly declining health was the real reason for his absence .
Many scoffed at the story , which the blog attributed to an Apple insider .
But the Wall Street Journal reports that a person familiar with Jobs 's health said he was extremely ill .
Jobs is widely believed to have undergone a form of gastrointestinal surgery known as a Whipple procedure similar to a gastric bypass in 2004 .
Hormone deficiencies and related digestive problems are common in people who have undergone the Whipple , according to Fortune 's Apple 2.0 blog .
Tim Cook , Apple 's chief operating officer , has been running the company in Jobs 's absence .
In the past six months , during Jobs 's medical leave , Apple 's shares have soared , which raises the question :
Will the fickle investors who tanked the stock when rumors of Jobs 's ill health first emerged even notice if he returns to work ?
I have noticed holes appearing in my dirty underwear exactly where my girl - juices dry ( I'm a fairly juicy girl ) .
These holes are very specific -- if the stains dry on the inner layer around the crotch ( women 's underwear typically has two layers of cloth in the crotch region ) , the holes will only be in the inner layer where the protein stains used to be , not the outer layer .
What could be causing this ?
Am I so acidic that I 'm eating holes in my underwear ?
Or ( and this is seriously gross ) are bugs / mice supplementing their protein intake ?
I consider the latter because we do have cockroach / bug / mice problems , and there appears to be direct correlation between the appearance of holes and whether the underwear is on the floor and how long it 's been sitting there .
Mysterious holes are appearing in my dirty underwear where there are , ahem , juices .
This is probably not lunch - safe .

WASHINGTON  President Obama , noting that millions of Americans do not have enough savings to cover their retirement , announced a package of initiatives on Saturday to spur increased savings .
The administrative actions , which do not require new legislation from Congress , are intended to make it easier and more automatic for people to put money into tax - advantaged retirement accounts .
“ The fact is , even before this recession hit , the savings rate was essentially zero , while borrowing had risen and credit card debt had increased , ” Mr. Obama said in his weekly radio address .
“ Half of America ’s work force does n’t have access to a retirement plan at work .
And fewer than 10 percent of those without workplace retirement plans have one of their own . ”
Mr. Obama outlined four new initiatives , all of which are based on new behavioral research on ways to encourage people to save in a systematic way .

At the end of May and begin of June we saw several long threads on p6l about how to distribute Perl 6 modules , and if Mark Overmeer 's cpan6 project is ( part of ) the solution .
As far as I could tell the discussion did n't become very productive , partly because the participants tried to discuss too many things at once ( for example distribution problems , format of source repositories and binary distributions ) .
My personal conclusion was that cpan6 is n't going anywhere soon , and not being designed as an evolution of something existing it means that really much would have to happen until something useful comes out .
As a consequence I uploaded a Perl 6 module ( JSON : : Tiny ) to the existing CPAN and watched the fallout .
My next steps will be to teach proto to install modules from CPAN , and to pester the modules@perl.org mailing list .
Module loading
As the result of a perlmonks discussion Larry broke down module finding and loading into separate steps .
He also addressed the problem of having multiple modules with different authorities .
Strings and Bufs
Larry and I fleshed out the semantics for the Buf types , encoding and decoding and related issues ( r27095 , r27096 , r27097 , r27098 , r27100 , r27106 , r27365 ) .
Other changes
New built - in method Array.rotate ( r27062 , r27063 , r27073 )
Clarification on ties and epsilons in multi dispatch ( r27313 )
The constant declarator scopes like our ( r27313 )
Implementations
Rakudo
Although both jnthn and pmichaud had some vacations , Rakudo has seen some nice progress in June :
Martin Berends contributed an implementation of the Temporal type ( date and time stuff )
Methods now accept additional named arguments ( jnthn )
jnthn fix the BUILD submethod to be actually usable
If you load libraries from other programming languages , the symbols are now declared at compile time ( Tene )
Type checking of implicitly returned values ( jnthn )
Improved assignment handling ( pmichaud )
More introspection ( . ^parents , .^methods ) ( jnthn )
) ( jnthn )
Allow operators to be defined in the setting ( pmichaud )
Partially implement series and eqv operators ( moritz )
Literals in a signature act like where $ literal ( jnthn )
( jnthn ) minmax infix operator ( pmichaud )
take ( ) without gather now warns ( masak )
extensive multi dispatch refactor .
With even better handling of where - clauses , and allows generics in multi dispatch ( jnthn )
Currently Rakudo suffers from memory handling problems in parrot , where seemingly randomly the .succ method is called on strings ( which is equivalent to the ++ operator ) which for example mangles type names ( Hash becomes Hasi ) .
Smop and mildew
pmurias makes great progress in implementing multi dispatch for mildew .
Curiously he hits the same speed problems that Rakudo initially faced as the multi dispatch algorithm became more sophisticated .
To the Editor : Your Practical Traveler column “ Labor Day ’s Last - Minute Lure ” ( Aug. 23 ) highlighted the difficulties the travel industry is having during these challenging economic times .
Here ’s a suggestion to jump - start domestic travel : use stimulus funds to bring back the World ’s Fair .
Reinstituting the fair would create jobs during the planning / construction phases ; jobs and economic benefits during the fair ; and if the fair produces an innovative structure , permanent benefits for the host community as it shows off the structure .

One in 20 schoolchildren is said to suffer from a form of ADHD Allowing children with attention - deficit disorders to " queue jump " at theme parks could be doing them more harm than good , one expert suggests .
Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) are given passes in most theme parks if they can prove they have the condition .
This may reduce the stress of waiting , which they find very difficult .
But Professor Katya Rubia , of London 's Institute of Psychiatry , said it was important they learned to do so .
The Disability Discrimination
Act puts a duty on attractions such as leisure parks to accommodate the needs of all visitors : this can include those with ADHD if they provide the necessary documentation .
ADHD is now the most common childhood - onset behavioural disorder .
Those affected have a greatly reduced ability to maintain attention without being distracted and find it difficult to control what they are doing or saying .
At least one in 20 schoolchildren - 360,000 in total - is thought to have some degree of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , but some critics argue unruly behaviour is being overly medicalised .
Early lunch Professor Rubia who has researched ADHD said her work showed such children did have serious problems with understanding time and an inability to delay a reward .
This is no different to these children being allowed to go ahead in the dinner queue at school
Andrea Bilbow
ADDISS " This is clearly a medical condition , but it is n't right to bring them up in a system where they never have to wait .
You 're not making it any better for them - this is something they can be helped to learn .
" I can see why parents might like it , but in the long term you are not doing the child any favours .
This is a condition which we can improve , and learning to wait should be part of that process . "
The fact that ADHD children and carers can avail themselves of this scheme has sparked some controversy since appearing in the Times Educational Supplement .
But the chief executive of The National Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service said there was nothing controversial about it .
" These are children with a disability who cannot wait .
You cannot teach someone who is crippled to walk , someone who is deaf to hear , " says Andrea Bilbow .
" They have a 30 % maturity lag , and are emotionally younger than their peers .
" This is no different to these children being allowed to go ahead in the dinner queue at school .
" What people need to remember is that it does n't just make it easier for the child and their carers , it 's better for everyone in that queue too . "

Woman who was the inspiration for Sgt Pepper album track dies from lupus
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The woman who inspired the classic Beatles song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds , has died at the age of 46 .
The song featured on the groundbreaking 1967 album Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
John Lennon 's elder son Julian said the song was inspired by a picture he drew of his classmate Lucy O'Donnell when they were at a nursery school in Weybridge , Surrey , in 1966 .
Julian said he took the picture home and showed it to his father , explaining : " It 's Lucy in the sky with diamonds . "
When Lennon and Paul McCartney 's song was subsequently released , it caused controversy because of its hallucinogenic theme and supposed reference to the drug LSD .
The former classmates resumed their friendship in recent months when Lennon heard that Lucy , who was married to Ross Vodden and lived in Surbiton , Surrey , had become ill with lupus , a disease of the immune system .
The St Thomas Lupus Trust , which had been supporting the couple during Lucy Vodden 's illness , said she died last Tuesday aged 46 .
Angie Davidson , campaign director of the trust , said : " Everyone at the Louise Coote lupus unit was dreadfully shocked by the death of Lucy .
She was a great supporter of ours and a real fighter .
" It 's so sad that she has finally lost the battle she fought so bravely for so long . "
The trust said that Lennon and his mother Cynthia were " shocked and saddened " by her death .
A book of condolence will be opened on the trust 's website , www.lupus.org.uk.

David Chang has nothing against vegetarians .
He just does n’t like to cook for them .
That much is made clear on the menu of his East Village restaurant Momofuku Noodle Bar , which offers exactly one vegetarian dish — ginger - scallion noodles .
OUR ONLY VEGETARIAN OPTION , it reads in boldface type , as if to say , “ Hey , you can take it or leave it . ”
A further examination of the menu , with its exuberance of pig tails , pork necks , Berkshire bellies , and boutique bacon , might lead you to speculate as to whether Chang was kidnapped by a gang of vegan hippies at a young age and then force - fed wheatgrass and raw parsnips and this is his revenge .
Why would someone choose to run a restaurant with only one non-meat or non-fish option in a vegetarian - friendly neighborhood like the East Village ?
“ Well , I guess it was because I do n’t like people telling me what to do , ” says Chang .
And when Chang was struggling to keep Noodle Bar afloat in the months after its August 2004 opening , everyone was telling him what to do : “ From day one , people would say , ‘ You need more vegetarian options !
You need more vegetarian options ! ’ ”
Even casual passersby felt obligated to chime in with unsolicited opinions .
“ I ’d be outside having a cigarette , ” recalls Chang , “ and people would walk by me and say , ‘ Mo - mo - fuck - u , what a stupid name ! ’ ”
Back before Momofuku Noodle Bar was a certified hit , before it won widespread critical acclaim , before there was a rabble of foodies parked outside its door every night at 5:30 sharp , clamoring to get in , Chang remembers receiving a phone call .
“ It was a lady who said she was a vegetarian , ” he says , “ and that she got something to go , and there was broth on the side , and she drank it . ”
“ I said , ‘ We do n’t have any vegetarian broths , ’ and she said , ‘ Well , you should , and anyway , somebody said it was , ’ and I said , ‘ Well , that must have been a miscommunication . ’ ”
“ You ca n’t do this to the vegetarians ! ” the lady bellowed , before threatening to sue Chang and put Momofuku Noodle Bar out of business .
“ I got so pissed off , ” says Chang .
So pissed off , in fact , that the very next day , in a public - relations gambit that would give Danny Meyer night sweats , Chang and his co-chef , Joaquin Baca , removed every vegetarian dish from the menu ( back then there were still a few ) except the ginger - scallion noodles .
“ We added pork to just about everything else , ” says Chang , giggling like a schoolgirl .
“ We said , ‘ Fuck it , let ’s just cook what we want . ’ ”
David Chang is something of a culinary rebel .
In a town overflowing with precious temples of gastronomy and $ 2.50 falafel shacks , he has defiantly carved out a tasty , idiosyncratic middle ground with inventive new riffs on traditional Asian flavors .
His food is more than cheap and delicious — it is the unique synthesis of his highbrow training with his lowbrow appetites .
And it is , apparently , just what New York was hungering for .
In less than two years , Chang shot from obscurity to a James Beard nomination , Food & Wine magazine changed its own selection criteria to name him one of the country ’s Best New Chefs , and Noodle Bar ’s success touched off a wave of imitators , sending phrases like “ Berkshire pork ” and “ housemade pickles ” reverberating across menus around town .
“ For a lot of people , it was such a new concept , ” says Craft ’s Tom Colicchio .
“ A cool place where you could get really good food fairly inexpensively with no pretense and no bullshit . ”
The world was Chang ’s oyster , or at least his pork - belly bun .
So instead of enjoying the moment , instead of going upscale and trying to become the ethnic - food equivalent of Thomas Keller , instead of teaming up with a moneybags gastropreneur or Vegas tycoon to clone Momofuku across America , what did Dave “ Fuck It ” Chang do ?
He opened a burrito bar .
Not just any burrito bar , mind you , but a quirky , cafeteria - style Asian burrito bar in the East Village specializing in ssäm , a Korean word that means “ anything wrapped . ”
In this case , anything wrapped means everything from Berkshire pork to organic chicken accessorized with edamame , azuki beans , and kimchee purée , all folded with rice into a flour pancake .
Chang calls it Momofuku Ssäm Bar , and the decidedly unconventional ( not to mention schizophrenic ) approach he has taken there is to figuratively build a whole second restaurant on top of the first , essentially creating two restaurants in one .
The first , in an early shift , offers burritos to anyone who wants them .
The second , in a late shift , caters to a crowd of culinary aristocrats and off - duty chefs after the space transforms itself from a burrito bar each evening into a full - service restaurant with a menu that reads like some kind of lunatic gourmand ’s death - row wish list ( four types of country ham , a whole wheel of Epoisses , fancy corn dogs ) .
And still , there ’s more :
With the burrito profits he hopes to rake in , Chang plans to spin off more Asian - burrito bars , all in the service of bankrolling the ambitious efforts of his talented colleagues — who otherwise could n’t afford to open their own restaurants — in a revolutionary kind of culinary collective .
“ It ’s too hard to open up a restaurant now , even if you ’re really talented , ” says Chang , who plans to make his chefs and managers co-owners .
“ I believe it ’s got to be more of a group effort .
By doing this , we can attract more talent and change the way things are done . ”

But five months into its young life , Ssäm Bar is off to what Chang concedes is a disappointingly slow start .
“ This is n’t the cash cow we thought it would be , ” he says .
True , the late - night Ssäm Bar has achieved a certain cachet , but “ I definitely fucked up in thinking that we ’d have a bigger lunch business . ”
After a short - lived moment of Momofuku Noodle Bar glory , Chang finds himself questioning the very things that have made his career so successful to date : his quirky vision and refusal to compromise .
Saddled with a million - dollar loan and ever aware of his staff of top - notch cooks with visions of Momofuku - funded projects of their own in mind , Chang fluctuates almost hourly between doubt and confidence , optimism and regret .
Should he bag the burritos and start dishing up noodles ?
Should he relocate to midtown , where he ’s sure Ssäm Bar would thrive ?
Should he enter the Witness Relocation Program ?
Chang , in other words , is at a career crossroads , wondering if he , the unlikeliest upstart , has bitten off more than he can chew .
“ I never planned for this , ” Chang says one unusually warm fall morning , knocking off some payroll work in the doorless closet that passes for an office in Momofuku ’s dank basement .
Behind him , prep cooks are bracing for the lunch rush , cleaning shrimp and grabbing bottles of soy and Sriracha off the tightly packed shelves .
Upstairs , Black Sabbath is already blasting and a chef named Scott Garfinkel is experimenting with a new , typically Momofukian lunch special , a smoked - duck soup with rillettes - stuffed matzo balls .
Chang , a buzz - cut 29 - year - old Korean - American built like a small Czech weight lifter and seldom seen out of an exceedingly well - worn pair of tan twill Levi’s , quits out of Microsoft Excel and slings his Crumpler messenger bag over his shoulder .
There ’s blood - pressure medication to be picked up at Duane Reade , a sample bowl to be returned to Bowery Kitchen Supplies , and ten pounds of mutsu apples to lug back from Migliorelli ’s stand at the Union Square Greenmarket .
Another day in the life of an East Village restaurant mini-mogul .
Chang ’s success at Noodle Bar was n’t something anyone could have predicted .
The youngest son of Korean parents ( his father owned restaurants in suburban Virginia ) , Chang had always loved noodles but never contemplated cooking professionally until discovering Alan Yau ’s pioneering Wagamama during a college semester abroad in London .
“ That restaurant was so ahead of its time , ” says Chang .
But Chang ’s real culinary awakening came in Japan .
After enrolling at the French Culinary Institute , and doing early - career stints at Mercer Kitchen and Craft , the noodle - obsessed Chang wangled a kitchen connection in a Tokyo ramen shop .
Finding himself living rent - free in a homeless men ’s shelter and working for one of its more unbalanced residents ( a ramen chef who “ laughed his ass off ” when Chang nearly severed a finger with a cleaver ) was n’t exactly what he ’d hoped for .
He moved on to less - perilous posts at an izakaya and the Tokyo Park Hyatt .
But mostly , he ate .
“ Japan changed the way I think about food , ” Chang says .
“ It ’s a food culture .
And food did n’t have to be great on just a fine - dining level .
You could eat really well .
Even fast - food chains were awesome . ”
After eight months , Chang returned to New York and a line - cook position at Café Boulud , where he found himself struggling to keep up in what he calls “ a kitchen full of ninjas . ”
If that kitchen had twelve cooks and all of them were awesome , he reasoned , his chances of getting his own high - end restaurant were “ minimal . ”
By then , Chang had had his eureka moment at Wagamama , eaten at hundreds of ramen bars , and trained under some of New York ’s most acclaimed chefs , and although he might not have known it at the time , he was developing his own culinary personality , one that did n’t find its ultimate expression in rigid Japanese tradition or classic French technique .
At 26 , an age when most ambitious cooks are content to toil anonymously on the haute cuisine slow track , Chang was getting antsy .
“ I wanted to do something different , and I knew it was n’t going to be fine dining . ”
In August 2004 , Chang opened the restaurant he ’d been conjuring since that first Wagamama lunch almost a decade earlier .
He called it Momofuku Noodle Bar .
Momofuku means “ lucky peach , ” and also happens to be the name of the man who invented instant ramen , Momofuku Ando , who died earlier this month .
Chang ’s dad helped raise the $ 130,000 it cost to build the 650 - square - foot cork - and - plywood - paneled noodle bar , done on the cheap by the same Japanese architect who ’d built ChikaLicious around the corner .
Before he opened , he spent a week apprenticing at Rai Rai Ken , a nearby noodle shop .
“ The guy said , ‘ You ’re gonna fail , ’ ” remembers Chang , and he had no reason not to believe him .
Days from opening , he ’d already lost his minuscule staff to more - established kitchens .
“ It ’s a hard sell to be like , ‘ I ’m opening up a noodle bar , we ’re going to serve ramen ’— essentially , that ’s all we did for the first few months — ‘ how would you like to work for me ? ’ he says .
“ Everyone was like , ‘ You ’re a retard .
You ’ve never been a sous - chef anywhere . ’ ”
Happily for Chang , that did n’t much matter to Joaquin Baca , a 28 - year - old cook from New Mexico who was having a hard time getting his foot in the door at Manhattan restaurants .
They opened the doors with a menu of hot and cold noodles that Chang was reluctant to categorize as Japanese , Korean , or , worst of all , fusion .
After his time in Japan , where ramen was religion , he knew better than to claim authenticity .
But customers were slow to respond to the spartan space and the streamlined , untraditional menu .
Alone behind the dining counter , the two cooks glowered sullenly at the comparatively bustling Sapporo East across First Avenue .
Chang remembers thinking , “ Let ’s cook better than those guys , then let ’s try to raise the level from there . ”
And they did — sourcing Berkshire pork for their house ramen and crowning it with fresh Greenmarket corn and slow - poached eggs .
“ We had nothing to lose .
No one expected anything from us . ”
Why run a restaurant with only one non-meat or non-fish option in a vegetarian - friendly neighborhood ?
“ I guess I do n’t like people telling me what to do , ” says Chang .
Except , of course , themselves .
One cold December afternoon , the two chefs took a cigarette break , and Chang told Baca that if they went out of business , it would n’t be for lack of trying .
“ I knew there was no way we could have done more , ” he says .
“ We worked like maniacs .
Having that freedom made us say , ‘ Fuck it , let ’s start cooking now . ’
That ’s sort of what changed it for us . ”
Soon , they hired three more cooks and expanded the menu , and in April , they diversified it with a section called “ Spring ” ( later changed to “ Local ” ) , incorporating more farm - fresh Greenmarket produce and giving rise to such elegant , original combinations as asparagus with miso butter and a slow - poached egg , or local tomatoes with tofu and shiso .
But more than their own determination , more than the new staff , Chang attributes the change in Momofuku ’s fortunes to the support it received from the restaurant community .
“ I remember one day , maybe our second month into it , our dishwasher did n’t show up , we were down big - time , and all my friends from Café Boulud came in to eat , ” he says .
“ They all washed dishes that night .
I think what really carried us at the end of the day was that we really took care of the cooks .
The word really spread . ”
And it ’s a fact of life in the restaurant world that where the chefs go , so go the groupies and the gourmands .
Mario Batali , who makes a point of hitting all the new places , was an early fan .
“ It ’s fun , it ’s delicious , and it offers value , ” he says , likening the pleasure - per - square - foot ratio to other tiny venues like ’ino and the original Tasting Room .
“ He was really smart to do what he did , ” says Marco Canora , Chang ’s onetime boss who ’d left Craft to open Hearth .
“ He found a niche , and people latched on to it . ”
Not only did Chang and Baca , by then partners , survive the first year , August 2005 was Momofuku ’s best month yet .
After that , says Chang , “ it grew so fast , like it ’s on steroids . ”
In its first year , Noodle Bar took in under $ 500,000 ; the year after that , $ 1 million .
This year , Chang is projecting sales of $ 2 million .
Then there were the James Beard and Food & Wine honors .
Chang , whose renegade spirit is tempered with characteristic self - effacement , is at a loss to explain it all .
“ It ’s like lightning in a bottle , ” he says .
“ We caught it . ”
Momofuku Ssäm bar ’s opening party on August 21 was a Who ’s Who of New York food cognoscenti .
Martha Stewart was in the house , as were the Batterberrys of Food Arts fame .
Food &
Wine had colonized one table .
Wylie Dufresne sauntered in with his girlfriend , Every Day With Rachael Ray ’s Maile Carpenter .
Pork ssäms and lettuce wraps flew out of the kitchen and were wolfishly devoured and washed down with Korean beer and Chang ’s favorite soft drink , Dr Pepper .
Blogger Ed Levine made quick work of a pile of pork buns .
Chang looked shell - shocked .
He had no way of knowing that that night would be the best reception his ssäms have yet to get .
In February 2006 , as Noodle Bar was riding the wave of its newfound popularity , Chang signed a lease on 207 Second Avenue , a onetime Chinese dive that had sat vacant for twelve years .
It was close to Noodle Bar and more than twice as big , and the $ 10,000 - a- month , fifteen - year lease Chang negotiated was way below market .
It was just the spot , Chang thought , for his second venture , an idea he ’d had even before he dreamed up Noodle Bar : a very fast , very casual Asian - burrito bar .
It would have been easy for him to go another route .
He was flooded with offers .
Everyone , not least his own customers , thought he was nuts .
“ Why do n’t you just open up a bigger Noodle Bar ? ” was a constant refrain .
“ Yeah , we could have done it , ” says Chang .
“ And sure , we want to make a lot of money , too .
But we wanted to take a chance and experiment .
We wanted to do it because we thought it would work . ”
The seeds of Chang ’s fast - food fixation might have been planted in Tokyo , but they were nourished by another major influence closer to home .
“ I tried to get a job at Chipotle when I got back from Japan , but they would n’t hire me , ” he says .
“ They knew what I was up to . ”
It ’s easy to see the parallels between Ssäm Bar and the Tex - Mex monolith that ’s invaded Manhattan .
“ A lot of this is premised on what Chipotle ’s done : Make affordable , good food , and do it with integrity . ”
According to Chang , “ There ’s a reason people do fast food . ”
It ’s easy to replicate , for one .
Chang was wary , too , of cannibalizing Noodle Bar ’s business .
“ Not to say that we want to raise the average check , ” he says , but if that happened , “ we ’d have Ssäm Bar there as a cheaper alternative . ”
And he was looking for something highly profitable to finance his chefs ’ collective .
Chang knew no investor would swallow that kind of risk .
By putting Noodle Bar up against Ssäm Bar for a loan and establishing two lines of credit , Chang staked everything on his Asian burrito .
So far , despite the undeniably delicious food , the gamble has n’t paid off .
In its first few weeks , Ssäm Bar sat empty most hours , its glass façade putting Chang ’s miscalculations on painfully public display .
Chang was hoping to sell 100 ssäms at lunch but was lucky to move that many all day .
Right away , Chang started making adjustments .
He added options like brisket and tofu to the ssäm menu , and , in a decidedly un-Changian concession , he even let people customize their own .
Business picked up little by little , but it was still nowhere near what he ’d projected .
With daytime lagging , a kitchen of restless cooks , and $ 1 million in loans to pay off , Chang let the rest of the team persuade him to launch the late - night menu in late September , months earlier than scheduled .
From Wednesday through Sunday , 10:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. , the ssäm station shut down and the ranges were fired up .
Chilmark oysters were shucked , Finchville Farms country ham was sliced , and cooks served up such offbeat , elegant fare as fish - sauce - dressed fried cauliflower with chilies and mint , and a banh - mi - by - any - other - name three - terrine sandwich .
To drink , there was sake , beer , and sparkling wine .
With the lights dimmed and the conversation buzzing , Ssäm Bar assumed a different personality , low - key but lively , with a steady flow of local chefs , hungry revelers , and foodies making pilgrimages from distant Zip Codes .
Soon , late night was outpacing daytime , but Noodle Bar was still subsidizing both operations .
That was n’t the only problem .
The restaurant ’s dual - concept schizophrenia was confusing , to say the least .
“ People came in at night and wanted a ssäm , ” says Chang .
“ Or they ’d come in during the day and want a banh mi . ”
The first of this year , Chang did something he ’s unaccustomed to .
He officially gave in .
The burrito - bar hours were curtailed to 11 to 6 , and the late - night hours , complete with table service , were expanded to 6 to 2 a.m. , seven nights a week .
Chang obsesses over his missteps .
“ The location was a miscalculation , ” he says .
“ If we opened in midtown , we ’d do really well . ”
It might have been an error , too , he now says , to create such a sleek stage for what really amounted to a self - service cafeteria .
But mostly he believes that “ people really wanted Noodle Bar .
I ca n’t even stress that enough , how pissed off people were that we did n’t open up a bigger Noodle Bar . ”
What they tend to forget , though , is that Noodle Bar was n’t an instant smash either .
“ It ’s a restaurant ; it ’s not a movie that does n’t change , ” he says .
In the coming weeks , Chang plans to add daytime delivery at Ssäm , something Mario Batali has been encouraging him to do from the start .
Chang is also making self - imposed management changes .
Even though Ssäm Bar started out as a team effort , he says , “ I ’m such a control freak , my hands were all over it .
I ’m trying to let go . ”
And what if none of it works ?
There are always other options .
“ People take a big shit on Vegas , but to a restaurant owner or chef , it ’s so fucking hard to open a restaurant in New York City , ” he says .
“ You ’ve got to fight the goddamn community board to get a liquor license .
You ’ve got to go through hoops to get building permits .
And here you have people in Las Vegas who want you there , who want to help you .
Yeah , it ’s a fucking armpit .
But at the same time , it ’s a legitimate opportunity to do something , make some more money , and to do it without all the crazy headaches .
I would n’t say no now .
I ’ve always said if we were going to do another Noodle Bar , it would probably be in a place like Vegas . ”
If he gets the right offer , he just might take it , he says .
“ As long as it ’s on our terms . ”
BECKY : Who do you think the biggest heroes ( of the financial crisis ) are ?
BUFFETT : Well , I think the heroes are -- are -- ( Federal Reserve Chairman ) Bernanke .
I think ( former Treasury Secretary ) Paulson 's a hero .
I think ( Treasury Secretary ) Geithner ’s a hero are -- I -- I -- you know , you can look back and say you could have done this a little differently or that a little differently , but at the time I called it an economic Pearl Harbor and in the end we got through Pearl Harbor .
And -- and it could have turned out a lot differently .
BECKY :
There are some people , including ( bank analyst ) Meredith Whitney , who say -- we 've just kicked things down the road .
That the banks -- are -- are still struggling .
That we have a lot of problems that could still come up from credit cards , from other areas , from consumers getting pinched for -- needing credit .
Are we through the worst of it ?
And --
BUFFETT : Oh , I think we 're certainly — we ’re through the worst of it in residential real estate in all probability .
And -- and -- and the reason is we 're building a lot fewer houses and we 're -- and we 're forming households , so that solves itself over time .
Does n't do it in a day or a week , but it solves itself .
So we 're further on that .
We 're gonna have unusual losses in credit cards and in commercial real estate , all of that .
But we 're a lot better off than we were a year ago .
I mean for one thing on some of the -- some of the toxic assets have been flushed through .
There 's been capital raised .
There ’s -- we 're immeasurably better than we were -- off than we were a year ago .
BECKY : But is there a risk of a second downturn ?
Will unemployment levels climb to a point where it becomes a leading indicator rather than a lagging indicator ?
BUFFETT : I-- I think the odds are very much against getting significantly worse .
It 's sort of plateaued at the -- at the bottom right now , but if you got some horrible exogenous event , some -- some , you know , 9/11 -- type event or worse -- you know , you could have something that would be dis -- really disruptive and start things all over again .
But in terms of problems that we 've identified and are working with , we 've got more to come .
But we 're -- we 're -- we 're past the -- we 're past the critical point .
BECKY : What are the most important economic indicators that you watch ?
Is there a series of numbers ?
Are there -- some statistics that you look at most closely ?
BUFFETT : Well , I look at our businesses every day .
But I -- I look at everything .
I mean I-- I -- I look at car loadings .
I look at the Fed 's balance sheet .
Whatever it may be .
I mean I -- and -- and we have not bounced -- but we 've quit going down .
I 'm and -- and it — the world will come back .
I 've never been able to tell whether it 's gonna be a week or a month or -- six months .
But we are on the mend .
And -- and if you look at -- at housing prices and activity in the mid to lower price range , it changed dramatically from a year ago .
We 're seeing some stability .
BECKY : All right .
Let me go at this another way .
Let 's pretend you 're on a desert island for a month .
There 's only one set of numbers you can get .
What would it be ?
BUFFETT : Well , I would probably look at -- perhaps freight car loadings and -- perhaps -- and -- and truck tonnage moved and -- but I ’d want to look at a lot of figures .
( LAUGHTER )
BECKY : You are the biggest shareholder -- Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest shareholder in Kraft .
Is the Kraft bid to go after Cadbury a good one ?
BUFFETT : Well , it 's a pretty full one .
I mean -- the -- Kraft -- Kraft has got -- anytime you 're in a takeover , you know , that -- the animal spirits run high and all of that .
But Kraft has the disadvantage of using an undervalued stock .
So if you -- if part of your currency is a stock that 's worth more money than it 's selling for and you 're -- you 're paying full negotiated value for the other guy ’s property and you would n't sell your own property for anything like the market price , it 's -- it 's a-- it makes it a tough game .
So it 's -- it 's a full price .
BECKY : Are -- that makes it sound like as if you 're not in favor of this bid ?
BUFFETT : No , I -- I 've got a lot of confidence in ( Kraft CEO ) Irene Rosenfeld .
She 'll -- but they have to do a lot of things right to justify this price .
BECKY : What do you think about the -- the talk towards health care and where things are headed right now ?
BUFFETT : Well , I think that -- unfortunately , I think that the -- what -- what -- we 're really talking about reforming health insurance more than health care .
So I -- the incentives that produce the 16 or so percent of GDP that 's going to health care , I think unfortunately they 're getting -- they 're going to get changed .
But -- so I think that we really -- and I 'm talking as much about reforming health care as we 're talking about reforming the insurance .
And I think that will be an opportunity missed if we do n't do more about looking at what -- what the incentives are in the present system and what they would be in an ideal system .
BECKY : And then finally , if -- if you had to -- give a gauge of where you stand on the economy again right now -- versus what you were thinking three months ago , is it the same ?
Is it better ?
BUFFETT : It -- it has n't gotten worse .
It has n't gotten much better either .
But the very fact that time is passing , it 's -- it 's gotten better in residential real estate .
That ’s important .
Certain things have n't hit much yet .
Commercial real estate , for example .
But we are moving through a recession .
And -- and -- and I see nothing that makes me worry about the fact that it 's going to be worse than I would have thought three months ago .

Last week , Frank Swain and I wrote a piece for The Guardian in which we questioned the various parties on their science policies ahead of the elections .
We heavily criticised the Green Party of England an Wales , in spite of their sparkling climate and environmental credentials , and in doing so kicked off a debate that ran for much of the week on blogs and in The Times .
On one side , many people thanked us for exposing deeply troubling attitudes .
On the other , Greens angrily claimed we had misrepresented their views .
So are the Green Party anti-science ; and if so what should they be doing to correct this ?
Frank and I set out to write our article by putting nine science - themed questions to the parties .
We knew that our response from the Green Party was going to be interesting when we saw this quote :
“ The Green Party , for example , is in favour of increased funding for research on methods of integrated conventional and holistic treatments for cancer . [… ]
We would oppose attempts to regulate complementary medicine , except by licensing and review boards made up of representatives of their respective alternative health care fields . ”
As Tim Minchin put it , alternative medicine by definition is medicine that has been proven not to work , or not been proven to work .
Alternative medicine that works is called “ medicine ” .
Under the Green Party , money that could be spent researching actual evidence - based treatments for cancer could instead be diverted to quack remedies like homeopathy .
Genius .
And to say that the $ 60 bn dollar alternative medicine industry needs no external regulation is just moronic .
Either their quack remedies have a clinical effect or they do n’t ; and if they do they should be treated like any other drug .
Their policies on GM and stem cell research were equally confused , and would devastate large areas of biological research in Britain .
I ’m neither a fanatical supporter nor opponent of GM food ; but clearly any new development in GM technology has both risks and benefits .
You would think , therefore , that a sensible policy would involving assessing those , and acting based on that information with appropriate regulation , along the lines of the precautionary principle .
Apparently not :
“ Genetically modified food presents significant and un-quantified risks to human health and the environment .
These outweigh any benefits . ”
If you do n’t know the risks , then how the hell can you claim that they outweight any potential benefits ?
Surely more research would be the answer in this case ?
But under Green Party policy , the import of genetically modified organisms would be banned outright , making research all but impossible .
It is an incredibly irrational approach , but we we see the same stunt pulled in their policy on stem cell research :
“ The Green Party believes that experiments on human embryos could have unforeseen outcomes harmful both to individuals and to society .
We would work for an immediate international ban on all cloning and genetic manipulation of embryos , whether for research , therapeutic or reproductive purposes . ”
Again , how can you ban all research into something on the basis of unknown consequences ?
Particularly when research into embryonic stem cells is so vital for progress in treating numerous conditions and diseases ?
Again , I ’m all in favour of using the precautionary principle , but to ban something with known benefits on the basis of unstated “ consequences ” is just plain ignorant .
They would allow the continued use of adult stem cells , but in doing so they appear to have swallowed the myth that these can always act as a substitute for the use of embryonic cells .
In short , while The Greens mean well , we found that their science policies in many areas were a disaster , and so we went ahead and published out results with suitably critical commentary .
The response we got back via e-mail from the party press office was frankly unimpressive , and included the following memorable quote :
“ Well , what can you say ?
We have an election platform that is talking about creating 1 million jobs through local food , renewable energy , and energy efficiency … and our lead candidate in the North West is up against Nick Griffin , the BNP ’s leader , for the final seat in that region .
But the most important thing for you to do is critique our support for alternative medicine ? ”
No .
I ’m not having that .
I ’m not being told that we ’re not allowed to criticise Green Party policy in case the BNP get in .
It is a miserable gambit designed to evade criticism .
As much as I despise and hate the BNP , the idea of giving the Greens a free pass goes against every basic principle of democracy and free speech .
The backlash continued on various blogs , with HolfordWatch taking flak for “ misrepresenting ” the party .
Some of the most intense criticism came in response to an article that Mark Henderson of The Times wrote about our work to leave comments like :
“ … the Green Party is not anti-science , as this misleading and extremely biased article is trying to suggest . ”
“ Please do n’t be misled by misrepresentations of our policies . ”
“ Instead of reading second - hand accounts of what our political opponents say that we say , how about looking about what we actually do say ? ”
None of these people hurling accusations of bias and misrepresentation at us appeared to appreciate the fact that we had posted their own statements unedited on our blogs , standing next to our commentary for everyone to see .
As much as they ranted , few dared to point out specific instances where these terrible misrepresentations had occurred , and when they did they were simply referred back to their own statements .
I am deeply frustrated that , rather than attempting to defend their policies or engage with criticism from scientists , party supporters resorted to mud-slinging .
The fundamental problem is that in the Green Party , anyone can propose a policy , call a vote , and get it accepted in the manifesto .
It ’s one of those ideas that ’s cute in theory , but the fact is that since most members of most parties are n’t likely to have much of a clue about things like modern genetics or cancer research , their policies are based on a popularity contest rather than considered appraisal of the evidence .
The truth is n’t democratic , and the whole structure of the party works against the idea of evidence - based policy .
So to be fair to our critics , I do n’t think they were being dishonest ; they probably did feel that we misrepresented them because it ’s unlikely that many party members support the whole manifesto .
You probably could n’t find a Green Party member that their manifesto fully and accurately represented .
I do n’t want to give the impression that I dislike the Greens .
I ’m a fan of a number of their members , and they ’ve done vital work pushing climate change up the national agenda .
I have huge respect for figures like Patrick Harvie from the Scottish party .
My hope is that by ramming home this message I can encourage them to properly consider their policies .
The first and most important thing for the party to do is to acknowledge that their policies are far out of step with the scientific community .
They genuinely do n’t seem to realise this , and I suspect this comes from a lack of engagement with actual scientists .
The second thing they need to do then is to engage with the scientific community , and bring evidence back into the policy - making process .
The third , is to build a more coherent set of policies so that their members are all singing from the same hymn sheet , rather than noisily squawking across each other .
If they do , then we can begin to take them more seriously .
If they do n’t they will continue to fall victim to the lunatic fringe .
Javascript is a weird language .
Great but weird .
Take functions for example .
You cannot only pass any type of arguments , you can also pass any number of arguments .
This may be quite disturbing , especially for Java developers .
Recently I had a discussion with a Java developer who complained about missing code assistance in Javascript , by which he meant no hint about the type of an argument .
This is of course due to the dynamically typed nature of Javascript .
While in Java you denote the expected type of a parameter , and it ’s the caller ’s duty to pass the correct type ( even more , you cannot pass a different type ) , in Javascript it ’s the function ’s duty to handle the given parameters and do something reasonable with unexpected types .
The question arises :
How do you write type safe functions in Javascript ?
Let me explain this by an example implementation to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers .
[ The greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest integer that devides these integers without a remainder .
The greatest common divisor ( or gcd for short ) of 24 and 15 is 3 , since 24 = 3 · 8 and 15 = 3 · 5 . ]
This is a basic implementation to calculate the greatest common divisor .
It ’s based upon the fact that gcd ( n , m ) = gcd ( n- m , m ) and gcd ( n , n ) = n .
This is a very easy algorithm , though not the fastest .
function greatestCommonDivisor ( n , m ) { if ( n === m ) { return n ; } if ( n < m ) { return greatestCommonDivisor(n , m - n ) ; } return greatestCommonDivisor( n - m , n ) ; }
So now , how do you make this function type safe ?
It 's a function for integers , how do you handle , for example , strings ?
Leave it to the user
The easiest answer is , you do n't .
Just leave the responsibility to the user .
If he's to dumb to provide integers let him handle the consequences .
[ By the way , what happens when calling this function with strings ?
Interestingly , you might get the right result ,
greatestCommonDivisor ( " 24 " , " 15 " )
returns 3 , but this is sheer luck .
greatestCommonDivisor ( " 9 " , " 24 " )
results in an infinite loop . ]
The consequences could be ( a ) the right result ( unlikely but possible ) , ( b ) an error thrown ( ugly , but the user asked for it ) , ( c ) unexpected results like
NaN
,
null
or
undefined
( still ugly ) or ( d ) an infinite loop .
This last possibility should make us discard the easy answer .
We might accept a ( we surly would ) , b and c ; d however is out of question .
Type check arguments
So the second answer is to type check the arguments .
We want numbers , so we reject anything else .
How do we reject unexpected types ?
Throw an error , at least for now .
function greatestCommonDivisor ( n , m ) { if ( typeof n !== " number " || typeof m !== " number " ) { throw " Arguments must be numbers " ; ) if ( n === m ) { return n ; } if ( n < m ) { return greatestCommonDivisor(n , m - n ) ; } return greatestCommonDivisor( n - m , n ) ; }
Convert arguments
While this is a valid solution , there are better .
If n and m come from user input , it 's likely they might be strings .
Strings can be easily converted to numbers , so instead of rejecting them , we should convert them .
This can be done by calling Number as a functíon :
function greatestCommonDivisor ( n , m ) { n = Number (n ) ; m = Number (m ) ; //
We had to change that check , since Number ( ) might return NaN if ( isNaN ( n ) || isNaN ( m ) ) { throw new TypeError ( " Arguments must be numbers " ) ; ) if ( n === m ) { return n ; } if ( n < m ) { return greatestCommonDivisor(n , m - n ) ; } return greatestCommonDivisor( n - m , n ) ; }
Better design
So now you know three concepts of handling unexpected types : Ignore them ( might result in infinitive loops , bad ) , reject them ( why give up so easily , bad ) and convert them ( good ) .
The concept might be good , but the implementation lacks something .
I 'll show you what .
First ( and that is a minor point ) the algorithm is bad .
If you pass negative numbers or zero , it results in an infinitive loop .
This can be solved by taking the absolute value ( gcd(n , m ) equals gcd ( - n , m ) ) .
Second ( a minor point as well ) the greatest common divisor expects integers but conversion to number results in float values .
This can be solved by using
parseInt ()
instead of
Number ( )
.
The third point is a major .
The function greatestCommonDivisor is called recursively .
That means in every call we type convert and check the arguments , although after the first call we know the arguments have the correct type .
There is an elegant solution .
First , we convert and check the arguments .
Then we define an inner function to do the calculation , which is then called recursively .
Since we provide the arguments for the inner function , we do n't have to check them again there .
The fourth is a minor point again .
When dealing with numbers I 'd rather not throw an error but return
NaN
instead .
If the user provides arguments which result in
NaN
, we should just tell him so .
Therefore we get the following solution to how to write a type safe function in Javascript :
function greatestCommonDivisor ( n , m ) { // convert n to an integer using parseInt , // take the absolute value to prevent infinitive loops n = Math.abs ( parseInt(n , 10 ) ) ; // do the same for m m = Math.abs( parseInt( m , 10 ) ) ; // check if conversion lead to NaN if ( isNaN ( n ) || isNaN ( m ) ) { return NaN ; ) // prevent infinitve loop when one argument is zero if ( n === 0 ) { return m ; } if ( m === 0 ) { return n ; } // now the inner function var gcd = function ( n , m ) { // gcd( n,1 ) is 1 , so prevent recursion to speed things up if ( n === 1 || m === 1 ) { return 1 ; } if ( n === m ) { return n ; } if ( n < m ) { return gcd(n , m - n ) ; } return gcd( n - m , n ) ; } ; // invoke the inner function return gcd(n , m ) ; }
There , we 're done !
Now ... would n't it be great to make type checking automated ?
Something like
var typeSafeGcd = makeTypeSafe(greatestCommonDivisor , [ " int " , " int " ] ) ; typeSafeGcd( 21 , 15 ) ; // would still return 3 typeSafeGcd( 21.5 , " abc " ) ; // would fail
Yes , this can be done and I will show you how .
There are some drawbacks though .
First , how do you automatically convert an unexpected type ?
It 's easy for some types , for example if you expect a number .
However , how do you convert a string to an array ?
Simply wrap the string ?
Split it somehow ?
Converting requires some thought and depends on the context .
Therefore I think it 's not a good idea to do so automatically .
That leaves checking types and rejecting unsupported ones .
Second , how do you reject unsupported types ?
You could either return null , undefined or NaN ( depending on the context ) or throw an error .
Both ways lead to the user having to check the results of function calls .
In other words , you push the responsibility to provide correct parameters off to the user .
Graceful conversion definitely is the better alternative .
So keep on reading , if you still want to know how to automatically make a function type safe .
This is heavy stuff .
I do not expect you to understand it , if you are a beginner in Javascript .
I try to explain everything in detail , so maybe you should give it a try .
I 've written a jQuery plugin that makes type safe functions , so if you do n't understand how it 's done , you can use it nonetheless ...
So what do we want ?
We want some way to automatedly check the given arguments by just telling which types we expect .
We want to reject all other values .
We want to reject the incorrect number of arguments .
Let 's start step by step .
var makeTypeSafe = function ( f , parameterList ) { return f ; } ;
We define a
makeTypeSafe
- function that accepts two parameters : f , the function to make type safe , and parameterList , the list of expected types of arguments of f .
This function does nothing so far except returning the original function .
Now reject the wrong number of arguments :
var makeTypeSafe = function ( f , parameterList ) { var p = parameterList.length ; // return a function that first checks the arguments before calling the // original function return function () { // check number of arguments if ( arguments.length !== p ) { throw " Unexpected number of arguments .
Expected " + p + " , got " + arguments .
length ; } // call f , passing the arguments , preserving the context return f.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; } ;
Here we do no longer return the original function but a new function .
This new function checks if the number of arguments (
arguments .
length
) is different from the expected number of arguments (
parameterList.length
) .
If so , it throws an error .
If not , f is called ( and its return value returned ) .
Need an example of how to use it ?
Here you are .
var add = function ( a , b ) { return a + b ; } ; var addIntegers = makeTypeSafe ( add , [ " int " , " int " ] ) ; addIntegers ( 21 ) ; // will throw an error addIntegers ( 21,15 ) ; // will return 36 addIntegers ( " abc " , 42 ) ; // will not throw an error
Why does n't the last call throw an error ?
Because until now we only check the number of arguments , not the type .
Let 's change that .
var types = { " int " : function ( n ) { // by comparing n to its floor value we see if it's an integer return n === Math.floor (n ) ; } } ;
Here we define an object with one property , a function called int , which checks if a given argument is an integer .
Since there is no integer type in Javascript , we do this by comparing n to its floor value ( which is the same for integers ) .
Extending the
makeTypeSafe
function to check the types of arguments leads to the following code :
var types = { " int " : function ( n ) { return n === Math.floor(n ) ; } } ; var makeTypeSafe = function ( f , parameterList ) { return function () { // check number of arguments if ( arguments.length !== parameterList.length ) { throw " Unexpected number of arguments .
Expected " + p + " , got " + arguments.
length + " . " ; } // check every argument using the types functions defined above for ( var i = 0 , l = arguments .
length ; i < l ; i++) { if ( !types[parameterList [i ] ] ( arguments [ i ] ) ) { throw " Invalid argument at " + i + " .
Argument must be of type " + parameterList[i ] + " . " ; } } // call original function return f.apply ( this , arguments ) ; } ; } ;
That 's basically the way to automatedly check parameters before executing the original function .
Now we can extend the types object to accept more types :
var types = { " int " : function ( n ) { // by comparing n to its floor value we see if it's an integer return n === Math.floor (n ) ; } , " double " : function ( n ) { // NaN is a number as well , so check that n is not NaN return typeof n === " number " && ! isNaN ( n ) ; } , " string " : function ( n ) { return typeof n === " string " ; } } ;
We could even add more sophisticated types like natural numbers or arrays of integers .
types [ " natural " ] : function ( n ) { // replace > by >= if 0 is natural to you return types [ " int " ] ( n ) && n > 0 ; } ; types [ " int [ ] " ] : function ( n ) { // accept only arrays if ( ! ( n instanceof Array ) ) { return false ; } // check if every element is an integer for ( var i = 0 , l = n.length ; i < l ; i ++) { if ( ! types [ " int " ] ( n [ i ] ) ) { return false ; } } return true ; } ;
" Make a jQuery plugin ! " my fellow co-author Christian cried .
Well , personally I do n't fancy jQuery , but if you must make a function type safe , you might be using jQuery anyway , so why not ?
I extended the list of build - in types to support int , double ( alias float ) , string , boolean , char , object and arrays of those types as well ( used via int [ ] , double [ ] etc ) .
Furthermore , the list of of expected parameters is checked for unknown types .
I solved the original function to calculate the greatest common divisor
// Define internal gcd function var gcd = function ( a , b ) { if ( a === b ) { return a ; } if ( a === 1 || b === 1 ) { return 1 ; } if ( a < b ) { return gcd ( a , b - a ) ; } return gcd( a - b , b ) ; } ; // extend the known types to support natural numbers jQuery.makeTypeSafe.types [ " natural " ] = function ( n ) { return jQuery.makeTypeSafe.types [ " int " ] ( n ) && n > 0 ; } ; // make gcd type safe var greatestCommonDivisor = jQuery.makeTypeSafe(gcd , [ " natural " , " natural " ] ) ; // call type safe gcd function greatestCommonDivisor ( 21 , 15 ) ; // returns 3 greatestCommonDivisor ( " 21 " , " 15 " ) ; // throws an error
Any questions , any remarks ?
Feel free to comment !
I spent the past several months away from politics .
It was an involuntary hiatus made necessary by personal and professional commitments that demanded my utmost attention .
When I left , we had a stimulus bill in place , a president with high approval ratings and some remaining afterglow from election night and inauguration day .
When I returned in mid August , it was to a country that had clearly lost its damn mind .
I turned on one cable station to hear people demanding President Obama prove he ’s an American citizen , an insane movement led by an Israeli citizen .
I switched channels to see another group screeching in fear that Obama ’s health care proposal would institute death panels to kill grandma .
On yet another station , Glenn Beck accuses this president of having a deep - seated hatred for half of himself .
Flip again to find parents removing their children from school because they do n’t want their kids exposed to Obama ’s socialist indoctrination .
And yesterday , Green Jobs Czar Van Jones resigned after extreme pressure from right wing groups and extreme tepidness from the White House that hired him to do his very important work .
Great .
After a brief respite , the most accessible American political discourse has returned to fearful , hate - filled , ignorant rants of a high - volume , low - intellect minority .
In such an environment , how does one govern ?
Does one try to “ balance ” such concepts as contradictory as a “ public option ” on one hand and “ fear of death panels ” on the other ?
Or does one realize that this is a false spectrum and to try to find a center in such a sea is a worthless and foolhardy expedition ?
Too often , this White House has sent the signal that it seeks common ground and conciliation with parties interested in its total destruction .
From my point of view , negotiating with ignorance , fear , hate and irrationality is insane .
For example , when a major Republican figure in the health care negotiations spreads the death panel lie ( Grassley ) , you see him for what he is , realize you ’re dealing with a group of psychopaths , and reset the objectives .
“ Oh , so that ’s how it ’s gonna be ?
Cool .
Good to know what we ’re dealing with .
Thanks for your time .
We wo n’t be needing your services anymore .
We ’re taking our ball and playing somewhere else . ”
Negotiations require trust and trust assumes that all parties are not completely batshit crazy .
I realize I ’m lumping a variety of “ opposition ” camps together : birthers , deathers , those who accuse the president of racism and those who accuse him of socialism .
I ’m grouping them because to me they all come from the same place .
They ’re engaging in a form of terrorism .
They are using psychological violence ( and occasionally the threat of real violence ) to pursue a political objective , and in so doing , inflicting harm upon non-combatants .
If there ’s one thing we ’ve learned from the movies , it ’s that “ The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists . ”
Yet this White House is willing to let these psychological terrorists set the terms of the debate and negotiate from their insane positions .
One group of people is trying to talk about co-pays .
The other thinks the president is a secret Kenyan .
One group of people sees the creation of domestic , sustainable jobs as a cornerstone of the 21st century economy .
The other thinks the president is going to murder your grandmother .
This is not legitimate political discourse and to make decisions acknowledging terms so far apart in their reality is just plain stupid .
Van Jones was one of the good guys .
A really , really good guy .
He used his education and his passion to combat police brutality and the massive , wasteful incarceration of so many of this nation ’s young , brown people .
Having fought in the trenches for so long , he saw an opportunity to build hope and jobs and tangible communities as the world responds to the climate crisis .
He connected the dots and inspired action and had a vision .
He was the rare outsider who got a chance to move inside , and move he did .
Van was the kind of guy that gave me real confidence in this administration ’s seriousness .
President Obama meets with generals every day and sees scary reports and wants to get re-elected .
I can always make some politics - based allowances for his underwhelming actions .
Van , however , was truly one of us .
He got it .
And to give someone like him power gave me more faith in the president .
So when the lynch mob came after Van , it was a test .
The same test so many Democratic administrations have failed time and time again .
When the going gets tough , do you back your people , or do you fall back on excuses .
This White House , this administration and this president failed Van , failed its supporters and failed to honor the efforts of millions that got them into office in the first place .
What ’s the point of having power if you do n’t use it ?
When will this White House realize that nothing it does will ever be acceptable to the loud - mouthed , ignorant minority ?
When will it learn that you cannot negotiate with terrorists ??
I ’m heartbroken over Van ’s departure because it ’s these little meaningless concessions that undermine people ’s faith in the system .
You get folks all riled up about change .
You empower a man who embodies that change .
And they you let him be run out of office by fucking Glenn Beck ?
So Glenn Beck is running the White House now ?
Is that how it ’s gonna be ?
Just tell me that I knocked on all those doors for nothing , and I can start the grieving process , but do n’t pretend this will solve anything .
I ca n’t help but look at this spineless response and see it in contrast to the previous administration .
You know how gangsta they are ?
DICK CHENEY IS STILL TALKING SMACK !
You do n’t see anyone of prominence telling him to shut up .
The man who has been wrong about everything gets the full support of his party , yet President Obama ca n’t find enough audacity to stick up for a true change agent ?
How do you expect folks to continue to go to the mat for your agenda , when you so easily sacrifice our best and brightest at the whim of an illegitimate lynch mob ?
How do you expect the next generation to invest themselves in the political process when they see that despite their good works , they can be taken out over nonsense , especially when the double standard is so abundantly clear ?
How can you ask from us what you wo n’t do for us ?
And when will you realize that you cannot negotiate with terrorists ?

John William Moyer , 60 , likes his females short , dark and hairy .
Moyer was found guilty of groping a Minnie Mouse character at the Magic Kingdom and sentenced to 180 days of probation , 50 hours , of community service , and a $ 1,000 fine .
Presumably , he also had to get to his car with Mickey , Pluto , Grumpy , Pete , and the Beagle Boys awaiting for him in the parking lot .
Moyer fought the charges that he groped the breasts and buttocks of Brittney Duncan McGoldrick .
Notably , McGoldrick did not call out for help because she thought Disney would fire her for breaking character .
That did not seem to stop a Pluto character who was kicked in the groin by a young boy :
The Mouse was defended in court by a Bear — prosecutor David Bear — who decried the plight of the custom character generally with an argument that seemed to come out of Horton Hears a Who : “ It does n’t matter she was grabbed , she ’s just a mouse . . .
It ’s not just a mouse , it ’s a person . ”
This is not the first controversy involving inappropriate conduct with Minnie , here .

After months of marching in line as senior Democrats worked with the White House to develop healthcare legislation , liberal lawmakers from solidly Democratic districts are threatening a revolt that could doom President Obama ’s bid to sign a major bill this year .
In the House , liberals are furious at their leaders for striking a deal with conservative Democrats that would weaken the proposal to create a government insurance program , a dream long cherished on the left .
On Thursday , 57 of these liberals sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) warning that they would vote against any bill that contained the terms of the deal .
“ We have compromised and we can compromise no more , ” an angry Rep. Lynn Woolsey ( D - Petaluma ) said at a raucous news conference outside the Capitol .

Meanwhile in the Senate , a growing number of Democrats and Republicans were taking aim at an effort led by finance committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) to develop centrist healthcare legislation that could attract GOP support -- in part by eliminating a government plan entirely .
The rising tide of liberal anger sent the White House scrambling , with Obama calling at least one left - leaning lawmaker to offer reassurance before Congress leaves town for its August break .
On Thursday , Pelosi and other House Democratic leaders also met privately with a group of labor leaders , consumer advocates and AARP to enlist their support .
Ever since the Democrats won congressional majorities in 2006 , party leaders have struggled to balance the demands of their liberal and more conservative members .

And although the leadership has more than a month to rally enough votes to pass healthcare bills when Congress returns in September , the latest unrest is raising a menacing specter for the president and his allies .
Some worry about a possible repeat of the healthcare debacles in the early 1970s and ‘ 90s , when divisions within the party helped doom bids to create universal coverage .
“ Historically , the good has become the enemy of the perfect , ” warned Ron Pollack , a veteran of past healthcare battles who heads the consumer group Families USA .
“ I ’m afraid we have seen that repeated a little bit in the past several days . ”
Scores of liberal Democrats favor a single - payer system similar to those in Canada and Britain , where the government controls the delivery of healthcare .
( Eighty - six House Democrats are cosponsoring a bill to create a single - payer system in the U.S. )
But most , eager to break the decades - long logjam blocking a healthcare overhaul , decided that they would have to compromise this year .

During the presidential campaign and after taking office , Obama voiced his support for liberal healthcare principles .
And many lawmakers put their faith in liberal leaders such as Pelosi and Reps.
Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) , Charles B. Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) and George Miller ( D - Martinez ) , the three committee chairmen who wrote the bill being debated in the House .
That measure -- and a similar one developed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) and his staff -- includes a provision creating a government - run insurance plan as an alternative to private coverage .
“ What the American people want , very clearly , is a Medicare - type public option in 50 states in this country which will give them the choice against private insurance companies , ” said Sen.
Bernie Sanders , an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats .
Polls have shown consistently that a large majority of Americans favor such a plan .
But senior House and Senate Democrats are contending with a growing cadre of party centrists , many of whom are uneasy about expanding government ’s role in healthcare .
Advertisement
“ It ’s the moderates that give [ Democrats ] their majority , ” said Will Marshall , president of the centrist Progressive Policy Institute .
“ The bigger the Democratic majority grows , the more moderate it becomes .
Democrats are a center - left coalition , so big legislative initiatives need to be shaped accordingly . ”
House leaders bowed to that idea this week .
Facing the prospect that a group of conservative Democrats in the 52 - member Blue Dog Coalition might block a healthcare bill from moving through the energy and commerce committee , they modified the bill .
The backlash was swift and severe .
“ We ’re at a point where there ’s no retreat , and we can and must hold the line , ” said Rep. Raul M. Grijalva ( D - Ariz . ) , co-chairman of the liberal Congressional Progressive Caucus .
Advertisement
In a letter , liberal lawmakers attacked the deal .
“ We regard the agreement reached by Chairman Waxman and several Blue Dog members of the committee as fundamentally unacceptable , ” they wrote .
“ This agreement is not a step forward toward a good healthcare bill , but a large step backwards . ”
In the Senate , John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) , a widely respected , longtime advocate of a healthcare overhaul , took aim at a key part of the Baucus efforts to craft a bipartisan bill : a proposal to create a system of insurance cooperatives in place of a government plan .
“ We can not afford to hang our hat on any unproven , unregulated or unreliable model for health insurance coverage , ” said Rockefeller , who also expressed his expectation that Baucus ’ effort would fail to produce a bill before the August recess .
Advertisement
“ I have a sense the tide is moving the other way , ” he said .
Pelosi , meanwhile , was left to try to downplay the divisions in her party .
“ We have tremendous diversity , whether it is generational , geographic , philosophical , ethnic , gender , you name it , ” she said .
“ It is a great kaleidoscope . ”

Blue Dog Coalition : a primer
It calls its members moderates , centrists and fiscal conservatives .
In a Democratic Party well - stocked with liberal lawmakers , the Blue Dog Coalition of 52 House members has aimed , in its own words , to “ bridge the gap between ideological extremes . ”
History
Advertisement
The group has focused mostly on budget issues -- asking Congress , for example , to adopt “ pay as you go ” rules to limit deficit spending .
The Blue Dogs have been an important faction of the party since forming in 1995 , but rarely in recent years have they been so blunt in confronting the liberal - dominated party leadership .
Healthcare debate
This week , the 15 - year - old coalition claimed a success in the most important legislative fight of the moment : the battle to draft an overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system .
After holding up the legislation for more than a week , a faction of the Blue Dogs won concessions from Democratic leaders Wednesday that could give the overhaul a more centrist bent .
Advertisement
It was a significant moment for the coalition , and one that has prompted an angry backlash from more - liberal House Democrats .
Due to pressure from the Blue Dogs , the House healthcare package might scale back the ability that a government - run insurance plan would have to compete with private insurers .
The coalition also won an agreement to exempt more small businesses from a requirement that they provide health insurance to their employees or pay a financial penalty .
And the Blue Dogs negotiated to delay a House vote until September , which will give lawmakers more time to understand the complex bill -- but will also give opponents more time to rally against it .
Member breakdown
Most of the coalition ’s members come from rural and suburban districts , many in the South .
According to the Blue Dogs ’ website , their name is taken from the South ’s longtime description of a party loyalist as someone who would vote for a yellow dog if it were on the ballot as a Democrat .
Members chose the “ Blue Dog ” moniker , the website said , because they had been “ choked blue ” by more - liberal colleagues for their moderate and conservative views .

In recent years , many Blue Dogs have come from districts that until recently were dominated by Republicans .
These members could be vulnerable at election time if they are too closely identified with a liberal agenda .

Last week a story which gained very little traction hit the financial newswires .
The U.S. Treasury is working on an internal project informally called “ Plan C ” which seeks to deal with further problems in the economy before they occur .
The anonymous report came out stating the administration is reluctant to commit any additional money especially to the level mentioned in the report .
However this is a disturbing new development in our bailout nation since this is one of the first times that the U.S.
Treasury will try to preemptively deal with a financial problem .
The issues with this Plan C is that it is setup to be a buffer on further deterioration in various loan categories but the big one is commercial real estate .
The commercial real estate market is gigantic and many of those loans are still active :
Some $ 3.5 trillion in commercial real estate loans are out in the market .
The problem is complicated because commercial real estate holders simply rollover their debt into new loans .
That of course has changed since the economy and credit markets have shutdown and many of these properties are now severely underwater .
Take a look at how many loans will be turning over :
* Source : ZeroHedge
The amount of maturing loans in commercial real estate will double in 2010 and will continue upward into 2010 .
The chart is very clear and this is only for debt in CMBS and not held by regional banks which is over $ 2 trillion .
This is the next multi-trillion dollar bailout you have yet to hear about .
In fact , while many are discussing a second half recovery higher up officials are already planning a bailout for the commercial real estate industry .
The challenge with this bailout is you are asking a public with 26,000,000 unemployed and underemployed Americans to shoulder the debt of largely speculative plays .
To many it is palatable to bailout the residential real estate market because the public can understand that ( even if it may be wrong ) or bailing out the 2 large U.S. automakers .
Yet bailing out the commercial real estate market is going to be a political nightmare .
Of course the U.S. Treasury would like you to believe this is merely a precaution but most of the last precautions we have heard about have turned out to be trillions and trillions in full on commitments shouldered by the American public :
“ ( WaPo ) We are continually examining different scenarios going forward ; that ’s just prudent planning , ” Treasury spokesman Andrew Williams said .
The officials in charge of Plan C — named to allude to a last line of defense — face a particular challenge in addressing the breakdown of commercial real estate lending .
Banks and other firms that provided such loans in the past have sharply curtailed lending .
That has left many developers and construction companies out in the cold .
Over the next few years , these groups face a tidal wave of commercial real estate debt — some estimates peg the total at more than $ 3 trillion — that they will need to refinance .
These loans were issued during this decade ’s construction boom with the mistaken expectation that they would be refinanced on the same generous terms after a few years .
The credit crisis changed all of that .
Now few developers can find anyone to refinance their debt , endangering healthy and distressed properties . ”
The end of the road has been reached for commercial real estate .
Many regional banks jumped into the commercial real estate market since they had little chance of competing with big subprime and Alt - A mortgage factories like WaMu or Countrywide .
Many regional banks saw this as a way to stay competitive in local regions across the country .
This is a much more diverse problem and the tentacles of the commercial real estate bust will be felt in every state .
These loans were made on strip malls , doctor ’s offices , and drive - through restaurants for communities that are hurting from the recession .
This is an enormous amount of debt that is out there that will surely default since there is no way to refinance this debt since many of these projects are literally underwater .
Take a look at the composition of over 8,000 banks and thrifts across the country :
Factoring in construction and commercial loans you arrive at a stunning 26 percent of all loans in FDIC banks and thrifts .
This is a staggering figure and the U.S. Treasury is well aware of this .
The question is n’t whether there will be major defaults here but who will shoulder the cost ?
So far , each consecutive bailout has largely been taken up by the U.S. taxpayer .
The problem of course is the cost of all these bailouts will eventually catch up through a tanking dollar and possibly the long - term viability of our economy .
Plan C is a preemptive bailout on an entire industry .
The reason the government is devising a plan is that these loans will start going bad in large amounts and they are gearing up on a process of dumping this large mess on the American people .
Yet it is going to be a politically hard sell for many to bailout a strip - mall from some large developer .
And make no mistake , the market for commercial loans is all but closed :
You are reading the above graph correctly .
In the 1st quarter commercial loans fell by a stunning 50 percent on a quarterly basis .
And the amount of bad loans is only growing :
If you have n’t heard of Plan C you soon will .
The commercial real estate bailout is the next ploy from Wall Street and the U.S. Treasury .

Description :
This is Part 3 of the rootkits primer created by Corey from WatchGuard .
Begin by watching Part 1 , if you have not done so already .
In this video Corey talks about kernel mode rootkits .
He begins the discussion with the basics of user mode and kernel mode , and talks about Ring 0 to Ring 3 .
Ring 0 has the highest privilege and is generally the kernel code of the system .
Ring 3 has the least privilege and this is where all the userland programs operate .
The operating system ensures that a lower privilege process , cannot read or write to the memory of a higher privilege process .
As an example , a userland program such as a word processor cannot read / write to the windows kernel memory .
This mechanism ensures that the system remains uncorrupted even if userland programs malfunction .
Most Anti-Virus and Firewalls work in kernel mode , so that they can continuously monitor userland programs for malicious activity .
Thus all userland rootkits can easily be detected by kernel mode AV tools .
But what if the rootkit itself was in kernel mode ?
Enter the world of kernel mode rootkits !
A kernel mode rootkit runs in Ring 0 and thus has the highest privilege .
Such a rootkit is very tough to detect as it can easily subvert AV mechanisms and is even tougher to remove from an infected system .
In this video Corey explains how kernel mode rootkits work at a very high level and talks about rootkit detection software such as Rootkit Revealer BlackLight and IceSword .
Note that we also covered the Helios Lite Rootkit Remover from Miel E-Security a couple of videos back .

Artisan Cheese from Pugs Leap Farm May Disappear if Food Safety Bill Passes
by Pascal Destandau of Pugs Leap Farm
Eric Smith and I own and operate a small diversified farm in Sonoma County , at Pugs Leap Farm we milk twenty seven goats by hand and make cheeses we sell at local farmers markets in Sonoma , Marin , Alameda and San Francisco .
We have a few chickens and sell the eggs at the markets .
In the next few years we hope to take to the markets the fruits and nuts from the orchards we planted .
We also grow onions , garlics , chards , salad greens , tomatoes , corn , squash , strawberry and culinary herbs .
We intend to add a few beehives next year .
HR2749 ( The Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009 ) which is currently making its way rapidly through the House of Representative will put us out of business .
HR2749 calls for :
a yearly registration with the FDA with a $ 500 fee
full HACCP plan for every type of produce sold or processed , for us that mean one plan for the dairy , one one for cheese making , one for transporting and retailing at the market , one for the fruits and vegetables , and another one for the nuts
FDA approved methods by which crops are raised and harvested .
The most likely outcome will be along the lines of the leafy green ordinance , scorched earth and exclusion of any wildlife .
I have twenty two years experience in research and development and in technical operations , at a managerial level , in the pharmaceutical and personal care products industry .
I therefore know very well the resources
needed to create and maintain a full HACCP plan .
Creating one plan would take me about 100 hours and maintaining it would take 2 hours per day of production .
Based on quotes I obtained in 2006 for laboratory testing , I estimate that I would need to budget $ 15,000 / year just for the microbiological testing of the cheeses .
The International Dairy Food Association ( IDFA ) has published some guidelines for HACCP which were used by the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments ( NCIMS ) when it developed a voluntary dairy HACCP program in parallel with the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance ( PMO ) .
To follow those guidelines I will have to start testing every batch of milk for drug residues , I will also have to tests for pesticide residues and mycotoxins .
I am still in the process of researching what amount of testing will be needed for compliance and it is still unclear if I will be allowed to do my own testing or if I ’ll need to send samples to a certified laboratory .
This will be decided when the regulations are written .
Stopping feeding cattle a high grain diet would be much more efficient than an HACCP plan to eliminate E. Coli O157:H7 from our meat supply .
The same for silage and Listeria .
The practice of feeding antibiotics for faster weight gain has been linked to the presence of antibiotic resistant strains of salmonella in chicken , turkey , beef and pork .
Recently MRSA has been found in pork meat .
The enforcement of HACCP plan for all food producers will do nothing to address those problems .
Furthermore HACCP plans are very industry friendly and rely on self regulation and self regulation does not work .
For example in 2006 from January to June , Cadbury knowingly shipped products tainted with salmonella ; Cadbury ’s defense is that the levels in the chocolate were too low to cause illness .
On July seven the White House appointed Michael R. Taylor Advisor to FDA Commissioner .
The press release mention that it is his third appointment at the FDA and that Taylor will work to :
Assess current food program challenges and opportunities
Identify capacity needs and regulatory priorities
Develop plans for allocating fiscal year 2010 resources
Develop the FDA ’s budget request for fiscal year 2011
Plan implementation of new food safety legislation .
The press release failed to mention Mr. Taylor connections with Monsanto .
Mr. Taylor began at the FDA in 1976 as a litigating attorney , he left to join King & Spalding where Monsanto was his personal client regarding food labeling and regulatory issues ..
He returned to the FDA as Deputy Commissioner for Policy from 1991 to 1994 , overseeing FDA ’s policy development and rulemaking , including the implementation of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and issuance of new seafood safety rules .
This was a new position created for him and he instantly became the FDA official with the greatest influence on GM food regulation , overseeing the development of government policy .
He was part of the team that issued the very industry - friendly policy on food biotechnology and that approved the use of Monsanto ’s genetically engineered growth hormone in dairy cows .
He introduced the the concept of substantial equivalence as an appropriate method for determining safety .
This is the basis for the lack of safety testing and the non labeling of GMO containing food .
The same concept was used to prevent dairy products to be labeled as rBGH free .
Mr. Taylor left the FDA in 1994 for the USDA .
In 1996 he went back to King & Spalding and in 1998 he was appointed vice president of Public Policy by Monsanto .
I am very concerned that Mr. Taylor will use his position to issue very tech heavy , industry friendly regulations that will place an unbearable burden on small producers and family farms .
Food safety is compromised by industrial farming practices not by sustainable farming .
The cost of cheap food has been food safety .
My personal check list for food safety is : no GMO , no trans fat , no high fructose corn syrup , no food colorants , no artificial flavors , no rBGH , no meat , eggs or dairy from CAFO’s .
The short version is do not eat anything with a bar code .
Size based regulations are possible .
In the new FDA egg safety regulations producers with less than 3,000 laying hen are exempt , producers with more than 3,000 but less than 50,000 have 36 months to comply , producers with more than 50,000 have 12 months to comply .
We do need farmers and consumers to start writing to your House Representative and request that HR 2749 include similar exemptions and provisions .

sandbox - X creates new empty directories in the $ HOMEDIR and / tmp
It labels these sandbox_x_file_t : MCS where MCS is a randomly selected MCS label
it then execs seunshare , specifying the new HOMEDIR and new / tmp , as well as an SELinux context and the command to run
/usr / sbin/seunshare is a new setuid C Program
seunshare calls unshare ( 2 ) to disassociate mount names from the process execution context , seunshare bind - mounts the sandbox HOMEDIR and / tmp these over the current $ HOMEDIR and / tmp seunshare then execs the shell under a sandbox_x_t : MCS context
When seunshare exits , sandbox - X destroys the contents of the temporary $ HOMEDIR and / tmp
sandbox_x_t policy prevents anything running in the sandbox from using the network , touching any user home content , allowing it to only read / write to sandox_x_file_t , basically locking it down .
I decided not to use the X Access Control Extension ( XAce ) to provide separation since I could never achieve the separation I wanted using it .
I use Xephyr to start a whole new X server .
This prevents XClients running within Xephyr from talking directly to the host X Server .
I also use a window manager Matchbox which maximizes the app to the size of the xserver .
sandbox - X evince ~/ Documents /RedHat/selinux_four_things.p
df
sandbox - X xterm
sandbox -X -t sandbox_web_t firefox danwalsh.livejournal.com
sandbox -X COMMAND
The main thing is that the Xephyr window is not resizable , so after the apps starts the app can not be resized .
Maybe the X team will fix this , or provide a rootless X on X server , which would let us allow sandboxed applications to at least communicate with each other .
Cut and Paste does not work ,
But then , that 's kind of the idea .
NFS home directories do not currently work since NFS does not support labeling .
This tool can generate lots of AVC's if you try to do evil stuff within your sandbox .
We would like to have the sandbox tool prompt you if any of the input to the sandbox has changed , so the user could decide whether or not to save the input .
Maybe allow sandbox to specify only a shared subdirectory of the users homedir , where the sandbox would be allowed to write .
You could say allow OpenOffice to save to ~/ sandboxout
One of the downsides of working in security is that we seldom get to do cool things .
The desktop engineers , VM engineers , even kernel engineers get to show off cool stuff .
But security guys usually only ever get to show how we broke something , if that .
Sometimes all we can do is say " trust us , it 's working . "
But I think I have something cool to show off which I 'm callingBack in May , I wrote a blog entry describing the " SELinux Sandbox " , , which provides a way to run a filter - type program within a locked - down sandbox .
This allows administrators to take untrusted content , run it through one or more filters , and be able to trust that the content can't cause the filter programs to do evil things .
As soon as I released it , I received email asking if It could be used to sandbox Acroread , and I had to say " Sorry , it ca n't do that " .
Acroread and most other desktop applications use multiple communication channels , interacting not just with stdin and stdout , but accessing configuration files , directly or using interprocess calls as with GConf , the X server and other applications , and usually have full run of the user 's home directory .
A bug in a desktop application can be exploited to attack other processes on the system through any of these channels .
Attempting to lock down access to these things usually just causes applications to break , or at least degrades the user experience .
In a nutshell , there was no good , general - purpose way to lock down Acroread , or that matter , any other desktop application .
Over the years several attempts have been made to lock down Desktop apps , most of which have failed .
I have often discouraged policy writers from attempting to write policy to lock down Firefox .
The main reason for this is the difficulty of locking down various information flows described above .
Tools like firefox are expected to be able to read and write all over the homedir and need pretty full access to X.
For example I might have a security goal that firefox application will not send email .
So I can check if my policy prevents firefox from sending email .
But my security goal can change depending on the content that I want to look at .
For whatever reason , I might want to allow OpenOffice to have full access to everything in my homedir when I launch it from the start menu , but when it is launched from firefox on untrusted content , I only want OpenOffice to be able to display , print , or email that content , not my credit card data .... I introduced xguest a year or so ago , and I 've thought about why people liked the concept and the ways people were telling me they were using it .
( Xguest is the least privileged user , his homedir is cleared on exit , and he is only able to connect to http ports ) .
I have been told that some people use xguest to go to untrusted sites where they do not want to have bad data left behind .
Others have told me they use xguest to run games , to make sure the downloaded games are n't allowed to do evil things .
The first step was to create a new $ HOMEDIR and new / tmp , and mount them over the real $ HOMEDIR and / tmp .
This gives me a fully locked down desktop session , in which I can run almost any X client application .
Here are some examples
This sandbox - X session is running evince inside of a sandbox .
The sandbox tool actually copied the content into the new HOMEDIR so that evince could see it .
This example lets me explore the locked down environment sandbox - X provides .
Note that while I am still running with my UID , I am no longer running under unconfined_t , but under sandbox_x_client_t :so:c17,c355 .
There are no files in my sandboxed home directory .
When I try to run a privileged command like sudo I 'm not allowed to , and if I try to ssh our or send email , I 'll be denied .
I do allow sandbox_x_t to connect to the printer ports to allow the evince example above to be able to print , but I do not allow it to connect to most other network ports .
You can specify an alternate SELinux type .
For Fedora 12 the sandbox_web_t to allow you to run firefox .
sandbox_net_t is also available , which allows full network access.sandbox_x_domain_template(sandbox_MYAPP ) allow sandbox_MYAPP_client_t self : tcp_socket create_socket_perms;Install Raw Hide , or Fedora 12 when it comes out .
Install the policycoreutils - sandbox package if it is not installed .
( Sorry , but after you install the package you will need to reboot to set up the mount space sharing . )

A 2C rise in global temperatures will not necessarily result in the calamity predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , China 's most senior climatologist has told the Guardian .
Despite growing evidence that storms in China are getting fiercer , droughts longer and typhoons more deadly , Xiao Ziniu , the director general of the Beijing Climate Centre , said it was too early to determine the level of risk posed by global warming .
" There is no agreed conclusion about how much change is dangerous , " Xiao said .
" Whether the climate turns warmer or cooler , there are both positive and negative effects .
We are not focusing on what will happen with a one degree or two degree increase , we are looking at what level will be a danger to the environment .
In Chinese history , there have been many periods warmer than today . "
The IPCC warns a 2C rise substantially increases the risks of floods , drought and storms .
Whether a 2C rise turns global warming into global burning has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in advance of the Copenhagen summit .
The G8 and EU want the world to set 2C as a ceiling by 2050 , but China is sceptical .
A senior government adviser said yesterday that the target of two degrees was unrealistic and would not give developing nations room to grow .
Xiao said China had started its own climate modelling programme for the next 100 years aimed at predicting the point when global warming will result in environmental collapse .
His centre will also release yearly climate predictions for China .
Even with weather satellites and sophisticated simulation software , Xiao is not overly optimistic about accuracy the initial results .
" Climate prediction has only come into operation in recent years .
The accuracy of the prediction is very low because the climate is affected by many mechanisms we do not fully understand . "
China 's growing influence in climate studies was recognised this year when the World Meteorological Organisation selected Beijing as a co-host of the Asian Climate Centre .
Alongside Tokyo , it will be responsible for monitoring and predicting changes in weather patterns and their impact on natural disasters , water resources and soil quality .
Even at current levels of warming , the centre has collected a strong body of evidence that climate change is wreaking havoc in China .
A report provided by the centre to the Guardian shows rainfall coming in shorter , fiercer bursts , interspersed by protracted periods of drought , particularly in the north .
Water supplies have been badly affected .
The Yellow river watershed has suffered a continuous drought since 1965 and it is getting worse , it said .
Almost half the serious droughts of the past 60 years have occurred since 1990 .
" Due to climate change , drought disasters come more frequently and across a wider area , " the report noted .
Since 1950 , Beijing has had an average of 36 rainy days a year , but not once in the past decade has that figure been reached .
In 2007 , the northernmost province of Heilongjiang reported a summer drought , which is almost unheard of in what is usually a flood season .
Glaciers are melting at an accelerating rate .
A ferocious storm on 10 May this year broke records in Gaoqing , Shandong , with nearly 19.7 cm of water dumped from the skies in one day .
On the edge of the Gobi desert in Xilin Haote , Inner Mongolia , 5.6 cm of rain fell on 27 June 2008 – the most since a monitoring station was established in the area fifty years earlier .
Summer is coming earlier and hotter across swaths of the North .
Of the many records broken this year , the most dramatic was in Shijiazhuang Hebei where the temperature soared to 30C on 17 March , more than six degrees higher than the previous high for that day .
Near the border with Siberia , the counties of Yilan and Yichun have experienced the hottest May in history and searing heat of more than 40C is now commonplace in many areas of the north .
" I think it is the responsibility of scientists to have a sense of crisis .
We should study whether climate change threatens human survival , " says Xiao .
" But I believe humans are wise creatures .
With wisdom and effort , we will prevent disaster .
There is always hope . "
Founded in 1995 as a national level organisation , the centre 's 150 staff compile data from four Chinese weather satellites , thousands of national monitoring stations and a regional network of meteorological organisations .
For anyone who 's ever forgotten something or someone they wish they could remember , a bit of solace :
Though the memory is hidden from your conscious mind , it might not be gone .
In a study of college students , brain imaging detected patterns of activation that corresponded to memories the students thought they 'd lost .
" Even though your brain still holds this information , you might not always have access to it , " said neurobiologist Jeffrey Johnson of the University of California , Irvine .
His remarks appeared in the study he co-authored , published Wednesday in Neuron .
That recalling a memory triggers the neurological patterns encoded when the memory was formed is a tenet of cognitive science .
Less understood , however , is what becomes of those patterns at moments of incomplete recall .
Maybe you remember breakfast at a certain restaurant , but not what you ate ; perhaps you recall a particular conversation , but not what you said .
It 's not known whether those details vanish from the mind altogether , or are subsumed by some larger pattern , or remain intact but inaccessible .
" It was n't quite clear what happens to them , " said Johnson of lost details .
" But even when people claim that there are no details attached to their memories , we could still pick some of those details out . "
Of the the forgotten breakfast , he said that " we might still be able to pick up information about what you ate from brain activity , though you can't access it consciously . "
Johnson 's team put eleven female and five male college students inside an fMRI machine , which measures real - time patterns of blood flow in the brain .
Each student was shown a list of words , then asked to say each word backwards , think of how it could be used , and imagine how an artist would draw it .
Twenty minutes later , the researchers showed them the list again , and asked the students to remember what they could of each word .
Recollection triggered the original learning patterns , a process known technically as reinstatement ; the stronger the memory , the stronger the signal .
" What I think is cool about the study is that the degree of cortical reinstatement is related to the strength of our subjective experience of memory , " said Anthony Wagner , a Stanford University memory researcher who was n't involved in the experiment .
But at the weak end of the gradient , where the students ' conscious recall had faded to zero , the signal was still there .
It 's possible that the students lied about what they remembered .
But if not , then memory may truly persist .
The question then is how long memories could last — weeks , months , even years .
" We can only speculate that this is the case , " said Johnson , who plans to run brain - imaging studies of memory degradation over days and weeks .
As for whether those memories could be intentionally guided to the surface , Johnson says that " at this stage , we 're just happy to be able to find evidence of reinstatement at a weak level .
That would be something down the line . "

Palin 's attorney threatens to sue mainstream news organizations if they publish ' defamatory ' stories .
Attorney warns on ' defamatory material '
Ratcheting up her offensive against the news media , Gov. Sarah Palin ’s attorney threatened on Saturday to sue mainstream news organizations if they publish “ defamatory ” stories relating to whether Palin is under federal investigation .
In an extraordinary four - page letter , Alaska - based attorney Thomas Van Flein warns of severe consequences should speculation that until now has largely been confined to blogs — about whether Palin embezzled funds in the construction of a Wasilla , Alaska , sports arena — find its way into print .
Advertisement
“ This is to provide notice to Ms. Moore , and those who republish the defamation , such as Huffington Post , MSNBC , The New York Times and The Washington Post , that the Palins will not allow them to propagate defamatory material without answering to this in a court of law , ” Van Flein warned , citing Alaska liberal blogger Shannyn Moore .
Much like Palin did in her Facebook statement Saturday , Van Flein savages the news media in his letter .
“ Just as power abhors a vacuum , modern journalism apparently abhors any type of due diligence and fact checking before scurrilous allegations are repeated as fact , ” the Anchorage attorney wrote .
Neither the Times nor the Post made any mention of the embezzlement rumors in their Saturday editions , but sources close to Palin consider the letter a warning shot to stay away from the topic .
In the letter , Van Flein writes : " ' The Alaska Constitution protects the right of free speech , while simultaneously holding those " responsible for the abuse of that right . '…
These falsehoods abuse the right to free speech ; continuing to publish these falsehoods of criminal activity is reckless , done without any regard for the truth , and is actionable . "
Still , the decision to issue a public statement reciting all the facts in the case now all but ensures that there will be mainstream media accounts of the situation .
“ While the Federal Government has a process to follow , and that process sometimes takes time , we can categorically state that we are not aware of any ‘ federal investigation ’ that has been ‘ pending ’ for the last seven years , ” Van Flein wrote .
“ We are aware of no subpoenas on [ the Wasilla supply company that supplied equipment for the construction of the sports arena and Palin home ] regarding the Palins … .
To be blunt — this ‘ story ’ was alleged during the campaign , evaluated then by national media and deemed meritless .
Nothing has changed . ”
Scores of left - leaning blogs posted speculation in the wake of Palin ’s surprise announcement Friday and among the most common theories was that she was on the verge of federal indictment over the 2002 construction of the sports arena .
Making the case for his client , Van Flein writes that Palin , then the mayor of Wasilla , did not oversee the Steering Committee tasked with running the project .
“ While her public support of this project was deemed pivotal by many , the actual construction , bidding , financing and other day - to - day management of the project was not in her scope of authority as Mayor , ” Van Flein writes .
Van Flein also notes that the project was publicly bid and therefore Palin had little control over construction .
The attorney also addressed another of the bloggers ’ claims : that Palin purchased building materials to build her own home from the same supply store as was used by those who built the arena .
“ Prior to the construction of Lowe ’s and Home Depot within the last few years in Wasilla , Spenard Builders Supply was the primary building supply company in Wasilla , ” Van Flein writes .
“ It can hardly come as a surprise that it would sell materials to small homeowners or that it would also bid to supply commercial contracts . ”
As for how the Palins financed their home on Wasilla ’s Lake Lucille , Van Flein says they “ used a combination of personal savings , equity from the sale of their prior home and conventional bank financing to build the house — like millions of American families .
The deeds of trust are recordable public records .
Basic journalism and fact checking would confirm this . ”

The culprit ...
The impact ...
The trip to hospital ...
The aftermath ...
THE STRAIN on my neck was a good indication I was n't hanging about .
A quick look at the SV650's speedo confirmed my thoughts - 125 mph is fast enough in anyone 's book - especially on an unfaired bike .
Pushing my arse back in the seat , I tucked in tight in an attempt to catch as little windblast as possible .
Wo n't be long ' til home .
Or so I thought .
I did n't see the pigeon before it hit me but I knew by the almighty impact I 'd made contact with more than just a sparrow .
It 's amazing what random thoughts flash through your mind in these sort of situations .
My brain was catapulted back 20 years to a scuffle at a rugby match , where a burly prop - forward had taken an exception to yours truly .
The shock was similar , the pain almost identical , only this time I did n't have the luxury of rolling around the floor clutching my face .
Far from it .
Luckily ( yes there is such a thing in this situation ) the road had been recently repainted and I could just about make out the solid white line running along the left - hand edge of the carriageway .
Squinting through watering eyes and a blood spattered visor , I clung like a limpet to the edge of the road , bringing the bike to a standstill without thinking .
Then the adrenaline kicked in .
Confused , dazed and in a lot of pain , I tried wiping the blood from my visor but could n't seem to clear it .
Then the penny dropped .
The dark , sticky liquid was on the inside - I was looking at my own blood .
Removing my helmet to look in the mirror gave me a fright .
My nose was double the size , both eyes were half closed and my face was covered in blood .
To add to my problems , the bleeding was getting worse .
Panic was setting in .
My friend , who'd been following behind , had seen everything and called for an ambulance .
With the situation under control , he whipped out his camera and started taking pictures - cheeky bastard !
I was whisked to hospital and diagnosed with concussion and a broken nose .
A few days later the swelling subsided and I was left with two lovely black eyes .
My nose still gives me gyp to this day .
And what about my helmet ?
I was wearing an Arai Condor at the time .
Both helmet and visor did a fantastic job of stopping over a pound of feathered meat , bearing the brunt of the massive impact - the Arai helmet is still in use to this day , however , I 'm not so sure about the pigeon ...
So there you have it - unlucky and very lucky in the same incident .
One thing 's for sure though : I 'm certain , without a doubt , that I 'd had have been killed outright had I not had my visor down .
“ Students do n’t have problems finding internships , students have problems getting internships , ” Eric Normington , the company ’s chief marketing officer , said by telephone from Hong Kong where he was overseeing the local program .
“ We can secure those exclusive positions . ”
Employers say the middlemen save them time and hassle .
“ They make the search process a lot easier , ” said Sarah Cirkiel , the chief executive of Pitch Control Public Relations , a small New York firm that started four years ago and has taken in 20 summer interns all from the University of Dreams .
“ I feel like they hand - select their interns for the specific agencies to make sure it ’s the right fit .
They just show up at our doorstep , ready to go . ”
But many educators and students argue that while the programs bridge one gulf  between those who have degrees from prestigious colleges or family connections and those who do not  only to create a new one , between the students who have parents willing and able to buy their children better job prospects and those who do not .
“ You ’re going to increase that divide early , on families that understand that investment process and will pay and the families that don’t , ” said Anthony Antonio , a professor of education at Stanford University .
“ This is just ratcheting it up another notch , which is quite frightening . ”
Julia McDonald , the career services director at Florida State University , questioned the need for these programs .
“ The economy has had an impact , but there are more than enough internship opportunities out there still , ” she said .
“ That ’s like buying a luxury car . ”
Other college advisers cautioned that while the desire to help is understandable , parents who pay for an internship program are depriving their children of the chance to develop job - seeking skills or to taste rejection before they have to fend for themselves .
The industry dismisses the criticism .
“ Universities forget that they themselves are , in essence , businesses , ” said C. Mason Gates , the president of Internships.com , an online placement service .
“ Just because they ’re doing it in a nonprofit fashion does n’t mean that those of us doing it for profit are doing it incorrectly . ”
Now he can point to a dramatic proof of his ideas .
Over the past six years , Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital , one of the country ’s premier hospitals , has worked with Litvak to streamline the flow of patients from the emergency department waiting room to post - surgical recovery areas .
The payoff has been dramatic .
Doctors now care for more patients in less time ; there are fewer aggravations and logistical conflicts for staff and patients alike .
The hospital says the improvements in efficiency have given it a boost in capacity equivalent to a $ 100 million , 100 - bed expansion and boosted income from treating patients by even more .
Doctors and nurses - many of them initially skeptical - generally like the system , too , because their schedules became more predictable .
And Children ’s officials say the changes have also made their hospital safer by reducing the times when nurses and doctors are under extreme stress .
But in recent years an efficiency expert - originally trained in the Soviet Union , land of legendary inefficiency - has been proving that hospitals do n’t have to be wasteful and inflexible .
Eugene Litvak , now a professor of health care management at Boston University , looks at hospitals and sees systems that are n’t even trying to be efficient with people ’s time or money .
If hospital executives concentrated on moving patients smoothly through the hospital the way that the local Applebee ’s restaurant moves diners , he believes , they could make hospitals better places to work , safer environments for patients , and cheaper to operate .
The complexity of hospitals has long frustrated reformers .
Hospital executives are adept at PowerPoint presentations that prove their 10 percent a year cost increases are justified , and they resist comparisons to other industries that have cut costs more effectively , saying it ’s impossible to apply lessons from other industries to something as urgent and morally necessary as medicine .
Hospitals waste 20 to 30 cents of every dollar they collect , and most lag behind the neighborhood Rite - Aid in adopting basic business practices such as computerized record - keeping .
What ’s more , they make lots of mistakes , hastening nearly 100,000 patient deaths a year , according to one major study .
Awash in internal politics and inefficiency , hospitals have overtaken prescription drugs as the main reason insurance bills go up each year - and the major reason that more and more people can’t afford insurance at all .
But hospitals are also the black holes of the American health care debate .
“ Death panels ” and fear of federal bureaucracy may get more public attention , but poor management at many of the nation ’s 5,700 hospitals is a vastly more important reason that US health care costs are the highest in the world , and why the quality of care that we get for our money is n’t far better .
The modern hospital is a storehouse of technology and training unmatched in human society .
These lifesaving institutions are often the biggest employer in town , making them - justifiably - the pride of their communities .
In hospitals , nobody expects - or even wants - “ fast ” care , but everyone in the building benefits when the flow of patients from one part of the system to another is smooth .
Backups in one part of the hospital can cause backups in others , leaving , for example , patients sitting for hours in the waiting room or highly trained surgical teams cooling their heels with no patient .
A smoothly flowing hospital saves time and money , but it also reduces stress on the staff and the risk of mistakes .
In the world of operations management , Litvak is among the leading experts on flow .
In the fast - food industry , maintaining an even flow is what keeps dozens of chicken fingers from stacking up while frustrated customers wait for cheeseburgers ; at Toyota , it turns automobile production into a tightly choreographed dance that minimizes wasted time and materials .
Thanks to strong central management and years of practice , companies have become expert at ensuring that steel arrives exactly when it needs to be rolled into car hoods , or a container of dishwashers from China shows up almost exactly when stores need to restock them for customers .
Of course , the US health care system is frustrating proof that just because something is a good idea does n’t mean it will happen .
The American approach to health care has always been to focus overwhelmingly on the search for cures while devoting far less energy to practical matters like finding the best way to get cures to patients .
Americans spend twice as much on health care as other industrialized nations with little evidence that the care here is better , and with little being done to stop the escalating costs .
Litvak , who learned a lot about bureaucratic inertia from his years as an economist in the former Soviet Union , said that persuading hospitals to adopt his efficiency recommendations has been like cutting through sour cream .
“ You get no resistance , ” he says , “ but you also get no slice . ”
Litvak ’s ideas are “ the best near - term play for changing health care delivery in a way that would meaningfully reduce spending and improve quality , ” said Dr. Arnold Milstein , medical director of the Pacific Business Group on Health in California , the nation ’s largest health care purchasing coalition .
“ As a country , we are at this point really starving for improvements in care delivery that not only improve quality , but equally important , make health insurance more affordable . ”
Leading thinkers of the health care reform movement agree that the ideas put forward by Litvak and a few others have extraordinary potential .
If all hospitals adopted aggressive “ flow management ” programs , Litvak believes it would free up enough beds and other medical resources to care for all of the nation ’s 46 million uninsured people .
Litvak ’s work is part of a broader field called operations management , which focuses on the mundane but vital business of making processes more efficient , from manufacturing a can of soup to moving baseball fans in and out of a ballpark .
Virtually every other major industry has adopted the principles of operations management , led by successful companies such as Toyota .
But the health care industry , 17 percent of the US economy , has been a big holdout .
For several years , Cincinnati Children ’s officials , with Anderson ’s enthusiastic backing , tried to get their patients flowing better through the building .
They tried hiring more staff to work in the emergency department at certain times .
But Anderson ’s team realized that , to make dramatic steps forward , they needed to analyze the whole hospital , not just individual departments .
That ’s when two doctors , Ryckman and the vice president for quality and transformation , went to a talk by Litvak as part of an Institute for Healthcare Improvement program in 2004 .
Cincinnati officials discovered that the busy nights were caused , not by the random distribution of accidents and illnesses in Cincinnati , but by the way the hospital assigned operating room time to surgeons for scheduled surgery .
Since a child who has just received a new liver needs near constant attention , this was no small matter , raising the risk that the child ’s vital signs could plummet while the nurse is off caring for other patients .
“ Some days , all the stars were aligned and you would have the perfect care system , ” recalled Ryckman .
“ But some nights , if there were a lot of sick kids in the ICU , the care that was delivered was going to be very different . ”
Dr. Frederick Ryckman , a prominent transplant surgeon at Cincinnati Children ’s , noticed how inefficiency can adversely affect his patients years ago .
For no obvious reason , he found that the nurses who cared for his young transplant patients sometimes had a lot more time to lavish on the children .
James M. Anderson , a former corporate lawyer and president of a company that manufactures valves , was underwhelmed by the level of efficiency he saw when he became chief executive of Cincinnati Children ’s in 1996 .
He was n’t worried about money so much :
After all , the hospital had a huge endowment and its annual revenues were growing at a healthy pace .
But , perhaps more than traditional hospital executives drawn from medicine , Anderson was sensitive to the fact that chronic delays and patient overcrowding can lead to bad morale and a decline in the quality of care .
As a result , Litvak says , American hospitals only think they ’re overcrowded because they have a chronic problem managing their flow .
Patients simply pile up at certain times .
In 2006 , for instance , US hospitals were typically only 65 percent full , far less crowded than the 84 percent occupancy in Britain and the 90 percent occupancy of Canadian hospitals .
But when US hospitals get much more than 65 percent full , the whole system starts to become stressed .
Then , to boost their capacity , hospitals expand , at an average cost of $ 1 million per new bed .
Unfortunately , the typical US hospital is a model of bad flow :
The average emergency room wait , for example , is four hours .
The problem is actually quite simple , Litvak says .
Nearly every department is run separately , making today ’s hospital a nest of competing kingdoms rather than a smooth - running , cooperative organization .
Hospitals often have limited power over doctors , who can schedule patient appointments without regard to the hospital ’s needs .
Effectively , one of the most important industries in America is in the hands of people who , for all their talents , have little expertise at running a business .
“ We were just blown away .
If what he says is true , oh my God .
Is n’t it exciting ? ” recalled Dr. Uma Kotagal , the vice president .
Or , as Ryckman put it , “ He might be brilliant , and he might be nuts . ”
Litvak , who cut his academic teeth analyzing the Soviet telecommunications industry , may have seemed an unlikely avatar of efficiency , but he had the advantage of not carrying the baggage of medical traditions that can crush the spirit of innovators .
And so , armed with a branch of mathematics known as queuing theory , Litvak began to rearrange Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital .
He told administrators that a lot of the delays throughout the hospital traced back to the lack of control over operating room time .
He recommended that some operating rooms be set aside for emergencies only so that scheduled operations would not be disrupted .
He also suggested that administrators take charge of assigning times for nonemergency surgeries to spread them out evenly .
And he asked that surgeons notify the intensive care unit if their patients would need ICU care after the operation , giving the nurses time to plan .
Litvak promised that the efficiency measures would increase the number of surgeries that Children ’s could perform with the same resources .
Over the next four years , the data proved him right .
Cincinnati Children ’s estimates that these and other streamlining measures will allow the hospital to generate an additional $ 137 million in revenue this year from treating more children with the same levels of staffing in surgery and other departments .
Dr. Milstein , the director of the Pacific Business Group on Health in California , said hospitals have resisted efficiency ideas because they could .
“ It takes a saint to say , ‘ Well , even though the market is not very competitive , I am going to quintuple the level of difficulty for my managers ’ ” by pressing for big efficiency improvements , explained Milstein .
There is also a deep cultural reason that “ efficiency ” has n’t caught on in America ’s hospitals :
Many doctors and nurses just do n’t care about “ efficiency ” for its own sake .
They got into the business to help people , and tend to cringe when administrators start going on about cost-cutting .
But Litvak ’s work blows up the easy doctors - vs. - bean - counters formulation , showing that the bigger threat to patient safety and medical staff sanity is the current disorganization of American hospitals .
It ’s the same sort of thinking that helped propel Toyota to world leadership in automobiles : Toyota focused on making the best car at the best price , and the general public did n’t hear much about eliminating “ muda ” - Japanese for waste - even though it was a key element of the Toyota system .
Today , with politicians from Beacon Hill to Capitol Hill clamoring for ways to reduce the cost of health care , some hospitals are taking a harder look at the efficiency lessons from other industries .
Last year , Lahey Clinic hired an engineer from Pepsi-Cola to help with an ongoing effort to streamline operations .
Earlier , Boston University Medical Center , guided by Litvak , reduced the number of elective surgeries that had to be rescheduled from 700 a year to seven .
Litvak is gearing up to train far more hospitals in his methods , setting up a nonprofit that will run independently from Boston University ’s Program for the Management of Variability in Health Care Delivery .
Cincinnati Children ’s , meanwhile , has become a laboratory for hospital reform , offering a course in flow management for the staff and hosting curious delegations of hospital officials from all over the country .
Dr. Michael Long , a former anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and frequent collaborator with Litvak , said it ’s somehow fitting that a management consultant who learned his trade in a communist country should be leading the American hospital efficiency revolution .
“ In some respects , Eugene was right at home , ” said Long , “ It reminded him of the way things are done in Russia . ”

End All Foreign Aid
In 2008 , the United States gave an estimated 26 billion dollars in foreign aid to other countries .
For free Yup , the U.S. government continues giving away your hard earned tax dollars .
Keep in mind that the United States owes approximately 11 trillion dollars .
While 26 billion dollars is not enough money to make a significant dent in the U.S. National Debt , it is a good start .
Should n't the U.S. pay off their debts before giving money away ?
It is common sense to spend money that you have , instead of borrowing and spending money that you do not have .
It makes less economic sense to continue borrowing more money each year ; while at the same time , giving some of the borrowed money to others for free .
I fully understand that the U.S. is helping other countries with foreign aid , but is it not better to help yourself first ?
Furthermore , who is going to help the United States in the future , when needed ?
No one will .
In addition , the United States is running the world 's largest trade deficit as well as a huge budget deficit .
This is increasing the U.S. National Debt even more .
Furthermore , some states are also running large budget deficits too .
Therefore , the U.S. can no longer afford helping other countries , let alone afford current expenditures .
Basically , the United States of America is becoming bankrupt , if the U.S. is not already bankrupt .
We should stop giving foreign aid .
In an ideal world , the U.S. should re-direct foreign aid to pay down their National Debt .
However , the best that the U.S. can do right now is stop giving foreign aid to decrease the amount of money the U.S. is borrowing each year .
Only through small steps can the United States return to true conservative fiscal responsibility that can eventually bring back a sound and stable economy .

It 's full of crazy fans , horrible opportunists , and her slimy father , which is a combination of both .
Yes , a glimpse into Lindsay 's voicemail inbox may just be the Rosetta Stone to decipher why she is such a horrible mess .
Last year , Lohan put her personal contact info on her Facebook page , and it circled around the internet for just about anyone to call her .
Someone figured out her voicemail password ( it was n't hard , it was 1234 ) and Animal New York posted a sample of the aural delights found there , and it 's not pretty .
Sure , there are a few drunk people saying retarded things , but even worse are all the people trying to get something out of her : a party promoter who wants her to host a gig that her girlfriend Samantha Ronson is DJing ; a girl who wants to " have coffee " because she 's " DJ , like Samantha Ronson " and then leaves her MySpace address ; and her father , who just wants a call back .
Actually the saddest part is when Michael Lohan says that he went to hang out with Lindsay 's siblings , but they did n't want to see him .
Instead , he went to 7 - 11 and bought a copy of Lindsay 's CD and is driving around listening to it .
He even holds up the phone so we can hear .
Yeah , cause that 's what is going to make your daughter like you , knowing that you purchased her magnum opus from a roadside convenience store for $ 7.99 ?
This is the torture that must lead the starlet to her misbehavior .
Oh , Lindsay , it is a sad and lonely life you lead , but this is why God invented publicists .
They take all the shitty calls you do n't want !

Brody Mullins reports on money and politics .
Protesters who attended Saturday ’s Tea Party rally in Washington found a new reason to be upset : Apparently they are unhappy with the level of service provided by the subway system .
Rep. Kevin Brady asked for an explanation of why the government - run subway system did n’t , in his view , adequately prepare for this past weekend ’s rally to protest government spending and government services .
Seriously .
The Texas Republican on Wednesday released a letter he sent to Washington ’s Metro system complaining that the taxpayer - funded subway system was unable to properly transport protesters to the rally to protest government spending and expansion .
“ These individuals came all the way from Southeast Texas to protest the excessive spending and growing government intrusion by the 111th Congress and the new Obama administration , ” Brady wrote .
“ These participants , whose tax dollars were used to create and maintain this public transit system , were frustrated and disappointed that our nation ’s capital did not make a great effort to simply provide a basic level of transit for them . ”
A spokesman for Brady says that “ there were n’t enough cars and there were n’t enough trains . ”
Brady tweeted as much from the Saturday march .
“ METRO did not prepare for Tea Party March !
More stories .
People could n’t get on , missed start of march .
I will demand answers from Metro , ” he wrote on Twitter .
Brady says in his letter to Metro that overcrowding forced an 80 - year - old woman and elderly veterans in wheelchairs to pay for cabs .
He concludes that it “ appears that Metro added no additional capacity to its regular weekend schedule . ”

The vast Illinois factory floor that will produce electric delivery vans for Amazon.com Inc. is starting to fill up .
Battery and chassis assembly here .

Sometime next year , the plant ’s workers will complete the first van .
A decade later , if all goes according to plan , van No. 100,000 will roll off the line , completing the biggest electric vehicle purchase in history .
By the time Amazon has all these zero-emission vehicles on the road , around 2030 , it will eliminate an estimated 4 million metric tons of CO2 now belched out each year by gasoline - powered vans and trucks .
That would wipe out a small company ’s entire contribution to the emissions warming the planet .
But for the largest online retailer , the savings represent roughly 8 % of its carbon footprint .

" I choose for my state , and for my family , more freedom to progress all the way around so that Alaska may progress ... I will not seek reelection as governor . "
- Sarah Palin
Sarah Palin resigned from her Alaska governor 's job with an eight minute long basketball metaphor delivered to a raft of loudly quacking ducks .
It was a fitting end to a grotesque political career that will stumble on for a while like a mortally wounded moose .
Her stated reasons for stepping down included everything from " frivolous " ethics charges to Something Awful making fun of her Down syndrome son .
The purpose of this article is to apologize to Sarah Palin for that last part , but first I feel that a bit of history is in order .
Palin became a household name in 2008 , when a malignant meat sack full of liquid Viagra and barely - sublimated hostility towards women and Asians chose her as its running mate .
Loquacious former beauty queen and dog counter Sarah , along with laconic husband Todd , boarded the flooded submarine of the McCain campaign just as it was sinking to crush depth .
The situation was dire for five - time jet - crasher John McCain .
Eight years of Bush shitting away everything true and beautiful in America had left the electorate ready to puke blood at the thought of another Republican President .
It did n't help matters that McCain was a ghost - faced , lizard - tongued monster committed to grade school level political theories ( do n't give up until we win ! ) trying to best a brown angel talking about destiny and casually reading Fareed Zakaria .
Obama even looked suave exiting vehicles and not at all like Dracula popping out of his casket at the funhouse .
That Obama fella was with the times .
The kids loved him .
He knew about things like blogs and Ludacrises .
The old man sharing a bucket list with Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman was in real trouble .
This sense of futility in the face of looming defeat partly explains the conservative base 's celebration when McCain made his cynical play for Clinton voters .
The base was n't even really with McCain until he picked Palin .
They never liked his sissy stance on not burning terrorist scrotums and not punching Russ Feingold in his fucking face on sight .
Palin was an appeal to the base 's blood - drenched id , aching for release in the womb of a holy - rolling special angel mom unwilling to support reproductive rights or equal pay for women .
The base believed that Palin would step in for an ailing McCain and bring about the culmination of the Bush Doctrine to transform America into a smoggy Wal Mart parking lot full of ant - covered abandoned snowflake fetuses .
They accepted the premise that years of facing Putin 's rearing head up in Alaska had trained Palin in the ways of international politics and a lot of prayer had prepared her to confront domestic issues like ' conomies and ' vironments .
A series of increasingly disastrous interviews set the stage for conflict with the press .
Palin crumbled in the face of impossible gotcha media questions like , " What do you read ? " ( nothing ) and " What is a Vice President supposed to do ? " ( everything ) .
Palin was understandably outraged that those rascals in the media would ask her things about stuff and expect an answer .
She wondered how come the media would n't ask Obama things about stuff and the red - faced bariatrics at her rallies roughed up reporters .
McCain 's campaign staff tried to spin Palin 's flabbergasting stupidity .
They claimed that a vengeful Katie Couric was just trying to gin up ratings by asking a fucking lousy trick question like , " How are you this morning ? "
While Palin was running screaming at the bayonet line she was simultaneously caught in a crossfire of miniature scandals .
She forced her pregnant teenage daughter to get engaged to a lunk - headed hockey star with a MySpace page stating directly that he did not want to be a father .
An ethics investigation back in Alaska was painting her as a woman who abused her power as governor to get even with enemies .
There were even conduct questions about her time as the hillbilly - fascist mayor of Wasilla : Alaska 's meth and rape capital .
Brutalized by eight years of Bush prosperity , the American people experienced a fit of sanity and elected the center - right corporatist and his goofball sidekick instead of the warmongering economic neophyte and the winking , know - nothing , hockey mom hate shit he took on the face of America .
The outcome was n't even close .
Indiana voted for Obama and voting Democratic in presidential elections there is actually a fineable offense .
Post - election leaks and dueling recriminations painted a picture of McCain 's advisers as reluctant , sometimes hostile , participants in the Sarah Palin campaign to be elected vice president .
Her family drama escalated and her approval rating in Alaska took a serious hit .
Whether she realizes it or not , Palin 's insane departure from the governorship of Alaska now relegates her presidential aspirations to the scrapheap of history .
Thankfully , we will only ever see Sarah Palin 's Real America in nightmares and self - hating masturbation fantasies .
Sarah Palin , I would like to personally take this opportunity to apologize for Something Awful 's role in your decision to step down .
Over the years we have produced millions of words of left - wing hatred for innocent teenage daughters and children with disabilities .
We hired a hockey - playing ne'er do well claiming to be Trig 's father to write articles in which he describes crossing the sex line with most of your family .
I am so sorry for letting that monster have a column here .
I would also like to apologize for the dozens of Photoshopped pictures of you and Trig on our forums .
I know that of all of our hate content , these upset you in particular .
You are n't the first governor to resign because of a mean Photoshop and I am certain you will not be the the last .
I hope you can find it in your Christian heart to forgive us for making light of Trig 's disability .
I completely agree with what you said in your speech today :
The world needs more Trigs .
You hear that , pregnant women of the world ?
The bar is officially open .

David Cameron faced fresh political embarrassment last night as a second Conservative MEP came forward to attack the NHS .
The Tory leader had tried to limit the damage inflicted on the party by Daniel Hannan , who told a US news channel that he would not " wish the NHS on anybody " .
Mr Cameron described Mr Hannan as " eccentric " , adding that the NHS was his party 's " number one priority " .
But yesterday , as the debate over the NHS moved to this side of the Atlantic , one of Mr Hannan 's Conservative colleagues in the European parliament inflamed the controversy by expressing support for his position .
Roger Helmer told the BBC : " Now we all love the NHS , but I think we all know in our hearts that it is no longer the envy of the world .
If the Americans came to me and said , ' Would you recommend us taking up a system just like the British NHS ? ' , I think I would have to say ' No ' . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Labour has been quick to capitalise on Mr Cameron 's discomfort , claiming the row exposed " deep ambivalence " within his party towards the health service .
But Mr Cameron said : " The Conservative Party stands four square behind the NHS .
We are the party of the NHS , we back it , we are going to expand it .
It is our number one mission to improve it .
[ Mr Hannan ] does have some quite eccentric views about some things , and political parties always include some people who do n't toe the party line on one issue or another issue . "
But in an extraordinary day of political jousting , ministers and Labour big hitters were soon queuing to argue that Mr Hannan had revealed that the NHS was not safe in the hands of the Tories .
Lord Mandelson said the public would " find it shocking that a Conservative parliamentarian should go to the US to slag off the NHS " .
He added : " What we see is the two faces of the Conservative Party . "
Andy Burnham , the Health Secretary , said Mr Hannan 's remarks represented the Tory leader 's " worst nightmare " .
" What has happened within the past 48 hours is what Cameron has feared most because it lays bare the Tories ' deep ambivalence towards the NHS , " he said .
" Their election strategy is not to talk about the NHS .
Cameron knows there is deep hostility towards it within his ranks .
Hannan is not the only one ; many senior Tory MPs would privately agree with his comments . "
Mr Burnham 's attack earned a quick repost from the shadow health secretary , Andrew Lansley , who accused him of deliberately " misleading the British public " .
Former deputy prime minister John Prescott called on Mr Cameron to take further action against Mr Hannan .
The Tories were then hit with more apparent disunity , after another MEP , Roger Helmer , said that Mr Hannan had done the party " a service " by raising the matter of NHS reform .
The damage inflicted on his party is a great frustration to Mr Cameron , who has been extremely wary of being accused of not giving the NHS his full support .
He has even pledged to protect its budget at the cost of cutting more heavily in other departments across Whitehall .
Timothy Kirkhope , the leader of the Conservatives in Europe , said of Mr Hannan : " In a foreign country , you should be doubly careful about what you say .
You do n't want to give the wrong impression of the party 's policy to the Americans . "
Mr Hannan , who became the new darling of the Tory grassroots after his attack on Gordon Brown became an internet sensation in March , had criticised the NHS while appearing on the conservative US news channel Fox News .
He told friendshe did not want to inflame the situation any further by speaking out .

The Federal Bureau of Investigation ’s budget request for fiscal year 2010 reveals that America ’s political police intend to greatly expand their high - tech surveillance capabilities .
According to ABC
News , the FBI is seeking additional funds for the development of “ a new ‘ Advanced Electronic Surveillance ’ program which is being funded at $ 233.9 million for 2010 .
The program has 133 employees , 15 of whom are agents . ”
Known as “ Going Dark , ” the program is designed to beef up the Bureau ’s already formidable electronic surveillance , intelligence collection and evidence gathering capabilities “ as well as those of the greater Intelligence Community , ” ABC reports .
An FBI spokesperson told the network :
“ The term ‘ Going Dark ’ does not refer to a specific capability , but is a program name for the part of the FBI , Operational Technology Division ’s ( OTD ) lawful interception program which is shared with other law enforcement agencies . ”
“ The term applies to the research and development of new tools , technical support and training initiatives . ” ( Jason Ryan , “ DOJ Budget Details High - Tech Crime Fighting Tools , ” ABC News , May 9 , 2009 )
Led by Assistant Director Marcus C. Thomas , OTD describes the office as supporting “ the FBI 's investigative and intelligence - gathering efforts  and those of our federal , state , and local law enforcement / intelligence partners  with a wide range of sophisticated technological equipment , examination tools and capabilities , training , and specialized experience .
You wo n't hear about our work on the evening news because of its highly sensitive nature , but you will continue to hear about the fruits of our labor … ”
According to OTD ’s website , the Division possesses “ seven core capabilities ” : Digital Forensics ; Electronic Surveillance ; Physical Surveillance ; Special Technology and Applications ; Tactical Communications ; Tactical Operations and finally , Technical Support / Coordination .
Under the heading “ Electronic Surveillance , ” OTD deploys “ tools and techniques for performing lawfully - authorized intercepts of wired and wireless telecommunications and data network communications technologies ; enhancing unintelligible audio ; and working with the communications industry as well as regulatory and legislative bodies to ensure that our continuing ability to conduct electronic surveillance will not be impaired as technology evolves . ”
But as we have seen throughout the entire course of the so - called “ war on terror , ” systemic constitutional breeches by the FBI  from their abuse of National Security Letters , the proliferation of corporate - dominated Fusion Centers to the infiltration of provocateurs into antiwar and other dissident groups  the only thing “ impaired ” by an out - of - control domestic spy agency have been the civil liberties of Americans .
Communications Backdoor Provided by Telecom Grifters

While the Bureau claims that it performs “ lawfully - authorized intercepts ” in partnership with the “ communications industry , ” also known as telecommunications ’ grifters , the available evidence suggests otherwise .
As Antifascist Calling reported last year , security consultant and whistleblower Babak Pasdar , in a sworn affidavit to the Government Accountability Project ( GAP ) , provided startling details about the collusive  and profitable alliance  between the FBI and America ’s wireless carriers .
Pasdar furnished evidence that FBI agents have instantly transferred data along a high - speed computer circuit to a Bureau technology office in Quantico , Virginia .
The so - called Quantico Circuit was provided to the FBI by Verizon , The Washington Post revealed .
According to published reports , the company maintains a 45 megabit / second DS - 3 digital line that allowed the FBI and other security agencies virtually “ unfettered access ” to the carrier ’s wireless network , including billing records and customer data “ transferred wirelessly . ”
Verizon and other telecom giants have supplied FBI technical specialists with real - time access to customer data .
“ The circuit was tied to the organization ’s core network , ” Pasdar wrote .
Such access would expose customers ’ voice calls , data packets , even their physical movements and geolocation to uncontrolled  and illegal  surveillance .
In April , Wired obtained documents from the FBI under a Freedom of Information Act request .
Those files demonstrate how the Bureau ’s “ geek squad ” routinely hack into wireless , cellular and computer networks .
Although the FBI released 152 heavily - redacted pages , they withheld another 623 , claiming a full release would reveal a “ sensitive investigative technique . ”
Nevertheless ,
Wired discovered that the FBI is deploying spyware called a “ computer internet protocol address verifier , ” or CIPAV , designed to infiltrate a target ’s computer and gather a wide range of information , “ which it sends to an FBI server in eastern Virginia . ”
While the documents do not detail CIPAV ’s capabilities , an FBI affidavit from a 2007 case indicate it gathers and reports ,
a computer ’s IP address ; MAC address ; open ports ; a list of running programs ; the operating system type , version and serial number ; preferred internet browser and version ; the computer ’s registered owner and registered company name ; the current logged - in user name and the last - visited URL .
After sending the information to the FBI , the CIPAV settles into a silent “ pen register ” mode , in which it lurks on the target computer and monitors its internet use , logging the IP address of every server to which the machine connects .

“ Going Dark ” is ostensibly designed to help the Bureau deal with technological changes and methods to intercept Voice Over Internet Protocol ( VOIP ) phone calls facilitated by programs such as Skype .
But a tool that can seamlessly target hackers and cyber - criminals can just as easily be deployed against political opponents .
The FBI also intends to continue their use of automated link and behavioral analysis derived from data mining as investigative tools .
As a subset of applied mathematics , social network theory and its derivatives , link - and behavioral analysis , purport to uncover hidden relationships amongst social groups and networks .
Over time , it has become an invasive tool deployed by private - and state intelligence agencies against political activists , most recently , as Antifascist Calling reported in February , against protest groups organizing against the Republican National Convention .
These methods raise very troubling civil liberties ’ and privacy concerns .
The Electronic Privacy Information Coalition ( EPIC ) filed a Freedom of Information Act request , demanding that the General Services Administration ( GSA ) turn over agency records “ concerning agreements the GSA negotiated between federal agencies and social networking services , including Flickr , YouTube , Vimeo , Blip.tv , and Facebook . ”
With the proliferation of social networking sites , applications allow users to easily share information about themselves with others .
But as EPIC points out , “ Many online services relay information about online associations as users create new relationships .
While government agencies may use social networking , cloud computing , and Internet services to create greater transparency on their activities , it remains unclear if there are data collection , use , and sharing limitations . ”
And with “ information discoverability ” all the rage amongst spooky security agencies ranging from the FBI to the NSA , “ connecting the dots , ” particularly when it comes to dissident Americans , “ is gaining increasing attention from homeland security officials and experts in their ongoing attempt to corral anti-terrorism information that resides across federal , state and local jurisdictions , ” Federal Computer Week reports .
Will an agreement between Facebook and the FBI facilitate “ dot connecting ” or will it serve as a new , insidious means to widen the surveillance net , building ever - more intrusive electronic case files on dissident Americans ?
The Electronic Police State
As Antifascist Calling reported earlier this month , citing the Electronic Frontier Foundation ’s ( EFF ) dossier on the FBI ’s Investigative Data Warehouse ( IDW ) , the office had “ transitioned to the operations and maintenance phase during FY 2008 ” and now possesses some “ 997,368,450 unique searchable documents , ” ready for data mining .
But as study after study has revealed , most recently the comprehensive examination of various programs by the National Research Council , automated data mining is “ likely to generate huge numbers of false leads . ”
Because the mountainous volumes of data “ mined ” for “ actionable intelligence ” are drawn from dozens of disparate sources on terrorism or criminal suspects , “ they have an enormous potential for privacy violations because they will inevitably force targeted individuals to explain and justify their mental and emotional states . ”
EFF documented that the Bureau ’s Telephone Application ( TA ) “ provides a central repository for telephone data obtained from investigations . ”
TA allegedly functions as an “ investigative tool … for all telephone data collected during the course of FBI investigations .
Included are pen register data , toll records , trap / trace , tape - edits , dialed digits , airnet ( pager intercepts ) , cellular activity , push - to - talk , and corresponding subscriber information . ”
Additionally , the civil liberties ’ group revealed that “ records obtained through National Security Letters are placed in the Telephone Application , as well as the IDW by way of the ACS [ Automated Case ] system . ”
It would appear that “ Going Dark ” will serve as a research subsystem feeding the insatiable appetite of the Investigative Data Warehouse .
In fact , these programs are part and parcel of what the security website Cryptohippie refers to as the Electronic Police State .
Far from keeping us safe from all manner of dastardly plots hatched by criminals and / or terrorists , Cryptohippie avers :
An electronic police state is quiet , even unseen .
All of its legal actions are supported by abundant evidence .
It looks pristine .
An electronic police state is characterized by this :
State use of electronic technologies to record , organize , search and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens .
The two crucial facts about the information gathered under an electronic police state are these :
It is criminal evidence , ready for use in a trial .
It is gathered universally and silently , and only later organized for use in prosecutions .
In an Electronic Police State , every surveillance camera recording , every email you send , every Internet site you surf , every post you make , every check you write , every credit card swipe , every cell phone ping … are all criminal evidence , and they are held in searchable databases , for a long , long time .
Whoever holds this evidence can make you look very , very bad whenever they care enough to do so .
You can be prosecuted whenever they feel like it  the evidence is already in their database .
( “ The Electronic Police State , 2008 National Rankings , ” Cryptohippie , no date . )
Unfortunately , this is not the stuff of paranoid fantasies , but American reality in the year 2009 ; one unlikely to change in the foreseeable future .

In addition to “ Going Dark , ” the FBI is busily constructing what ABC News refers to as the “ development of the Biometric Technology Center , a Joint Justice , FBI and DoD program . ”
At a cost of $ 97.6 million , the center will function as a research and development arm of the Bureau ’s Biometric Center of Excellence ( BCOE ) , one which will eventually “ be a vast database of personal data including fingerprints , iris scans and DNA which the FBI calls the Next Generation Identification ( NGI ) . ”
The program is closely tied with technology under development by West Virginia University ’s Center for Identification Technology Research ( CITeR ) .
As the FBI ’s “ lead academic partner in biometrics research ” according to a Bureau press release , CITeR provides “ biometrics research support to the FBI and its law enforcement and national security partners and serve as the FBI liaison to the academic community of biometric researchers nationwide . ”
Indeed , CITeR director Lawrence A. Hornak , “ a visionary of the Big Brother school of technology ” told The Register , he awaits the day “ when devices will be able to ‘ recognize us and adapt to us ’ . ”
The “ long - term goal , ” Hornak declared , is the “ ubiquitous use of biometrics . ”
But as The Register pointed out when the program was publicly rolled - out , “ civil libertarians and privacy advocates are not amused . ”
They claim that the project presents nightmare scenarios of stolen biometric information being used for ever - more outlandish forms of identity theft , which would be nearly impossible to correct .
Correcting an inaccurate credit report is already an insulting and hair - raising experience in America , and critics contend that the use of biometrics would make correcting inaccurate credit reports or criminal histories nearly impossible .
Besides , they argue , the US government does not exactly have a sterling record when it comes to database security  what happens when , as seems inevitable , the database is hacked and this intimate and allegedly indisputable data is compromised ? …
Databases usually become less accurate , rather than more , the older and bigger they get , because there ’s very little incentive for the humans that maintain them to go back and correct old , inaccurate information rather than simply piling on new information .
Data entry typically trumps data accuracy .
Furthermore , the facial recognition technology in its current iteration is woefully inaccurate , with recognition rates as low as 10 per cent at night .
All in all , there is ample reason for skepticism  not that it will make much of a difference .
( Burke Hansen , “ FBI preps $ 1bn biometric database , ” The Register , December 24 , 2007 )
But WVU ’s CITeR is n’t the only partner lining - up to feed at the FBI ’s trough .
ABC reports that the Bureau “ has awarded the NGI contract to Lockheed Martin to update and maintain the database which is expected to come online in 2010 .
After being fully deployed the NGI contract could cost up to $ 1 billion . ”
However , Federal Computer
Week reported in 2008 that although the initial contract will “ consist of a base year , ” the potential for “ nine option years ” means that “ the value of the multiyear contract … could be higher . ”
You can bet it will !
Additional firms on Lockheed Martin’s “ team ” as subcontractors include IBM , Accenture , BAE Systems , Global Science & Technology , Innovative Management & Technology Services and Platinum Solutions .
In other words , NGI is yet another in a gigantic herd of cash cows enriching the Military - Industrial - Security Complex .
Democracy “ Going Dark ”
The “ vast apparatus of domestic spying ” described by the World Socialist Web Site , greatly expanded under the criminal Bush regime is a permanent feature of the capitalist state ; one that will continue to target political dissent during a period of profound economic crisis .
That the Obama administration , purportedly representing fundamental change from the previous government , has embraced the felonious methods of the Bush crime family and its capo tutti capo , Richard Cheney , should surprise no one .
Like their Republican colleagues , the Democrats are equally complicit in the antidemocratic programs of repression assembled under the mendacious banner of the “ global war on terror . ”
From warrantless wiretapping to the suppression of information under cover of state secrets , and from the waging of imperialist wars of conquest to torture , the militarist mind - set driving capitalist elites at warp speed towards an abyss of their own creation , are signs that new political provocations are being prepared by America ’s permanent “ shadow government ”  the military - intelligence - corporate apparatus .

Congress appears close to restoring the $ 100 million in funding for hydrogen research that Steven Chu , the energy secretary , had cut from his budget in May .
The House of Representatives voted 320-97 last Friday to approve $ 26.9 billion for the Energy Department , including $ 153 million for hydrogen and fuel cells in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program , plus $ 40.45 million for hydrogen from coal .
The Senate Appropriations Committee was even more bullish on hydrogen , approving $ 190 million for the program .
Reconciliation of the two budget figures ( assuming the full Senate leaves the $ 190 million intact ) could result in a final amount greater than the $ 168 million for fuel cells in the 2009 Energy Department budget .
It is uncertain when the Senate will vote on hydrogen funding .
Robert Rose , executive director of the United States Fuel Cell Council , said he hoped a vote would occur in the next two weeks before the Senate ’s scheduled recess in early August .
“ We ’re encouraged , ” said Patrick Serfass , a spokesman for the National Hydrogen Association .
“ Congress has shown that it is very well educated about these technologies .
It sees the benefits of hydrogen and fuel cells , and understands we need to pursue a portfolio of technologies , not just one or two .
Frankly , it ’s too early to choose . ”
Mr. Serfass added that the proposed budget contained no cuts for battery manufacturing or research , “ and the fuel - cell community thinks that ’s a good thing .
But you ca n’t design a family - sized long - range vehicle with just batteries — you need something else , and we think that something else is hydrogen fuel cells . ”
In May , Mr. Chu argued for cutting hydrogen funding because the technology seemed to be always decades away from reaching the market .
“ We asked ourselves , ” Mr. Chu said at the time , “ ‘ Is it likely in the next 10 or 15 , 20 years that we will convert to a hydrogen car economy ? ’
The answer , we felt , was ‘ no . ’ ”
But according to Larry Burns , General Motor ’s retiring fuel - cell champion , cutting hydrogen funding would hurt American car companies .
“ Japan and Germany are moving forward with their government - funded programs , ” he said in a recent interview .
“ This is strategically important .
Do we want to wake up five years from now and say , ‘ What happened to us ? ’ ”
On Monday , Toyota told Ward ’s Auto ( via Autoblog Green ) that its first production hydrogen vehicle in 2015 would be priced low enough to “ shock ” the industry .
Economies of scale will bring costs down , the company said .
Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella hears a voice in his corn field tell him , " If you build it , he will come . "
He interprets this message as an instruction to build a baseball field on his farm , upon which appear the ghosts of Shoeless Joe Jackson and the other seven Chicago White Sox players banned from the game for throwing the 1919 World Series .
When the voices continue , Ray seeks out a reclusive author to help him understand the meaning of the messages and the purpose for his field .

Epitaph for the eighties ?
“ there is no such thing as society ”
Prime minister Margaret Thatcher , talking to Women ’s Own magazine , October 31 1987
“ I think we ’ve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem , it ’s the government ’s job to cope with it .
‘ I have a problem , I ’ll get a grant . ’
‘ I ’m homeless , the government must house me . ’
They ’re casting their problem on society .
And , you know , there is no such thing as society .
There are individual men and women , and there are families .
And no government can do anything except through people , and people must look to themselves first .
It ’s our duty to look after ourselves and then , also to look after our neighbour .
People have got the entitlements too much in mind , without the obligations .
There ’s no such thing as entitlement , unless someone has first met an obligation . ”

Kiwibank is for the first time looking for funding offshore , due to the pressure on domestic funding sources .
Chief executive Sam Knowles said the move had been inevitable but was being brought forward a couple of years from what was previously expected .
The pressure on domestic funding was a consequence of the Australian - owned banks trying to raise more of their money in New Zealand , he said .
Mr Knowles was not concerned at the move and said it was just something Kiwibank had to do to manage its margins , because funds could be raised more cheaply offshore than domestically .
In the short term , Kiwibank was looking to raise small amounts offshore , in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars .
Kiwibank today reported a normalised after - tax profit for the year to the end of June of $ 52.5 million , up 43 percent from $ 36.8 million last year .
The profit did not include an additional $ 11.1 m that resulted from a structural change in the ownership of the bank by New Zealand Post .
Profit including that was $ 63.6 m .
Mr Knowles said in the last year loans and advances increased 52 percent from $ 5.6 billion to $ 8.5 billion and retail deposits increased 39 percent from $ 4.8 billion to $ 6.7 billion .
Impaired loans increased from $ 4 m to $ 19 m over the year , representing 0.2 percent of total assets , a lower ratio than those of Kiwibank 's competitors .
Non-performing loans had " quite an increase " between Christmas and about March , Mr Knowles said .
" But it 's come right back again .
So the level that we are seeing , on a month - by - month basis , of the number of customers not paying us when due , is very , very stable as a percentage of the portfolio , " he said
In the first half of the financial year much of the lending growth came from people with mortgages refinancing and moving from other banks .
In the second half much more had come from first home owners .
The issue of when Kiwibank would pay a dividend was something discussed regularly with the shareholder .
" Obviously , the bigger they want it to be , then the less dividend they 're going to get in the short term , and the more dividend they 're going to get in the long term , " Mr Knowles said .
Kiwibank also announced today it was ending its links with the Mercer KiwiSaver scheme , effective from September 30 .
Mr Knowles said Kiwibank had acted as a retail partner for Mercer , making information about the scheme available in brochures and on its website .
The nature of this role meant Kiwibank was not involved in investment decisions .
" However , because we now have our own wealth management division and are considering being more actively involved in the superannuation and managed funds sector , we believe it is essential that we bring our involvement with Mercer to an end . "
Mercer has about 70,000 KiwiSaver members and Mercer 's New Zealand business leader , Martin Lewington , said it was business as usual for these members .
" Mercer has managed the funds of these members during our relationship with Kiwibank and we will continue to do so now it has ended , " he said .

Dead fans have a lot to look forward to with the upcoming expansion pack , " Crash Course . "
Unfortunately , though , different platform versions are going to carry different prices : the download will be free for PC players , but it will cost Xbox 360 gamers 560 MS Points .
While that might seem unfair , Valve has revealed that the Xbox Live price was something forced on them .
In an interview with Eurogamer , Valve writer Chet Faliszek explained that the developer would prefer to make expansions and add - on content free for its customers .
This is why the PC version of Crash Course wo n't cost gamers a thing ; Microsoft , on the other hand , would n't let this happen .
According to Faliszek , " [ Microsoft ] helped us get the first one out for free .
We had the one DLC out for free .
And I think ... they have to look and say , wow , we 're kind of being unfair to everybody else if these guys can do that .
It 's not like [ Valve is ] looking at this as , ' Oh my god , we need some money , we 're going to charge , ' obviously , or we'd do it on the PC .
So it 's just kind of the way the system works right now . "
The Zune HD is soon to be officially out on the streets , and we 've got the official Engadget hands - on / unboxing .
Now , we were excited as all get - out to wrap our paws around the Tegra - powered PMP , but some of that luster has worn off since popping this baby out of its extremely attractive packaging .
Why is that , you ask ?
Well , Microsoft decided to hold on loading up any usable software until the new Zunes were out to market .
What that means is that we have yet to do any serious testing with the new device -- despite having the gem sitting right here .
We can tell you that the Zune HD is most definitely a thing of beauty as far as gadget standards are concerned , and while the only media we 've been able to enjoy is the big M's demo video , we have been marveling at the clarity and crispness of that OLED display .
Obviously we 've got a proper review coming soon , but we take this stuff pretty seriously and do n't like to offer our opinion till we 've spent some quality time with a device .
You can expect a look at both the music and media playback capabilities of the ZHD , as well as the new Zune integration into Xbox Live , Windows Media Center , and all other kinds of connected - world goodness .
Till then , feast your eyes on the galleries below , and quietly curse Microsoft for handing us a neutered Zune .
As a commenter points out below , these devices are being sold to end users in the same condition our unit is in -- namely , without any real functioning software .
It 's a pretty unusual move for a company like Microsoft to put devices into the hands of consumers with no functionality at all , but it seems the Zune team was cranking till the last minute .
Let 's hope all the hard work pays off !
FLOWERY BRANCH , Ga.  Tony Gonzalez swears he has found a personal fountain of youth , and that it explains how he has so majestically defied pro football 's hourglass .
It 's on the menu .
Gonzalez , 33 , enters his 13th season as the NFL 's longest - tenured starting tight end , with no apparent signs of disintegration .
Nearing the 200 - game milestone , he still has soft hands .
His feet remain quick enough to pivot free in the red zone .
And as demonstrated during a congested - traffic , 11 - on - 11 goal - line drill in the Atlanta Falcons camp , he has not lost the knack for making the paydirt catch while two defenders cling tight like parasites .
He 's working on a streak of 10 consecutive Pro Bowl selections and last season was named first - team all - pro — significantly enough , for the first time in five years .
This , he insists , emanates from a decision three years ago to adopt Vegan principles for his diet .
" It 's clean eating , from a 100 % grass - fed source , " says Gonzalez , obtained in April from the Kansas City Chiefs for a second - round pick .
" You have to put good stuff in your body .
Everybody should , but especially athletes .
We 're high - performance machines .
You would n't put regular gas in a race car .
Jimmie Johnson is going to put the high - octane , good stuff in there .
It 's the same thing for football players .
You'd be surprised by how many players do n't do it .
But I 've seen the results . "
Before : Fast food .
TV dinners .
Bacon cheeseburgers .
Potato chips .
Soda .
After : Seafood .
Steamed vegetables .
Rice .
Salads with Balsamic vinegarette .
Because he eats fish and occasionally has organic chicken , Gonzalez is n't a true vegetarian .
He 's a flexitarian who views vegetables as the main course .
He says he often cooks for his family , because , well , his wife Tobie is " quasi on - board . "
" She 's having trouble , " Gonzalez says .
" When I cook , she 's eating good .
But if she has to do it on her own , she might not make the best choices . "
Gonzalez has become so hooked on his lifestyle change that he collaborated with nutritionist Mitzi Dulan on a new book , The All - Pro Diet .
Recipes included .
" If you do n't want to read my book , fine , " says Gonzalez , who also recommends a documentary , Food , Inc .
" But I encourage everybody to get something that tells you how nutrition affects your body .
Try it and see how it feels . "
Family history has played a role in his evolution .
Gonzalez says that an uncle and some cousins have Type 2 diabetes .
" It 's really rampant among minorities , " Gonzalez says .
" And if you 're of a lesser income , it 's harder to eat healthy , which is sad .
That 's another thing I can see myself trying to change ...
The stores do n't care about what we eat .
They just want to make money .
It 's really up to us as people to wake up . "
The turning point for Gonzalez began during a cross-country flight about three years ago , he says , as he sat next to a vegan .
After observing the man 's meal , Gonzalez peppered him with questions .
The conversation led him to read The China Study and ultimately speak to its author , Dr. T. Colin Campbell , about theories of a plant - based diet increasing energy and reducing risks for illness such as heart disease , diabetes and cancer .
Two other incidents in 2006 also shook him up .
After feeling numbness on the right side of his face , Gonzalez was diagnosed with Bell 's Palsy , a form of facial paralysis stemming from nerve malfunction .
After receiving treatment , he has n't had any recurring symptoms .
A mixup with a blood test , later rectified , also hit home .
" I laugh about it now , " he says , " but it was one of the scariest moments in my life when they told me , ' Your white blood cell count is way too low .
Could be leukemia , but we do n't want to startle you . '
By then , you 're like , ' What the hell are you talking about ? '
" That was the defining moment .
You hear all the statistics out there about the mortaility rate for football players .
Life is too short . "
No tight end has ever been to as many Pro Bowls as Gonzalez ( 6 - 5 , 243 ) , but the past two seasons he produced some of his best numbers with 99 and 96 receptions , while surpassing one NFL marker after another ( most career catches , yards , TDs , 1,000 - yard seasons by a tight end ) .
In his view , it gets back to the diet .
" I 've seen the difference on the field and noticed it after the game , " he says .
" My recovery is way better .
My endurance is better .
My focus has improved .
Before I drastically changed my eating habits , I was sore .
My bones were hurting .
But not anymore . "
The Falcons , trying to build on last season 's 11 - 5 record and playoff berth , envision Gonzalez as an ultimate security blanket for young quarterback Matt Ryan .
He will stretch the middle of the field and provide a trusted option in the end zone .
" Even before I got here , I always thought I 'd love to get that quintessential all - pro tight end , " says Falcons GM Thomas Dimitroff , like coach Mike Smith in his second year on the job .
" You can talk to some coordinators in this league and they say you need to go all wideouts .
But a guy like this is special , a high - percentage shot underneath . "
They 've also acquired a resident nutritionist .
During training camp meals , Gonzalez says some teammates cover their plates when they see him coming .
But at least one , backup tight end Ben Hartsock , is inspired .
" I 've watched him eat , and he 's pretty serious about it , " Hartsock says .
" But if Tony sipped Crisco through a straw , he 'd still look as good as he does .
His genetics and my genetics come from a different tree . "
Hartsock , a sixth - year pro , was undoubtedly affected by Gonzalez 's arrival .
He lost his starting job .
But there are no hard feelings .
" You just adjust to your role , " Hartsock says .
" If I were in the front office or the head coach and had an opportunity to get a future Hall of Fame talent like Tony Gonzalez , I 'd do the exact same thing .
We 're a better team with him . "
Gonzalez is staying in a suite with Ryan and veterans Chris Redman and Brian Finneran during camp .
He says it has been a solid bonding experience , and there are times when football does n't enter the conversation .
But food is fair game .
Is Ryan , a second - year pro , ready to become a vegan ?
" Nah , he 's not doing it , " Gonzalez says .
" He told me he was n't doing it until he 's older .
He says he 's young ; he can burn it off and not feel it .
" I 'm like , ' You 'd better , or you 'll be out of the league . ' "
A number of things can shake up a person ’s life , but divorce is definitely one of the biggest .
Whether you initiated it or not , dealing with the aftermath takes a great deal of emotional fortitude .
Most people start to identify themselves in conjunction with their spouse , especially after several years of marriage .
Having that identity wrested away in a divorce is a soul - shaking and world - shattering event .
There is no more “ family ” the way you previously defined it , and it ’s something that affects both you and your children .
It takes a great deal of time to cope with divorce , strength and support to come to terms with a new identity .
That ’s made even more difficult with all the constant reminders of all the “ couples ” things that you used to do , especially with the start of a new school year .
How are you going to deal with the “ couple ” things that you ’ll now have to do alone , like attending school functions ?
How about coping with seeing your ex-spouse there with a new significant other ?
It ’s important to learn to accept and move on , but here are a few divorce support tips for staying sane in the present .
Divorce support tip # 1 : List your fears
Even if you ’re not an anxious person by nature , divorce can have a major effect on that .
Maybe you ’re worried about seeing your ex with his or her new interest .
Maybe you ’re worried about attending all those school functions — parents ’ night , plays , concerts , what have you — by yourself , when everybody else will be with a spouse .
Maybe you have other fears .
Whatever the case , you ca n’t face your fears if you do n’t name them .
Make a list of the things you fear , or that worry and concern you , about facing the new school year as a single parent .
Acknowledging your fears is the first step to facing and eliminating them .
Divorce support tip # 2 : Accept your limitations
You are n’t Superman ( or Wonder Woman ) .
No matter how much you may want to , there will be times when you just wo n’t be able to do everything .
It ’s okay if you scrap a home - cooked meal in favor of frozen food or dinner out so that you can make it to functions on time , or if you get a store - bought costume for the school play instead of making it yourself .
You are only one person .
Divorce support tip # 3 : Keep the peace
As emotionally trying as it would be to see your ex at school functions , it ’s vital to maintain a peaceful relationship for the sake of your children .
Kids are brilliant at picking up on tension , and they ’re probably more worried than you are that there will be a humiliating scene at their school play .
If at all possible , keep your post - divorce relationship with your ex friendly .
If you ca n’t manage friendly , at least manage civil .
And do n’t speak ill of your ex to your children .
Tempting as it may be to list what you view as a litany of faults , it will only serve to damage your ex’s relationship with your kids , and possibly yours as well .
If you need to vent , do it to a supportive friend or relative .
Divorce support tip # 4 : This , too , shall pass
Above all , know that everything you feel – the fears , the worries , the grief and the transitional feeling – is not permanent .
The present stage of your life will pass , and you will move on to the next .
With each passing day , coping will get a little easier .
The good things in life may not last forever , but then again , neither do the bad things .
Divorce brings lots of changes to your life , but you do n’t have to let those changes destroy your sanity .
The school season is stressful enough without adding a new list of worries to it .
Take a deep breath and take it one day at a time , and eventually things will get better .

I saw a YouTube video recently that moved me .
It 's a pretty famous video - the source of the * Yale Book of Quotations * most memorable quote for 2007 , " Do n't taze me , bro ! "
That quote moved many people to laughter and even moved some opportunists to make T - shirts and bumper stickers .
But the video , which was shot at the University of Florida in September , did n't make me laugh , and I hope it does n't make you laugh .
It moved me to tears .
The video reminded me of how scary police can be ; they 've got guns , and clubs , and Tasers , and they are sometimes prone toward a " stay the course " mentality , even when their course has escalated past the point of reason .
The video left me thinking that every onlooker in the room was a coward .
I was also left with the impression that John Kerry , the most influential and tase - proof person in the room , was a double - coward for not stepping off the stage and getting involved .
My spouse called my accusations unfair .
I 've never been in that kind of situation , so how can I know that I 'd be brave enough to stand up against the police ?
Besides , what could I really do to help the victim ?
Getting myself arrested would n't accomplish anything .
My spouse has been in that kind of situation .
Her friend spoke past the three - minute limit at a city meeting , was asked to leave by the mayor , refused to leave , was tackled by police , and was eventually dragged out of the room .
Everyone in the room , including my spouse , stood by and watched it happen .
According to my spouse , these situations paralyze the onlookers with shock .
The University of Florida video was nominated for the YouTube 2007 Video Awards in the Eyewitness category , but it did n't win .
The winning video was ironically similar to the UF video - just replace students with buffalo and police with lions .
The analogy breaks down toward the end of the buffalo video , however , as the buffalo do the seemingly impossible : they fight back against the lions and rescue the victim .
But why should it seem impossible ?
How could five lions really be a match for a herd of 50 buffalo ?
How could seven police officers really be a match for a crowd of 50 students ?
Brave buffalo , cowardly students ?
But it 's more complex than that .
One of the buffalo gores one of the lions , and it's not clear that the lion will survive such a grave wound .
I 'm not suggesting that the UF students should have physically attacked the police .
So what should they have done ?
Perhaps they should have done some quick , ad hoc organizing .
Perhaps they should have collectively stood up to the police in some kind of non-violent , legal way .
Even if the students could organize on the spot , I was n't sure what the most effective strategy would be .
I designed a game to explore the possibilities .
Police Brutality is a game about fear , collective motivation , ad hoc organizing , self - sacrifice , and non-violence .
First and foremost , though , it 's a game about shouting .
Through designing and playing this game sketch , I 've discovered my own strategy for dealing with police brutality in a public forum .
Should I ever find myself in that kind of situation , I 'd be ready to act , and I 'd be brave enough to act .
At least I hope that I 'd be brave enough to act .

CIA 's History of Lying to Congress
On TV this week , with a measure of disbelief in their voices , the pundits ask , did the CIA lie to or deliberately mislead Congress ?
How is that not a rhetorical question ?
Email
Printer friendly The Agency has a long history of manipulating Congress and others to support its programs .
That this was posed as an actual question reveals the media ’s historical illiteracy in this matter .
In fact , when a House select committee investigated the CIA in the 1970s , the CIA convinced the House to suppress its own report , begging the question of who was overseeing whom .
Nevertheless , a copy of the House report was leaked , via Daniel Schorr , to the Village Voice .
The report opened with this disturbing sentence : “ If this Committee ’s recent experience is any test , intelligence agencies that are to be controlled by Congressional lawmaking are , today , beyond the lawmakers ’ scrutiny . ”
In the wake of revelations that CIA Director Leon Panetta just recently learned of an eight - year CIA operation that had never been revealed to , much less approved by , Congress , Reps .
Anna Eshoo , D - California , and Rush Holt , D - New Jersey , echoed similar sentiments .
On Andrea Mitchell ’s show on MSNBC Thursday , Eshoo and Holt stated that Panetta ’s revelation challenged his earlier statement that the CIA did not mislead Congress .
Eshoo made clear that , contrary to accusations from some Republicans , the charge has nothing to do with protecting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who earlier claimed the CIA lied to and misled Congress regarding its use of waterboarding and other brutal interrogation methods .
“ This is n’t anything personal , ” Eshoo said emphatically .
“ This is strictly about business , and this is deadly serious business , if I might characterize it that way .
“ The issue here is the national security of our nation .
There are very few members of Congress that [ sic ] are chosen to serve on the House Intelligence Committee .
And in that role , we are reliant upon the intelligence community to inform us – in fact , they are obligated , under the National Security Act of 1947 – to fully and completely inform the Congress .
“ So this is about accountability .
If in fact we do not get the proper information , how can we conduct our oversight which we are responsible for in the oath that we take , as well as shaping policy based on that information ? ”
Rep. Rush Holt focused the key issue for Andrea Mitchell : “ A moment ago , [ you ] said the relationship between Speaker Pelosi and Director Panetta and who told what [ to ] whom when is the bigger issue .
No , that ’s the smaller issue .
The bigger issue is , how well - examined are the activities of the CIA ?
Is the CIA doing things that are not in the best national interest ?
Who knows , if you do n’t have the oversight and the examination ?
So that ’s what this is about . ”
As the only full - scale House investigation focused on the CIA – the one led by Rep.
Otis Pike in the mid-1970s determined – overseeing the CIA is a challenging task , at best , and one at which government had repeatedly failed .
Painful Knowledge Author Kathryn Olmstead explored the failure of government to properly oversee the Agency in her book Challenging the Secret Government and found three culprits : First , the House and Senate were unwilling to challenge the CIA on policy , whether from fear , support , or sheer laziness .
Second , Olmstead believes the press , which seemed hell - bent on exposing the excesses of covert action in the wake of Watergate , pulled back for fear reporters had gone too far in bringing down President Richard Nixon .
( Olmstead notes only in passing CIA ’s longstanding relationships with the media , so well detailed in Carl Bernstein ’s landmark article “ The CIA and the Media , ” published in Rolling Stone in 1977 . )
But Olmstead really hits the mark with her third point , criticism of the American people for turning a blind eye to the excesses of the National Security State .
“ [ T ]he American people , acculturated for years to view their country and their leaders as moral and democratic , were reluctant to acknowledge unpleasant truths about their secret agencies , Olmstead wrote . " [ A ] s William W. Keller has explained in ‘ The Liberals and J. Edgar Hoover , ’ the liberal state did not like to admit that it had violated its ideology in any way .
“ Therefore , the extensive powers of its clandestine agencies were kept secret .
This secrecy enabled Americans to assume that the nation ’s foreign policy goals were compatible with traditional American ideals .
“ But the intelligence investigations brought these secret powers into the open ; they forced American to acknowledge that their country had tried to kill foreign leaders , had spied on civil rights leaders , and had tested drugs on innocent people .
“ Because this knowledge was very painful , many Americans , including members of Congress , refused to accept it .
Secrecy , as journalist Taylor Branch has said , ‘ protects the American people from grisly facts at variance with their self - image . ’”
Deceiving Congress
If we study history , we ’ll find rather quickly that the CIA has repeatedly , systematically , misled Congress .
Miles Copeland , one of the founding fathers of the CIA , talked of the use of “ Byzantine intrigues ” designed to keep Congress off its back .
Tom Braden noted that CIA Director Allen Dulles and CIA counterintelligence chief James Angleton used to discuss each morning , in the guise of fishing talk , the “ take ” from the night before , i.e. , intelligence gathered on prominent denizens of Capitol Hill from CIA taps sprinkled throughout the community .
( Braden , who died recently , is famously cited for writing an article titled “ Why I ’m Glad the CIA is Immoral . ”
Few commentators note that , in a later article , penned in the wake of disclosures about the Agency ’s wrongdoings , Braden advocated the abolition of the CIA . )
Angleton said at one point that if the CIA could n’t find out its own future from tapping the Hill , it had no business being in intelligence .
It should go without saying that “ gossip ” could easily become blackmail material , especially where illicit sexual liaisons were involved .
E. Howard Hunt , the notorious figure who at the time of Watergate was on his ostensible third retirement from the CIA , described how , during the 1960s , he penned a series of spy novels to aid the CIA , but “ quit ” the agency when his pen name became linked to his real name .
After he “ quit , ” he was instantly rehired as a contract agent , answerable solely to the CIA director ’s deputy Thomas Karamessines .
In his own words , Hunt explained he did this as a “ cautionary ” move “ in the event some Congressman might raise a question . ”
In other words , he “ quit ” to hide a CIA media operation from congressional scrutiny .
Lying about the Castro Plots
And nowhere is the CIA ’s deception and independent action more evident than in the Castro assassination plots .
When Congress first got a whiff of these plots thanks to a couple of articles by Jack Anderson and others , what did the CIA tell Congress ?
“ [ W ] ith the exception of one case which is under review by the Committee staff , there is no substance to the charges that CIA directed agents to assassinate Castro . ” ( Letter from Walter Elder to the Staff Director of the Church Committee , dated Aug. 21 , 1975 . )
As both Elder and the Church Committee later learned , the CIA of course had directed numerous agents to assassinate Castro in a variety of ways .
But , the CIA suggested publicly , they were acting under presidential authority .
Privately , however , according to the CIA ’s own Inspector General Report , the CIA never informed President John F. Kennedy of the Phase I Castro plots until they had ended , and never informed Kennedy of the ongoing Phase II plots at all .
In its own report , the CIA asks itself , can we claim executive approval for these plots , and answers its own question , “ No . ” ( This report was not declassified until the late 1990s , and should be considered the final word on the subject . )
The legacy of the investigations of the CIA in the 1970s was the perception , though not the reality , that effective CIA oversight had been implemented .
We ’re now seeing that , in reality , almost nothing changed .
The troubling insights of the committees that investigated the CIA were all but forgotten .
No one went to jail for breaking laws or committing perjury .
( In 1977 , former CIA Director Richard Helms was convicted of misleading Congress about the Nixon administration ’s covert action to oust Chile ’s socialist President Salvador Allende , who died in a 1973 coup .
Helms received a two - year suspended sentence and a $ 2,000 fine , which was paid by friends at the CIA .
Until his death in 2002 , Helms wore the conviction as a badge of honor , and President Ronald Reagan awarded him the National Security Medal in 1983 . )
( In the 1980s , CIA Director William J. Casey delighted in mumbling through his congressional testimony making it nearly impossible for the Intelligence Committee members to understand what he was saying or grasp its import .
When the deceptions of the Iran - Contra Affair were exposed in 1986 , Casey was accused of misleading Congress but died in May 1987 before any legal action could be taken .
Three other implicated CIA officers were pardoned by President George H.W. Bush on Christmas Eve 1992 . )
While both the Senate and House have intelligence oversight committees , the CIA is always in control of what Congress knows about its operations , as we were reminded again on Thursday .
How can that be changed ?
Who has the political will to demand true openness ?
It appears that President Obama has no desire to demand any change in the current system of intelligence community oversight .
That ’s unfortunate , and dangerous to our Democracy .
How can there be consent of the governed , as our Constitution demands , if the governed , or at least , their representatives , have no knowledge of what they are consenting to ?
Should we then demand a new investigation of the intelligence communities ?
Of course we should , and regularly .
But we should also do so with a genuine desire for change .
We should n’t spend the time and money unless there ’s a determination to get to the truth and follow through on lessons learned .
We should n’t start unless we have the stomach to face our past with a view towards protecting our future .
We elect our leaders .
We have chosen whom we want to entrust with our secrets .
How dare the CIA decide our representatives are unworthy of our trust and keep secrets from them ?
Is this a government of the people , by the people , and for the people ?
Or do we live under a government run by covert operators for purposes undisclosed ?
We ca n’t know if we do n’t ask the hard questions and perform a serious investigation into all that has been kept from us to date .

Center for Economic and Policy Research
July 10 , 2008
As Senators McCain and Obama fine - tune their plans for Social Security in preparation for the 2008 presidential election , a new report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research ( CEPR ) shows that , due to the collapse of the housing bubble , the vast majority of Americans have accumulated little or no wealth .
This means that they will be almost completely reliant on Social Security and Medicare to support them in their retirement years .
The study , “ The Impact of the Housing Crash on Family Wealth , ” analyzed the wealth holdings of families in all age cohorts in 2004 and projected the wealth of these families in 2009 .
The findings are presented by income quintile under three scenarios - real house prices remain at current levels , real house prices fall by an additional 10 percent , or real house prices fall by an additional 20 percent .
In all three scenarios , the vast majority of these families will have little or no housing wealth in 2009 .
“ This extraordinary destruction of wealth will have tremendous implications for millions of families , ” said report co-author Dean Baker .
“ Coupled with a very low personal savings rate , this means that many people , especially those near retirement will only have Social Security and Medicare to rely on once they leave the workforce . ”
The report projects that if house prices stay the same through 2009 , the median household headed by a person between the ages of 45 and 54 , those in their prime earning years , will have 24.7 percent less wealth than did the median household in this age group in 2004 .
These households will have accumulated just $ 113,268 in net worth in 2009 , barely $ 15,000 more than their counterparts in 1989 , whose net worth totaled $ 97,600 .
If real house prices fall 10 percent , the median household in the 45 to 54 cohort will see a 34.6 percent loss in wealth compared with the median in 2004 while families in the 18 to 34 cohort will lose of 67.6 percent .
If prices fall by 20 percent , the most pessimistic scenario , families in the 55 - 64 cohort will experience a loss of 49.6 percent of their wealth compared to the same cohort in 2004 .
This analysis should also prompt serious re-examination of policy proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare for near retirees .
Baker commented , “ policies that perhaps could have been justified at the peak of the housing bubble make much less sense now that tens of millions of near - retirees have just seen most of their wealth disappear . ”
In analyzing wealth holdings for these families , the authors used data from the Federal Reserve Board ’s 2004 Survey of Consumer Finance .
The authors also used the S&P 500 and the Case - Shiller 20 - City Composite Index to adjust for equity values and home price changes between 2004 and 2009 .

Strange Attractors :
Creating Patterns in Chaos
My book , Strange Attractors : Creating Patterns in Chaos ( ISBN 1-55851-298 -5 ) , describes a simple method for generating an endless succession of beautiful fractal patterns by iterating simple maps and ordinary differential equations with coefficients chosen automatically by the computer .
It contains over 350 examples of such patterns .
Each pattern produces a corresponding piece of fractal music .
The book describes methods for visualizing objects in three , four , and higher dimensions and explains how to produce 3 - D stereoscopic images on the computer screen using red / blue glasses which are included with the book .
The book and accompanying 3.5 " IBM - PC disk contain source code in BASIC , C , C++ , Visual BASIC for Windows , and QuickBASIC for Macintosh as well as a ready - to - run IBM - PC executable version of the program .
Strange Attractors : Creating Patterns in Chaos was published by M&T Books ( a subsidiary of Henry Holt and Company ) , 115 W. 18th Street , New York , NY 10011 ( 1-800-628-9658 ) .
The book is currently out of print , but it is available in Microsoft Word manuscript form as well as a machine - translated html version and a pdf version ( 8 MB ! ) .
There 's something touchingly innocent about the argument put forward by many people that the BNP should be allowed space in the mainstream media as this will " expose their ignorant ideas " .
Because history does n't necessarily prove this to be the case .
I do n't suppose that , in 1941 , many people thought : " You see , this is all working to plan .
Now he 's invaded Russia everyone will see just what an idiot this Hitler really is . "
The arguments of the far - right groups are already obviously ridiculous .
The latest slogan they march under is " Stop the Islamification of England " .
But how many people have had their lives Islamified against their will ?
Is there a single tea shop owner in Dorset who has to tell her customers : " Sorry dear , we 're not allowed to serve a scone until after dark as it's Ramadan . "
Do radio stations have to start the day : " Allaaaaah – ah - aaaah allaaaaaah .
Good morning , this is BBC Radio Sussex calling you to prayer . "
The most important government policy in recent years was probably the decision to go to war in Iraq , a move vehemently opposed by almost every Muslim in the country .
But the BNP would presumably say : " That proves it – they deliberately ignored the Muslims when they SHOULD be ignoring the BRITISH people . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The trouble is , the BNP do n't aim to attract support by winning debates , they want to spread fear and then pose as the respectable antidote .
The other trouble is they do this because , in my view , they 're fascists , with some of their leadership having a record of supporting Hitler .
Leading member Richard Edmonds published " Holocaust News " , which claimed the Holocaust was an " evil hoax " .
The publicity manager Mark Collett fudged the Hitler issue when he said : " Hitler will live forever . "
Co-founder of the party , the late John Tyndall , managed to surpass that with " Mein Kampf is my Bible " .
So the party that appoints itself as the barrier to Britain being taken over by a foreign religion was set up by someone who thought the Bible should be German .
And Nick Griffin wrote a pamphlet in 1997 called " The Mind - Benders " , in which he said of the Holocaust : " The ' extermination ' tale is a mixture of Allied wartime propaganda and witch - hysteria . "
Griffin usually dismisses these examples by putting them down to excitable youth .
Because we 've all got embarrassing snippets from our teenage days , so it hardly matters which of us wore crazy kipper ties and which wrote pamphlets denying the Holocaust , and the fact that Griffin wrote that when he was 38 only shows how young and full of life he is .
But around 10 years ago the BNP hit a snag , realising that their approach was holding them back .
Maybe they had a focus group , with someone reporting that , " OK , if I can share my feedback , some of the policies , such as distrust of Europe , supporting British farmers , I 'm hearing lots of positive energy .
But , and do n't take this the wrong way , the praising Hitler angle is proving mostly negative , I 'm afraid . "
So Griffin set about making them appear respectable .
They would deny they were fascist , and claim to be an upstanding legitimate party .
This creates another problem with them in the media , as their leaders are determined to conceal what I believe is their real mission , which is n't just to campaign in elections but to build a force of street - fighters .
After a BNP member was elected in 1993 Griffin said : " The electors of Millwall did not back a post - modernist Rightist party , but what they perceived to be a strong , disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan ' Defend Rights for Whites ' , with well directed boots and fists . "
At which point if you thought : " Aha , the trick now is to interview him and expose how he 's misunderstood post - modernism .
Then the electors of Millwall will see how ridiculous he is , " you were probably missing the point .
So the most effective opposition comes when communities refuse to be intimidated .
Last Friday , when the English Defence League announced a protest against " Islamification " outside a mosque in Harrow , around 2,000 people stood in their way .
The " protest " vanished , and the local population has apparently tingled with excitement ever since .
As was the case in the 1930s and 1970s , events such as this are the most practical barriers against the far right .
The idea of inviting them into the mainstream in order to expose them is well - meaning , but I doubt whether Griffin thinks :
" We can cope with united communities opposing us – but the perfect cutting remark on Newsnight and we 're stuffed . "

On his radio show today Lou Dobbs declared MSNBC the attack dogs for the White House .
He claimed that MSNBC has manufactured a story against him .
Dobbs said , “ These people over at MSNBC have moved so far to the left they will do almost anything to hold in the good graces of the Obama White House . ”
So , the White House and MSNBC are out to get Lou Dobbs ?
Here is the audio from Media Matters :
Advertisements
Dobbs said , “ I ’m going to talk a little bit about MSNBC and how they ’ve manufactured a story , and when you hear the details .
These people over at MSNBC have moved so far to the left that they will do almost anything seemingly , to hold in the good graces of the Obama White House , and their ideological thuggery allies .
I mean these guys are something .
Would be a thuggery , an assemblage of thuggers , thugs ?
I do n’t know , help me out on that .
What would it be just a group of thugs ?
I want a name , thuggery . ”
He continued , “ What would it be , a coven of thugs .
Anyway , they ’re attack dogs for this White House , and we ’re going to be talking about them and the extraordinary lengths to which they will go without any sort of remorse or principle what so ever .
I mean they ’re shameless , that ’s all there is to it . ”
Let ’s guess what Dobbs is referring to here .
Could it be the birther nonsense that he has been spewing for weeks ?
I am not sure if you picked up on this , but Lou Dobbs is now calling MSNBC an agent of the White House .
Dobbs is making the claim that silencing him would make Obama happy , so that is why MSNBC is going after him .
Dobbs is already on thin ice on CNN , and they ca n’t be happy with him starting a feud with another network , as they are trying to market themselves as the middle , and they to avoid the cross network bickering that MSNBC and FNC engage in .
I would say that it is not wise for Dobbs to anger a potential future employer , but who am I kidding ?
MSNBC would never hire Lou Dobbs .
If Dobbs would ever leave CNN , he would end up on Fox News .
The truth is that with each passing day , Dobbs is looking like an even bigger crackpot than Glenn Beck and Bill O’Reilly .
MSNBC is not doing the bidding of , or trying to curry favor from Barack Obama .
They are going after Dobbs because he is the most mainstream personality on the birther bandwagon .
If Dobbs keeps this up , CNN might be forced to let him go , whether they want to or not .
We all love Mary Anne Hobbs , do n’t we ?
She has given us so much great music through her radio show and compilations on Planet Mu .
So it was an honour to receive a promo of her latest compilation album Wild Angels .
Wild Angels has a distinguished dark feeling to it that seem to be intentional from Mary Anne .
It explores the subgenres that she plays on and the album is able to extract the essence of the show .
All in all I love the Wild Angels compilation !
It is filled with strong tunes ( with a couple of exceptions ) for everyone interested in bass - driven music and it is definitely a compilation worthy of your record collection .
I give it 5 out 6 Core News - stars .
Mary Anne Hobbs – Wild Angels can be bought from Amazon as CD , vinyl and MP3 - release .
Here are short reviews of each track with mp3 - links to preview them .
1. Mark Pritchard – ?
The opening tune of Wild Angels is simply called “ ? ” by Mark Pritchard .
It is a moody piece of music that works great as an opening track on this “ dark ” compilation .
The most ambient tune on the CD .
I like it !
2. Hudson Mohawke – Spotted
Hudson Mohawke gives us a track called Spotted that has eclectic Hip Hop feel to it .
It is pretty good , but I prefer other tunes on Wild Angels .
3. Mike Slott – Knock Knock
Next up we get the track Knock Knock from Mike Slott .
I feel it is in a bit the same vein as the one from Hudson Mohawke .
Not really my style , but still cool .
4. Brackles – LHC
Brackles got a downright ridiculous great tune on the album .
It ’s called LHC and fills me with joy .
Might be one of my favorite tracks of 2009 .
“ If you were in my hearth ” , indeed you are Brackles 😉
5. Gemmy – Rainbow Road
Rainbow Road by Gemmy is one fine dubstep tune that I ’ve enjoyed a lot .
6. Untold – Discipline
Untold is representing the darker and heavier side with Discipline .
Some really heavy , rolling basslines in this one that make you wanna move slowly around the dance floor like you are caressing the music ..
7. Tranqill – Payroll ( Paul White ’s Clean Dub )
Next up is Tranqill with a track called Payroll in a Paul White ’s Clean Dub that starts up like a Prince track and then moves on to sound a bit like DJ Shadow .
8. Architeq – Sleeping Bear Lament ( TAKE Remix )
Love the bassline on this one with its wobbly movements .
9. Rustie – Zig - Zag
I enjoy the DJ sets Rustie play and his tune Zig - Zag on Wild Angels is loveable too .
To me it sounds a bit chaotic , but it still has a nice structure .
10 . Mono / Poly – Red And Yellow Toys
I discovered Mono / Poly through the Mary Anne Hobbs show .
The track Red And Yellow Toys .
Think experimental hip hop on this one .
11 . Hyetal – We Should Light A Fire
We Should Light A Fire is a perfect track for long summer nights while you are sitting with your girl by a bonfire .
It is evocative yet massive .
One of my faves on Wild Angels !
12 . Starkey – Gutter Music V.I.P .
If you can call something a hit in “ our scene ” Starkey – Gutter Music VIP is a strong contender .
Its wild and dirty beats should make any crowd move .
13 . Darkstar – Videotape
Darkstar got some really wicked tracks .
No different with the Videotape tune that is the Darkstar version of the Radiohead tune from the In Rainbows album .
Although a bit unusual style it is still very awesome .
I ’ve actually been walking around humming on Videotape for the last few days .
14 . Floating Points – Esthian III
Floating Points has made a nice tune called Esthian III .
15 . Sunken Foal – Of Low Count And Light Pocket
Time for some acoustic guitar from Sunken Foal .
I ’ve been enjoying this tune too .
Love it !
16 . Teebs – WLTA
WLTA makes your head nod n appreciation .
Love the fat beats ( I really mean fat – my ears feel like they are stuffed with cotton after listening to Teebs too loud ) .
17 . Nosaj Thing – IOIO
Another great tune !
Nosaj
Thing brings us lovely music that I find a bit hard to describe so just listen to the sound clip .
18 . Legion Of Two – And Now We Wait
The last track by Legion Of Two got a dark feeling to it and the drums sounds acoustic .
Not my fave track as I ’m not a fan of the more industrial kind of sound .

Face it – floors see a lot of action .
From the grimiest tennis shoe soles to the spilled soda seeped into its pores , floors go through the gamut and deserve some much needed TLC to get them back to their pristine , shiny state .
It ’s easy to take a mop or shining solution and lather your floors up yourself , but is that really getting the job done ?
As a business owner , you want your business to have a clean , polished and put together look for customers as soon as they step inside .
Making commercial stone care Queens NY a priority is essential in fostering this well - kept environment .
Here are three reasons you should get your marble floors professionally cleaned .
1. Cleaning prevents permanent stains .
Even if you wiped the soda up that fell on your floor , most likely there are remnants still left behind .
These may be hard to see , but in reality , they can lead to permanent , more noticeable stains if not addressed .
Marble floors are stunning and expensive .
You ’ll ensure your marble ’s longevity by making cleaning a priority .
In addition , move around floor mats often because the dirt and grime that gets caught around these can also lead to stains .
2. Clean floors increase your businesses ’s value .
While you may have no intention of selling your business right now , that time may come .
If it does , you ’ll want to get the most out of the company , and well - maintained floors can help you get the highest selling price .
While people do n’t think much about floors because they ’re below your feet , they take up a lot of space inside a dwelling .
Good floors stand out and so do bad ones .
The more you invest and take care of your floors early on , the better they ’ll look down the road .
3. Clean floors are better for your health .
Germs , bacteria and dirt all settle into a floor and end up seeping into your lungs as you breathe .
These pathogens can be especially harmful to someone with asthma or other respiratory ailments , and the dirtier your floors get , the more these germs grow and multiply in your business .
If you ’re the business owner , you most likely spend the most time in your company .
As your second home away from home , do n’t you want to work at a place that ’s helping you stay healthy ?
Cleaning does n’t get most people super excited but is very important .
Leaving the job to cleaning professionals gets you out of doing it and ensures clean , healthy and fabulous floors for years to come .

Piracy and hacking are eveywhere .
It has enetered humans as an in -evitable disease .
Now
It ’s possible to pirate / hack a DNA pretending to be someone else .
Now ,
As a proof Scientists in Tel Aviv say they ’ve found and demonstrated that “ DNA evidence ” can easily be faked to match the wrong person – assuming the nefarious framer has access to a biology lab and DNA database .
Methodology –
The boffins fabricated phony DNA using blood and saliva samples to match someone else ’s profile without any tissue from that person , reports the New York Times .
They claim the procedure can be done by “ anyone with basic equipment and know - how ” and is indistinguishable from the real thing using current forensic procedures .
It ’s Simple
“ Any biology undergraduate could perform this , ” said Dan Frumkin , lead author of the paper , published in the journal Genetics .
The paper asserts that the possibility of DNA evidence being fudged to finger someone else has been overlooked by law enforcement , which has come to rely on DNA matching as a centerpiece of conviction and exoneration of criminal suspects .
The scientists said they counterfeited DNA samples in two ways .
One required a small sample of the scapegoat ’s DNA , and the other constructed from a DNA database .
For the first technique , the paper ’s authors took blood from a woman and removed the white blood cells containing DNA in a centrifuge .
They then added DNA from a man that had been amplified from a single strand of his hair using a standard technique called whole genome amplification .
The scientists then sent the sample to a top American forensic laboratory , which analyzed the sample as belonging to the man without detecting genetic shenanigans .
The second technique used samples from a DNA database to match a desired profile .
The authors simply mixed and matched DNA snippets from their database to fabricate a phony profile .
According to the NYT , the scientists claim a person only needs a mere 425 DNA samples to mimic a profile of any person they want .
Of course , the average criminal looking to frame someone unlucky sod would have a far easier time just leaving bits of the person ’s hair or blood around rather than bother with this DNA business .
The research , though , could be a boon to conspiracy theorists everywhere and at least worth another spin - off for the CSI franchise .
None - the -less , Frumkin is also rather conveniently the founder of a company called Nucleix , which has developed a test to detect whether DNA samples are real or faked – by the very technique Frumkin ’s team has demonstrated .
They hope to sell the test to forensic labs – which in all likelihood would be needed as part of any fake DNA conspiracy in the first place .

After I finished reading Born to Run by Christopher McDougall , I bought a pair of Vibram FiveFingers shoes .
I have been running in them now for five weeks .
I am loving them .
The only negative is that I am continuously having to explain them to curious strangers .
In fact , three people stopped me today in the space of three miles .
As a result , I thought it would be helpful to share my responses to the nine most common questions I get .
If you ’re thinking about buying a pair , maybe this will help you .
Why do you run in those things ?
Because I like running barefoot .
However , I ca n’t always run on safe terrain .
Running in the Vibram FiveFingers is as close as you can get to running barefoot and still have some protection .
They provide a thin layer of rubber than keeps you from getting cut or bruised on sharp rocks or glass .
Why would you want to run barefoot ?
Twenty - five percent of all your bones are in your feet .
Your feet are a marvel of biological engineering .
They are designed to adjust your stride , distribute your weight , and minimize the impact on your joints — on the fly .
Unfortunately , when you encase them in modern running shoes , your feet lose contact with the ground .
They do n’t adjust .
They are n’t free to do what they were made to do .
But are n’t running shoes designed to provide cushion and prevent injuries ?
Yes , but according to McDougall , despite supposedly huge improvement in shoe technology , 70 percent of all runners get injured every year .
This number has not decreased in decades .
Interestingly , running injuries were very rare until the invention of the modern running shoe in 1972 .
McDougall claims , there is a direct correlation between running shoes and running injuries .
In fact , the more expensive the shoe , the more likely you are to be injured and the more severe your injury will be .
But all the running magazines advocate the super expensive , super advanced shoes .
Why ?
Follow the money .
Running shoes are a $ 15 billion industry .
The companies that make these shoes are not going to admit that their product is the problem rather than the solution .
These same companies advertise in the running magazines .
The magazines can rate the various shoes and write reviews , but they ca n’t challenge the whole premise behind the shoes without flushing the bulk of their revenue stream .
But they look so bizarre .
Are n’t you embarrassed to wear them ?
Yes , they look weird .
My kids say they look like “ gorilla feet . ”
I was initially embarrassed , but I got over it .
When people make fun of me now , I tell them , “ ridicule is the last stage you go through before you order a pair ! ”
I have several friends now running in them who initially laughed .
Can you run as far in your FiveFingers as you can with traditional running shoes ?
Not yet .
So far , the longest I have run in them is 3.5 miles .
Regardless , even if you are a seasoned runner , you must start slowly .
Your feet have essentially been encased in casts for years .
You will be using muscles you never knew you had .
Some of your muscles have atrophied .
I recommend that you run no more than half a mile at first and gradually increase .
However , I am on - track to run a full half marathon in them in November .
Which model of the FiveFingers do you like best ?
I initially bought the Classic .
They are the easiest to get on and off .
However , after my son- in - law bought the KSOs , I decided to go with those .
“ KSO ” stands for “ keep stuff out . ”
They just feel better to me .
This is totally subjective and “ your mileage may vary . ”
Do you really think you will stick with them ?
Only time will tell .
I am admittedly an early adopter .
I love new stuff .
I try things for a while , and then I discard them .
That ’s just my personality .
That ’s why I have n’t blogged about the Vibrams until now .
I wanted to give them a month and see if I still liked them .
I do , but that could change .
Caveat emptor .
Where did you buy your Vibrams ?
I bought mine on the Vibram FiveFingers web site .
It was totally self - service .
I got them in about three days .
However , they do distribute them through some retail outlets .
For example , Cumberland Transit in Nashville carries them .
You can check their store locator for a local retailer in your area .
If you are a runner , I think the FiveFingers merit serious consideration , particularly if you have been prone to injuries and tried everything else .
If you are still not convinced , I would urge to read Born to Run .
Even if you do n’t buy into running barefoot , it is still one of the best running books I have read .
Red Hat would like to thank CERT - FI and Outpost24 AB for reporting these issues .
Exploiting these flaws requires the attacker to have access to a subnet where they can make use of routable IP addresses .
These need to be different from the IP address being used by the attacker 's machine .
The attacking system must send from IP addresses that other hosts are not competing for , and it must guarantee that its ARP poisoning is completely effective .
The attacking system must create an attack that can not only generate the three - way handshake but can avoid sending RST frames in a response .
Denial of service flaws in the way TCP connections are handled have been disclosed by Robert E. Lee and the late Jack C. Louis of Outpost24 AB .
These flaws allow an attacker to create crafted TCP connections , which can eventually exhaust the receiver 's system resources and lead to a denial of service .
These flaws are assigned CVE - 2008 - 4609 ( Red Hat Bugzilla bug 465932 ) .
Details of the attacks are described in the CERT - FI advisory .
Resolution
These attacks target design limitations of the TCP protocol .
Due to the upstream decision not to release updates , Red Hat does not plan to release updates to resolve these issues ; however , the effects of these attacks can be reduced .
The following iptables example limits the number of new connections over a time period .
It checks if packets are part of an existing or associated connection .
If they are , the packets are accepted .
Otherwise , if 10 connection attempts to any TCP port are received within one minute , they are dropped :
# The following rule accepts a packet that is associated with an established connection , # or that is starting a new connection that is associated with an existing connection : iptables -A INPUT - p tcp -m conntrack -- ctstate RELATED , ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT #
The following rule updates the recent list if the packet is from a new connection , and # drops the packet if it is above the limit : iptables -A INPUT - p tcp -m recent -- update -- seconds 60 -- hitcount 10 -j DROP #
The following rule tracks and accepts the packet if it was a new connection and was not # above the limit set in the previous rule : iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m recent -- set
This example is a connection rate limit , not a concurrent connection count limit .
Simply closing existing connections is not enough to enable new ones as it is the number of connections over the time period that matters .
This example can be extended with TCP matches to separate limits per destination port .
This is only an example .
Mitigation should be dealt with on a site - by - site basis .
Once you know you are under attack , block the IP address or subnet since this will be revealed in the attack packets .
Furthermore , contact your upstream internet provider to get those IP addresses blocked at their ingress .
The iptables package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 does not have the libipt_recent module ; therefore , the above iptables example cannot be used .
If you use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 , you need to contact your upstream internet provider to have the attacker 's IP addresses blocked at their ingress , as noted above .

" We know that there were several warnings that were given prior to the events of September 11th .
People were calling in to the CIA and to the FBI , and they were giving information that was critical .
There was adequate warning .
But instead of requesting that Congress investigate what went wrong and why , we had President Bush place a phone call to Majority Leader Senator Tom Daschle , asking him not to investigate .
My question is , what do they have to hide ?
The fact is that the father sits on the board of the Carlyle ( ph ) Group , which is one of the highest - level defense contractors in the country .
And so we get this presidency of questionable legitimacy requesting a nearly unprecedented amount of money to go into a defense budget for defense spending that will directly benefit his father !

Latest News
Ending some nine months of closed - door deliberations , Sens. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) and John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) will release global warming legislation Wednesday that they hope will be the vehicle for broader Senate negotiations and an eventual conference with the House .
The bill 's authors said last week that they expect to start hearings early next month on the bill , with a markup in Boxer 's Environment and Public Works Committee to follow soon thereafter .
They also acknowledged that their legislation is just a " starting point " in a bid to win over moderate and conservative Democrats , as well as Republicans .
" I hope what we 've done is constructive and well - received , " Kerry , the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , said Thursday .
" I have no pretensions , and neither does Barbara , that this will be the final product .
It is a starting point , a commitment , full - fledged , across party lines to do what we need to do to protect the planet for the next century . "
The Boxer - Kerry bill will build in large part off H.R. 2454 ( pdf ) , legislation approved in June by the House following several marathon months of negotiations that involved lawmakers representing coastal and industry - heavy districts .
Exactly what is the same in the two bills remains to be seen .
As for differences , Senate Democratic aides say they expect the legislation to divert from the House bill 's 17 percent emissions target for 2020 and go with an even more aggressive 20 percent limit .
The bill also will stay silent on exactly how the Senate should divide up emission allowances .
At least five other Senate committees are also expected to contribute to the climate debate .
The Foreign Relations and Agriculture committees are preparing language without convening a markup .
Commerce Chairman Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) said he will hold votes on his pieces of the global warming bill .
And the same goes for Finance Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , who last week told reporters that provisions on international trade and the allocation of emission allowances would be marked up provided Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) says the bill is " clearly moving . "
Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) has already approved legislation ( S. 1462 ( pdf ) ) out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that includes a nationwide renewable electricity standard and a raft of other energy incentives , including a provision that could bring oil and gas rigs closer to Florida 's Gulf Coast .
Bingaman is also planning a hearing Thursday on several competing cost estimates associated with the House - passed climate bill .
The session , which was postponed once earlier this month , now gives senators an early public forum to sound off on the Boxer - Kerry bill .
Already last week , several Democratic senators working outside of the Boxer - Kerry camp said their ideas would be melded into the legislation at a later date .
" It 's going to need a lot of work , " said Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) .
Brown said he did not expect the Boxer - Kerry bill to include language adopted in the House that tries to assist energy - intensive manufacturing industries , including steel , pulp and paper and cement .
" My understanding is they did not include the House language on manufacturing , " Brown added .
" But I 've been talking to them about it .
They are very open to it .
They are in no way dismissive . "
Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) said she also does not think her concerns will be addressed in the initial draft from Boxer and Kerry .
That means further efforts on issues related to agriculture , offsets and energy intensive industries .
" We will have to take a look at the language and then determine it from there , " Stabenow said .
Kerry last week sought to change the vernacular surrounding the climate bill and sell its concepts more broadly , insisting it is not a " cap and trade " proposal but a " pollution reduction " bill .
" I do n't know what ' cap and trade ' means .
I do n't think the average American does , " Kerry said .
" This is not a cap - and - trade bill , it 's a pollution reduction bill " ( E&E Daily , Sept. 25 ) .
But a leading GOP opponent to the Senate climate effort quickly pushed back on the Democrat 's strategy .
" No matter the semantic games employed , or the extent to which Democrats wish to hide the truth from the American people , cap and trade will mean more job losses , more pain at the pump , and higher food and electricity prices for consumers , " said EPW Committee ranking member James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) . "
Both Brown and Stabenow said they would welcome the release of the Senate bill even though it will give critics something tangible to target .
" It always does , " Brown said .
" There is always something to shoot at .
But I think it is the right step , and then we start working to improve it . "
Senate Democratic leaders , including Reid and Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , have said that they do not know if there will be enough time to get to the climate bill on the floor this year .
But Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass. ) , one of the lead authors of the House bill , said that he is not giving up yet .
" At this stage in the House no one was predicting we could be successful , " Markey told reporters .
The lawmaker said he expected the Senate to closely follow the House bill 's outlines , especially " once people sit down and begin to understand we have dealt with the major interests in the country .

Socialist Alliance : ` Australia must act for democracy in Honduras '
Below is an open letter from the Socialist Alliance to Australia 's foreign affairs minister , Stephen Smith , calling on the Australian Labor government to act for the immediate and unconditional reinstatement of President Manuel Zelaya , and the restoration of democracy in Honduras .

Dear Minister Smith ,
The people and nation of Honduras urgently need the support of democratic governments and peoples around the world .
The current military dictatorship in Honduras , which on June 28 overthrew the elected government of President Manuel Zelaya Rosales in a coup d’etat , has unleashed a wave of repression against tens of thousands of people who have taken to the streets demanding Zelaya ’s immediate restoration as president .
Zelaya re-entered Honduras on foot on September 21 and was given asylum by the Brazilian government in its embassy in Tegucigalpa .
However , on September 22 , as thousands of people assembled outside the embassy to welcome Zelaya home , the coup regime headed by Roberto Micheletti cut electricity and water to the embassy and tear - gassed , pepper - sprayed and fired on the president ’s supporters , seriously injuring some .
With Zelaya ’s return , the incessant violations of human rights and fundamental liberties perpetrated by the dictatorship over the last 85 days have significantly increased .
Hundreds more civilians have been arrested and images have emerged of large numbers of protesters being rounded up and detained in a sports stadium in Tegucigalpa .
The military has now imposed a total curfew in the country – an attempt to prevent the Honduran people from expressing their wish for the restoration of democracy in their country .
Speaking to international media on September 21 , Zelaya called on Honduras ’ armed forces to “ respect the human rights of the Honduran people …
To the commander general of the armed forces ...
I peacefully make a call for sanity , so that there is no violence on the streets .
The people here are unarmed , shouting for joy . ”
It is a fundamental human right of all peoples to determine their own government and political future and during the last three months the people of Honduras have made very clear what they want with peaceful protests , strikes and road blockades , on a daily basis .
On September 15 , three million people rallied in more than 20 cities and towns across Honduras demanding an end to the coup .
We join with the nine governments of Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America , the Organisation of American States , the UN General Assembly and the Rio Group in their call for Zelaya to be immediately reinstated as the legitimate president of Honduras and for the democratically elected government to be able to resume its duties .
We note also that the European Union and almost every government in the world have officially condemned the coup , and call on the Australian government to urgently :
Demand that the coup leaders respect the integrity of the Brazilian embassy and immediately stop the repression against civilians ;
Actively support the reinstatement of democratically - elected President Manuel Zelaya , including supporting all calls for his reinstatement made at the 64th meeting of the United Nations General Assembly this week ;
Demand the immediate release of all political and social movement activists who have been detained by the military ;
Support President Zelaya ’s and the Honduran people ’s rejection of the terms of the “ Arias agreement ” , which would legitimise the coup leaders ’ actions , and work for the reinstatement of Zelaya to the presidency without conditions of any kind , in accordance with the will of the people of Honduras .
Not recognise the results of Honduran elections in November if those elections are carried out while the coup government remains in power , the position of the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) .
Support the calls of the Honduran people for the coup leaders to be arrested and tried for their crimes .
Pressure the United States administration to end its training of the Honduran military .
We applaud the millions of courageous Hondurans who have peacefully protested for three months to defend democracy , despite severe intimidation and assault by the military , and pledge our active solidarity with them until the coup is overturned and democratic rights are assured in Honduras .
Yours in support of the democratic rights of all peoples ,

Statement from Cuban parliament on situation in Honduras
Havana , September 23 , 2009 -- The National Assembly of People 's Power of the Republic of Cuba yesterday issued a statement repudiating the flagrant violation of human rights being suffered by the people of Honduras .
Below is the text of the document :
Given the gravity of events that are still occurring in the sister Republic of Honduras , the National Assembly of People 's Power of the Republic of Cuba affirms its profound concern over the flagrant violation of the most elemental human rights of the people of that country as a consequence of their determined and constant resistance and rejection of the coup d’état and the dismantling of the constitutional and democratic regime of the government of President Manuel Zelaya .
We join the universal repudiation and condemnation of the military regime imposed on that nation and call for the implementation of more energetic and profound measures on the part of the international community in order to achieve a return to normality and the restoration of the Honduran president , democratically and popularly elected , as a manifestation of the will of his people .
Zelaya ’s presence in Tegucigalpa constitutes a gesture of courage and is based on his legitimate right as the constitutional president of Honduras .
His physical integrity and that of his family , of the diplomatic personnel and other employees in the Brazilian embassy , as well as that of the group of Hondurans present there must be respected and guaranteed by the coup perpetrators .
The barbaric repression of demonstrations by the people in support of the democracy that they are defending and which they deserve must likewise be ended .
PSOL Brazil : Unconditional support for Honduran people
September 22 , 2009 -- Zelaya`s entry in Honduras is a great victory of the 85 days of Hondurean resistance .
It put us the urgent task to improve the continental solidarity with the resistance at the moment it was opened a confrontation between people and dictatorship .
There is a new situation which provides us with the urgent task of supporting the next steps in Honduras and also to prepare with all dedication the meeting they have organised on October 7 and 8 .
There is no other way to understand how Zelaya entered the country – without negotiation with the regime , even surprising it – if it was n’t due to the powerful Hondurean resistance which advanced on September 15 .
As the comrades of the Hondurean Resistance Front said , “ This day we have mobilised 3 million people .
Althought we can’t confirm this amount , because it is a sum of more than 20 mobilisations organised along the country , we can assure that only the mobilisation in Tegucigalpa had about 150,000 people . ”
The resistance through these 85 days kept advancing , generating what we can call a democratic popular revolution , a mobilisation process as or deeper than the ones in Venezuela , Bolivia and Equador .
Zelaya ’s entry and his positioning in Brazilian embassy gives power to this open process and it establishes in fact two powers : Zelaya and the mobilised people , from one side , and the oligarchy responsible for the coup d’état from the other side .
How this process will be defined it depends of the power of the popular mobilisation to face the regime and of the resistance direction .
Another element which allowed the growth of the resistance was the international isolation of the coup ’s regime .
This isolation is also a product of the continental ascension which lives Latin America and that is expressed in the role of the ALBA ’s countries , led by Venezuela , that positioned themselves for the return of Zelaya , and that have been almost for sure the ones who collaborated with his entry , as it was done in the past tries .
This situation also explains why yankee imperialism could not support the coup d’état and why Obama had to keep his repulsion to the coup and a position of a negotiated exit .
The next hours and days will be definitive for the outcome of the Hondurean process .
In his return to the country Zelaya said : “ Country , restitution or death ” .
He also said that the agreement proposed by Arias , the president of Costa Rica , is not the alternative .
This was the position transmitted by Nicaragua ’s ambassador to the emergency meeting of the Organization of American States .
At this time it was started a confrontion between the resistance and the dictatorship which tries to remove the demonstration in front of the Brazilian embassy .
WE DECLARE OURSELVES OPENLY AGAINST THE REPRESSION AND DENOUNCE THE DICTATORSHIP GOVERNMENT , AND SUPPORT THE IMMEDIATE RESTITUTION OF ZELAYA IN POWER , FOR THE WIDER SOLIDARITY AND COLABORATION WITH THE NATIONAL RESISTANCE FRONT .
It is time to develop one wide and unconditional campaign of solidarity , denouncing the repression and preparing one important delegation to be present in the Honduras meeting .

The legitimate president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya arrived in Honduras this week and is in the Brazillian embassy supported by thousands of people from all over the country that have come to Tegucigalpa to show their support .
The European United Left–Nordic Green Left ( EUL - NGL ) , the left group in the European Parliament , is demanding that the EU offer concrete support for Zelaya , a democratically elected head of state deposed in an illegal military coup .
Willy Meyer of Spain ’s Izquierda Unida ( United Left ) , who visited the country four days after the coup d’etat , is delighted with the news of Zelaya 's return and has demanded that the Spanish overnment , the European Commission and the European Council offer “ the maximum collaboration with President Zelaya to endorse him in every action in order to restore the democratic order in Honduras ” .
Meyer has asked the European Commission “ to collaborate with the Organisation of American States ( OAS ) to support all diplomatic actions ” and to instruct its office in Tegucigalpa , the Honduran cpital , to hold talks with President Zelaya “ in order to coordinate the measures necessary for the return of constitutional order ” .
“ We are against the curfew and any kind of repression of the people that are around of the Brazillian Embassy , and we also demand that the army return to its barracks ” , said Meyer .
Friends of the Earth International : A call for world - wide solidarity against the repression in Honduras
By Nnimmo Bassey September 22 , 2009 -- Friends of the Earth International ( FoEI ) applauds the return to Honduras of its legitimate president , Manuel Zelaya , who has taken refuge in the embassy of Brazil in Tegucigalpa .
At the same time we note with grave concern the siege on the Brazilian embassy and the increase in repression following the return of President Zelaya .
Friends of the Earth International denounces the gross human rights violations in Honduras perpetuated by the illegitimate government .
This repression violates international norms and cannot be accepted under any circumstances .
The people of Honduras have stood firmly by their legitimate president and have not wavered since the day the unfortunate usurpation of power took place on 28 June 2009 .
Friends of the Earth International calls on the international community to pressure the illegitimate authorities in Tegucigalpa to step aside for dialogue and for the completion of term of the legitimate president .
Specifically , Friends of the Earth International calls on the Security Council of the United Nations to take immediate actions to stem the rise of violence in Honduras .
We also assure the peoples of Honduras of the continued support and solidarity of our 77 groups and 2 million members spread around the world .

Toronto : Supporters call for the return of democratically elected Honduran President to power
By John Bonnar
September 25 , 2009 -- rabble.ca --
Supporters of deposed Honduran president Manuel Zelaya gathered outside the Brazilian consulate in Toronto on September 23 demanding his return to power while condemning the violence and oppression under interim leader Roberto Micheletti .
Zelaya , ousted in a coup nearly three months ago , slipped back into the country September 21 and is currently taking refuge in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa .
“ Thank you Brazil and the people of Brazil for your great support ” , said Raul Burbano of the Latin American Solidarity Network .
Supporters applauded .
“ We ’re here asking the Canadian government to condemn the violence against people who have been resisting peacefully against a military dictatorship for the last three months . ”
“ Viva Brazil ” , yelled one supporter .
Representatives from Canadian Union of Public Employees ( CUPE ) , the Ontario Secondary School Teachers ’ Federation ( OSSTF ) and the Toronto Bolivia Solidarity Network also attended Wednesday ’s rally on the southwest corner of Bloor and Bay Streets .
In the past , the OSSTF has supported the Latin American Solidarity Network in their documentary work as well as moving forward the causes of progressive movements in Latin America .
Burbano appealed to Canadians to take a stand against the interim Micheletti government that imposed a curfew , closed the airport and set up roadblocks on highways leading into Tegucigalpa to keep out more Zelaya supporters from other regions of the country .
The Associated Press reported that Zelaya loyalists ignored the decree and surrounded the embassy dancing and cheering and using their cell phones to light up the streets after electricity was cut off on the block housing the embassy .
Luis Granados Ceja was recently in Honduras with the brigade from the Latin American Solidarity Network .
He explained that Zelaya ’s return to Honduras had less to do with international pressure than the valiant efforts of the Honduran people , who have been resisting a military dictatorship for close to three months .
Even after daily rallies , constant repression , and Zelaya supporters killed or detained , he said “ the people remain on the streets with the same level of optimism and militancy that they did on day one ” .
With Zelaya ’s return , his supporters are even more determined to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict .
“ We must take this opportunity to restore democracy to Honduras so that they can continue ” , he said .
“ Members of the military are willing to take the lives of their fellow Honduran people in order to prop up this coup . ”
Granados Ceja declared that the Canadian government must call for the immediate and unconditional return of Zelaya to power .
Until that happens , he argued that Prime Minister Harper should suspend all aid to the de facto government .
The Obama administration has cut more than $ 30 million in non-humanitarian aid to Honduras — calling it a signal that Washington is not happy with the status quo .
In the meantime , CUPE Ontario committed to call on the Canadian Labour Congress ( CLC ) , CUPE National and other affiliates to pressure the Canadian government to change its position .
The Manitoban recently reported that Canada , the second largest investor in Honduras , has not cut off military aid or any aid to the coup government and is in fact still training Honduran soldiers despite the coup .
“ The Canadian government ’s position is embarrassing ” , said Edgar Godoy of CUPE Ontario .
“ They have to take a position to restore the constitution in Honduras , to demand the freedom of the people who have been detained and stop the repression . ”
Nchamah Miller told supporters that Canada needs to wake up now .
“ If we do n’t we ’re going to have a battlefront on our own continent , ” said the president of the National Council of Latin American and Caribbean Women in Canada .
“ It ’s time for Canada to realise what ’s at stake here . ”
Miller warned that if Canadians continue to remain indifferent to the situation in Honduras , the Harper government will have been complicit in keeping the illegal coup in power .
She urged Latina and Caribbean women to join the council .
Raul Burbano , who was also in Honduras recently , reported that the resistance movement in Honduras is unanimously united against the dictatorship .
He explained that the goal of the movement , besides restoring Zelaya to power , is to re-establish the nation through a constitutional assembly led by the people .
“ We ’re calling for grassroots democracy ” , he added .
“ Every day at the front lines , members of various indigenous groups are putting themselves in danger , struggling against neo-liberalism and free trade agreements . ”
Burbano said the dynamics of power have changed in Honduras dramatically in the last thirty years , since the free trade agreements were signed .
In the 1980s , he remarked , the multinationals had 40 per cent of the power , the government had 40 per cent , and the people had the remaining 20 per cent .
“ Today , the people only have 5 per cent of the power , while the multinationals control 75 per cent of the country . ”
Like Burbano , Communist Party of Canada leader Miguel Figueroa believes the coup in Honduras needs to be seen in a broader context .
He said it ’s part of a larger struggle to roll back and defeat the popular , progressive and anti-imperialist movements that are sweeping across South America .
“ It ’s like the domino theory of the 1950s during the Cold War ” , said Figueroa , “ which was used to justify US imperialist intervention in Vietnam and Southeast Asia in order to stop the spread of the left . ”
Solidarity statement of the Iraq Committee , Lund , Sweden
The Iraq Committee in Lund , Sweden , salutes President Manuel Zelaya and his brave return to his homeland , Honduras .
We hope that this move will facilitate a successful general uprising of the popular masses in Honduras , reinstating Mr Zelaya as leader of the country .
The Anti-Imperialist Bloc of ALBA will be strengthened if Honduras will also join as member .
This is in the interest of the Patriotic Resistance and people of Iraq , who have everything to gain from a more united alliance of the oppressed peoples against the US Empire .
We support the international trade union initiatives condemning the coup , and we send our greetings to the steadfast Frente Nacional de Resistencia .
Your struggle against the reactionary usurpers of power is an inspiration to anti-imperialists around the world !
¡ Viva El Pueblo Hondureño !
¡ Viva La Solidaridad Internacional !

Calculated Risk has updated his chart showing job losses as a percent of peak employment since WW2 .
Needless to say , it 's not encouraging .
The last time employment fell this much , in 1948 , it recovered quickly .
The recent recoveries , however , have been much more gradual .
Unless employment rebounds rapidly ( it 's still falling ) , it 's hard to see how we 're going to get the v-shaped recovery that the bulls are now expecting .
( In 1948 , consumers had almost do debt .
Now they have it coming out of their ears ) .
The unemployment rate , meanwhile , is now the highest it has been in 26 years .
Calculated Risk 's full take on the employment report is here >

Bill Gross has a piece out now on Pimco ’s website suggesting we are about to witness a sea change in saving and spending habits , government intervention , and a host of other issues .
This is not a buy - the - dips kind of atmosphere and it will last for , oh , 20 years .
Gross says :
This “ new ” vs. “ old ” normal dichotomy was perhaps best contrasted by Barton Biggs , as I heard him on Bloomberg Radio in early 2009 , when he said he was a “ child of the bull market . ”
I thought that was a brilliant phrase , and Barton is a brilliant phrase - maker .
He went on to say though , that his point was that for as long as he ’s been in the business – and that ’s a long time – it has paid to buy the dips , because markets , economies , profits , and assets always rebounded and went to higher levels .
That is not only the way that he learned it , but that is the way , basically , that capitalism is supposed to work .
Economies grow , profits grow , just like children do .
I think that ’s why he said he was a child of the bull market , not just because he had experienced it for so long , but also because economic growth and higher asset prices are almost invariably a natural evolution , much like the maturation of a person .
That ’s how people grow , and so I think Barton was saying that capitalism just grows that way too .
Well , the surprise is that there ’s been a significant break in that growth pattern , because of delevering , deglobalization , and reregulation .
All of those three in combination , to us at PIMCO , means that if you are a child of the bull market , it ’s time to grow up and become a chastened adult ; it ’s time to recognize that things have changed and that they will continue to change for the next – yes , the next 10 years and maybe even the next 20 years .
We are heading into what we call the New Normal , which is a period of time in which economies grow very slowly as opposed to growing like weeds , the way children do ; in which profits are relatively static ; in which the government plays a significant role in terms of deficits and reregulation and control of the economy ; in which the consumer stops shopping until he drops and begins , as they do in Japan ( to be a little ghoulish ) , starts saving to the grave .

" These guys are just playing with my life . "
Erinn Ackley still remembers her father 's words as he struggled with an aggressive form of cancer in 2006 .
Bill Ackley had health insurance through his job as a public school teacher .
But as his life hung in the balance , his insurance company questioned the necessity of a potentially life - saving treatment doctors prescribed and , for a time , refused to pay .
After months of appeals to overcome the " bureaucratic roadblocks , " Ackley finally received approval for the treatment he sought .
But to his daughter Erinn , the delay just might have cost her father his life .
" Dad was finally transplanted 126 days after the first transplant request [ but ] he never returned home , " said Ackley .
" He passed away at the age of 57 , leaving a grieving widow and daughter , and only one grandchild born 17 months later , that he will never play with . "
" When a loved one is going through a life or death struggle , you can hear the clock ticking every minute , " she said .
Ackley 's story was one of several accounts shared with members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday of the often heart - wrenching struggles some Americans face in dealing with the " private health insurance bureaucracy . "
" We 're always more informed when we hear about personal experience , " said subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio .
At the hearing , lawmakers of both parties agreed that delays – or denials – of coverage like the one faced by Ackley are unjustifiable and have become too common .
" Every single American would agree that what you went through was wrong , " said Rep. Jim Jordan , R - Ohio .
" Americans hate being told what to do , and this idea that someone is going to get between them and their doctor does n't sit well . "
The story of Mark Gendernalik 's infant daughter , Sidney , was among the emotional testimony before the committee regarding insurers ' attempts to avoid costly payouts .
" They were trying to exhaust us , " said Gendernalik , the father of twin girls from Los Angeles , Calif. , of the repeated delays and denials for an expensive treatment Sydney needed for a rare infant spasms syndrome that can lead to irreversible mental retardation .
" After six days of being inpatient , doctors said we have to discharge you , we can't get a response from your insurance groups , " he said , choking up .
" I spend so much time fighting to get care .
I feel like medical manager for my daughter , not her daddy …
I need you people to let me be her daddy , " he implored members of the committee .
" We are disenfranchised now … all I want to do now is go home and be a dad . "
Similar scenarios have been the target of state insurance regulators around the country in recent years , resulting in a number of cases against insurers for wrongfully delaying or denying claims .
PacifiCare , a subsidiary of United HealthCare which also insured Gendernalik , paid a hefty settlement in California in 2008 for improperly denying 130,000 claims , among other violations .
" Commercial plans will always , always , compete to avoid sick people , even in a regular marketplace , " said Karen Pollitz , director of the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute .
" There has never been a more deadly time for patients in terms of insurance practices , " testified Dr. Linda Peeno , a former review physician for Humana insurance in Louisville , Kentucky .

A woman who jumped naked from a Sydney office building yelled " I love you " before lunging off a window sill in a psychotic state , a coronial inquest has heard .
Counsel assisting the inquest Robert Bromwich said the manner of Rebekah Lawrence 's death was n't in question , but the contentious point was the reason for her state of mind .
A colleague of Ms Lawrence , who plunged to her death in December 2005 , described how the 34 - year - old was " quite unstable in a manner in which I had never seen before " .
Royal Australian College of Physicians executive officer Fairlie Clifton said Ms Lawrence began swearing and then said " I love you , I love you " before backing out onto a ledge of the Macquarie Street Tower .
Ms Clifton told the NSW Coroner 's Court at Glebe she did not know who the comments were directed at .
The inquest heard the usually cheerful and good - natured woman arrived late for work on December 20 , 2005 , telling a colleague she had attended an " amazing " self - development course called Turning Point .
But the colleague , Christine Ernst , said Ms Lawrence later became agitated as she repeatedly tried to phone someone but was unable to get through .
She gazed at her computer screen and appeared to do no work at all , Ms Ernst said .
The phone number she had been trying to dial was later revealed to be the Turning Point office , the inquest was told .
Ms Lawrence 's psychotherapist Helen Mitrofanis - who had completed the same course - told the inquest her client was a shy , anxious person who was a compulsive worrier .
In early December , about one week before she had begun the course , Ms Lawrence told Ms Mitrofanis her life had been pointless and she had feelings of hopelessness .
" She was conflicted about having a child , " Ms Mitrofanis told the inquest .
" I got the impression she wanted to have a child but her husband did not and if she wanted to have a baby the relationship might end . "
The inquest also heard Ms Lawrence had taken part in a Turning Point session on the Saturday before she died which had a component called The Inner Child where participants become extremely " regressed and young - like " .
Her husband David Booth said she returned home in a dream - like state , appeared detached and seemed like somebody on drugs .
An autopsy found she had no alcohol or drugs in her system at the time of her death .
Turning Point , run by Zoeros Life Skills Training in Cremorne , was recommended to Ms Lawrence by a friend who said she felt uneasy after finishing the sessions , Mr Booth said .
Counsel assisting Coroner Malcolm MacPherson , Robert Bromwich , said Ms Lawrence 's death was not a suicide " because she did n't have sufficient presence of mind to take her own life . "
The inquest has heard Ms Lawrence had no psychological issues or personal problems prior to undertaking the course and no traces of alcohol or drugs were found in her body .
Her husband and parents described her as " a shy , modest , gentle and delightful young woman " with no personal problems known to them , Mr Bromwich said .
He said her behaviour changed dramatically after the course , particularly in the last two hours of her life .
" She was aggressive , abusive and foul - mouthed - all out of character , " he said .
" She was modest to the point of being prudish but she took her clothes off twice and was naked when she fell to the ground . "
The court heard Ms Lawrence had wanted to do the course for years , despite being warned by a friend that she would " feel out of balance " for a while after experiencing it .
Her husband , David Booth , said she wanted to " resolve issues in her life " through the course , which promotes itself as " a journey to the core of the human spirit . "
Mr Booth said the night before his wife died , she had been in a " dream - like state ... almost like someone on drugs . "
The inquest before Deputy State Coroner Malcolm MacPherson continues .

El Consejo para la Ley y los Derechos Humanos AC , asegura que en el Sistema de Transporte Colectivo - Metro siguen perpetrándose secuestros exprés , tal y como sucedió el año pasado , y de lo cual hay registro oficial .
Dicha asociación civil indica que operan 11 bandas que cometen este tipo de delitos , sobre todo en Taxqueña , Insurgentes , Chabacano , Pantitlán y Cuatro Caminos , a plenas horas pico .
Esta asociación civil ha registrado 322 casos en 19 meses , y tan sólo
En sólo cuatro meses , del pasado mayo a este septiembre recibió la denuncia de 235 personas .
Sin embargo , el presidente del Consejo Ciudadano de Seguridad Pública y Procuración de Justicia del DF , Meyer Klip , dijo desconocer de un solo caso denunciado este año por esa situación .
“ Nosotros no hemos recibido ninguna denuncia al respecto ; el año pasado sí teníamos esa problemática y recibimos denuncias , pero este año no ” .
Fernando Ruiz , presidente de Consejo para la Ley y los Derechos Humanos , aseguró que pese a que ha pedido a los afectados interponer la denuncia correspondiente , no lo han hecho por desconfianza a las autoridades .
Un caso
Una de esas personas que considera una pérdida de tiempo ir al Ministerio Público , es la doctora Margarita N. Entrevistada vía telefónica , narró que el 25 de agosto , a las 16 horas , estando en los andenes de la estación Insurgentes fue interceptada junto con su hija , de 20 años , por dos sujetos que se acercaron a saludarla , y luego le enseñaron una pistola .
Indica que fueron sacadas del Metro , y asegura que : “ Dos policías vieron lo que nos estaba pasando y no hicieron nada ” .
Los 7 mil pesos que llevaba para la inscripción de su hija a la universidad , 4 mil que la hicieron sacar de un cajero , los teléfonos celulares de ambas y algunas joyas , fue lo que les robaron .
“ Modus operandi ” Resalta que el 14 de abril , la Procuraduría informó que fueron detenidos dos elementos de seguridad del Sistema de Transporte Colectivo Metro : Martín René Ramírez Carapia y Gustavo Álvaro Gómez , de 37 y 35 años de edad , asignados a la estación Candelaria , quienes robaron y privaron de la libertad a un usuario .
El organismo señala que los delincuentes amagan a las víctimas con armas de fuego y las retienen entre 30 y 45 minutos dentro del Metro , en espera de que algún familiar pague el rescate .
For 35 years the federal government has been well aware — yet publicly denied — that cannabis possesses potent anti-cancer and anti-tumor properties .
Even under the Obama administration , which promised to " base [ their ] public policies on the soundest of science , " the myth that pot promotes cancer persists .
In fact , the White House ’s website , whitehousedrugpolicy.gov , presently warns , " Marijuana has the potential to promote cancer of the lungs and other parts of the respiratory tract . "
Or not .
In a clinical abstract published online on journal of Cancer Prevention Research website in July , a team of U.S. investigators reported — with absolutely no mainstream media fanfare — that lifetime marijuana use is associated with a " significantly reduced risk " of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .
Investigators at Rhode Island ’s Brown University , along with researchers at Boston University , Louisiana State University , and the University of Minnesota assessed the lifetime marijuana use habits of 434 cases ( patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from nine medical facilities ) compared to 547 matched controls .
Authors reported , " After adjusting for potential confounders ( including smoking and alcohol drinking ) , 10 to 20 years of marijuana use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNDCC ) . ”
Perhaps even more notably , subjects who smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol and tobacco ( two known high - risk factors for head and neck cancers ) also experienced a reduced risk of cancer , the study found .

" Our study suggests that moderate marijuana use is associated with reduced risk of HNSCC , " investigators concluded .
" This association was consistent across different measures of marijuana use ( marijuana use status , duration , and frequency of use ) .
…
Further , we observed that marijuana use modified the interaction between alcohol and cigarette smoking , resulting in a decreased HNSCC risk among moderate smokers and light drinkers , and attenuated risk among the heaviest smokers and drinkers . "
Of course , this is n’t the first time that U.S. investigators have documented an inverse association between pot use and cancer .
A separate 2006 population case - control study , funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and conducted by the University of California at Los Angeles , also reported that lifetime use of cannabis was not positively associated with cancers of the lung or aerodigestive tract , and further noted that certain moderate users of the drug experienced a reduced cancer risk compared to non-using controls .
Predictably , the federal government ’s goal when green - lighting the UCLA study was to conclusively establish just the opposite result , as explained recently by its lead researcher Dr. Donald Tashkin .
In an interview with the McClatchy newspaper chain in June , Tashkin admitted that he expected his study would find that pot was associated with " increased health effects . "
Instead , he summarized , " What we found instead was no association ( between marijuana smoking and cancer ) and even a suggestion of some protective effect . "
Perhaps that explains why Tashkin ’s study , the largest trial of its kind , is inexplicably absent from the White House ’s website .
Tashkin added , " [ A ] t this point , I ’d be in favor of ( marijuana ) legalization .
I would n’t encourage anybody to smoke any substances .
But I do n’t think it should be stigmatized as an illegal substance .
Tobacco smoking causes far more harm .
And in terms of an intoxicant , alcohol causes far more harm ( than marijuana ) . "
Indeed it does .
In fact , according to the findings of a study published online August 3 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , even moderate alcohol consumption ( defined as six drinks or less per week ) is positively associated with an elevated risk of various cancers — including stomach cancer , rectal cancer , and bladder cancer .
The study is the second to be published this year indicating that those who consume even minor amounts of booze are at increased risk for cancer .
In February , a British study of some 1.3 million women age 50 to 64 reported that imbibing in as little as one alcoholic beverage per day significantly elevated females ’ risk of cancer , particularly breast cancer .

For those of us who have closely studied the physiological effects of pot and alcohol the two substances contrasting association with cancer is n’t surprising .
Ethanol , the psychoactive ingredient in booze , is converted by the body to acetaldehyde , a known carcinogen .
By contrast , the active components in marijuana — known as cannabinoids — are relatively non-toxic and actually mimic chemicals naturally produced by the body ( so - called endocannabinoids ) that are necessary for maintaining one ’s proper health .
Of course , that ’s hardly where the differences between marijuana and alcohol end .
As I write in my new book Marijuana Is Safer : So Why Are We Driving People to Drink ( Chelsea Green Publishing , 2009 ) , alcohol consumption is toxic to cells and healthy organs , can depress the central nervous system ( inducing unconsciousness , coma , and death ) , and is strongly associated with increased risks of injury and acts of violence .
The use of marijuana , on the other hand , is incapable of causing fatal overdose — cannabinoids do not act upon the brain stem — and its use is inversely associated with aggression and injury .
Naturally , none of these differences should imply that America should return to the days of alcohol prohibition .
Rather , they should spark a long - overdue dialogue in this country asking why our laws target and prosecute those adults who choose to make the rational choice to relax with a substance that is objectively safer , both to the user and to society as a whole , than alcohol .
Perhaps when the President finishes his beer , he can provide an answer .
The Best of Paul Armentano
I adopted Madison when I was 24 .
Our family had a history with dogs but Madison was the first I considered " my " dog .
I was living in Chicago at the time .
My brother and I ( mostly my brother ) had just purchased a small multi-unit building in Chicago 's Bucktown neighborhood .
As the landlord , we got to set the pet policy and pets were to be very welcome at our building .
( Despite being pet - friendly , my brother was less than enthusiastic when I decided to adopt a dog of my own .
Today , 11 years later , he cried as much as anybody when we had to say goodbye to Madison . )
Madison had been found on the streets on the southside of Chicago and brought to Animal Welfare League in Chicago Ridge .
My friend Terese went with me to Animal Welfare League on a Sunday afternoon .
We quickly narrowed down our choices to two .
We asked to spend time with both of them .
AWL has you sit in a private room and they bring the dogs to you .
The first dog was a timid German Shepherd mix .
As we were sitting there waiting for the next dog , I could see out the door 's window and remember seeing a red ball of fur ( believed to be a Chow / Golden mix ) that could n't have weighed more than 15 pounds pulling the full - grown shelter volunteer around the corner , feet scampering on the shelter 's concrete floor .
She burst into the room and immediately rolled over on her back in perfect belly rub position .
My heart was stolen .
I told the volunteer I wanted to take that red ball of fur home with me .
She left only to return a short time later with some bad news .
Somebody else had seen the red ball of fur earlier that day and also wanted her .
However , they were teenagers and needed their parents permission .
They had been given 24 hours to obtain it .
I could wait and see what happened or I could choose another dog .
I decided to wait and hope for the best .
I called the next day and got the good news - for me at least : the teenagers ' parents said no and the red ball of fur was mine .
By the time I got down to AWL that evening after work , I was told another family had been waiting just in case I had n't shown up and they were going to take the red ball of fur home .
I remember thinking at the time that maybe , since it was obvious that the red ball of fur was not going to have trouble finding a home , I should let the family have her and I could choose another dog .
Today , I cannot imagine what my life would have been like without my red ball of fur .
At my mother 's suggestion , the red ball of fur was named Madison , after my hometown in Indiana ( which , by the way , is a great place for a small town getaway , especially for fans of 19th - century American history ) .
She was approximately six months old when I adopted her but I brought her home on the same day as my grandmother 's birthday , July 16 , and we always celebrated that day as Madison 's birthday too .
Madison would eventually grow to be nearly 70 pounds .
Children loved her ( some said she looked like a big teddy bear ) but their parents were sometimes intimidated by her size .
She was a gentle soul , however , and loved to lick the faces of small children .
For older children , she was always willing to stop for a quick pet .
Madison was also very much a lady .
She hated to get dirty and would go to great lengths to avoid stepping in water puddles or walking through mud .
In fact , the first time I took her to the neighborhood little league field that doubled as an unofficial dog park , she got some mud on her paw and , much to everybody 's amazement , proceeded to wash it off at the water fountain by sticking her paw under the water stream .
Of course , her insistence on lady - like behavior could be frustrating at times , especially during Chicago 's notorious winters .
She was very particular about where she went to the bathroom and refused to go anywhere where it was wet .
Dry spots are hard to find in the middle of a Chicago winter so we would go on long walks in the freezing cold looking for a bridge overpass or a large bush she could crawl in under .
Madison was very smart and had a great memory .
She knew where every dog in a three - block radius lived and she would get excited and start pulling you a good 1 / 2 block before you got to their house .
She always seemed so disappointed when they were n't home to bark and / or paw at the windows when we passed by .
I remember there was one building around the corner from us that had some dogs living on the third floor .
They would always bark at us .
They must have moved out because the barking stopped but for months afterwards Madison would always stop and stare up at their window , waiting for them to greet her .
I guess eventually she figured out what had happened .
I guess this would be the place to bring up the infamous " Bravo " incident that resulted in Madison going for aggressive dog training but I do n't think we need to go into great detail .
Suffice to say , Madison was a good judge of character and so clearly Bravo must have been a very bad dog .
After two years , she got a brother , Java .
She was a great big sister , very protective of her brother , but always made sure he knew who was in charge .
Here is a picture of the three of us together .
( Java , it turns out , is not a big fan of noise , making my San Diego residence near both the airport and Sea World 's nightly fireworks display a less - than - ideal location , and currently lives with his grandmother in Indiana where he is Chief of Security in charge of her personal protection . )
In 2002 I accepted a voluntary lay - off from a dot - com and decided to take an opportunity to travel and do some volunteer work .
I went to Barcelona for six weeks , traveled throughout Ecuador and Peru for four months , and then spent two weeks volunteering for General Wesley Clark 's presidential campaign in New Hampshire .
When I was in Ecuador and Peru , I lost a lot of weight and developed a deep tan .
When I walked into my Chicago apartment for the first time , Java treated me like an intruder and Madison approached me very cautiously .
However , as soon as I opened my mouth and they recognized my voice , I was given the returning hero 's welcome .
In 2004 , my next career opportunity took me to San Diego .
Given how much she despises the rain , it 's hard to imagine a better location for Madison to live .
She adapted very well .
Although she never did become a big fan of the beach , she did at least become comfortable enough around the ocean to wade out into it .
Still , she always seemed to prefer looking at the water to actually being in it .
I think the only thing that Madison did n't enjoy about San Diego was Jack In the Box .
It did n't have anything to do with their food .
It was the antenna balls they give away and that adorn car antennas throughout So Cal .
After we moved to San Diego , Madison developed the weirdest obsession with car antenna decorations ( balls , flags , ribbons -- anything tied to or placed on a car antenna ) .
She would go absolutely nuts whenever she spotted one -- and she was very , very good at spotting them .
It would sometimes take me a full minute or two to see what she was seeing but when she sounded the alarm I always knew there had to be one somewhere because she was never wrong .
Over the last 18 months that I have been working from home , Madison went with me almost everywhere .
I always dreaded getting stuck at a red light with an antenna ball within sight .
We used to get some very strange and perplexed looks from people trying to figure out why my dog was barking like crazy at them .
I wish dogs could speak so that she could have explained to me what drove her obsession with antenna balls .
Most people assume she liked to chase balls and that 's what got her so excited but she showed no interest whatsoever in any balls except those adorning car antennas .
I do n't wo n't to dwell too much on the end of the story .
You already know the ultimate outcome .
But here 's a quick summary .
A little over a year ago Madison started to lose her fur .
The vet thought it was due to allergies .
It seemed like a strange diagnosis to me because she was 10 years old and had never had allergies before .
They said it was likely that as she was getting older her body was losing its ability to fight off the allergens .
Made sense since my brother 's dog , Liberty , developed allergic reactions at age seven .
Plus , San Diego County is one of the worst places for allergens in the entire country .
Things did n't improve and she developed several new symptoms ( frequent diarrhea , bloody stool , etc ) but everything , I was told , could be the result of allergic reactions .
Eventually we did a full allergy panel test and discovered she was allergic to a number of different foods ( chicken , rice , etc ) and environmental factors ( dust mites , pollen , etc ) and started her on allergy shots .
She showed no signs of improvement but the vet told me to give it more time .
But I grew increasingly concerned about her condition .
Deep down , I knew something more serious was going on with my red ball of fur .
A father can sense these things .
I called the vet and scheduled an appointment for later in the week .
The morning of the appointment she would n't take her pill - as always , wrapped in a dollop of peanut butter .
Turning down peanut butter ?
Very unlike Madison .
This was confirmation something else was going on .
I took her to the vet .
He said there was a hard growth pushing out her liver 1 1/2 inches .
We scheduled an ultrasound for the next day .
He did n't raise false hope .
We both knew it was going to be bad news .
The ultrasound showed a tumor that had already taken over most of her liver , gall bladder and part of her spleen .
The doctor who did the ultrasound said she could n't believe Madison was n't more debilitated considering the size of the tumor .
I was told there was nothing medically we could do for her .
At this point , my only concern was about Madison 's well being and comfort .
The doctors said they did n't know how long she had but it probably was n't long .
I was determined to be strong and make the right decision .
I was going to have to say goodbye to my best friend .
But first there were some other people back in Indiana that needed to say goodbye .
I decided to drive her back to Indiana so my mom , brothers and Java could say goodbye .
I was never comfortable with the idea of putting my dogs in the cargo hold of an airplane and she had made the 2,200 - mile trip from Indiana to San Diego car trip three times before ( moving to San Diego and a round - trip visit in 2008 -- this was the trip upon which Java stayed in Indiana ) .
The three days in the car , while exhausting , were also therapeutic .
This was all happening very quickly and I needed some time to come to grips with it .
Plus , it afforded plenty of petting opportunities .
We arrived in Indiana a week ago and everybody got to spend some quality time with Madison before we had to say goodbye late this afternoon .
It was a very , very sad day .
It was especially hard because she looked relatively healthy on the outside but I knew she was being torn apart on the inside -- as evidenced by her lack of eating and heavy breathing .
In the end , she was surrounded by love ( my mom , two brothers and I ) and we all got to hold her and comfort her as she drifted off into that final permanent nap of eternal peace .
Thank you for reading .
It was very helpful to put all this down in writing .
Anne Lewis , who is legally blind , has been testing the glasses .
Unlike other products she has tried , they work while she is moving .
(( Simon Gardner / CBC ) )
An Ottawa company is developing computerized glasses that help people with severe visual impairments see — as well as zoom in on and replay what they saw with the press of a button .
The company , eSight Corp. , received a $ 500,000 grant from the Ontario government this week to develop its evSpex product as part of a special $ 4.5 million fund to help 10 start - up companies bring products to market .
The device , which resembles a pair of large sunglasses , has a high - resolution camera on the outside and tiny LCD screens on the inside that project images to the wearer 's eyes .
Before the image is projected , it 's custom - processed by a tiny computer , said company president Rob Hilkes .
" So that when it 's presented to a person who has diseased eyes … it 's presented to the pieces of their vision that are most functional , " he added .
Réjean Munger , a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute who helped develop the glasses , said that can help people with a variety of diseases .
" We can take advantage of every bit of vision they have , " he said .
The company hopes to start commercial production next year .
Sister of company chairman inspiration for glasses
The glasses have a camera in the front and LCD screens on the inside that transmit images to the eyes .
They are customized to maximize a user 's remaining vision .
( ( Simon Gardner / CBC ) )
Anne Lewis , who is legally blind as a result of Stargardt 's disease , has been testing the prototype and is very excited about it .
" I see this product as a gift ; I truly do , " she said at the news conference announcing the funding .
Lewis is the sister of Conrad Lewis , eSight 's chairman and one of the company 's founders , and her disability was the inspiration for the glasses .
Stardgardt 's disease is a form of macular degeneration that has destroyed Anne Lewis 's sight except for her peripheral vision .
" It 's like looking at a bubble and the inside of the bubble is black , the outside is clear , " she said .
Lewis said using the glasses will allow her to read body language in meetings at work , stand on her deck and see flowers blooming , navigate shopping malls and flag down the right bus .
Unlike other products she has tried , it works even while she is moving .
The product is expected to be able to help people with age - related macular degeneration , diabetic retinopathy , glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa .
Users can record , zoom
Because the device is essentially recording a loop of video at all times , it will include special functions that people with normal vision do n't have .
For example , the user can save the last 10 seconds of what they saw at the press of a button so they can have another look at something that went by too quickly .
The video can also be viewed later on a DVD player or computer .
In addition , they could zoom in on certain things in their field of view .
Hilkes said the features are available because the " inherent guts " of the device are a computer .
" Once you pack a lot of electronics into a system like this , then creative people start to think of all kinds of ways that you could use it , " he said .
In the future , the company hopes to market the technology to people with normal vision as wearable binoculars , night vision goggles or video gaming devices .
Under pressure from civil rights organizations , Rappahannock Regional Jail officials stated they would stop censoring religious material in letters to inmates .
The change in policy comes after The Becket Fund and other civil rights organizations protested the censorship of correspondence from a Christian mother to her son .
One 3 - page letter she sent was censored down to nothing but the salutation , first paragraph , and “ Love , Mom . ”
“ The Bible is n’t pornography and should n’t be treated like it , ” said Eric Rassbach , National Litigation Director at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty , which signed the letter .
“ Would n’t it be great if every level of government – local , state , and federal – stopped acting as if the Bible and other religious books are dangerous contraband and instead acknowledged faith ’s role in our society ? ”
Prison authorities can legitimately censor writings that affect prison security , but the courts have ruled that inmates must be given access to religious materials .
The letter that prompted today ’s change stated that officials at Rappahannock were violating the First Amendment and federal civil rights laws , in particular the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act ( RLUIPA ) of 2000 .
Section 3 of the Act provides that no government may arbitrarily prohibit a prisoner from engaging in religious worship or communication .
“ Every prison official in the country should make themselves familiar with the First Amendment and the prisoner religious freedoms granted under RLUIPA , ” added Rassbach .

The biggest flaw in Overlord 2 , I find , is that it goes about things assuming that we already care .
Why take over the world ?
Why keep mistresses in your doom fortress ?
Why resurrect specific dead imps ?
Because you care .
And you care because we say you care .
This is another thing the game has in common with the Fable series .
At GDC 2008 I attended Peter Molyneux 's presentation of Fable 2 , and he told a story about how some players would acquire a wife and family , starve them half to death , then stand in front of them eating all the food .
He attributed it to the players ' poor moral character .
Personally I 'd say it 's more to do with players trying to squeeze some kind of value out of the whole business , even if it 's just a weak and momentary schadenfreude .
I feel the designers of this sort of thing are making two errors .
Firstly , they assume that a player 's real - life emotions and desires carry over to their in - game avatar , and they do n't .
When you enter a game , you enter an unfamiliar world with a new set of rules , and so you adopt a blank personality .
Besides the default desire to simply reach the end of the story and have some fun along the way , all of the player 's motivations have to be gradually built up from scratch .
And at that stage the carrot motivates a lot better than the stick .
So a romance sidequest works when there is some benefit to gameplay .
That 's the carrot .
You can marry characters in most of the Harvest Moon games , and your spouse provides you with items or assists you with the farming .
Japanese dating sims function on the basis that if you pull the right moves you get rewarded with a picture of your character motorboating some juicy titties .
But in Fable and Overlord , having a wife or mistress has no gameplay benefit , and actually puts you out .
That 's stick territory right there .
The game instructs you to pay them support and keep them happy with frequent presents and PG - 13 blacked - out bunk - ups .
Or maybe I could stab them in the throat and fuck the wounds , how about that , game ?
How about you shove that particular stick up your arse so I can concentrate on gathering my carrots ?
The other mistake being made here , and it's a fairly common one made by games , is that you can't just tell us that we care about something .
Unlike Fable , Overlord 2 does n't even give you the luxury of choosing your mistress - the game pretty much just says " Here 's this chick .
You love her now . "
I 'm reminded of the DRAMATIC PLOT TWIST in Dead Space that 's presented as a big personal tragedy , but your character to this point has been a personality - less hulk behind a faceless helmet , and his farcically grief - stricken body language was about as emotive as just flashing up a subtitle saying " YOU ARE VERY SAD NOW . "
Like I said , the player is a blank slate whose cares need to be built up over time .
You can't pull our heartstrings by piling tragedy onto empty characters , especially not ones that irritate our nipples off .
( Alone in the Dark , I 'm thinking of you . )
I find the easiest way to make me care about a character is , again , make them useful to gameplay .
Like Alyx from Half - Life 2 , or your horse from Shadow of the Colossus , both of whom I could see myself cuddling up to at night .
And I can care about characters who are central to the story , like Farah from Prince of Persia : Sands of Time , who are established over time as relatably human and loveable .
So , if you 're making a game with a story , bear this in mind .
And for the record , ' LOVEABLE ' MEANS MORE THAN JUST CRACKING WISE ALL THE TIME LIKE A SMUG LITTLE BITCH FROM A JOSS WHEDON SHOW AARGH .
INCIDENTALLY ( #1 ) :
Ghostbusters actually got better later when it stopped doing the nudge - wink fan - wank thing and brought in new locations and concepts , like the alternate New York and the spider boss .
But then I got to the cemetery level and the action became almost unplayably chaotic .
Oh well !
Also , on reflection , when I said the characters have been boiled down to smug wanky one - joke shallow dipshits ( I'm paraphrasing obviously ) , I was mainly referring to Venkman .
He needs to shut up .
Shut up , Venkman .
INCIDENTALLY ( # 2 ) :
Do n't expect a full review but Guitar Hero : Greatest
Hits has been helping me relive some fond memories of late .
Something bothers me , though .
Am I just being sexually repressed again , or could " Hit Me With Your Best Shot " by Pat Benatar secretly be a dirty song about cumshots ?

For as long as people have traveled the globe , they ’ve done so carrying stereotypes tucked neatly away along side their other baggage .
Despite your best intentions , sometimes it ’s difficult to check these preconceptions at the gate .
Occasionally , such a stereotype may be based on a partial truth .
These scenarios make it even more challenging to remain unbiased .
In my virtual travels , this has always been the case with the Asian market for online games .
You may think that Ireland is filled with hapless drunks , or that Jamaicans are all ganja smoking Rastafarian – I think that China and South Korea churn out a dozen new MMORPG ’s a week , greatly favoring quantity over quality .
This past week marked the last stage of beta testing for NCSoft ’s new entry into this crowded space : Aion : The Tower of Eternity .
Having launched in South Korea nearly a year prior , Aion is now taking aim at the western market .
With equal amounts of flash and polish , does Aion really break new ground , or is it just more of the same ?
The path you take into the world of Atreia is pretty routine .
After selecting which server you wish to create a new avatar on , you ’re asked to pick a faction .
The factions in Aion follow a pretty common formula ; one faction is light , and one is dark .
Unlike many modern MMORPG ’s , the faction you ’re aligned with is mostly a matter of aesthetics .
Both factions have the same basic and advanced classes , so your choice mainly decides how you look , and on which end of a shattered world you wish to reside .
If you feel like you ’ve done this all before – do n’t worry – you probably have .
Once you decide on your server and faction , it ’s time to design your toon .
You can chose between four starting classes at this point in your career : a warrior , a scout , a priest or a mage .
These ultimately branch off into eight more advanced professions .
Warriors can become gladiators or templars ; scouts can advance as rangers or assassins ; priests graduate into chanters or clerics ; and mages ascend as sorcerers and spiritmasters .
The intricacies of each advanced class could fill their own wiki , so it would be wise to do a little research before diving headfirst into any position .
With your class and sex established , it ’s time to decide on your appearance .
The character customization , like much of the Aion experience , is medley of good and bad .
The fundamental elements of your toon ’s appearance will be the same regardless of your faction .
There are a reasonable number of body types and features to take in , and beyond those basic options , you ’re given a great deal of freedom in your physical proportions .
While the latter may add a little diversity to Atreia ’s population , it regrettably results in some rather hideous designs .
You can just as easily create a beautiful avatar , but some players opt for super - deformed toons .
The world of Aion is populated with an unhealthy mix of beautiful avatars and genetic freaks .
For my journey through the open beta event , I chose to create an “ Asmodian ” scout named “ Killandra . ” I chose the Asmodian ( dark ) faction so I could start in the same area as my friends , but given the opportunity I would have opted for the alternative .
The Asmodians are ugly creatures .
While the details of their appearance are mostly identical to their rivals ( the Elyos ) , they have a few unique characteristics that you wo n’t find on the catwalk anytime soon .
It ’s especially difficult to make an attractive female avatar when they have hooves for feet and long flowing hair on their backs .
Despite my apprehension , “ Killandra ” was ready to explore her new world .
As an Asmodian , you begin your quest as a mortal on the island of “ Ishalgen . ”
While Aion features a sort of pop up as you play tutorial , this area will be your home for your toon ’s first ten levels .
Aion ’s world is literally divided in two , having been physically split down the middle by a previous catastrophy .
The world of Atreia was protected by divine forces , but the cataclysm that fractured the planet ’s surface also divided its population .
The two factions continued to evolve down separate paths , which altered their appearance based largely on their environments .
The divine forces at play seem to have diverged on separate paths as well , and it ’s the goal of every inhabitant of Atreia to ascend to a higher level of existence .
While this all plays directly into the games rather convoluted plot , it also has a more practical effect .
Once you ’re ready to ascend , you can leave this area and travel to your faction ’s main city , where you ’re granted with your advanced profession – and a pair of wings .
Flight marks one of the more unique aspects
Aion ’s gameplay , but it ’s not without compromise .
You ca n’t freely coast through every area , but there are zones which are partially open to free flight , and you can still glide through other areas given enough height to get off the ground .
While Aion ’s advanced movement did n’t weigh heavily upon my experience in the beta , I ’ve heard that it shines in the later stages of “ PvPvE ” ( Player versus Player versus Environment ) combat .
Aion ’s “ endgame ” faces players off against one another ( as well as NPC’s ) in an area known as the Abyss , where guilds compete for control and influence .
Having not experienced Aion ’s PvPvE zone , I can only hope that it adds more variety to what can often be a routine experience .
Many of Aion ’s mechanics are very traditional , but while it does n’t often venture into new territory , it does conventional things mostly well .
Combat is your typical timed affair , but offers a little action and diversity through skill chains .
As you learn new skills , some will form a chain .
When the first skill from a chain connects , it opens up the next , allowing you to unleash a combo of attacks on your enemy .
Other MMORPG mainstays , such as gathering , crafting and trading , are also competently executed .
Ultimately ( and quite unfortunately ) the traditional nature of Aion also marks some of its biggest faults .
For every thing it does well , there ’s a classic genre pitfall waiting to bring it down .
For every exciting moment of gameplay , there ’s a time - sink waiting around the bend , and you ’ll be waiting for quest items and mobs to respawn as you compete with other players to complete identical missions .
The games direction , from music , to art , to gameplay is a bit of a sensory overload .
I only wish that every bit of this assault was successful .
The graphics are lush and detailed , but every surprising detail is packed along side some equally surprising flaw .
The low tech lighting and shader treatment are n’t especially shocking , but some of the games muddy , low resolution textures are .
The music is similarly awesome and awful – orchestral scores giving way to grating rock guitar riffs in combat .
For all of the ways that Aion assaults the senses , it ’s a little unfortunate that it ca n’t do so with some measure of consistency .
Aion may be gearing up for its western release , but it ’s hardly a game that has followed western trends .
This game follows a pretty standard formula , and while it does add a few new twists , it ’s very oldschool .
If I felt like being more critical , I might even call it archaic , but it ’s important to note where Aion succeeds as well .
There ’s something oddly appealing about all of this , and it even managed to draw me in .
One thing is certain though :
This is not a casual experience .
Aion has been crafted from the ground up for the genres more dedicated followers , who are ironically the genres least demanding demographic .
If you ’re looking for an easy going MMO adventure , this is probably not your game .
Hardcore MMO junkies – welcome home !
I still do n’t know why AT&T and Apple do n’t enable Internet Tethering by default on the iPhone , but nonetheless they do n’t … but you can enable it yourself with a little work !
The simplest way I ’ve found without Jailbreaking your iPhone requires a few settings changes from updating a system profile , which you can download from BenM.at , just visit the page from your iPhone .
After you install the adjusted profile , Internet Tethering will be enabled , easy huh ?
This definitely works , but it does have the strange effect of disabling Visual Voicemail … now supposedly if you have AT&T then this configuration profile fixes that problem , but I have n’t tried it myself , so your mileage may vary and proceed at your own risk ( remember to visit that link from your iPhone ) .
Basically after you install that profile and double - check the setting exists , have your iPhone hooked up to your Mac ( or PC? untested ) and the rest is pretty much setup for you , your Mac should pull DHCP settings from AT&T and suddenly you ’re using the AT&T data network from your Mac via your iPhone !
Sweet !
So again here ’s the breakdown , visit these links and install the profiles from your iPhone :
Internet Tethering +
Visual voicemail profile – AT&T only !
– untested personally , but supposedly works
Internet Tethering but disabled visual voicemail – worked for me , YMMV though
If you run into any problems , simply go to Settings > General >
Profiles and delete the profile and things should be back to normal .
Remember to proceed at your own risk !
I have no idea if AT&T will start charging you different rates or if this voids your warranty , but like any hack , it ’s best to proceed with caution and expect some disapproval from AT&T and Apple .
Hopefully Apple and AT&T will soon enable this feature by default and wo n’t charge anymore for it .
Gary Reinbach developed cirrhosis of the liver
A man from east London who began binge - drinking at 13 has died after being denied a life - saving liver transplant .
Gary Reinbach , 22 , from Dagenham , was given only a few weeks to live after developing cirrhosis of the liver .
He was admitted to University College Hospital London ( UCL ) with alcohol damage for the first time 10 weeks ago .
But health chiefs ruled he should not be exempt from strict organ donation criteria which require an alcohol - free period of at least six months .
Mr Reinbach , who died on Sunday , was too ill to be sent home after his admission to hospital .
Teenage drinking
A statement from NHS Blood and Transplant said : " This case highlights the dilemma doctors face because of the shortage of donated organs .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" They have to make tough decisions about who is going to get the benefit and who is going to take best care of this precious gift . "
Campaign group Alcohol Concern called for more research into the way alcohol can affect young people 's health .
The group said it was worried that a rise in teenage drinking would lead to more people suffering alcohol - related illnesses at younger ages .
Speaking about Mr Reinbach 's case , a spokeswoman said : " This does n't surprise us at all , sadly .
" Statistics show that more people are getting liver disease in their 30s and , if more teenagers are drinking , people will become seriously ill at a younger age . "
A UCL spokeswoman said they extended their sympathies to the family at this " difficult time " .

Journalist Besan Sheikh recently visited the Guantanamo Bay prison facility run by the US , where al - Qaeda and other prisoners from Bush ’s ‘ war on terror ’ are held .
( Many of the prisoners appear to have been sold by the Taliban or swept up indiscriminately in the vicinity of a battlefield ) .
Sheikh told the pan-Arab London daily , al - Hayat [ Life ] , that the facility ’s library now has 13,500 books .
What are the three most requested titles by the remaining 229 prisoners ?
1. The Harry Potter novels
2. Cervantes ’ Don Quixote
3. Barack obama ’s Dreams from my Father .
No reason was given for these choices , which are followed in popularity by Muslim religious volumes .
( Though see this In these Times 2007 article about reading Harry Potter at Guantanamo . )
Do they think Guantanamo is a little like Hogwarts Academy and that their torturers were Lord Voldemort ?
Do they know that Miguel Cervantes fought at the second Battle of Lepanto in 1571 in which the Holy League defeated the Ottoman empire at sea , and that later on his ship was captured by the Algerians and he spent 5 years imprisoned and enslaved in Algiers before being ransomed– thus reversing an element in their own biographies ?
They are said to be fascinated that the new president of the United States has African and Muslim roots .
Although the prisoners receive newspapers , all violent incidents are torn out of them , so they know nothing of the Huthi revolt in Yemen , e.g .
I ’m still thinking about the idea of John Yoo as Voldemort .

Nitrous oxide , commonly known as laughing gas , is now the dominant ozone - depleting substance emitted by humans – and is likely to remain so throughout the century , a new study suggests .
Researchers suggest use of the compound – which is produced by the breakdown of nitrogen in fertilisers and sewage treatment plants – should be reduced to avoid thinning the protective ozone layer that blankets the Earth .
The ozone layer shields Earth from the sun ’s ultraviolet rays , which increase the risk of cancer and threaten crops and aquatic life .
Human - produced chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) made headlines in the 1980s when it became clear they were eating a hole in the ozone layer above Earth ’s polar regions .
An international treaty called the Montreal Protocol regulated production of CFCs and certain other ozone - depleting gases in 1987 , and they were phased out completely by 1996 .

Since then , Earth ’s ozone – both the polar hole and the atmospheric layer around the whole planet – has been on the mend .
But the emission of nitrous oxide , which is not regulated by the Montreal Protocol , could reverse those gains – and could even make the situation worse .
“ Right now , nitrous oxide is the most important ozone - depleting gas that is emitted , ” says A. R. Ravishankara of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , lead author of the new research .
“ It will continue to be so unless something is done . ”
Greenhouse gas
Nitrous oxide is also a heat - trapping greenhouse gas in the league of methane or carbon dioxide , so regulating it would also be good for the climate , he says .
Nitrous oxide ( N 2 O ) is produced naturally when nitrogen in soil or water is eaten by bacteria .
It rises into the stratosphere , where most of it is broken down into harmless molecules of nitrogen and oxygen by the sun ’s rays .
But some of it remains , and can survive for hundreds of years .
The compound reacts with high - energy oxygen atoms to produce a deadlier compound , nitric oxide ( NO ) .
This then goes on to destroy ozone , a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms .
Nitrous oxide has no effect on the hole in the ozone layer , Ravishankara points out , but it makes the global layer thinner .
Abundant gas
This chemical process has been known since the 1970s , when scientists were worried about the environmental effects of flying supersonic planes , which emit ozone - depleting nitrogen oxides .
Ravishankara and his colleagues are the first to put hard numbers on the role of nitrous oxide in ozone depletion .
To do so , they modelled the atmosphere and the chemical reactions that take place inside it .
They found that nitrous oxide ’s potential to deplete ozone is comparable to other ozone - depleting substances , called hydroCFCs , that replaced CFCs but are also in the process of being phased out .
But although the depletion potential is roughly equivalent , nitrous oxide could have a more damaging effect because it is much more abundant .
Global human emissions of N 2 O are roughly 10 million tonnes per year , compared to slightly more than 1 million tonnes from all CFCs at the peak of their emissions .
On the rise
Scientists say humans ’ role in producing the harmful gas has largely been overlooked .
Thanks to fossil fuel combustion , which produces the gas , as well as nitrogen - based fertilisers , sewage treatment plants and other industrial processes that involve nitrogen , about one - third of the nitrous oxide emitted per year is anthropogenic .
Although supersonic transport never took off , current N 2 O emissions destroy as much ozone as flying 500 such planes a day .
Emission levels have increased by 0.25 per cent a year since pre-industrial times .
“ Nitrous oxide is kind of the forgotten gas , ” says Don Wuebbles of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , who invented the method of quantifying a chemical ’s ozone - depletion potential but was not involved in this work .
“ It was always thought of as a natural thing .
People have forgotten that it ’s been increasing . ”
And as CFC levels abate , nitrous oxide could become even more powerful .
Nitrogen and chlorine compounds counteract each others ’ effects on ozone – the more chlorine there is , the less effective nitrogen becomes at destroying ozone , and vice versa .
As CFCs are purged from the atmosphere , nitrous oxide will become 50 per cent more potent than it was before , Ravishankara says .
“ People were expecting that ozone was just going to recover from the results of human activities that resulted in CFCs , ” Wuebbles says .
“ Nitrous oxide could prevent that from happening . ”

import pkg_resources

Better grouping for projects / community / companies
Better name for packages and do n't worry about a name conflict Re-use package name in different namespaces Easy distribution as eggs
Zope project and the community in general use lots of namespacespackages .
Though , we have some non-namespace packages likeZODB3 , ZConfig etc .
Zope community has created many namespacesfor packages like `zope` , `zope.app` , `zc` , `z3 c` , `lovely` etc.
Here`zc` stands for Zope Corporation , `z3 c` for Zope 3 Community andlovely for Lovely Systems ' packages .
Python is a language with namespace support at many levels .
Remember , the last line of Zen of Python reads like this : " Namespacesare one honking great idea -- let 's do more of those !
" Take it positively , do n't interpret it more ;) A namespace package will not have any method , class or any otherobjects defined in that level .
So a normal namespace package will beonly having an empty `__init__. py` file .
Eggs and setuptools providessome new advantages for the distribution of namespace packages .
So , normally a namespace package 's `__init__.py` file will containsomething like this :
That 's all you required to put in your namespace package ' s`__init__.
py` file .
But you also will be required to add one morekeyword argument for `setup` function in your `setup .
py` script likethis :
You can even have nested namespace packages , in that case you have toadd it like this :
Remember , Zen of Python also says : " Flat is better than nested . " .
Even though Zope use `zope.app` nested namespace package , Zopecommunity discourage nested namespace packages .
The `zope .app`namespace may be consider as a mistake of Zope project .
The `zope` and `zope.app` were the first namespace packages used byZope .
I still remember the appraisal I got from Jim Fulton afterimplementing his proposal for making `zope.app` a pure namespacepackage .
Here I will list some advantages of namespace packages .
Feel free toadd / explain anything you found . :) I think the last point requires bit explanation .
Consider twopackages in same namespace , `zope.interface` and `zope.testbrowser` .
In Python , package name is tied to directory structure .
So , in normaldistutils based distribution both `interface` and `testbrowser` shouldbe under `zope` directory .
But setuptools and eggs allows you toinstall both separately and still use both .
Let 's save some names for new generation smart Python programmers !
Do n't pollute top - level names , use namespace packages !!

Say goodbye to the paper paycheck .
More and more companies are now forcing their employees to switch over to direct deposit or some other type of electronic payment as part of a larger cost - cutting effort .
The latest company to make such a switch is Wal - Mart .
The nation 's largest employer will now pay workers via a debit card if they decline to sign up for direct deposit .
And it 's not just paychecks that are disappearing .
Some major airlines are now only accepting credit and debit cards for purchase of meals or headphones on planes .
And many states are now providing welfare and food stamp benefits only through direct deposit and debit cards .
" It 's definitely part of a growing trend toward doing away with paper paychecks .
That 's true with some employers as well as government benefits that used to be given out with checks , " said Gerri Detweiler , a personal finance author and credit advisor at Credit.com .
Wal - Mart would not say how much money it would save with the switch , but the world 's largest retailer said that by eliminating checks in the United States it plans to save 257,572 pounds of paper a year .
Wal - Mart has more than 1.4 million employees in the United States and roughly half of them have not signed up for direct deposit , according to company spokeswoman Daphne Moore .
The debt cards are being phased in over the next few months .
The cards will make it more convenient to workers who now have to come into their stores to pick up paychecks , Moore said .
It also falls in line with the company 's goal to " eliminate waste wherever we can , " she said .
Wal - Mart has , for instance , is asking its suppliers to start using less packaging .
Some employees avoid direct deposit because they like getting a physical check .
But others simply do n't have a bank account .
An estimated 10 to 25 percent of Americans do not have a bank account , according to a 2007 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston .
These so - called " unbanked " Americans resort to check - cashing businesses and grocery and convenience stores to convert their checks into cash .
The unbanked , according to the Fed report , have lower incomes , less education , are younger , more likely to reside in urban areas , and disproportionately nonwhite compared to those who have bank accounts .
These consumers typically do n't trust banks or think they are afraid of the perceived cost of bank accounts , such as monthly fees , minimum balance requirements and possible overdraft charges .
But not having a bank account also has its costs .
The fee check - cashing businesses charge to cash personal checks can be as high as 10 percent of face value while government or payroll checks cost up to 1.5 percent of face value , according to the Fed .
" One of the big concerns with these pre-paid cards is that the fees can really add up very quickly , " Detweiler said .
" It is true that these employees were probably paying check cashing fees but at the same time employees want to make sure they do n't see their pay check nickel and dimed away with fees that may be associated with using these cards . "
Wal - Mart employees will be able to use the cards anywhere that accepts MasterCard and also be able to get cash from ATMs .
There would be no fee from Wal - Mart or MasterCard – who is providing the cards – for the first ATM withdrawal in a pay period .
( Banks could charge their own fees for using their ATMs . )
After that first withdrawal , each additional one would be $ 2 .
Employees can also purchase something at Wal - Mart or Sam 's club stores and get cash - back above their purchase without any fees .
Workers can also get checks to pay people who do n't accept debit cards .
Detweiler said for some people it is harder to track their spending with a debit card .
" It adds a layer between you and your money , " she said .
But if " you lose cash , it 's gone . "
With a debit card , if you register it , you can usually get the full balance restored .
Michael W. Brandl , an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin 's McCombs School of Business , questions if this will lead employees to save less .
He said it would be " much easier just to spend it , as opposed to going to the bank , cashing the check and putting $ 20 into the ' rainy day ' fund or jar . "
Brandl also said that debit card use provides a large paper trail .
" Who gets access to it and what are they going to with you ? " he said .
" Banks know a frightening amount about you . "
Many companies are now doing credit checks before hiring new employees .
The theory is : if you can't handle your own personal finances , why should we let you handle our company 's money .
" Can Wal - Mart then take this to the next logical step and see how people are using this debit card ? "
Brandl asked .
Will the company notice that you paid a therapist for a session or that he might be stopping by your local liquor store every night ?
Wal - Mart 's Moore said that would not be the case , saying that the program is " administered by MasterCard and First Data and we wo n't have the ability to see that information . "
Mark A. Calabria , director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute , said that such a move by Wal - Mart will ultimately be a convenience for workers .
" This is clearly something that will save the stores themselves money .
It 's ambiguous to say whether it 's going to be necessarily a bad thing for employees .
I can see lots of reasons why it would be a positive for them , " he said .
" There are more protections on the card than there is on cash , there are incentives now to go out and set up a bank account but on the other hand I certainly understand people 's concerns about fees . "
But he noted , those fees are probably less than workers are now paying at check cashing businesses .
He said some people might not have bank accounts because their " immigration status is questionable " but said that is one extreme and a small number of the country 's unbanked .
" I think a lot of people just never get around to thinking that the bank is going to work for them , " Calabria said .
" I think there is some skepticism about setting up an account , if you actually need one . "
Oct. 13 , 2003 -- Smoking marijuana makes sperm less fertile -- even if the woman is the one who smokes it , a new study shows .
Marijuana - smoking college men volunteered for the study led by Lani J. Burkman , PhD , director of andrology at the University of Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences .
The smokers were n't the only ones who got high .
The drug affected their sperm , too .
These stoned sperm party hard .
And then ?
They burn out , researchers say .
" Marijuana - smoking men 's sperm are hyper .
They are way out there , " Burkman tells WebMD .
" They already have begun the vigorous swimming called hyperactivation .
Sperm should be quiet at first .
They should be waiting to be washed into cervix and approach the egg before they start hyperactivation . "
So the little guys are fast out of the gate , right ?
What 's wrong with a little head start ?
" It is not a head start .
They are going to blow it , " Burkman says .
" They 're too fast , too early .
Each individual sperm can maintain this swimming only so long , only several hours .
Then it poops out .
If it has run out of hyperactivation before it gets close to the egg , it will not fertilize .
These sperm are going to burn out . "
Burkman announced the findings at this week 's meeting of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine .
This picture of Mr Lace was taken when he was about 15 years old Police have named the man they say was " responsible " for the murder and rape of a woman in 1979 .
Detectives have revealed the DNA of David Lace , 26 , whose remains were exhumed last month , matched that of the suspected killer of Teresa De Simone .
The 22 - year - old victim was found in her car at the pub in Southampton where she worked part - time , in December 1979 .
Sean Hodgson , 58 , of County Durham , spent 27 years in jail for the murder before his conviction was quashed .
Mr Lace , whose natural parents are both dead , was originally from Portsmouth and , at the time of the murder , he was 17 and living in the city .
He was born with the surname Williams , later taking the adopted name Lace .

He took his own life in December 1988 when he was living in Brixham , Devon .
He did not feature in the original police investigation and was not thought to have had prior links to Miss De Simone .
He made admissions to the murder in 1983 following Mr Hodgson 's conviction at Winchester Crown Court some 18 months earlier .
In a statement his family said : " We have been left shocked and saddened at the latest news that David has been shown to have been responsible for such a terrible crime .
" We very much wish to extend our sympathies and condolences to Teresa De Simone 's family at what must be a very difficult time for them . "
The Ministry of Justice gave permission for Mr Lace 's body to be exhumed from Kingston Cemetery , Portsmouth , after new DNA samples taken from his siblings indicated he was the prime suspect in the case .
Teresa De Simone 's mother said she was a " happy girl , but shy " Det Ch Insp Philip McTavish , of Hampshire police , said : " We are satisfied we have identified the man responsible for the murder and rape of Teresa De Simone and we are not seeking any other person .
" We are not linking David Lace to any other undetected serious crimes . "
Hampshire police have voluntarily referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
Det Ch Insp McTavish said officers looked into Mr Lace 's confession at the time and decided it revealed " numerous and significant inconsistencies " .
They included an incorrect description of the car 's colour and number of doors , incorrect timings and incorrect descriptions of Miss De Simone 's clothing and watch .
His description of the violence used was also inconsistent with the victim 's injuries .
Seven confessions
The handbag Lace had concealed was never found , Det Ch Insp McTavish added .
He said seven men , including Mr Lace and Mr Hodgson , had confessed to the crime but added that very limited and original paperwork was available .
" We are not aware of the full content of these confessions or indeed the full rationale for the exclusion of these men from further consideration , " he said .
The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) confirmed it would have enough evidence to charge Mr Lace if he was still alive .
Alastair Nisbet , senior crown prosecutor for Hampshire & Isle of Wight , said : " But this is in no sense a declaration that he was guilty of the offences .

" Had Mr Lace lived , our decision would merely have authorised the police to begin the legal process by charging him . "
Miss De Simone 's partially - clothed body was found in the back seat of her Ford Escort in a car park beneath the Tom Tackle pub , where she worked behind the bar part - time .
Her main job was as a clerk for the gas board .
Her mother Mary Sedotti , 77 , said the naming of the suspect would give some closure on the matter .
" It is a relief to get it all done , " she said .
" Hopefully , we can all start to move on now .
" In a way it 's hard knowing that he is not here to answer or explain .
But then , at the same time , I think that what he did shows he must have had a conscience . "
Mr Hodgson confessed at the time of the original inquiry to killing Miss De Simone .
But he pleaded not guilty at his 1982 trial at Winchester Crown Court , where his defence team said he was a pathological liar .
After Mr Hodgson 's conviction was quashed at the Court of Appeal in March this year , police carried out DNA screening of more than 100 people .
Hampshire police said it was one of the rare times the suspect in a historic murder inquiry had been exhumed in the UK .

A Phoenix woman was charged in connection with the death of a man whose body was found burning and mutilated in a garbage bin earlier this month , police announced Wednesday .
Homicide investigators were �shocked at the casualness � with which Angela Simpson , 33 , apparently confessed Tuesday to the killing that left 46 - year - old Terry Neely 's body so badly charred that police initially could not even determine his gender , according to Phoenix police Lt. Joe Knott .
Simpson reportedly said she 'd tell investigators everything in exchange for a candy bar , Knott said .
Firefighters found Neely 's body , which was later identified by fingerprint , burning in a trash bin behind Covenant Grace Christian Fellowship Church on Aug. 5 , Phoenix police spokesman Luis Samudio said .
Neely 's motorized wheelchair was recovered a short distance away a few days later , Knott said .
Beyond video surveillance that showed Neely leaving the Phoenix assisted - living facility , where he lived three days earlier , details surrounding the crime were limited , Samudio said .
Police turned to the community , canvassing the area with fliers , which produced several leads , he said .
One of those leads directed investigators to a vacant apartment in the 9600 block of North 12th Avenue , according to Simpson 's arrest statement .
With the apartment manager 's permission , detectives looked around and found bloodstains on the bathroom door , bedroom wall , and along the rails of a crib , the statement said .
The carpet had been removed .
After detectives obtained a search warrant , they were able to verify that the blood belonged to Neely , Knott said .
Another lead pointed detectives to a man and a woman who apparently frequented that apartment , both of whom were suspects in a previous armed robbery , he said .
The woman , Simpson , was already in jail , where she was being held on charges related to the robbery two days after Neely 's body was found , Knott said .
The man was arrested Monday on charges related to the armed robbery .
He was interviewed along with Simpson on Tuesday and is currently being treated as an investigative lead .
Knott said Simpson blatantly confessed to killing Neely , nonchalantly describing the crime in �very specific� detail and including elements �only the murderer would know . �
Neely had been stabbed about 50 times , beaten , �crudely � dismembered , strangled , and had a 3 - inch nail hammered into his head before being set on fire , police said .
Knott said investigators believe he was �alive for a good part of it .�
Knott said he had seen several cases where bodies were mutilated over his 28 years of investigative work , but none had been maimed to the extent of Neely's .
Simpson was �adamant� that she had done it all by herself , according to her arrest statement .
The murder was not random , Knott said .
In one of several interviews with police , the manager of the apartment told police Simpson believed Neely was a �snitch � and was working with prosecutors , though Knott would not confirm the claim .
According to Simpson 's arrest statement , the manager also said he saw a green City of Phoenix trash can in the apartment Simpson visited , which matches the description of the bin in which Neely was found .
The manager also said Simpson asked to borrow his car shortly before confessing to him that she had �killed the guy in the wheelchair , � the statement said .
Video surveillance at a nearby elementary school captured a car matching that description traveling by with something large sticking out of the trunk , the statement said .
The video was from the day Neely 's body was found .
Though investigators are �not absolutely certain ( Simpson ) is the only person involved � in the murder , they are �confident that most of the heinous act was committed by her , � Knott said .
Knott believes Simpson would �pose a significant risk to society � out of confinement .
Police will continue to conduct interviews related to the case as investigation is ongoing .

U.S. citizens wrongly detained , deported by ICE Immigration Law
56786 Hector Veloz , at his aunt 's home in San Marcos , California on Friday , May 29 , 2009 .
By JOSHUA GATES WEISBERG / SPECIAL TO THE CHRONICLE 56786 Hector Veloz , at his aunt 's home in San Marcos , California on Friday , May 29 , 2009 .

The son of a decorated Vietnam veteran , Hector Veloz is a U.S. citizen , but in 2007 immigration officials mistook him for an illegal immigrant and locked him in an Arizona prison for 13 months .
Veloz had to prove his citizenship from behind bars .
An aunt helped him track down his father 's birth certificate and his own , his parents ' marriage certificate , his father 's school , military and Social Security records .
After nine months , a judge determined that he was a citizen , but immigration authorities appealed the decision .
He was detained for five more months before he found legal help and a judge ordered his case dropped .
" It was a nightmare , " said Veloz , 37 , a Los Angeles air conditioning installer .
Veloz is one of hundreds of U.S. citizens who have landed in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and struggled to prove they do n't belong there , according to advocacy groups and legal scholars , who have tracked such cases around the country .
Some citizens have been deported .
By law , immigration authorities have jurisdiction only over noncitizens .
Citizens , whether native - born or naturalized , cannot be deported .
As ICE increased its collaboration with state and local police and prisons under changes to immigration laws and policies in recent years , some detainees who have had a run-in with the law drop through a trapdoor from the criminal justice system into deportation proceedings .
In immigration detention it falls to the detainees to prove their citizenship .
But detainees do n't have the constitutional protections , such as the right to legal counsel , that would help them prove their case .
And many of those who wind up in immigration custody are frequently those who might have the most difficulty proving their citizenship .
Many were born abroad and acquired citizenship through a U.S. - born parent , like Veloz , or a parent who became a naturalized citizen .
Some have mental health problems .
And frequently they are poor , as those who can afford a lawyer get out more quickly .
" These are people who are the most vulnerable , " said Judy Rabinovitz , deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants Rights Project .
" People are being locked up without bond hearings , often for long periods . "
A growing chorus of legal experts says these detentions are unconstitutional .
" The constitution is the same that applies to U.S. - born citizens as to naturalized citizens , " said Sin Yen Ling , an attorney at San Francisco 's Asian Law Caucus .
" Detaining these folks is creating a third category of people with a different set of rights . "
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials insist they would never knowingly detain or deport a U.S. citizen .
Asked about citizens winding up in immigration detention , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who oversees ICE , told The Chronicle : " We 're always concerned about that .
If there 's an error made , we want to rectify it as soon as possible . "
In April , after The Chronicle reported on a Modesto man in immigration detention , ICE released him and dropped its deportation case against him .
Douglas Centeno was born in Nicaragua but derived citizenship when his father naturalized while he was a boy .
He was jailed for four months .
A lack of rights
People charged in the criminal justice system have a range of constitutional rights , including the right to a speedy and public trial before an impartial jury and the right to legal counsel even if they can't afford to hire a lawyer .
Criminal detainees have the right to a telephone call , to be brought before a judge , usually within 48 hours , and to be told of the charges against them .
Immigration matters , however , are civil , not criminal , so those protections do not apply .
Still , the U.S. Constitution is designed to protect citizens from detention without due process .
But citizens in immigration detention are not being afforded that due process , advocates say .
Immigration detainees are routinely shipped to remote jails where free legal aid is unavailable , their families are not notified of their whereabouts , and they are often denied access to telephones , mail and even medical care , according to a March report by Amnesty International and several federal audits .
" Throwing people into a system where they 're sitting 3,000 miles away without a lawyer and trying to prove they 're a citizen - they 're making people make their arguments with two hands tied behind their back , " said Nancy Morawetz , a professor at New York University School of Law and an expert on deportation law .
In January , Napolitano ordered a full review of ICE detention and removal operations .
ICE spokeswoman Cori Bassett said she did not know when the review would be completed or whether its findings would be made public .
Immigration officials must balance civil liberties against security concerns , some observers say , and wrongful detentions are rare .
" ICE is not going to pursue anyone unless they can really justify the cause for it , " said Janice Kephart , national security director at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington , D.C .
Fighting the system
That 's not what happened to Hector Veloz .
Before his birth , Veloz 's U.S. - born father was sent to Vietnam , so his pregnant mother stayed with relatives in Mexico and Veloz was born there .
Months later , the family returned to the United States and has lived here since .
Veloz was automatically a citizen at birth , though his parents never obtained his certificate of citizenship .
In 2006 , Veloz was convicted of receiving stolen property after purchasing a car that had been stolen .
He served eight months and was about to be released from prison when he was turned over to ICE .
" I said , ' I 'm a U.S. citizen , why am I being put through deportation ? ' " he recalled .
At the ICE prison in Arizona , the paperwork stated that he had entered the country illegally and that his father was a Mexican citizen .
" It was all incorrect information , " Veloz said .
Immigration lawyers say locking up Veloz and others like him violates the 1971 Non-Detention Act , which says the U.S. government cannot detain citizens without an act of Congress .
ICE 's presumption that everyone in immigration custody is an alien undermines the act , said Holly Cooper , a professor of immigration law at UC Davis .
" The system is set up so even if they believe you , you have to prove it in court .
It could take six months to five years to prove it and you 're detained in the meantime , " said Cooper , who helped Veloz win his freedom on appeal .
" You give up your citizenship at the prison door . "
Tough to prove
A person who is born abroad to U.S. parents , as Veloz was , is a citizen at birth .
And a foreign - born child automatically derives citizenship when a parent naturalizes , though they may not realize it .
Without documentation at hand , or an attorney 's help , however , it can be tough to prove .
" I do n't carry my birth certificate around with me and I bet you don't , " NYU 's Morawetz said .
" ICE ought to know the law .
Individuals might not , but the government is supposed to .
They 're the experts . "
ICE 's Bassett said that officials work hard to ensure that they deport only aliens .
In rare instances , she said , the government might detain an actual U.S. citizen because that person claimed to be an alien .
" With somebody who misrepresents their true identity and makes a false statement to an ICE officer , it creates a problem for the government and for themselves , " she said .
The number of people in detention has tripled over the past dozen years .
Immigration authorities now detain more than 400,000 people a year .
Analysts say that is leading to more citizens wrongly detained by ICE .
A study by the nonprofit Vera Institute , conducted for the U.S. Justice Department 's Executive Office of Immigration Review , found more than 700 people at several detention facilities between 2006 and 2008 who said they planned to pursue claims of U.S. citizenship .
Jacqueline Stevens , A UC Santa Barbara professor of law and society , said she had identified 160 cases of people who had been detained or deported but whose U.S. citizenship was later affirmed by the federal government or a jury .
And several immigrant legal aid groups have helped free dozens of other citizens in recent years .
In addition to U.S. citizens , there are other inmates in immigration detention who may not be deportable , legal analysts say .
They include lawful permanent residents who have committed crimes that are not grave enough for deportation , and asylum seekers locked up until their cases are decided .
The fact that citizens are imprisoned in a system designed to deport them points to potential problems for these other detainees , said Chuck Roth , litigation director for the National Immigration Justice Center in Chicago .
" If it can happen to U.S. citizens , you can imagine how few procedural protections are available to everybody else . "

The Treasury Department has yet to establish rules on lobbying for its $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout , although the head of the program ’s independent watchdog says he has found no undue outside influence that has affected the program .
An audit released Thursday by Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , says the Treasury Department is in the final stages of drafting rules on lobbying for bailout money - more than 10 months into the program .
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner , when he took office in January , called for new rules to increase transparency and curtail potential lobbyist influence over the TARP decision - making process .
But the effort to increase transparency and control over lobbyists took a back seat because “ other issues had consumed Treasury ’s time and [ had ] taken precedence over completing the guidance , ” the report said .
The pending lobbying rules , which are awaiting White House approval , are similar to those governing the $ 787 billion economic stimulus program , the audit says .
The new policy will prohibit Treasury employees from talking to lobbyists or members of Congress , with one exception - “ instances of overarching policy discussions , ” the report states .
But the report also found “ little indication that external inquiries on [ TARP ] applications had affected the decision - making process ” on how bailout money was doled out .
“ No official stated that he or she received any inquiries regarding a specific applicant that they deemed inappropriate , ” the audit said .
TARP was created in October to purchase “ toxic assets ” from major banks and other financial institutions .
Two weeks into the program , the Treasury Department announced it would make more than $ 200 billion of the program ’s money available to troubled financial institutions through purchases of preferred stock through its Capital Purchase Program ( CPP ) .
The 38 - page audit studied 56 financial firms that applied for CPP aid and had been the subject of “ external inquiries , ” such as calls or letters from members of Congress .
Of those , 16 received money , 26 did not and 12 were still waiting for a decision as of mid-June .
Two firms did n’t apply .
The report found that three of the 16 funded institutions did n’t meet all the CPP “ quantitative criteria ” but received bailout money anyway based on “ qualitative mitigating factors ” considered by Treasury and banking agency officials .
More than 2,700 financial institutions had applied for CPP money by late July , with 660 collectively receiving about $ 204 billion .
Treasury officials estimate that about 120 applications have been preliminarily approved for CPP aid but have not been funded , while about 40 are pending review at the regulatory level .
The deadline for applications is Nov. 21 .

Dozens of Muslims have staged a protest in the Sri Lankan capital , Colombo , at what they say is police brutality against members of the community .
They allege that several people have been killed or have disappeared .
In the past few weeks the police have announced the killing of men they describe as underworld figures , usually in encounters on the street .
The police in the capital say that they are engaged in a necessary clampdown on organised crime .
Once Friday prayers ended at the Friday Mosque in the Muslim area of Maligawatta , several dozen men and women marched down the street , shouting anti-police slogans .
Their posters said " Ramadan Wet with Blood " and " Innocent to Sacrifice " .
Three people were killed last Friday in a single incident .
Almost all of the victims the police describe as " underworld figures " or " involved in crime " are Muslims .
Police argue the incidents have nothing to do with ethnicity and say that they are cracking down on criminals .
Some demonstrators said more than 16 people had died in this way and that some of the victims were not criminals , but pointed out that even criminals should be treated with due legal process .
" They do n't have the right to kill those people - there should be a law , courts of law .
Actually it 's a jungle of the law .
" So we want show the government , the entire world , that there is no law in this country , " MN Abuakbar who works for a local human rights organisation , said .
The government is unapologetic .
It says it wants to use the same resources it used against the now defeated Tamil Tigers , against the underworld .
It says police have been killing criminals in self - defence when they have drawn guns .
The media are mostly supportive .
But one of the speakers at the Muslim protest , which was partially organised by leftist parties , said that if the current situation continued , Muslims in Colombo might take up weapons .
Muslims in Sri Lanka are the third largest group in Sri Lanka 's ethnic make - up .

Pakistan said yesterday it had rescued 20 young boys who were among hundreds recruited by the Taliban and brainwashed into becoming suicide bombers at a secret indoctrination camp .
The boys , some as young as nine , have revealed details of how they were induced to become part of the Taliban 's army of jihad inside Pakistan and told their rescuers that more than 1,000 children may be undergoing training in the special camp in the Swat valley .
Their discovery by the army as troops were sweeping through the valley conducting the final stages of a military offensive against the Taliban underscores the organisation 's power over poor Pakistani communities and the extreme lengths Taliban commanders are willing to go to achieve their aims .
The rescued children were held at a training camp in the Charbagh area of the Swat valley , where their indoctrination programme reportedly lasted more than a month .
Some were recovered as the army was carrying out " search and sweep " operations as part of the final stages of its military offensive in the valley , while others were handed over to the army by worried parents .

" When we interrogated the boys , they said that they had been taken hostage by the Taliban by force , or in some cases they were taken to the training camps by their friends , " said Major Nasir Khan , a military spokesman in the Swat valley .
" They were heavily indoctrinated .
When I asked them about what they were told , they said : ' The Pakistan army is the ally of the Western capitalist world , they are the enemies of Islam .
The fight against them is justified , they are apostates , the friends of the infidels . ' "
The boys arrived at the camp by a variety of different routes .
Some families had been forced at gunpoint to hand over their children " to fight jihad " during the Taliban 's brutal advance across
Swat over the last two years .
Some groups of young boys were kidnapped in mysterious circumstances , while others were lured in to the Taliban 's clutches by the persuasion of their friends .
The precise number of boys detained and trained by the Taliban is unclear , but is believed to run in to the high three figures .
One of the 20 boys recovered told Major Khan that there were " about 1,200 other boys " at the training camp in Charbagh .
The army suspects that there were other camps in operation elsewhere in the valley , including the militant stronghold of Piochar .
The boys now in the army 's hands have started to give details of the training they underwent at the camps .
First it appears they were indoctrinated ideologically : they were shown videos of atrocities being carried out across the Muslim world , from Palestine to Chechnya and the Middle East .
" They were shown these images to develop a hatred of Western countries , " said Major Khan .
The Taliban militants would then gauge their levels of intelligence and physical strength before dividing the young boys into separate categories .
The first group was used as local informers who would patrol the streets of the valley gathering information .
One of the boys interrogated said he was given a pistol and told to monitor the Pakistan army 's troop movements .
As the army began to strike at the Taliban 's communications infrastructure , destroying their ability to communicate by satellite phone and capturing known local informants , the militants fell back on simpler methods : young boys were posted on street corners and when an army convoy began to roll in their direction they would send signals to boys further on by mirrors or hand signals .
While boys selected to be informers were chosen for their intelligence and street knowledge , the more athletic ones were picked to train as the next generation of Taliban fighters , and instructed in how to mount the sort of small - scale guerrilla attacks with which the Taliban have been harrying the Pakistan army during their two month - long offensive in the valley .
Meanwhile , those who were judged to be less intelligent and more susceptible to manipulation were chosen to join the Taliban 's stockpile of suicide bombers .
According to the young boys interrogated by the army , this group was kept separately and prized for their potential to cause large army fatalities .
As the Taliban faced mounting losses and began to scatter under the army 's offensive , in dribs and drabs the children returned to their homes in different parts of the valley – but with their Taliban indoctrination intact .
Many parents were appalled at the changes their children had undergone .
" The militants had told the boys that they had the right even to kill their parents if they stood in their way , " said Major Khan .
The army has appealed to parents across the valley to hand over sons who spent time in the Taliban 's camps .
A special school is being established in Swat to rehabilitate the children , to re-educate and counsel them , and give them small grants to be able to seek jobs once they have recovered .
The army claims that it has cleared Taliban fighters in all but a few pockets of the valley .
While more than 1,500 militants are said to have been killed , the Taliban commander in the valley , Maulana Fazlullah , is at large .
One quarter of the two million displaced have returned to their homes .
But many others hesitate to return , fearing that the Taliban could return in strength .

Despite what the overcrowded , overpriced shelves of your pharmacy might suggest , pharmaceutical companies struggle to find new drugs these days .
The low - hanging fruit is long gone , and the main discovery method that served so well in past decades is generating far fewer hits today .
But a fresh strategy , focused on a property called allosterism , is now invigorating many investigators .
Some predict it will revolutionize drug discovery and could deliver treatments for diseases that so far remain intractable .
' We are God 's partners in matters of life and death '
A reader points out that President Obama 's call with the rabbis today — as recorded in Rabbi Jack Moline 's and other clerics '
Twitter feeds — freights health care reform with a great deal of religious meaning , and veers into the blend of policy and faith that outraged liberals in the last administration .
" We are God 's partners in matters of life and death , " Obama said , according to Moline ( paging Sarah Palin ... ) , quoting from the Rosh Hashanah prayer that says that in the holiday period , it is decided " who shall live and who shall die . "
The president ended the call by wishing the rabbis " shanah tovah , " or happy new year — in reference to the High Holidays a month from now .
America , meet Alan Grayson .
To the vast majority of Americans , Rep. Alan Grayson ( D ) of Florida is the representative who told members of Congress late Tuesday night that the Republicans ’ health care plan was for sick Americans to die quickly .
Accompanied by a billboard adorned with the same message , he said this precisely : “ If you get sick America , the Republican health care plan is this : Die quickly . ”
What is perhaps most surprising is that it took him this long to get America ’s attention .
Bringing the blogosphere to Capitol Hill
The New Republic describes the freshman congressman – who is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the House – as “ the first member to bring the blogosphere 's in - your - face style to Capitol Hill . ”
When his hometown paper , the Orlando Sentinel , suggested that “ some say ” his style “ may quickly rub his new colleagues the wrong way . ”
He responded in a fundraising e-mail : “ Well , ' some say ' that the Sentinel is a trashy tabloid that dresses up bias and gossip as news . ”
Introducing Vice President Joe Biden at a fundraising dinner , he suggested that former Vice President Dick Cheney gave Mr. Biden a tour of the White House " dungeon " and " its torture rack . "
He joked that Mr. Cheney invited Biden to “ go waterboarding ” with him .
Grayson enemy No. 1 : the Fed
Elected as an anticorruption crusader targeting contractors in Iraq , he has turned his focus to the Federal Reserve and those he holds responsible for the financial meltdown .
His performances at hearings are tailored for the YouTube generation , and he has his own section on the online video site .
In one typical exchange , he asked the CEO of AIG the names of the “ 20 to 25 people ” involved in the credit - default swaps that played a part in AIG ’s collapse .
Edward Liddy : … I do not know those names .
I do n't have them all at my command .
Grayson :
Well , how can you propose to solve the problems of the company that you 're now running if you do n't know the names of the people who caused that problem ?...
Liddy : I 'm just not going to do that , sir , because that will provide — that 'll be the — that could be a list of people that we could do — individuals who want to do damage to them could do that .
It 's just not …
Grayson :
Well , listen , these same people could now be working right now today at Citibank .
Is it more important to protect them , the ones who caused the $ 100 billion loss , or protect us ?

Strange bedfellows
In what could be this Congress ’s most extreme case of strange bedfellows , Grayson has teamed up with libertarian Republican Ron Paul to back a bill calling for an audit of the Federal Reserve .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D ) of Massachusetts has backed the bill .
In an interview with Phil ’s Stock World , he called the Federal Reserve ’s activity “ the story of the millennium .
There are very few stories you can ever write about where the numbers involved have 13 digits in them . ”
Some call him a conspiracy theorist .
Many liberals call him a hero .
But one thing seems clear .
He could well be the congressman least likely to apologize for his words .
Strike that .
He did apologize Wednesday , though it was not the apology Republicans might have been hoping for .
Citing a Harvard study that estimates 44,000 Americans die every year because they do n’t have health insurance , he said : " I apologize to the dead and their families that we have n't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America . "

A 300 kilogram man who was winched from a Brisbane tower by crane after suffering an asthma attack in his apartment remains in intensive care in hospital .
The 57 - year - old man is a resident in the Walter Taylor Bridge , between Indooroopilly and Chelmer , which has two towers , each with their own apartment .
Police ordered the closure of the bridge just before 5 pm yesterday after paramedics were called to assist the morbidly obese man , who was experiencing breathing difficulties .
Taringa fire brigade station officer Steve Marmotta , who helped coordinate the rescue operation , said medicos rendered treatment at the scene but a decision was made to remove him through a third - floor window using a crane .
Prince William spent 10 weeks in Chile on a Raleigh International expedition
The government is to pay for graduates struggling to get a job to go on trips abroad , The Department for Business , Innovation and Skills has confirmed .
It said the scheme will be launched with expedition company Raleigh International next week .
It will pay for 500 young people under the age of 24 to travel to places such as Costa Rica and India to take part in projects such as building schools .
It comes as graduates face an increasingly tough job market .
Forty - eight graduates are chasing every job on offer this year , according to a study by the Association of Graduate Recruiters .
The 10 - week expeditions - to Borneo , India , Costa Rica and Nicaragua - will enable graduates to work on community and environmental volunteering projects in remote communities .
Higher Education Minister David Lammy said volunteering would help new graduates develop " the communication and leadership skills that are so highly valued in the workplace " .
The government was giving Raleigh £ 500,000 to support graduates " who otherwise could not afford to go , " he added .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Gap years should be funded by those who take them , not by a government initiative J. Jenkins , Southampton According to the Times , graduates must raise £ 1000 , buy their own flights and cover the cost of vaccinations to be eligible .
Applicants will have to prove an overseas expedition would be beyond their means without the bursary .
Raleigh expeditions usually cost about £ 3,000 per person .
Prince William spent 10 weeks in Chile on a Raleigh International expedition as part of his gap year .
' Headline grabber ' Matthew Pickin , from Windsor , taught in Malawi during his gap year .
He said the scheme seemed " unfair " to those that had to pay the £ 3,000 , and working to raise money to go abroad had " lead to greater satisfaction " when he was out there .
Struggling graduate James , from Leamington Spa , said the " sending 500 graduates on a jolly " was like a " smack in the face " .
" I am out of work and I am currently funding my own re-training - currently heading for £ 3,000 - to make myself more employable and because the government will not help me . "
Funding opportunities for skills development is surely better than the soul destroying experience of sitting at home watching Jeremy Kyle
Wes Streeting , NUS
As university leavers finish for the summer , the government has upped its campaign to try and help graduates find work during the recession .
On Wednesday , it announced that 2,000 internships are to be made available through a graduate talent pool website .
In addition , Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper invited businesses , councils and charities to bid for a share of £ 1bn to create 47,000 jobs for young unemployed people .
This will offer employment for six months , paid at the minimum wage .
The bleak outlook is also causing many graduates to simply stay in education .
National Union of Students president Wes Streeting said he welcomes the government 's " creative thinking " that could give graduates opportunities to " gain valuable new skills " .
" With youth employment reaching the one million mark , funding opportunities for skills development is surely better than the soul destroying experience of sitting at home , watching Jeremy Kyle , on the dole , " he said .
But Matthew Elliott , chief executive of the Taxpayer 's Alliance , a group which campaigns for lower taxes , said the latest scheme was a " headline grabber " that would put a dent in taxpayers ' pockets .
" The government needs to stop spending .
It needs to focus on creating the right economic climate to allow entrepreneurs and business men to be able to hire new graduates , " he said .

Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill , who recently released the Lockerbie bomber , has a brother who is an energy - industry executive and who has worked at firms that have pitched for oil business in Libya .
The Scottish government , which has said that it made full disclosure of facts relevant to the decision , did n't disclose this relationship , and opposition politicians on Monday criticized this .

The ongoing open mathematics project finding primes aims to find a deterministic algorithm to efficiently generate - digit primes .
The fastest known algorithm seems to be a method of Odlyzko which generates a - digit prime in time .
The people working on the project have made some observations which come tantalizingly close to breaking that barrier .
The obstruction is a beautiful little problem that I thought many people might enjoy , and which may well be tractable .
If you ’re interested in participating in the finding primes project , it might be a good entry point .
So if you ’ve got a good idea to solve the problem , pitch in and help over at the Polymath blog .
But please be polite : read some background first , and take a look at some of the research threads to get a feel for how things work , and what ’s already known .
One small caveat : the argument that follows is not in any way mine , it ’s all the work of other people !
A recent comment thread on this argument starts here .
Let denote the number of primes less than or equal to .
has a lot of structure , and there ’s a surprising amount that can be said about it .
In particular , the people working on finding primes have figured out a clever way of computing the parity of in time about .
Suppose you can find two - digit numbers and such that the parity of and are different .
Set , i.e. , take to be the midpoint between and .
Compute the parity of .
It must have either a different parity to or a different parity to .
Repeating this procedure times , we can use a binary search to find adjacent - digit numbers and such that and have different parity .
We conclude that must be prime .
That takes time , and so breaks the barrier set by Odlyzko ’s method .
What ’s the problem with this algorithm ?
The problem is finding the initial - digit numbers and such that and have different parity .
It would surprise me a great deal if this were n’t possible , but it ’s not obvious ( at least to me ) how to do it quickly .
Is there a fast way of doing this ?
Those " Sponsored Ads " in e-mails are an annoyance to both sender and recipient and they seem to escape blocking .
Until now .
These two ( so far ) fail - proof sentences at the end of an email will let you enjoy e-mailed rants , ad - free .

( Click the images above and below for a closer look at the before and after effect . )
In his personal blog , Joe McKay writes about his experience in blocking Gmail 's sponsored ads using words referencing tragic or catastrophic events ( which Google bans from their ads ) as well as words from George Carlin 's infamous list of seven words you can't say on TV .

That 's great news , but how on Earth do you send an email to your boss that 's littered with f- bombs and talk of murder ?
After finding a few victims and experimenting with various potential ad - blocking words , here 's the relatively kindly signature we came up with :
I enjoy the massacre of ads .
This sentence will slaughter ads without a messy bloodbath .
Result :

Those two simple ( and innocent ) sentences at the end of an e-mail appear to consistently block Gmail 's sponsored ads for us .
We 've tested e-mails of varying lengths because Joe remarked that he found that there needs to be a ratio of one ad - blocking word for every 167 normal words , but so far , we have n't seen those sentences fail .
Got your own methods of avoiding the extra ads in Gmail ?
Maybe you 've put together a better ad - blocking signature sentence ?

How to avoid Gmail 's Sponsored Links [ Joe McKay ]
File Deletion
File deletion is all about control .
This used to not be an issue .
Your data was on your computer , and you decided when and how to delete a file .
You could use the delete function if you did n’t care about whether the file could be recovered or not , and a file erase program — I use BCWipe for Windows — if you wanted to ensure no one could ever recover the file .
As we move more of our data onto cloud computing platforms such as Gmail and Facebook , and closed proprietary platforms such as the Kindle and the iPhone , deleting data is much harder .
You have to trust that these companies will delete your data when you ask them to , but they ’re generally not interested in doing so .
Sites like these are more likely to make your data inaccessible than they are to physically delete it .
Facebook is a known culprit : actually deleting your data from its servers requires a complicated procedure that may or may not work .
And even if you do manage to delete your data , copies are certain to remain in the companies ’ backup systems .
Gmail explicitly says this in its privacy notice .
Online backups , SMS messages , photos on photo sharing sites , smartphone applications that store your data in the network : you have no idea what really happens when you delete pieces of data or your entire account , because you ’re not in control of the computers that are storing the data .
This notion of control also explains how Amazon was able to delete a book that people had previously purchased on their Kindle e-book readers .
The legalities are debatable , but Amazon had the technical ability to delete the file because it controls all Kindles .
It has designed the Kindle so that it determines when to update the software , whether people are allowed to buy Kindle books , and when to turn off people ’s Kindles entirely .
Vanish is a research project by Roxana Geambasu and colleagues at the University of Washington .
They designed a prototype system that automatically deletes data after a set time interval .
So you can send an email , create a Google Doc , post an update to Facebook , or upload a photo to Flickr , all designed to disappear after a set period of time .
And after it disappears , no one — not anyone who downloaded the data , not the site that hosted the data , not anyone who intercepted the data in transit , not even you — will be able to read it .
If the police arrive at Facebook or Google or Flickr with a warrant , they wo n’t be able to read it .
The details are complicated , but Vanish breaks the data ’s decryption key into a bunch of pieces and scatters them around the web using a peer - to - peer network .
Then it uses the natural turnover in these networks — machines constantly join and leave — to make the data disappear .
Unlike previous programs that supported file deletion , this one does n’t require you to trust any company , organisation , or website .
It just happens .
Of course , Vanish does n’t prevent the recipient of an email or the reader of a Facebook page from copying the data and pasting it into another file , just as Kindle ’s deletion feature does n’t prevent people from copying a book ’s files and saving them on their computers .
Vanish is just a prototype at this point , and it only works if all the people who read your Facebook entries or view your Flickr pictures have it installed on their computers as well ; but it ’s a good demonstration of how control affects file deletion .
And while it ’s a step in the right direction , it ’s also new and therefore deserves further security analysis before being adopted on a wide scale .
We ’ve lost the control of data on some of the computers we own , and we ’ve lost control of our data in the cloud .
We ’re not going to stop using Facebook and Twitter just because they ’re not going to delete our data when we ask them to , and we ’re not going to stop using Kindles and iPhones because they may delete our data when we do n’t want them to .
But we need to take back control of data in the cloud , and projects like Vanish show us how we can .
Now we need something that will protect our data when a large corporation decides to delete it .

Mr Kroenke also owns a number of US sports clubs
Arsenal director Stan Kroenke , the largest shareholder at the north London club , has increased his stake again .
Mr Kroenke has bought a further 80 shares at £ 8,500 per share , taking his holding in Arsenal to 28.7 % .
It takes Mr Kroenke closer to the 29.9 % threshold that would force him to make an offer for the remaining shares .
The American tycoon had been increasing his stake this year , giving him a bigger holding than Uzbek metals magnate Alisher Usmanov .
Mr Kroenke also owns the NBA 's Denver Nuggets , the NHL's Colorado Avalanche , and the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer .
His latest move comes two days after Arsenal revealed its annual pre-tax profits had risen to £ 45.5 m in the year to 31 May .
Mr Usmanov , a billionaire , owns more than 25 % of the club through investment vehicle Red and White Holdings .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - The Hollywood studio behind a film based on “ The Hobbit ” and trustees for author J.R.R .
Tolkien ’s estate said on Tuesday they had settled a lawsuit that clears the way for what is expected to be a blockbuster movie based on the book .
“ The Hobbit ” is a 1937 book by Tolkien about a diminutive character named Bilbo Baggins who goes on a treasure - seeking adventure , and it sets the stage for Tolkien ’s “ The Lord of the Rings ” trilogy , with its epic tale of magic and warfare .
The “ Lord of the Rings ” books were made into three films released by New Line Cinema between 2001 and 2003 that made about $ 2.9 billion at worldwide box offices , and similarly “ The Hobbit ” is widely expected to be a blockbuster hit .
But in February 2008 , the trustees of the Tolkien ’s estate filed a lawsuit against New Line , a division of Time Warner Inc , seeking more than $ 150 million in profits from the “ Rings ” movies , it claimed it was owed .
The lawsuit also sought to block filming of “ The Hobbit , ” which will now be made into two movies by Guillermo del Toro , the filmmaker behind “ Pan ’s Labyrinth ” and “ Hellboy . ”
Financial terms of the settlement were not released , but the author ’s son , Christopher Tolkien , said in a statement that as a result of the agreement , “ New Line may now proceed with its proposed films of ‘ The Hobbit . ’ ”
HarperCollins Publishers Ltd , a publisher of Tolkien ’s works , joined trustees of the Tolkien estate in the lawsuit .
The Tolkien Trust , a charity tied to the late author ’s estate , has given away more than $ 8 million in the last five years .
Obama admin increases deficit projections to $ 9 trillion
In a Friday news dump , the Obama administration revised upward its deficit projection for the next 10 years by $ 2 trillion .
The old figure was $ 7.108 trillion , which was awful enough , but the new projected budget shortfalls over the next decade is a whopping $ 9 trillion .
Such a massive disparity is unsustainable if ignored or , as seems to be the case here , increased by more irresponsible spending .
Does the Obama administration have a point when they say they inherited a $ 1.3 trillion deficit from Bush ?
Of course they do – Bush was no fiscal conservative by any stretch of the imagination .
But it ’s hard to point the finger of blame at the previous administration when your own does the same thing on a larger scale .
The information has obvious implications for the health care debate as any sort of public option will be a massive increase in the size of government with the requisite cost and inefficiencies that come with it .
Estimates of its cost are between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion over a stretch of years , depending on who you ask .
Either way it ’s hard to sell that such a program will be deficit - neutral or that any supposed savings on health - care costs would outbalance the cost of the program itself .
Never mind that it ’s a bit odd to claim that spending more taxpayer money on health care will actually result in less money being spent on health care , but that ’s a different story .
And in any case , the revised projections do n’t inspire much faith in the administration ’s ability to forecast .
As Ed Morrissey notes , they got the unemployment figure wrong on the stimulus , they figured the initial Cash for Clunkers would last three months and it lasted a week , and now they reveal they ’re off by $ 2 trillion in deficit forecasting .
But yet their plans for health care reform will be so beneficial for us that we need not question their necessity or cost ?
In the bigger picture , there are really only two options for anyone who wants to solve the troubling deficit problem : either raise taxes in a move that will further harm the economy and paradoxically further reduce revenues , or cut entitlement spending .
No , cutting military spending wo n’t ever by itself solve the problem , as it ’s Medicare and Social Security that are the major liabilities on the federal books .
Neither choice will be particularly popular , but politicians may end up thinking that it ’s easier to simply tax more than to risk the wrath of the various groups currently receiving benefits .
In a saying that has been attributed to Benjamin Franklin and may be sadly prescient , we come to learn the following :
When the people find they can vote themselves money , that will herald the end of the republic .
Entitlements and bailouts are adding to the inevitability of that statement , but let ’s hope it does n’t come to that .
In any case , the focus now should not be on adding on more , but getting the economy back on track and getting our government back to a responsible financial posture .
Neither appears to be much of a priority now .

My bare dirt patches
it 's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests
What gives ?!
Do you have cheap sod or not ?
Are you just using Craigslist to test the waters and see if you 've " still got it " sod-wise ?
Are you just some sod-bot and not a real person ?
Was my need for sod somehow not enough for you ?
Was it because I 'm seeking an NSA ( Need Sod ASAP ) relationship with a sod purveyor and you 're looking more for an LTR ( Lawn Term Relationship ) ?
Now I feel like I 'm in the lawncare version of " He 's Just Not That Into You . "
Do I send yet another email or would that seem " psycho " at this point ?
Are you not responding to any emails or is it just me ?
All I want is some freaking grass on my freaking black dirt at a good price .
Well , if I do n't hear from you today I 'm moving on .
I 've got needs , and obviously you 're either not serious or you 're picky about who gets a piece of your grass .
I did n't even mention it in my email but if you 'd answered you 'd have found out I have plenty of bare patches for some lucky sod guy .
But I guess someone else will get to lay those .
Fulltext search in SQLite and Django app
Since version about 3.5.9 SQLite contains full - text search module called FTS3 ( older releases may have FTS1 , FTS2 ) .
Using this module we can easily add fast full text search to a Django application ( or any other using SQLite ) .
During my tests I got FTS3 only on Python 2.6 .
On Python 2.5 and using pysqlite may be hard to get FTS3 ( try recompiling with - DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3=1 flag ) .
Here is an example table :
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE my_search using FTS3 ( slug , body ) ;
FTS1 and FTS2 can be used exactly in the same way as FTS3 .
More on sqlite.org .
We can start with importing data from existing table .
With this script ( executed from Django project folder ) we can import the data :
# -*- coding : utf - 8 -*- import sys import urllib2 from os import environ environ [ ' DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE ' ] = ' settings ' from settings import * from django.contrib.sessions.models import * from django.db import connection , transaction from MYAPP .
models import * cursor = connection .
cursor ( ) j = MY_SOME_MODEL . objects . all ( ) iterr = 1 for i in j : print iterr txt = i . some_txt + ' ' + i . more_txt + ' ' + i . city_of_something # txt should be stripped from HTML , stop words etc. to get smaller size of the database cursor .
execute ( " INSERT INTO my_search ( slug , body ) VALUES ( %s , %s ) " , ( i . slug , txt ) ) iterr += 1 transaction . commit_unless_managed ()
Indexing new entries we can handle in Django with signals .
For example in models .
py add :
from django.db.models import signals #.... def update_index ( sender , instance , created , ** kwargs ) : cursor = connection .
cursor ( ) txt = instance .
some_txt + ' ' + instance .
more_txt + ' ' + instance .
city_of_something # txt should be stripped from HTML , stop words etc. to get smaller size of the database txt = clean_to_search ( txt ) if created : # add if object is created , not updated cursor .
execute ( " INSERT INTO my_search ( slug , body ) VALUES ( %s , %s ) " , ( instance . slug , txt ) ) transaction .
commit_unless_managed ( ) signals .
post_save .
connect ( update_index , sender = MY_SOME_MODEL )
The query looks like this :
SELECT slug FROM my_search WHERE body MATCH ' search term ' ;
cursor = connection . cursor ( ) cursor .
execute ( " SELECT slug FROM my_search WHERE body MATCH %s " , ( query , ) ) results = cursor .
fetchall ()
I 'm testing this search solution on my JobMaster - job offer searcher hosted on megiteam.pl .
As for now no problems occurred with this ( except switch from Python 2.5 to Python 2.6 ) .
It does n't leak memory ( Nginx + FastCGI ) , and it does n't seem to be slow ( it index entries faster than Whoosh , but no number on it ) .
It 's simple , easy to setup , and no whoosh .
solr , xapian needed , so it 's cool way to add full text search to SQLite powered websites .

Radiotherapy is a common treatment for brain tumours Radiotherapy used to treat brain tumours may lead to a decline in mental function many years down the line , say Dutch researchers .
A study of 65 patients , 12 years after they were treated , found those who had radiotherapy were more likely to have problems with memory and attention .
Writing in The Lancet Neurology , the researchers said doctors should hold off using radiotherapy where possible .
One UK expert said doctors were cautious about using radiotherapy .
The patients in the study all had a form of brain tumour called a low - grade glioma - one of the most common types of brain tumour .
In these cases radiotherapy is commonly given after initial surgery to remove the tumour , but there is some debate about whether this should be done immediately or used only if the cancer returns .
It always depends on the patient , but if it is possible to defer radiotherapy , maybe people should
Dr Linda Douw , study leader
It is known that radiation treatment in the brain causes some damage to normal tissue and the study 's researchers suspected it could lead to decline in mental function .
A previous study in the same patients done six years after treatment found no difference in aspects like memory , attention and the speed at which people could process information , in those who had received radiotherapy .
But the latest research , carried out more than a decade after original treatment , did find significant variation in the results of several mental tests between those who had had radiotherapy and those who had not .
In all , 53 % of patients who had radiotherapy showed decline in brain function compared with 27 % of patients who only had surgery .
The most profound differences were in tests to measure attention .
Delaying treatment
With an average survival of ten years for this type of tumour , the researchers said patients undergoing radiotherapy were at considerable risk of developing problem years down the road .
One option for doctors would be to delay when patients received radiotherapy , reserving it in case the tumour returned , they advised .
" It always depends on the patient , but if it is possible to defer radiotherapy , maybe people should , " said study leader Dr Linda Douw , from the Department of Neurology at VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam .
But she added that more research was needed and there were trials under way to look at other treatments such as chemotherapy .
In an accompanying article , experts from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , USA , said it was hard to draw conclusions because radiotherapy had improved since the patients in the study had been treated , but agreed more studies were needed .
Dr Jeremy Rees , a Cancer Research UK scientist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery Honorary said they would usually try to avoid giving radiotherapy to patients with low - grade glioma , unless the tumour was progressing or the patient had epilepsy not controlled on standard medication .
" Surgery is generally a preferred option with chemotherapy or radiotherapy coming into play at a later stage , if the glioma progresses .
" Continued research and increased knowledge about the disease is enabling us to treat it increasingly effectively while reducing side effects . "

The Effects of Epic Stimulus
What makes investing particularly difficult now is that the distortion in prices , as if reflected in a funhouse mirror .
Normally market prices should reflect underlying demand and supply .
As in a vegetable stand , the prices come from the buying and selling of people in the market .
But with all the artificial stimulus money floating around , you can never be sure of what you see .
Is this a real recovery or is it an artificially ripened tomato , and hence an imposter ?
When the stimulus money stops flowing will the recession get worse ?
It ’s hard to say , but let me give you a couple examples of distortions .
CNN ’s bailout tracker reports that US government stimulus has totaled $ 2.8 trillion so far this year , with another $ 8.2 trillion in commitments .
Most of this money has gone to the financial sector .
Some of it has gone to infrastructure projects and to consumers ( cash for clunkers , for example ) .
That is a lot of money .
It is hard to say how all of this spending has artificially boosted economic activity in some sectors of the economy .
It is obvious that such spending cannot continue indefinitely .
This has also been a worldwide phenomenon .
There is n’t an economy of size that does not have some stimulus - spending program in place .
Governments are spending money they do n’t have .
The result is widening budget deficits and higher debt levels .
First up , take a look this graph , from The Economist , which shows the industrial production of emerging Asia compared to the United States .
Looks like Asia is recovering pretty well .
That chart shows the “ decoupling ” that became such a hot topic of discussion last year .
The idea was that the emerging markets would not necessarily follow lockstep with the Western countries .
But this graph only tells a part of the story .
China is one of the countries in “ Emerging Asia . ”
China supposedly grew in the first quarter at an annualized rate of 15 % .
Yet , the government also spent a lot of stimulus money .
As Eric Sprott writes in his latest letter to shareholders :
“ The Chinese have injected a stimulus equivalent to 64 % of their first half 2008 GDP in the first half of 2009 … The Chinese government has effectively spent and lent enough in six months to buy 122 Ford Class aircraft carriers at US $ 8.1 billion a piece .
It is akin to the US government injecting ( and US banks lending ) almost $ 4.5 trillion USD to its citizens and businesses before July 2009 … an ungodly sum that would impact every asset class under the sun .
Is it any wonder then that the Shanghai stock exchange has more than doubled from trough to peak since its November lows ? ”
Let me remind you that GDP is a clumsy way to get at an economy ’s size .
It is a figure that includes government spending .
So , put another way , stimulus money this year is about 64 % of the recorded economic activity in the first half of last year for China .
In some ways , the Chinese government spent well – investing in the commodities it craves .
It ’s locked down oil and gas assets , iron ore contracts , interests in rare earths and more .
It ’s put up power plants and laid down roads and pipelines .
It ’s made long - term investments in Africa and Brazil .
Some of that will pay dividends down the road , if not already .
For instance , in the first six months of this year China became Brazil ’s single largest export market .
That ’s the first time that ’s ever happened .
The Chinese and Brazilians are doing deals .
For instance , China will lend $ 10 billion to Petrobras in return for 200,000 barrels of oil per day .
China , in fact , has been active throughout South America , investing billions in mines , refineries , ports , and railroads .
These shifting patterns of trade always fascinate me .
And we are living in an era of great change on that front , as new patterns emerge on a scale we have never seen .
It ’s clear that China will have enormous needs for commodities over time .
In the short - term , we are surely seeing distortions from the stimulus money .
But the long - term demand is there nonetheless and the Chinese have a lot of money to spend .
In fact , infrastructure needs – especially in the areas of water and energy – are becoming more of a headline issue than ever .
Not a week goes by where I do n’t pick up a handful of stories of infrastructure falling apart somewhere .
This , too , is a global story .
A couple weeks ago , for instance , there was a terrible accident in a Russian hydropower plant .
Eleven people were killed and 65 were missing after water burst into a turbine room .
It also destroyed the turbine .
Besides the irremediable loss of life , it will take hundreds of millions of dollars and years to repair the demand .
As the FT reported , the accident “ was a powerful reminder of Russia ’s dire need for hundreds of billions of roubles in investment in its crumbling Soviet - era infrastructure . ”
Putin ’s government put aside $ 200 billion for infrastructure in two oil windfall funds , but that money is already being tapped for social spending programs and to help make up budget deficits .
As in many places , including in the US , money set aside for infrastructure has been essentially hijacked by the political process and diverted to other uses .
Another story comes from Britain .
Britain faces huge deficits in energy and the risk of widespread blackouts .
Its energy complex is old and strained .
The Economist reports : “ The nuclear stations are simply too old to carry on : most are over a quarter of a century old .
Around half have already been shutdown and are being decommissioned . ”
About half of its electricity comes from natural gas , a legacy of its North Sea riches .
But the North Sea peaked in 1999 and has been in steep decline ever since .
Britain ’s coal plants struggle under new pollution control rules and the effects of age .
It ’s an ugly situation that will cost a lot of money to fix .

When we use a break - through industrial design product – the iPod , for example – we do n’t necessarily spend much time thinking about the extensive development process that went into achieving such a simple solution .
But the long journey from visionary idea to intuitive product is a trajectory worth contemplating .
In the case of Herman Miller ’s new Setu chair , designed by Berlin outfit Studio 7.5 , the numbers are telling : 18 months of self - financing , 5 + years of development , and 40 fully functional prototypes .
We sat down with 3 of the studio’s 4 partners – Claudia Plikat and siblings Carola and Roland Zwick – to talk about the deceptively simple design of Setu , which debuted at NeoCon this summer and snagged two prestigious awards .
The multipurpose chair boasts a “ kinematic spine ” – the first of its kind – which seamlessly joins the seat bed to the chair back , allowing the chair to adapt to the ergonomics of individual users without a single adjustment .
The group also designed Herman Miller ’s award - winning Mirra desk chair .
Studio 7.5 has only 8 employees , and 4 of them are partners in the firm .
They all went to school and received their industrial design training from the same professors , and they ’ve been “ married , ” as they put it , for almost 20 years now .
But it ’s not their shared history as much as it is a shared mission that holds the group together .
Their mantra is “ the best idea should win , ” and as a result everyone is in constant pitch mode .
“ If you cannot convince the others – and paper is not that convincing , ” says Carola , the project wo n’t happen .
“ If you have something in your hand that does something , that ’s way more appealing to everyone here . ”
We never start with this nice - looking picture of our vision , of how something should look at the end .
In short , the group thrives on the challenge :
Put your model where your mouth is .
“ If you are really serious about what you are doing , and not only delivering napkin drawings that some engineer at a company is executing , ” as Claudia says , prototyping must be at the core of the design process .
Fittingly then , the studio is outfitted with a small , but incredibly robust , model - making shop , replete with a CNC milling machine .
As die - hard believers in transforming idealized visions into pragmatic realities – and the sooner the better – the Studio 7.5 team has little use for drawings .
Carola :
“ We never start with this nice - looking picture of our vision , of how something should look at the end …
At every iteration of the prototyping , we try to update ‘ What would the product look like ? ’ if this would be the final stage of development .
And during this iterative process , the details get carved out , and evolutionarily develop .
And , of course , you have to be very patient . ”
In their opinion , if they are outsourcing prototype development , they are also outsourcing learning .
By being able to develop fully functional prototypes in house , “ The learning from building prototypes stays here and we can be faster , more agile , ” says Roland .
“ The simplest version works the best , and the first version is never the simplest . ”
Patience and taking the long view seems to be the order of the day at Studio 7.5 .
The group self - financed the first 18 months of Setu ’s development because they needed to protect their creative process in those fragile , early days .
Claudia says , “ We think as designers , we are authors of something .
We do n’t think of design as a service …
With some projects , it is like a growing plant .
It is so small and vulnerable that you do n’t want to expose it to really harsh critique . ”
Though they had worked with Herman Miller previously , 7.5 did n’t even give the company a peek until the design had already evolved through 35 fully functional prototypes .
The simplest version works the best , and the first version is never the simplest .
“ The question from the beginning was , if we wanted to achieve this , what we would call solid - state kinematic , we would need to prove and verify that living hinges ( now only used on Tupperware boxes ) could work and last for the [ Herman Miller ] 12 - year warranty , ” says Carola .
“ And that meant internally ‘ a million cycles ’ – these living hinges need to move a million times .
That was the part we were most nervous about .
And that could only be proved by a real prototype and then Herman Miller would test that . ”
During the process , small rituals help the team sustain momentum and keep in touch .
Every day , all of the studio ’s employees gather at a long , oak table , which doubles as a workbench at other times , for a meal served up by resident cook , Katja , and a daily conference .
Despite the success of their Setu and Mirra chairs , Carola still calls their family - style lunch 7.5 ’s best invention : “ It sounds silly but that ’s the best way to ensure that everybody is on the same page . ”
It ’s also the best way to relax and refuel for more prototyping .
TARBES , France 
Tour de France officials and most of the teams in the race are at an impasse over the ban of team radios for two stages , a standoff that could spice up this week ’s racing .
Tour officials have called for Tuesday ’s and Friday ’s stages to be run without the use of radios .
Their thinking is that riders will have to make decisions on their own , without as much help from their race directors as they are accustomed to .
If the ban is enforced , directors will have no communication with their riders except by pulling their cars next to the peloton and talking to them .
Teams said it would compromise the safety of the riders .
Bjarne Riis , the team manager for the Saxo Bank squad , said racing without radios was “ too romantic ” a notion .
If the Tour does not relent , he said , the teams will use the radios anyway .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd famously labelled the Exclusive Brethren ( EB ) a " cult " while in Opposition .
But it seems that , in Government , he is more generous to the Christian sect .
Figures obtained by The Greens in Senate Estimates reveal that funding to schools run by the controversial Christian sect have increased by 50 per cent under the Rudd Government .
In 2007 , EB schools were receiving just over $ 9 million in funding from the Howard government .
But NSW Greens MP John Kaye says funding for EB schools around Australia has risen to $ 13.9 million this year .
" [ It is ] scheduled to go to about 17.2 million by 2012 , " he said .
" The Rudd Government did not change the Howard Government 's formula that had an in - built escalation in it .
" This is funding going to the schools that Kevin Rudd referred to as being operated by a cult . "
Education Minister Julia Gillard was unavailable to comment last night , but a statement from her office said recurrent grants funding for EB schools grew by 14 per cent between 2007 and 2008 , reflecting increased enrolments at those schools .
It said final 2009 entitlements will not be known until October .
The statement also said the Government has implemented its election commitment to maintain the current funding arrangements for non-government schools and that a Government review of funding arrangements will get underway next year .
No surprise
Peter Flinn , a former member of the Exclusive Brethren , says he is disturbed by the increase in funding , but not surprised .
He wrote a letter on behalf of 30 ex-members of the EB asking Mr Rudd to establish an inquiry into the brethren .
" They have been the recipients of great generosity from various governments over the years and we 're quite concerned about that , " he said .
" It 's out of all proportion to the number of students .
But they are very good at negotiating and lobbying governments . "
That lobbying goes back to the days of the Keating and Howard governments .
In the 1990s , two of the main Brethren schools were granted special status known as ' Category 12 ' .
Michael Bachelard , author of Behind the Exclusive Brethren , says under the old funding model , Category 12 was reserved for Aboriginal schools for children with particular needs .
" Somehow the EB managed to get Category 12 funding for their schools in NSW and SA and to keep it under the new system , " he said .
Funding loophole
New schools built by the Brethren are designated as campuses of an already established school .
Under the " funding maintained " principle , set up by the Howard government , these new schools are entitled to the generous funding levels of the schools that already exist .
Mr Flinn says an example within NSW is the main school at Meadowbank in Sydney .
He says they have campuses as far away as Albury , 600 kilometres to the south .
" When the new campuses were established they did not have to go through the whole establishment process under the SES model , " he said .
" They were able to retain the ... special position they had been able to obtain under that system and that applied to all other campuses . "
An internal Department of Education review of SES funding in 2006 acknowledged that some schools were gaining an advantage in funding by setting up campuses .
The examples highlighted were Brethren schools in NSW .
Revolution benefit
The Brethren 's campus system has also allowed them to benefit from the Rudd Government 's Building The Education Revolution funding .
The Brisbane campus of the Brethren 's Agnew school has been granted $ 1.65 million to build a library .
To qualify for this level of funding , the school must have between 151 to 300 primary students on site , but the school has only 57 primary students on site .
No -one from the Agnew school was available for comment , but in a written statement the school said : " The central library will , through the use of cutting - edge information and communication technologies , provide all students and teachers across all campuses daily access to services .
Materials will be forwarded and returned by either a courier service or post . "
One condition of the federal funding for school libraries is that they be open to all members of the local community .
In the written statement to Lateline , a representative from the Agnew school said : " The school has accepted this commitment and the commitment will be met . "
While the Agnew school has not acted illegally in tallying up student numbers from across the state , one former Brethren school principal , who did not wish to be identified , told Lateline " it was immoral " .

Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie's bid to buy the bankrupt Phoenix Coyotes and relocate them in Hamilton has ended in failure .
Balsillie confirmed late Wednesday he will not appeal an Arizona bankruptcy judge 's rejection of bids for the Coyotes from both the BlackBerry tycoon and the NHL .
" I respect the court 's decision and I will not be putting forward an appeal , " Balsillie said in a statement .
The ruling handed down earlier Wednesday by Judge Redfield T. Baum proved to be the knockout punch for Balsillie , who has tried — and failed — three times to buy an NHL team and relocate it in southern Ontario .
" Nobody can deny that we are now a big step closer to having a seventh NHL team in Canada , " Balsillie said .
" It does n't matter who owns that team [ and ] , when that day comes , I will be the first in line to buy a ticket to the home opener . "
Balsillie offered $ 242.5 million US for the Coyotes , contingent on moving the team to Hamilton , but Baum turned down the bid because it failed to satisfy the NHL 's rights regarding relocation .
The league was opposed to Balsillie moving the team to Hamilton , preferring to keep it in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale for the time being .
Baum sided with the NHL on three points — the right to approve membership ; the right to control where teams play ; and the right to a relocation fee — and , in doing so , avoided setting a legal precedent feared by all major professional sports leagues .
" We are pleased that the bankruptcy court has confirmed the league 's rights to select its owners and the location of its franchises , " NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in a statement .
Baum rejected Balsillie 's bid " with prejudice " and the NHL's bid " without prejudice , " leaving the door ajar for the league to amend its $ 140 million offer to the satisfaction of the court .
" It seems to the court that the defect in the NHL 's bid could be easily cured by the NHL , " he said .
" In hockey parlance , the court is passing the puck to the NHL who can decide to take another shot at the sale net or it can pass off the puck . "
Baum expressed concern over the NHL 's omission of Coyotes majority owner Jerry Moyes and former head coach Wayne Gretzky on its list of creditors to be paid .
Moyes claimed to have lost more than $ 200 million in equity and accumulated $ 100 million in debt since partnering with developer Steve Ellman and Gretzky to buy the team for $ 90 million in 2001 .
Gretzky is owed $ 9.3 million on his minority stake .
The NHL argued in court that the debt incurred by Moyes and Gretzky was , in fact , equity — thus removing them as creditors — but Baum disagreed .
" There has been no determination that the Moyes and Gretzky claims are not ' legitimate creditors , ' " Baum said .
" It would be inherently unjust for this court to deprive them of their possible rightful share of any proceeds without first providing all involved a fair trial on their claims . "
" We are reviewing the opinion and considering how we can best address the court 's concerns regarding our offer to purchase the Coyotes , " Daly responded .
" It remains our goal to secure the long - term stability of the Coyotes in Glendale . "
Hamilton Hopeful Jim Balsillie had an agreement with the City of Hamilton on a lease at Copps Coliseum with $ 5 million in upgrades if he succeeded in landing the Coyotes in bankruptcy court .
" It certainly would 've meant a lot of business for the downtown core of Hamilton .
It would certainly have brought a lot of awareness to the city and with awareness creates opportunities . " — Ruth Liebersbach , president of Hamilton Chamber of Commerce
All is not lost , however .
Witnesses for the NHL testified in court that Hamilton ranks high among the untapped markets for an NHL team , be it relocated or an expansion entry .
" The good news in it for Hamilton is that all have agreed that hockey in southern Ontario is viable and that it would be a successful market for them to start working with .
We will continue to work to see if we can get an NHL franchise here for Hamilton . " — Fred Eisenberger , mayor of Hamilton
Moyes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 5 , with the expressed purpose of selling the Coyotes to Balsillie over the NHL 's vehement objections .
The league had already rejected Balsillie 's application for ownership by a 26 - 0 vote with three abstentions ( Buffalo , Pittsburgh , Toronto ) and , based on past dealings , questioned his character and integrity as a businessman .
Moyes later filed an emergency motion requesting Baum order mediation to resolve the case , but it was tossed .
" This conclusion effectively is the end for the efforts of PSE , Balsillie , Moyes and the Coyotes to force a sale and relocation of the hockey team , " Baum said .
Failed bids for Penguins , Predators
The resentment between Balsillie and the league — and the reason why mediation was viewed as pointless — has intensified since he tried unsuccessfully to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins and Nashville Predators , so he could move them to Hamilton .
Balsillie struck a tentative agreement with Penguins majority owner Mario Lemieux to purchase the team for $ 175 million in 2006 , but NHL commissioner Gary Bettman intervened and reportedly imposed restrictions to ensure the team would stay in Pittsburgh .
Balsillie later agreed to purchase the Predators for $ 238 million from Craig Leipold in 2007 and began accepting deposits for season 's tickets in Hamilton — a move that miffed the NHL and led to Leipold scuttling the deal and selling the team to local interests for considerably less .
Leipold was later rewarded for his loyalty with majority ownership in the Minnesota Wild , and Balsillie has since irked board members by pursuing the Coyotes in bankruptcy court .
The ruling on the Coyotes is the result of five months of legal wrangling for a floundering franchise that lost $ 75 million in 2004 , $ 50 million in 2005 , $ 75 million in 2006 , $ 117 million in 2007 and $ 72 million in 2008 .
Baum hinted he might reject both bids during a two - day , court - supervised auction in mid-September .

Listening this morning to Democracy Now !
brought back a flood of memories which I would prefer to have forgotten .
Marilyn Walker and Frank Lindh were being interviewed .
If you recall they are the parents of John Phillip Walker Lindh who was captured in Afghanistan on November 25 , 2001 .
Lindh , who is a US citizen , was crucified immediately in the media as being the " American Taliban . "
He was 20 years old , and officially converted to Islam in 1997 , travelled to Yemen to study the Qur'an , and returned to the US in 1999 .
He then went to Pakistan via Yemen in 2000 , to study further at a madrassa .
When Lindh was " captured " by the Afghan Northern Alliance forces , they were also working with CIA special operatives and an elite Marine Corps Unit assigned to work in the foothills searching for bin Laden .
The reason I know this is because my son was there .
He participated in Lindh 's capture and in the subsequent battle when the " Taliban " prisoners at the military garrison , Qala - i - Jangi , near Mazar-e Sharif , became the scene of an uprising .
One CIA officer , Johnny " Mike " Spann , was killed , along with other members of the CIA and military .
I remember the phone call I received in the early morning hours from the Marine Corps base " Camp Rhino . "
I got used to the 3 AM calls when my son would return from his " hunting " missions and tell me every last detail of trying to capture bin Laden .
But this call was different .
I heard the entire story of what ensued with the fight and detention of the " American Taliban . "
If you look through the Wikipedia entry on " John Walker Lindh " you will note that a reference is made that his captors did not know who Lindh was because he refused to speak English , barely spoke at all , and when he did , he spoke Arabic , which he was fluent in .
The Wiki entry also says that if " he had only told them he was an American , he would have received better treatment . "
This is a downright lie .
Those marines and CIA operatives knew the moment he was captured that he was an American citizen .
I was also told about how he was thrown on the back of a marine corps truck , with the marines guarding him , and others they had grabbed .
During this conversation , my son told me how they had been working with the northern alliance bombing caves and hunting for bin Laden .
The 15th MEU , a special operations battalion that drove deep into Afghanistan , was the first of its kind .
Marines have always been trained to deploy on the beach and be the first fighting force to open the way for the Army .
However , the MEU's , Marine Expeditionary Unit , were trained for land fighting , and have vehicles that travel on all types of terrain and can move far inside a Country 's borders .
On November 25th this MEU , and specifically my son's platoon , Javelin Company , was operating deep inside Afghanistan .
I knew exactly what he was doing , and was scared to death .
Working in downtown Manhattan when the Twin towers fell , then living with the invasion of Afghanistan , it was an extremely difficult time for me as a mother and concerned human to fully grasp what was really happening around me .
I think that most of the world , and people in this Country , felt the same way .
We were shocked into fear , hatred , paralysis , and confusion .
My son told me that they took Lindh on the truck back to Camp Rhino and put him in a shipping container .
He also mentioned that Lindh was wounded .
I was horrified at this thought .
I remember asking him if they took care of his wounds .
He laughed and said " no way . "
I think that at this moment my senses were " awakened " to the brutality of this invasion .
There were times when I did question the " mission " in Afghanistan , but always felt that if bin Laden was responsible , then he must be caught and brought here for trial .
Day by day I waited for this to happen , and day by day I realized that this would never happen .
Not only did the marines at Camp Rhino place Lindh in a shipping container , they taunted him .
He was kept in their naked , with no food or blanket .
He was sprayed with water and at night , when it got down to less than 20 degrees , he was left alone to freeze .
He cried out to his captors , but his cries went unanswered .
He was being " punished " not for necessarily taking up arms against Americans , but because the marines felt he was a traitor who left America to become a Muslim .
He was their age , 20 years old , the same as my son and most others who were there .
They hated him very deeply and could not nor would not show him compassion .
I had sent my son a blanket and warm clothing for the cold nights in Afghanistan .
When he told me about Lindh , I asked him if he would give him his blanket .
He said flat out " no . "
The next day my brain really could n't process all this information and really wished that I did n't receive that call , or any calls for that matter in this war .
It is inhuman to think you can call a mother or anyone at 3 AM from a damn warzone , and expect them to go to work the next day all bright and happy .
At that moment , I became completely disgusted with the Marine Corps , what had happened with my son , and what our Country was doing .
As the public learned about the " American Taliban " I watched John Lindh 's parents in their anguish .
I wanted to reach out to them and tell them what I had heard , and wanted to apologize for the abject brutality he was subjected to .
I was completely humiliated for myself and anyone else who thought that this young boy who believed in a religion that had now become our enemy , was anything but a human being that deserved to be innocent until proven guilty .
Another month went by , with more phone calls and discussions .
Interestingly prior to the month of November , 2001 , I received a letter from the Dept. of the Navy inviting me on a " Tiger Cruise . "
Since marines and sailors travel together on ships , the Navy had instituted a program for family members to spend time with them and learn how they live and work aboard a naval vessel .
I was invited to meet my son in Honolulu , Hawaii the last holiday week in December , and travel back with him into the port of San Diego aboard the U.S.S. Peleliu .
He was returning from his deployment aboard this ship , and I was excited to see him after suffering through the horror of his time at war .
So I spent 8 days with 3,000 marines and 1,500 sailors on a ship the size of a small state .
It was a wonderful reunion and seeing my son in one piece was the best holiday present I have ever received .
But I was also deeply troubled by what I saw and heard .
It was another world , another dimension .
I did n't know it when I embarked , but deep in the bowels of the ship was their prisoner John Walker Lindh .
I had heard it a few days after I had been on board .
Sitting in the " mess hall " or cafeteria like I call it , with a table full of combat hardened marines , I heard more stories of the " American Taliban " or many other names that I dare not repeat .
These kids despised him on every level you could imagine .
They truly wanted to get at him .
At one meal , ca n't remember which terrible one it was , a young female marine MP , with a sidearm , came over to the table .
She was blond , pretty but tough .
I will never forget her , ever .
She stood there with a tray of food .
The marines I was sitting with yelled at her .
" You taking him food ? " I was puzzled .
She stood there so strait and somber and said " Yes .
And he is my prisoner . " "
None of you will ever get to him , nor will he be mistreated under my watch . "
They all scoffed at her , but showed her tremendous respect .
I asked who she was referring to and they told me .

Maoists have a presence in almost 200 Indian districts
India 's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh says his country is losing the battle against Maoist rebels .
Mr Singh told a meeting of police chiefs from different states that rebel violence was increasing and the Maoists ' appeal was growing .
The rebels say they are fighting for the rights of the poor .
They operate in a large swathe of territory across central India , and in some areas have almost replaced the local government .
More than 6,000 people have been killed during their 20 - year fight for a communist state .
' Going up '
" I have consistently held that in many ways , left - wing extremism poses perhaps the gravest internal security threat our country faces , " Mr Singh told a conference of Indian police chiefs in the capital , Delhi .
" We have discussed this in the last five years and I would like to state frankly that we have not achieved as much success as we would have liked in containing this menace . "
The prime minister said that despite the government 's best efforts , violence in Maoist - affected areas was going up .
The prime minister admitted that the Maoists had growing appeal among a large section of Indian society , including tribal communities , the rural poor as well as sections of the intelligentsia and the youth .
Mr Singh said a more sensitive approach was necessary in dealing with the Maoists .
" Dealing with left - wing extremism requires a nuanced strategy - a holistic approach .
It can not be treated simply as a law and order problem . "
The rebels operate in 182 districts in India , mainly in the states of Jharkhand , Bihar , Andhra Pradesh , Chhattisgarh , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra and West Bengal .
In some areas they have virtually replaced the local government and are able to mount spectacular attacks on government installations .
Gilbert schoolchildren and parents be warned : Police have their citation books in hand and are ready to crack down on jaywalkers .
As Gilbert - area schools reopened last week , school - resource police officers notified officials in Gilbert Public Schools and Higley Unified school districts that they would soon begin a crackdown on students who do n't use crosswalks .
" What we try to do is educate the students first by notifying them and when that does n't work , we will start issuing citations , " said Sgt. Mark Marino , a police spokesman .
In an e-mail to students and parents , Higley High School Principal Larry Rother stated , " Gilbert officers informed school administration that they are conducting ' sweeps ' of all high schools in Gilbert and may be ticketing students who are ' j - walking ' after dismissal . "
Patrol and motorcycle officers will be on the lookout for jaywalkers throughout the school year , Marino said .
" Our goal here is to keep the students safe , " Marino said , adding students and parents were tipped off because " we want to do everything we can before we have to issue a citation . "
The biggest offenders are older students , typically those in junior and high school , Marino said .
" We 've had a bunch of close calls at some of the schools , " Marino said .
" No one has been hurt , but it 's only a matter of time if we do n't take some sort of action . "
Arizona Revised Statute 28-793 requires a pedestrian to yield to oncoming traffic when crossing a roadway outside of a crosswalk .
However , the law prohibits pedestrians from crossing intersections outside a crosswalk when traffic lights are present .
The fine is $ 210 .
Marino said the crackdown is twofold - to keep schoolchildren and drivers near schools safe .
" We talk a lot about enforcement on drivers , but we also have to focus on the students ' behavior and safety practices as well , " he said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The world 's population is forecast to hit 7 billion in 2011 , the vast majority of its growth coming in developing and , in many cases , the poorest nations , a report released Wednesday said .
Riders cram into a train last month in New Delhi , India .
India 's population is expected to be 1.7 billion by 2050 .
A staggering 97 percent of global growth over the next 40 years will happen in Asia , Africa , Latin America and the Caribbean , according to the Population Reference Bureau 's 2009 World Population Data Sheet .
" The great bulk of today 's 1.2 billion youth -- nearly 90 percent -- are in developing countries , " said Carl Haub , a co-author of the report .
Eight in 10 of those youth live in Africa and Asia .
" During the next few decades , these young people will most likely continue the current trend of moving from rural areas to cities in search of education and training opportunities , gainful employment , and adequate health care , " Haub continued , calling it one of the major social questions of the next few decades .
In the developed world , the United States and Canada will account for most of the growth -- half from immigration and half from a natural increase in the population -- births minus deaths , according to the report .
High fertility rates and a young population base in the developing world will fuel most of the growth , especially in Africa , where women often give birth to six or seven children over a lifetime , the report says .
The number is about two in the United States and 1.5 in Canada .
Do n't Miss 13 million abortions in China
A stark contrast can be drawn between Uganda and Canada , which currently have about 34 million and 31 million residents , respectively .
By 2050 , Canada 's population is projected to be 42 million , while Uganda 's is expected to soar to 96 million , more than tripling .
" Even with declining fertility rates in many countries , world population is still growing at a rapid rate , " said Bill Butz , president of the bureau .
" The increase from 6 billion to 7 billion is likely to take 12 years , as did the increase from 5 billion to 6 billion .
Both events are unprecedented in world history . "
By 2050 , India is projected to be the world 's most populous nation at 1.7 billion , overtaking current leader China , which is forecast to hit 1.4 billion .
The United States is expected to reach 439 million for No. 3 on the list .

A miraclous image done by fungi appeared on the wall .

Probably they just looked better in search of something alike and bingo here it is .
Maybe your city has something similar too ?
Looking at the world through the eyes of the Web
If you want to know where the United States went wrong in its approach to the War on Terror , look no further than the day George W. Bush told the world there was going to be a war on terror .
You can forget our pre-emptive war against Iraq or our blasé bungling among the caves at Tora Bora or even the Abu Ghraib fiasco ; our fate was sealed on Sept. 16 , 2001 , five days after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , when the president announced , “ This crusade , this war on terror is gonna take a while . ”
Like a contestant on the old Groucho Marx game show “ You Bet Your Life , ” Bush had spoken the secret word — ” crusade ” — confirming the darkest suspicions of already - skeptical Muslims and couching all of the country ’s future responses to 9/11 in the language of what author Reza Aslan calls “ cosmic war . ”
Suddenly we were n’t just victims of an act of brutality committed by religious zealots from a far - off land .
We were defiant actors in what Aslan describes as a “ ritual drama in which participants act out on earth a battle they believe is actually taking place in the heavens . ”
Here we were partitioning the world “ into black and white , good and evil , us and them , ” just like the terrorists were .
Suddenly we were zealots , too .
He may not have known it at the time , but Bush was condemning the U.S. and the world to a clash of civilizations ; raising the stakes to heights of Manichaean , even biblical , significance ; offending an enormous portion of the world ’s population whose hearts and minds would be the spoils of battle ; and giving Osama bin Laden and his loose - knit army of global jihadists exactly what they were hoping for .
In his excellent and fascinating new book , How to Win a Cosmic War : God , Globalization , & the End of the War On Terror , Aslan — an assistant professor of creative writing at the University of California - Riverside and research associate at the University of Southern California ’s Center on Public Diplomacy in Santa Monica — explains just how consequential Bush ’s word choice was .
For those of us in the Judeo - Christian West , the Crusades are like some misbegotten quirk of history , an isolated series of moments from a darker time and place when human beings were willing to engage in all kinds of bloody nonsense in the name of religion and territory .
For all their relevance to our daily lives , the Crusades might as well be the Battle of Agincourt or the Punic Wars .
But in the Arab world , Aslan writes , “ the image of cross - marked knights riding out to cleanse the Holy Land of heathen Muslim hordes became the most potent symbol of the imperialist aspirations of the West : a kind of shorthand for Christian aggression against Islam . ”
The Western colonialism that had served throughout the 19th and 20th centuries to partition the territories of the Middle East , crush and dismantle its traditions , and profit off its natural riches is an integral part of the Middle Eastern imagination .
Many in the region view Europe and the United States to this day as imperialist thieves and conquerors , intent not just on profiting from their land but on destroying their religion .
So calling up that word was like sounding an alarm .
“ For Jihadists , ” Aslan writes , “ the Crusades are not so much a historical event as they are an ideological construct — an enduring narrative whose final chapter is only now being written in the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq . ”
Drawing such a straight line from the Crusades to the construction of the Suez Canal to the first Palestinian Intifada to the current war in Iraq may seem like a gross oversimplification , but as Aslan points out , it ’s just these sorts of oversimplified “ cosmic dualisms ” that speak most clearly to aggrieved souls willing to strap bombs to their bodies and blow up buses .
Not to mention those souls going out to fight such jihadists in the name of Christian Zionism and a hoped - for American theocracy .
In fact , if there ’s one thing that How to Win a Cosmic War shows , it ’s that the language and imagery of religious zealotry is essentially the same across regional and theological lines .
Cosmic dualism — we ’re right ; they ’re wrong ;
God is with us ; they ’re with Satan — is the preferred philosophy of Islamic extremists , ultra-religious Israeli settlers , and the Christian soldiers of the American fundamentalist movement in equal measure .
When a member of Algeria ’s Armed Islamic Group said of global jihad , “ There is no neutrality in the war we are waging .
With the exception of those who are with us , all others are apostates and deserve to die , ” he could have been speaking for mega- church pastor John Hagee , former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , or George ( “ You ’re either with us or with the terrorists ” )
Bush .
How can we win this cosmic war ?
In Aslan ’s view , grievance is the key , both to understanding the mindset of jihadists and to finding ways to end our fight with them .
As an Iranian - American born in Tehran , Aslan understands and empathizes with both sides of an intractable and destructive argument .
He recognizes both the religious and secular motivations behind all the East - West anger .
And by dissecting the language of cosmic warfare that has defined this issue for eight years , he is able to shed light on the actual social and political roots of the conflict , bringing some much - needed sanity to a discussion that for years has been bogged down in madness .
Shaking free from deluded and stereotypical Western beliefs that Islamic jihadism is born out of willful ignorance in the madrassas of theocratic Middle Eastern nations , he takes us instead to Western Europe , where recruiters for Islamic jihad prey on the fears , anger and sense of displacement of a generation of young first - and second - generation Muslims to populate their army of martyrs .
Far from being an offspring of the Dark Ages , as we would like to believe , these Europeans Muslims are children of modernism , multiculturalism , capitalism and globalization , much more like their Christian , Jewish and nonreligious neighbors than the tribal fundamentalists in their ancestral homelands .
Recruiters take the personal grievances of these young men — the anger resulting from their experience with racism , poverty , religious intolerance , identity confusion or simple adolescent rage — and weave them into a tapestry of global and historical victimhood until their students begin to view their own stories as part of a larger narrative of East against West , of good versus evil .
In Al Qaeda recruitment propaganda , there ’s a direct connection between economic and social isolation in the suburbs of Paris and oppression in Palestine , the killing of children in Afghanistan , the torture of prisoners in Guantánamo , and the theft of oil by American corporations in Iraq .
Grievance is the fuel that powers religious extremism .
When accumulated grievances and theological extremism replace humanism and a belief in the value of democracy and religious tolerance you get a world of “ negative poles ” where brutality against one group leads to brutality against another group by the group once brutalized , where willful misunderstanding and violent disdain become lingua franca and the tragic play of human aggression plays out unceasingly into the future — where groups rationalize their cruelty and the cruelty visited upon them through the lens of cosmic contention , sanctioned by and agreeable to God .
To demonstrate his point , Aslan takes us through the whole sordid , irony - soaked history of Christian / Islamic / Jewish relations , from the Crusades to the Christian oppression of Jews in nation - state Europe to Zionist oppression of Palestinians in the Holy Land , from the rise of global jihad during the Soviet Union ’s invasion of Afghanistan to the attacks of 9/11 , from the streets of Cairo and Tehran to the cells of Abu Ghraib .
Grievance piled upon grievance .
Negative poles creating new negative poles .
An endless cycle of good vs. evil .
Sanctified by religion and enacted in the name of God. Cosmic dualisms wreaking nothing but havoc .
To Aslan , the worst thing we could have done after the events of 9/11 is the exact thing we did : responding to a call for cosmic war by declaring a cosmic war of our own .
Like marks falling for an elaborate con , we were goaded into a war we never should have been fighting .
But off we went to fight anyway , with flags waving , country songs in our ears , and hatred for “ the other ” in our hearts , just like Al Qaeda hoped we would .
Aslan ’s achievement in How to Win a Cosmic
War is working his way through all that white noise — through the apocalyptic religious rhetoric , through the patriotic cant and clichés , through the racism both implied and explicit , through the self - serving theological justifications of the imams , pastors , nationalists and politicians — to get at the underlying economic , social , and political roots of our never - ending war .
An academic with the voice of a novelist , he ’s able to bring unprejudiced clarity to a seemingly impassable quandary and a sense of optimism to the bleakest of realities .
In our cynical age , his educated faith in the possibilities of progress , humanism and democracy is nothing short of miraculous .

In its present form , the subprocess .
Popen implementation is prone to dead - locking and blocking of the parent Python script while waiting on data from the child process .
This PEP proposes to make subprocess .
Popen more asynchronous to help alleviate these problems .
Further exploration of the concepts covered in this PEP has been deferred at least until after PEP 3156 has been resolved .
This can be dealt with in the bug tracker .
A specific proposal is attached to .
A search for " python asynchronous subprocess " will turn up numerous accounts of people wanting to execute a child process and communicate with it from time to time reading only the data that is available instead of blocking to wait for the program to produce data .
The current behavior of the subprocess module is that when a user sends or receives data via the stdin , stderr and stdout file objects , dead locks are common and documented .
While communicate can be used to alleviate some of the buffering issues , it will still cause the parent process to block while attempting to read data when none is available to be read from the child process .
There is a documented need for asynchronous , non-blocking functionality in subprocess .
Popen .
Inclusion of the code would improve the utility of the Python standard library that can be used on Unix based and Windows builds of Python .
Practically every I/O object in Python has a file - like wrapper of some sort .
Sockets already act as such and for strings there is StringIO .
Popen can be made to act like a file by simply using the methods attached to the subprocess .
Popen. stderr , stdout and stdin file - like objects .
But when using the read and write methods of those options , you do not have the benefit of asynchronous I/O .
In the proposed solution the wrapper wraps the asynchronous methods to mimic a file object .
I have been maintaining a Google Code repository that contains all of my changes including tests and documentation as well as blog detailing the problems I have come across in the development process .
I have been working on implementing non-blocking asynchronous I/O in the subprocess module as well as a wrapper class for subprocess .
Popen that makes it so that an executed process can take the place of a file by duplicating all of the methods and attributes that file objects have .
There are two base functions that have been added to the subprocess .
Popen class : Popen.send and Popen._recv , each with two separate implementations , one for Windows and one for Unix - based systems .
The Windows implementation uses ctypes to access the functions needed to control pipes in the kernel 32 DLL in an asynchronous manner .
On Unix based systems , the Python interface for file control serves the same purpose .
The different implementations of Popen.send and Popen._recv have identical arguments to make code that uses these functions work across multiple platforms .
When calling the Popen._recv function , it requires the pipe name be passed as an argument so there exists the Popen.recv function that passes selects stdout as the pipe for Popen._recv by default .
Popen . recv_err selects stderr as the pipe by default .
Popen.recv and Popen.recv_err are much easier to read and understand than Popen._recv ( ' stdout ' ... ) and Popen._recv( ' stderr ' ... ) respectively .
Since the Popen._recv function does not wait on data to be produced before returning a value , it may return empty bytes .
Popen .asyncread handles this issue by returning all data read over a given time interval .
POLICE are investigating an elephant who has been accused of assaulting a woman by throwing a stone at her head from its zoo enclosure .
The woman - who has only been identified by her surname of Kim - told police she was visiting the zoo at the Children 's Grand Park in south - east Seoul on Monday when she noticed the elephant - Taesani , 35 , picking up a stone with its trunk .
She turned away - and was hit in the back of the head by the stone .
She reported the incident to police in Gwangjin district who began an investigation .
Unfortunately , they quickly realised that the scene of the alleged assault was out of the range of CCTV cameras .
' Though Ms Kim believes the elephant threw a stone at her , it 's hard to conclude that the elephant attacked her since there are neither witnesses nor evidence , ' Dong - A Ilbo newspaper quoted a police source as saying .

President Obama 's mention of Sen. Max Baucus Max Sieben BaucusBottom line Bottom line The Hill 's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - George Floyd 's death sparks protests , National Guard activation MORE 's healthcare proposal drew boos Thursday at a healthcare rally at the University of Maryland .
By contrast , the left - leaning crowd cheered Obama when he endorseed a public health insurance option , which is considered a core provision for liberal lawmakers but is absent from Baucus 's ( D - Mont . ) proposal .
ADVERTISEMENT
The president ’s speech in College Park , Md. , was part of a return to campaign mode aimed at his attempts to drum up support for his embattled healthcare proposal .
Baucus , a centrist and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , unveiled his bill Wednesday .
He had been working behind the scenes for months with a group of three Republicans and two Democrats in an attempt to craft a bipartisan measure .
But Republicans and liberal Democrats criticized the legislation upon its release , and the White House was largely noncommittal .
Obama did not endorse Baucus 's bill at the rally .
But he assailed critics of his broader goal , threatening those who mischaracterize his plans that he will " call them out . " " I 've heard a lot of Republicans say they want to kill ' ObamaCare , ' " Obama said .
" Some even raise money off of it .
" By the end of the rally , the president had brought the crowd firmly back to his side , leading them in the now - familiar chants of " Fired up , ready to go .
" Earlier Thursday , the White House formally announced that the president had directed Health and Human Service Secretaryto begin offering $ 25 million in grants for demonstration projects to find ways to improve patient safety while limiting medical malpractice suits .
" I do n't think this is a silver bullet , but I want to explore the idea , " Obama said in Maryland .
The move , announced during the president 's joint address to Congress last week , was largely viewed as an olive branch to Republicans who have long faulted frivolous lawsuits for raising the cost of insurance .
Trial lawyers , one of the most reliable Democratic donor bases , have long fought attempts at tort reform on Capitol Hill , but Sebelius said that the president is not trying to use the outreach as " a lever " in the healthcare debate .
Sebelius told reporters earlier Thursday that the launch of the demonstration projects can track with legislative language that explores ways to limit malpractice suits , and the president 's directive " captures some of the legislative intent and jumpstarts it . "
" I do n't think this is an either - or , " she said .
" I see this as very complementary to some of the proposals on the table . "

When meeting people you do n't know very well , the convention is to seem extra friendly .
You smile and say " pleased to meet you , " whether you are or not .
There 's nothing dishonest about this .
Everyone knows that these little social lies are n't meant to be taken literally , just as everyone knows that " Can you pass the salt ? " is only grammatically a question .
I 'm perfectly willing to smile and say " pleased to meet you " when meeting new people .
But there is another set of customs for being ingratiating in print that are not so harmless .
The reason there 's a convention of being ingratiating in print is that most essays are written to persuade .
And as any politician could tell you , the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the facts .
You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down .
For example , a politician announcing the cancellation of a government program will not merely say " The program is canceled . "
That would seem offensively curt .
Instead he 'll spend most of his time talking about the noble effort made by the people who worked on it .
The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they interact with the ideas .
Saying " pleased to meet you " is just something you prepend to a conversation , but the sort of spin added by politicians is woven through it .
We 're starting to move from social lies to real lies .
Here 's an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about labor unions .
As written , it tends to offend people who like unions .
People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union organizers have a problem to explain : why are unions shrinking now ?
The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation of people living in fallen civilizations .
Our ancestors were giants .
The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral courage that 's lacking today .
Now here 's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of offending them :
Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions for workers .
But though labor unions are shrinking now , it 's not because present union leaders are any less courageous .
An employer could n't get away with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today , but if they did , I see no reason to believe today 's union leaders would shrink from the challenge .
So I think it would be a mistake to attribute the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who run them .
Early union leaders were heroic , certainly , but we should not suppose that if unions have declined , it 's because present union leaders are somehow inferior .
The cause must be external . [ 1 ]
It makes the same point : that it can't have been the personal qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful , but must have been some external factor , or otherwise present - day union leaders would have to be inferior people .
But written this way it seems like a defense of present - day union organizers rather than an attack on early ones .
That makes it more persuasive to people who like unions , because it seems sympathetic to their cause .
I believe everything I wrote in the second version .
Early union leaders did make heroic sacrifices .
And present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if necessary .
People tend to ; I 'm skeptical about the idea of " the greatest generation . " [ 2 ]
If I believe everything I said in the second version , why did n't I write it that way ?
Why offend people needlessly ?
Because I 'd rather offend people than pander to them , and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other .
The degree of courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point ; all that matters for the argument is that they 're the same .
But if you want to please people who are mistaken , you can't simply tell the truth .
You 're always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their misconceptions from bumping against reality .
Most writers do .
Most writers write to persuade , if only out of habit or politeness .
But I do n't write to persuade ; I write to figure out .
I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased reader .
Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader , someone who does n't will seem arrogant .
In fact , worse than arrogant : since readers are used to essays that try to please someone , an essay that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander to the other .
To a lot of pro-union readers , the first paragraph sounds like the sort of thing a right - wing radio talk show host would say to stir up his followers .
But it 's not .
Something that curtly contradicts one 's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a partisan attack on them , but though they can end up in the same place they come from different sources .
Would it be so bad to add a few extra words , to make people feel better ?
Maybe not .
Maybe I 'm excessively attached to conciseness .
I write code the same way I write essays , making pass after pass looking for anything I can cut .
But I have a legitimate reason for doing this .
You do n't know what the ideas are until you get them down to the fewest words . [ 3 ]
The danger of the second paragraph is not merely that it 's longer .
It 's that you start to lie to yourself .
The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin you 've added to get them past the readers ' misconceptions .
I think the goal of an essay should be to discover surprising things .
That 's my goal , at least .
And most surprising means most different from what people currently believe .
So writing to persuade and writing to discover are diametrically opposed .
The more your conclusions disagree with readers ' present beliefs , the more effort you 'll have to expend on selling your ideas rather than having them .
As you accelerate , this drag increases , till eventually you reach a point where 100 % of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any faster .
It 's hard enough to overcome one 's own misconceptions without having to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's .
I worry that if I wrote to persuade , I 'd start to shy away unconsciously from ideas I knew would be hard to sell .
When I notice something surprising , it 's usually very faint at first .
There 's nothing more than a slight stirring of discomfort .
I do n't want anything to get in the way of noticing it consciously .
Notes
[ 1 ] I had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing this .
To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious crap you were expected to , but also seem to be writing with conviction .
The solution was a kind of method acting .
It was revoltingly familiar to slip back into it .
[ 2 ] Exercise for the reader : rephrase that thought to please the same people the first version would offend .
[ 3 ] Come to think of it , there is one way in which I deliberately pander to readers , because it does n't change the number of words : I switch person .
This flattering distinction seems so natural to the average reader that they probably do n't notice even when I switch in mid-sentence , though you tend to notice when it 's done as conspicuously as this .
Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this .
Note :
An earlier version of this essay began by talking about why people dislike Michael Arrington .
I now believe that was mistaken , and that most people do n't dislike him for the same reason I did when I first met him , but simply because he writes about controversial things .
The report will reveal more about the abuse of inmates in CIA prisons
The US justice department is calling for about a dozen prisoner abuse cases to be reopened , US media say .
The recommendation could lead to the prosecution of CIA employees and contractors over the treatment of terrorism suspects , the reports say .
The call comes as justice officials are set to disclose previously censored parts of a key report on inmate abuse .
President Barack Obama is also now reported to have approved a new elite team to question key terror suspects .
Criminal inquiry
The call for the reopening of the prisoner abuse cases - mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan - was made by the US Department of Justice 's ethics office , the New York Times reported .

The cases account for about half of those that were referred to the justice department by the inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , but which were later closed .
The recommendations to review some cases , which would reverse Bush administration policy , have been sent to US Attorney General Eric Holder .
He is set to announce soon whether he will appoint a prosecutor to investigate alleged abuse by CIA agents .
It is expected that he will go ahead with a new criminal inquiry .
Such a decision would pose problems for the CIA .
It would also have political ramifications given President Obama 's desire to leave questions over the Bush administration 's interrogation practices in the past , correspondents say .
Harsh methods
The department of justice 's call came as the CIA inspector general prepared to unveil a fuller version of a key report on the handling of terror suspects .
A heavily censored version of the 2004 internal report was released last year , but in an almost meaningless form because so much remained classified , the BBC's Daniel Sandford reports from Washington .
Barack Obama has approved a new unit to question terrorism suspects A federal judge ordered more details to be released on Monday , after a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union ( Aclu ) .
According to US media , the report by the inspector general details how a gun and an electric drill were brought into an interrogation session of suspected USS Cole bomber and alleged al - Qaeda commander Rahim al - Nashiri , in a bid to frighten him .
In another case , a gun was fired in another room to lead a detainee to think another suspect had been killed .
The US has banned harsh interrogation methods , including death threats .
Even under the Bush administration 's controversial interpretation of the law , causing " severe mental pain " by the " threat of imminent death " was considered illegal .
Meanwhile , senior officials told US media on Monday that the new unit to question key terrorism suspects had been approved by President Obama .
It will be called the High - Value Detainee Interrogation Group .
It is to be composed of experts from several intelligence and law enforcement agencies .
The group will be housed at the FBI but will be overseen by the national Security Council , giving the White House direct oversight , the Washington Post reported .
A US intelligence official told Associated Press news agency the CIA welcomed the move as it did not want involvement in long - term detentions .

He suggested I give him a blowjob , but I had never done so before and it was too overwhelming .
After a few failed attempts , I told him I could n’t do it .
He snapped back with “ That ’s what they all say ! ” ( He told me he was a virgin ) Then he suggested we have a go without the condom .
I was on no form of birth control .

i evolusjonen i klasserommene har økt kraftig , og det kommer hovedsaklig fra muslimske studenter , sa biologiprofessor og Darwin - forfatter Richard Dawkins i et intervju med The Times i august .
De protestantiske fundamentalistene er blitt verdenskjent for sin Darwin - avvisning , men de siste årene har også islamsk kreasjonisme vokst seg sterkere med inspirasjon og støtte fra kristenkonservative i USA .
Blant annet utveksles folk og ideer mellom disse miljøene .
The growing dispute between conservatives and liberals over the Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor obscures a more troubling point of agreement :
The government should almost always win .
Many conservatives who think of themselves as proponents of limited government would be surprised to discover that conservative judges begin their constitutional analyses in almost every context by placing a thumb firmly on the government side of the scale .
It 's called " judicial deference . "
Many liberals , who take pride in being " empathetic , " would be surprised to learn that liberal judges also subscribe to judicial deference .
The practical result is that judges of both persuasions almost never enforce any constitutional limit on the power of government to regulate property and the economy .
Given that the vast majority of law concerns these two areas , the real crisis in constitutional law is not judicial " activism " but judicial passivism .
It all began in the late 1930s , when the Supreme Court opened the floodgates for New Deal economic regulation .
In essence , conservatives have adopted the big - government agenda of that era .
The liberal - conservative consensus explains why nomination fights focus on a few " culture war " issues such as gay marriage or guns .
Liberals and conservatives squabble over these esoteric questions because there is such harmonious accord on everything else .
The time - honored justification for judicial deference is that when courts refuse to enforce property rights and allow economic liberties to be trampled by legislatures they are showing respect for the democratic process .
But this notion is not faithful to the duty of the judiciary .
The Constitution 's framers understood that legislatures are as much nests of vice as of virtue .
That is why they went to such lengths to define the limits of government , set forth our rights broadly , and create an independent , co-equal branch of government to protect those rights .
The absence of meaningful constitutional limits on the power of government over property and the economy has had consequences that should cause both liberals and conservatives to rethink the wisdom of sweeping judicial deference .
For example , last fall Congress enacted the Troubled Asset Relief Program , putting hundreds of billions of dollars at the personal discretion of the secretary of the Treasury .
This grant of authority -- which violates the basic constitutional duty of Congress to control the purse laid out in Article I , Section 8 -- transformed the secretary into the most powerful unelected official in American history .
Such power , once acquired , is rarely relinquished .
None of this would have been thinkable , much less possible , without the longstanding refusal of the Supreme Court to enforce clear constitutional boundaries on the elected branches .
In another example , America has become a patchwork quilt of laws serving special interests because courts refuse to protect economic liberty .
In 1950 , only one in 20 trades required a license .
Now it is more than one in four ( according to recent research of Morris Kleiner published by the National Bureau of Economic Research ) , and the clamor by industry groups for more licensing grows unabated .
Special interests love licensing because it restricts competition and thus drives up the prices they can charge .
None of this would be possible if judges simply struck down licensing laws as an insult to the constitutional right to earn an honest living secured by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the " privileges or immunities " clause of the 14th Amendment .
Bad government is usually the result of runaway government .
And runaway government is usually the result of government exceeding its constitutional prerogatives .
Because they have a far stronger stake in the integrity of checks and balances on government power than in the culture war , conservatives and liberals should declare a truce over " activism " and reflect on the need to take the whole Constitution seriously .
Judges should be neither active nor passive , neither aggressive nor deferential .
In a word , they should be engaged -- engaged in protecting constitutional rights to property and economic liberty , because these areas of the law have the most impact on our daily lives .

Beijing 's airport is owned by the state 's Capital Airport Holdings
The former head of the state - firm that owns Beijing airport has been executed following his conviction on corruption charges , state media have reported .
Li Peiying was found guilty of bribery and embezzlement totalling nearly $ 16 m ( £ 11 m ) , Xinhua news agency said .
The death sentence is usually reserved for violent crimes but is occasionally used for cases of major fraud .
China executes more people than any other country but last month the Supreme Court said fewer would be held .
Li was executed in Jinan , capital of the eastern province of Shandong , after the Supreme People 's Court upheld a lower court 's rejection of his appeal .
From 1995 - 2003 he was head of the state - owned Capital Airports Holdings , a huge firm with 30 airports across nine provinces in China .
He was found guilty in February of accepting about $ 4 m in bribes and stealing a further $ 12 m in public funds .
Anti-corruption drive
The amounts are small compared to the $ 260 m allegedly squandered by another senior official , Kang Rixin , the general manager of China 's National Nuclear Corporation .
He is accused of trading money earmarked for the construction of three nuclear plants and trading it on the stock exchange , with heavy losses , says the BBC's Chris Hogg in Shanghai .
He is also accused of accepting bribes from a foreign company that wanted to build nuclear power stations in China .
His investigation , and the execution of Li Peiying , are further signs that China is determined to punish corruption among high - ranking officials , says our correspondent .
On Thursday two business people were executed , convicted of defrauding investors of more than $ 120m .
Du Yimin and Si Chaxian " seriously damaged the country 's financial regulatory order and social stability " , the Supreme People 's Court ruled .

Uncovering evidence of another Christian extremist organization in the U.S. is not exactly newsworthy .
There are many such groups , and they are nothing new .
However , when the particular Christian extremist organization proves to be extremely secretive , proudly compare itself to the mafia , and counts many members of Congress among its members , one hopes that a flurry of investigative reporting would be unleashed .
Moreover , one hopes that this investigative reporting would continue until all the information worth knowing about such a group becomes public .
Now just imagine that the organization we 're talking about also proves to be anti-democratic to the core .
Bill Moyers did an excellent segment with Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Drew Altman on health care reform , and in this segment they discuss how the polling and narratives being driven by the mainstream media and the 24 hour " news " cycle are actually preventing there from being an honest debate on health care reform .
And so it 's not creating context in which misinformation on both sides can be corrected .
And that 's the problem .
We do n't have a deliberative process here taking place in public to inform public opinion .
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON :
But you 're also seeing something else .
In your clip you see a woman who says , " Is it coming out of my paycheck ? "
She 's raising a legitimate question .
But when people are shouting at each other , the answer does n't get through .
And when you 're impugning the integrity of the person who 's answering the questions , the member of Congress , that person 's response is n't going to be believed if it is able to be articulated and is n't simply shouted down .
DREW ALTMAN : It 's part of our democracy , but I think it 's actually kind of sad because the left , does n't like this legislation a lot .
They 're not really enthusiastic about it .
They would prefer a single - payer approach with more government .
And on the conservative side , they 're not crazy about it either .
They would like a market approach , people getting vouches or a tax credit and just shop in the marketplace .
This is down - the - middle legislation .
And yet we see these fears and concerns as if this were a radical approach .
It 's not a radical approach .
It 's just a down - the - middle approach .
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON : People who are angry and frustrated and not necessarily well informed in part driven by people who are on the other side of the reform effort .
And it 's driving into news evocative visuals that are leading the public , I think , to overgeneralize the extent to which there is principal , reasoned dissent from health care reform .
DREW ALTMAN : But I think what also happens is , the concerns of most Americans , of average Americans , just get lost in this process .
This whole debate began because of the real problems and worries that average people are having paying their health care bills .
And what we really have here are the strong concerns and fears -- and you do n't want to minimize them ; it 's part of our democracy -- that some people have about this legislation .
But the worries that average people have that we see in our polls about paying their bills get lost .
And in instead we 're debating other things , fears that people have that really are n't there in the legislation .
BILL MOYERS : How do we decide who these people represent ?
I mean , are they just a fringe element that are like honey to the cameras of the press ?
Or is there something else going on that 's difficult at this moment to measure ?
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON : I 'm not sure that we should be trying to measure it .
I worry about public opinion polls coming into this environment and asking questions that may actually distort our understanding of what the public knows .
Unless you start by asking the public in a poll what they know , what the baseline level of knowledge is , it does n't matter what the public thinks ultimately about a piece of legislation or not because you can be reflecting uninformed public opinion .
But the nature of public opinion it 's expressed in " USA Today " in -- at a front - page piece that appeared on Thursday of this week which says " Protests Tilt Views on Health Care Bill . "
Now that 's reflecting the results of a poll that asked about people 's response not to the health care bill but to the protests about the health care bill .
But the headline leads you to think it 's about the health care bill itself .
And it suggests that public opinion is now shifting dramatically away from the Obama health care reform efforts .
BILL MOYERS : So the protests seem to be making some people more sympathetic to the protesters ?
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON :
And potentially the press then picks that up , polls , finds that sympathy , creates a structure that suggests that health care reform initiatives are losing support .
Now polls have driven press coverage which says " Obama on the defensive .
Obama struggling to explain .
Obama trying , " when , in fact , the dynamic under that has been created by a news structure that decided to cover this in a certain way , to do polling in a certain way .
And those two things played into the process to make it more difficult for the discussion to actually happen about the substance of what 's going on .
DREW ALTMAN : So it 's exactly right .
So we have the protests , the media coverage , especially the 24 - hour news cycle , follows the protests and the town meetings .
Then the polls poll about the media coverage of the protests .
And we create almost an alternative reality about what is occurring out there .
When you look at the real polls about where the public actually is , what you see is there 's been a little bit of a tick down in public support and people are getting a little anxious as they follow the media coverage .
But still the majority of the American people are for moving forward with this .
And we have seen more people begin to say , " Gee , I 'm not so sure that this is good for me and my family , " but it 's still a small number .
It 's only 20 , 22 percent who say , " I 'm a little bit worried about this . "
And a much bigger number say , " I still think this is good for me and my family . "
And then you 've got a group in the middle who 's not so sure .
And everyone 's fighting for that group on both sides .
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON :
And imagine if you 're trying now as just a person who 's sitting in your home and you do all sorts of other things , you have a job , you have children , you know , you have all sorts of concerns .
And what you get of this debate is what comes through news .
The pictures that you 're seeing are -- because the news is focusing on conflict and attack , are a very angry people shouting at representatives .
First , no substantive information .
But secondly , what are n't you seeing ?
Well , you are n't seeing something that actually was featured on the front page of " The New York Times " this week .
" Free health care draws thousands .
Thousands of people came to the forum in Englewood , California , for free dental care and free medical and vision services . "
People at protests -- people protesting health care reform shouting at legislators as opposed to people waiting for free health care and dental care --
DREW ALTMAN : Who ca n't afford it otherwise .
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON :
Who ca n't afford it otherwise .
DREW ALTMAN : Right .
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON :
Now suppose we saw more of these pictures and fewer of those or just a balance of the two .
You'd have a completely different sense of what 's at play in the debate .
Pictures matter .
Evocative visuals lead us to generalize to what 's important to the framing of the debate , how we should see this discussion .
And also they help shape the answers to those public opinion polls .
More pictures of people dissenting , more sense that maybe we should hold back a little in our support .
More pictures of people in need of care , people just like us who do n't have it , greater sense that maybe there 's a social concern here .
And then the question might I , the insured , at some point be in that situation ?
DREW ALTMAN : And you really got to feel bad for just the American people who , from the beginning , have just been trying to answer one question .
Will this help me with my health care bills ?
That 's the question they 're trying to answer .
And so they 're turning on the television and they 're seeing a debate about whether this is Russia or it is n't Russia and whether there are death panels and whether it's a government take over of the health care system .
And they just want to know " my premiums are going up $ 1 thousand every five years .
And is this going to help me with that ' cause I can't pay my rent or my mortgage ?
I 'm having trouble paying for my food because of my health care bills . "
That 's really the question they want answered .
Before you begin working in the yard this summer , you need to be sure your tools are in good shape .
A lawnmower can only work so well without maintenance ; hoses waste water if they are leaking ; weed eating can cause back strain if you do n’t pay attention to several factors .
Check out these tips that will lead to a better yard this summer .
Your Lawnmower
Change the filter if you have not changed it since last year .
If you have a plastic filter and have changed it recently , remove it and clean it with warm , soapy water .
If your mower has a paper filter , replace it .
Disconnect the spark plug and turn the mower on its side and clear out old dried grass and debris carefully .
You may need a screwdriver to remove hard clumps .
Use the water hose to spray it clean .
If your yard has a fungus , use a disinfecting spray or liquid to clean it thoroughly .
Check the status of the spark plug .
If it shows signs of wear such as black marks or oil stains , you might want to replace it ; if not , at least remove it and clean with a wire brush .
Set it aside until all other maintenance is done .
The blade should be balanced and sharp .
Wear thick work gloves and remove the nut that holds the blade in place .
Use a metal file and sharpen the beveled edge .
If you do n’t feel comfortable performing this task yourself , take the blade – or even the entire mower – to a repair shop to have the blade sharpened .
Check the balance using a level while it is on the post but unscrewed .
An unbalanced blade results in poor cutting patterns and can also damage your grass .
Additionally , an unbalanced blade can damage your mower .
Once the blade is balanced and sharp again , use your thick work gloves to replace the blade and the nut .
Replace the spark plug .
Water hoses
Check every inch of your water hoses before you begin to water .
You can use plumber ’s tape and duct tape to seal small cracks , but you will have to monitor them throughout the summer to be certain the leaks have not resprung .
Replace the washers in the connectors if you use more than one hose or any sprinkler attachments .
These plastic or rubber washers can save money on your water bill and only cost about a dollar for a pack of 10 .
Weed - eaters
There are numerous types and brands of weed - eaters .
Depending on how much grass you need to edge and how many trees you need to edge around , you want to get the lightest weight weed - eater you can find .
Look for one that has a curved handle and that has an adjustable height clip .
This can be a back - breaking chore if you have one that is too heavy or short .
Another consideration is whether to use a gas - powered or electric machine .
If using a corded machine remember to keep the cord out of any water sources as a precaution against electrocution .
If you plan to use a gas - powered machine , consider purchasing a clip - on shoulder strap to ease back strain .
Also remember that gas - powered machines require special oil and gas mixtures in order for the machine to function properly , so be sure you want that additional step in your yard care regimen .
Once you are gassed - up or plugged in , be sure the handle and base guard are tightly secured so that they do n’t slip or fly off during operation of the machine
Loppers and hedge clippers
Long poles with a cutting device at the top attached to a rope handle are called loppers ( sometimes pronouned LO - pers ) .
This tool allows you to trim your higher tree branches without using a ladder .
Check the extending pole lock clamp to be sure it still locks tightly , if not , it is your choice – use it at your own risk , or get a new pole .
Check the rope handle to be sure the rope glides smoothly in its bracket , and check the blade to be sure it is free of debris at the joint and on the actual blade itself .
You can use mineral oil or WD - 40 for cleaning and oiling purposes .
Short - handled hedge clippers need to provide a crisp cut in order to prevent damage to your trees and shrubs .
Check the hinges and blades .
You can sharpen your blades using heavy grit sandpaper and cutting the paper a few times , or take them to a lawnmower shop to be sharpened .
Be sure the handles are not damaged and are attached securely to the blade .
Some handles have a small screw that can be tightened to keep the handles tightly attached .
Now that your yard care tools are ready for action , be sure you take care of your body .
Use a sunscreen , wear protective gloves , use bug repellent , and dress in loose clothing coupled with close - toed shoes .
Have water available instead of soda or tea because sugary and caffeinated beverages can add to dehydration .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress he has an exit strategy to rein in excess growth in the monetary base when the time comes .
The problem is , any action that would reduce the bloated monetary base would do so by increasing interest rates , and Bernanke has also said he will keep interest rates low to support the recovery .
The recovery is likely to be slow , for one reason because the “ stimulus package ” imposes so much government spending on the economy , which must be supported by private sector productivity , and because of the burden of the trillion dollar deficits President Obama projects for as far out as they are projected .
Ironically , the “ stimulus ” measures we ’ve undertaken will slow the recovery , not help it .
Thus , Bernanke will be reluctant to raise interest rates as an anti-inflationary measure until we actually see rising prices .
By that time , it will be too late to prevent inflation .
As Milton Friedman said , with monetary policy there are long and variable lags .
Once inflation starts to show up , it will continue for a few years even if Bernanke starts anti-inflationary moves ( which will come with higher interest rates ) immediately .
If the economy enters a robust recovery , higher interest rates wo n’t be a problem .
If the recovery is sluggish , Bernanke is likely to hold off on inflation to support the economy .
How high would inflation have to get before Bernanke saw it as a problem ?
Three percent ?
Four percent ?
If he waited that long to deal with it , we ’d have inflation several percentage points higher than that before inflation actually moderated .
Will Bernanke be skillful enough , or lucky enough , to work a balancing strategy between supporting a fragile economy and keeping inflation in check ?
I ’m guessing no , because there is too much of a temptation to hold off on the inflation front until confronted by the actual evidence of rising prices , and by then there will be several more years of rising inflation before it starts to fall again .
This is just what happened in the 1970s .
We knew how to stop inflation , but we also knew it would be painful ( that pain was the 1982 recession ) , so we put it off until inflation went into double digits .
Bernanke is a smart guy , and he knows monetary history — including the monetary history of the 1970s — very well .
So what I ’m saying would not be news to him .
He just thinks he ’ll be able to balance the twin goals of supporting a weak economy and keeping inflation in check so that inflation does n’t reappear .
I ’m not confident he can do this .
I ’m guessing that in five years we ’ll be looking at inflation in the 5 to 10 percent range , but if it gets as high as 15 percent I would n’t be surprised .
Yes , once it gets over five percent we ’ll be concerned and want to do something about it , but by then it may be too late to stop it from getting to 10 percent .
And if we ’re still concerned about the soft economy when inflation gets to 7 - 8 percent , an eventual rate of 15 percent would look more likely .
Bernanke says he has an exit strategy , and I hope he ’s able to pull it off more successfully than when Nixon told us he had an exit strategy for the Vietnam war .
I ’m hopeful , but not optimistic .
( CNN ) --
The international governing body for athletics urged caution Friday after reports that the world - champion South African runner Caster Semenya has both male and female organs .
The front cover of You magazine shows Semenya after a recent makeover .
The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia and The Sun newspaper in Britain reported that gender tests ordered by the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) show the 18 - year - old is a hermaphrodite .
Neither paper named the source of their information .
IAAF spokesman Nick Davies would not discuss the findings with CNN .
" I simply have n't seen the results , " Davies said .
" We have received the results from Germany , but they now need to be examined by a group of experts and we will not be in a position to speak to the athlete about them for at least a few weeks .
" After that , depending on the results , we will meet privately with the athlete to discuss further action . "
Has Semenya been treated fairly ?
The IAAF issued a statement , saying no decision on the case will be announced until the experts can look at the results .
A final decision regarding the case is not expected before the IAAF Council meets in late November in Monaco , the IAAF said .
Davies also said the news reports should be treated with caution .
The newspapers said extensive physical examinations of Semenya show she has no ovaries , but rather has internal testes , which are producing large amounts of testosterone .
What is intersexuality ?
Semenya won the women 's 800 - meters gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin last month .
She crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in 1 minute , 55.45 seconds -- the best women 's time in the world this year .
Defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei of Kenya took the silver and Jennifer Meadows of Britain claimed bronze .
The IAAF said it was seeking tests on Semenya 's gender even before that race .
Davies said questions about her were first raised after her astonishing displays at the African junior championships in July , with her masculine build and surprising performance fueling the rumors .
South Africans reacted angrily to Friday 's reports , with one newspaper headline declaring " outrage . "
Sport and Recreation Minister Makhenkesi Stofile said he was " shocked and disgusted " at the treatment that Semenya has received from the media , the IAAF , and the world .
" She may be a hermaphrodite , but so what ?
She is still a girl , " Stofile told a news conference in Pretoria .
Even if Semenya has an unfortunate " proportion of hormones , " he said , she is still " a young girl enjoying growing up . "
Stofile said he believes the teenager 's human rights have been violated and that she was not given a chance to understand what the gender testing was all about .
South Africa will fight back if Semenya is excluded from further competition , Stofile said , adding , " It will be a third world war . "
All indications were Friday that , at the very least , Semenya may be able to keep the gold medal she won in Berlin .
" Our legal advice is that , if she proves to have an advantage because of the male hormones , then it will be extremely difficult to strip the medal off her , since she has not cheated , " Davies told CNN .
Semenya 's countrymen -- including her father and the South Africa team manager -- have maintained that Semenya is a female .
Thousands of supporters crammed the airport in Johannesburg when she returned from Berlin last month .
And this week , the athlete appeared on the cover of a South African magazine wearing makeup , jewelry and a glamorous dress .
Under IAAF rules , any time there is suspicion about an athlete 's gender , the athlete can be asked to attend a medical evaluation before a panel consisting of a gynecologist , an endocrinologist , a psychologist , an internal medicine specialist and an expert on gender issues .
There are chromosome tests and scans of the athlete 's body , Davies has said .
He called gender verification -- which is generally required only for female athletes -- " an extremely complex procedure . "
The process of gender verification has undergone big changes since it was first introduced for international competition in the 1960s , the IAAF said .
The first mechanism involved " rather crude and perhaps humiliating physical examinations , " which soon gave way to mouth swabs to collect chromosomes , the IAAF said .
There were too many uncertainties regarding the mouth swabs , so the IAAF abandoned them in 1991 and the International Olympic Committee discontinued them in 2000 , the IAAF said .
A proper test has yet to be found , the IAAF said , and the current round of tests is considered a good interim solution .

← Tell Harry Reid : Stop the Silent Filibuster of a Public Option
At least one senator in the Democratic caucus is blocking a public option - but we do n't know who .
That 's because Majority Leader Harry Reid is protecting any senator who wants to join a Republican filibuster of health care reform .
This is n't just wrong , it 's deeply immoral .
If a Democrat wants to filibuster a public option , make them do it in public .
Harry Reid can no longer allow members of the Democratic caucus to block a public option behind the closed doors of the Senate .
Sign our petition to Harry Reid : force the silent filibuster senators out into the open .
It 's time for a public count for the public option .

Citing national security concerns , the Central Intelligence Agency is refusing to divulge dozens of documents in a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit surrounding its torture and rendition program adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
The withholding of documents dating to President George W. Bush 's administration leaves to the imagination just how damaging are those papers , one of which is a classified presidential directive authorizing CIA " black sites , " or secret prisons .
That 's because the government has already released reports detailing abusive interrogation techniques including waterboarding and sleep deprivation .
Among other things , the government has also divulged its legal rational for its torture program .
Yet the CIA told a federal judge late Monday in an ongoing American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit that there likely would be no more documents forthcoming .
" The documents at issue contain information that implicates intelligence activities , sources , and methods , and information relating to the foreign relations and activities of the United States , " Wendy Hilton , a CIA officer , wrote ( .pdf ) to U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York , who is presiding over a FOIA lawsuit .
Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU 's National Security Project , said the CIA 's position " is entirely incompatible with the Obama administration 's stated commitment to ending torture and restoring governmental transparency . "
Jaffer said in a statement that Obama has publicly recognized that " torture undermines the rule of law and America 's standing in the world , but on the other , the CIA continues to argue in court that it cannot disclose information about its torture techniques because it would jeopardize the CIA 's interrogation program . "
Hilton , an associate information review CIA officer , wrote that the information sought " is classified , as its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in serious or exceptionally grave damage to the national security . "
Among other things , here 's what the government 's wants kept secret :
" The classified and otherwise protected information at issue includes information concerning the capture , detention , confinement , and interrogation of known and suspected terrorists .
The information impacting foreign relations contained within the documents includes the locations of CIA intelligence activities overseas and the assistance provided by certain foreign governments in furtherance of those activities . "
The ACLU has won the release of parts or all of about five dozen documents .

Scientific advances means that there are many more medications for ailments than ever before .
However , all drugs carry some side effects , and the degree of severity and length of time a patient suffers these side effects varies patient to patient .
Hair loss can be temporarily caused by a large number of commonly prescribed medications .
Patients are often unaware that taking a drug can not only trigger the onset of male pattern baldness and female pattern hair loss but also lead to permanent baldness .
Doctors sometimes do not mention hair loss as a side effect because some deem it ‘ cosmetic ’ so it is always sensible read the small print in the drug manufacturer ’s warnings .
If in doubt , you should ask your pharmacist to explain things fully to you .
Below is a list of common conditions that patients are prescribed medications for which may have hair loss as a side effect ( excluding drugs for cancer treatment ) .
If you are suffering from any of these issues and are taking medication or considering taking medications , it is advisable to ask you doctor about the subsequent shedding .
It may be possible to substitute drugs for a type with less or no risk of hair fall , or it may be possible to supplement the medications with proven hair loss treatments .
Acne ( All drugs derived from vitamin A as treatments for acne or other conditions )
Blood Disorders ( for which patients are prescribed blood thinners )
Cholesterol ( eg Statins )
Depression ( anti- depression drugs including commonly prescribed Prozac , Zoloft )
Diet ( eg Amphetamines )
Fungus ( eg Antifungals )
Glaucoma ( eg Beta - blockers )
Gout
Heart ( including Beta- Blockers )
High Blood Pressure ( including Beta- Blockers )
Hormonal Conditions ( eg Birth Control Pills , Hormone - replacement Therapy ( HRT ) for women , Male androgenic hormones and all forms of testosterone , anabolic steroids )
Inflammation ( eg many anti-inflammatory drugs including those prescribed for localized pain , swelling and injury )
Parkinson ’s Disease
Thyroid Disorders
Ulcer ( eg drugs for indigestion , stomach disorders , and ulcers , including over - the - counter dosages and prescription dosages )
While hair loss can be distressing , obviously it goes without saying that you should not stop taking a drug that may improve your state of health just because it causes hair loss .
However , it is worth researching as thoroughly as you can and seeing what options are available to you .

Here 's information on using Capistrano with the Glass Fish gem
If you have a fairly straightforward Rails app without a lot of service dependencies and a greenfield deployment target , your best bet is probably the Glass Fish gem right now .
It performs really well , can handle high loads and high concurrency , and automatically detects Rails ' threadsafe mode , scaling better when it 's turned on .
I 'm no longer a Sun employee , and I still think the GF gem is an outstanding piece of work .
Here 's my howto on GF gem + JRuby on Rails +
Apache
If you have an existing Java EE or web container like Tomcat , JBoss , GlassFish , WebLogic , or WebSphere , you want to look into Warbler .
Warbler packages your application as a . war file , suitable for deployment on any of these standard servers .
The Warbler wiki is the best place to learn about deploying with Warbler .
If you 're looking for something that 's somewhat greenfield but also needs more advanced services like scheduled asynchronous jobs , web services , and some level of EE integration , you should look at JBoss 's TorqueBox , a customized JBoss specially tailored for deployment of Rack - based apps ( like Rails ) on JRuby .
If you 're looking for a hosting provider that can take your app and make it " just work " , then you should look into Engine Yard 's JRuby cloud offering .
We do n't yet have it 100 % ready to go , but it wo n't be long and it will be fantastic .
For now you can give us some direction and input on what that hosting / cloud should look like .
All told , there 's a lot of great options for JRuby deployment , and no one of them is going to be perfect for everyone .
Choose wisely , and join the JRuby mailing lists if you have questions .
We often get the question " which deployment option is the best for JRuby on Rails ? "
The truth is that it depends on what you need out of deployment .
PITTSBURGH --
The leaders of the U.S. , France and Britain charged Iran has built a secret nuclear facility designed to give the Islamic republic the ability to build an atomic weapon , a revelation that significantly raises the stakes in the West 's intensifying face - off with Tehran .
President Barack Obama made the disclosure Friday as heads of government gathered here for a G - 20 summit on the world 's financial and climate - change problems .
U.S. officials said the discovery of the underground site , near the holy city of Qom , supported the long - held belief that Tehran is operating a second , clandestine facility to produce the highly enriched uranium used in making a nuclear bomb .
Iran has a previously disclosed enrichment facility in Natanz .
President Obama said the public disclosure of the site -- which he was briefed on shortly after his election last fall -- gives Washington a new tool to unite the international community against Iran going into a pivotal face - to - face meeting with Iranian officials next Thursday in Geneva .
" Iran is breaking rules that all nations must follow , endangering the global nonproliferation regime , denying its own people access to the opportunity they deserve , and threatening the stability and security of the region and the world , " Mr. Obama said .
He was flanked by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
Both Russia and China , who are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council along with the U.S. , Britain and France , have opposed stiffer economic sanctions on Tehran .
The Western powers now hope the Qom facility will sway them .
A Queens man needed a doctor after a house call from a surly Verizon repairman who pummeled him — and never fixed the problem , according to a lawsuit .
Robert Benjamin pounded Aubrey Isakson , 37 , after the suspicious customer — told earlier that the repair would n’t require access to his Sunnyside apartment — demanded ID and would n’t let him inside , the suit filed in Queens Supreme Court charges .
“ You want to know my name ?
Here ’s my name , ” Benjamin snarled , slapping his ID card into Isakson ’s face , according to Isakson ’s account of the December 2008 confrontation .
“ The guy essentially snapped .
He cold - cocked me , hit me two or three solid shots to the head while my hands were down , ” said Isakson , a limo driver .
He said the pounding bloodied his face and broke his glasses .
But things got uglier , Isakson said , when Benjamin squeezed him around the neck and pressed him up against the wall .
“ He ’s prepared to kill me , ” Isakson said .
“ That ’s all I could think of . ”
Isakson said he broke free and ran down the stairs — fracturing his ankle along the way — to get help in his building ’s lobby .
One of his neighbors , an off - duty cop , grabbed Benjamin , who had chased after Isakson .
Benjamin was arrested and charged with assault .
But prosecutors offered to dismiss the case if Benjamin agreed to stay out of trouble for six months — despite assuring Isakson there would be no deal , Isakson alleged .
“ According to what I was told , there was an error by the DA ’s staff , ” Isakson said .
“ They ’re giving this guy carte blanche to do this every six months . ”
The Queens District Attorney ’s Office , citing the pending litigation , declined to comment .
Isakson ’s lawyer , Marc Albert , said every company has a responsibility to screen employees .
“ This is especially true with Verizon because of the level of interaction with customers , ” Albert said .
Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company has “ zero tolerance for any sort of unethical or illegal behavior ” and noted Benjamin was not convicted of any crime .
“ In the months since this incident , his conduct has been blameless .
As a result , we will not take further action , ” Young said .
Benjamin did not return calls for comment .
Two days after the alleged beatdown , Isakson got a call from the Verizon technical service department .
“ We think we figured out what the problem was , ” Isakson recalled them saying .
“ They did n’t even need to send this guy . ”

McLaren's Pat Fry believes Formula 1 will continue to see big fluctuations in performance and unpredictable results into the 2010 season as teams have only scratched the surface of the current rules so far .
The 2009 season has been one of the most unpredictable in years , with Brawn and Red Bull taking turns at dominating early on , Ferrari and McLaren starting slowly before recovering ground , and Spa seeing a shock Force India , Toyota and BMW one - two - three in qualifying .
Fry , the chief engineer on this season 's McLaren MP4 - 24 , thinks it will be a long while before the field settles down into a more stable order , as this year 's rule changes were so comprehensive teams are set to continue finding big steps with their packages .
" The level of performance gained in the season , historically a couple of years into a new set of rule changes , the development rate seems to level out , " said Fry during the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Phone-in .
" I still think we 're at a very , very early stage in terms of understanding what you can actually do within the current aero package .
A lot of people were adapting the ' double ' diffusers onto their cars rather than having designed them for it .
So I 'm sure there will be variations on that which might take a year or two to settle out .
" I think there will be a reasonably steep learning curve through into the middle of next year .
A car can be good at one track and then the order can swap at the next . "
He thinks the current tyre regulations are also playing a big part in shaking up the pecking order from race to race .
" We 're relatively light on tyres so running a soft tyre in Hungary and Valencia , we could manage a long stint on that when other people could n't , " said Fry .
" If you get a bad day at Silverstone with a hard tyre in cold weather , no one would be able to get the tyres up to temperature , so that would swing in favour of the cars that are harsher on their tyres .
As well as just aero development through the season , I think tyre choice is swinging the order around . "
McLaren 's own form has varied considerably during the 2009 season , with the team struggling to break out of Q1 in the early summer races but then taking a commanding victory with Lewis Hamilton at the Hungaroring and finishing on the podium in Valencia .
But just a week later at Spa , Hamilton returned to the midfield as the team struggled for fast corner pace .
Fry is optimistic that McLaren 's current development programme can address this issue before Suzuka - the next circuit on the schedule where fast corners are prevalent .
" Suzuka will certainly be interesting , " he said .
" I suppose if you look at our development throughout the year , it was obvious at the start of the year we were lacking an amount of downforce compared to the rest of the grid .
" In terms of ultimate downforce , at Spa and Monza you 've got to have the efficiency .
Suzuka is less about efficiency and more about the overall downforce , so it 's a different set of challenges .
We 're still very good I think in low and medium speed corners .
We still need to work , and we are working hard , on improving high speed cornering .
This is obviously through aero research .
" The development that we 're doing hopefully for Singapore and then onto Suzuka will see us make another step improvement from where we 've been on high speed cornering . "

Ares 1 test flight moved up four days
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : September 22 , 2009
NASA has decided to move up the first test launch of its new Ares 1 rocket by four days to Oct. 27 , the agency announced Tuesday .
Previously scheduled for Oct. 31 , the $ 350 million flight will give rocket designers an early look at the aerodynamic , control and acoustic characteristics of the new crew - carrying booster .
Managers met Monday and approved the date change because preparations for the Ares 1 - X test flight are ahead of schedule at the Kennedy Space Center .
" We can make that date and we got on the range , so that 's what we 're working toward , " said Amber Philman , a NASA spokesperson .
The launch team conducts a countdown simulation earlier this month .

Technicians finished stacking the 327 - foot - tall rocket last month .
Workers have since tested more than 700 data - collecting sensors scattered throughout the rocket , shook the vehicle to gauge its response to vibrations , and powered up the launcher 's electronics systems for testing .
After a few more checks and closeouts , the rocket will be rolled from the Vehicle Assembly Building to launch pad 39B on Oct. 19 for eight more days of prep work .
A flight readiness review will be held on Oct. 23 , according to NASA .
Meanwhile , launch controllers are polishing their procedures during a series of countdown simulations inside Firing Room 1 of the Launch Control Center .
The team completed a simulation Tuesday that tested their ability to respond to problems in the countdown .
" This launch simulation assembled almost the entire launch team here at Kennedy for the first time , " a NASA spokesperson said .
" With unexpected problems intentionally introduced into the countdown , it exercised their engineering expertise as well as their judgment to reach the simulated liftoff . "
One more dry run is slated for about three weeks before launch .
Although the real Ares 1 wo n't debut until 2015 or 2016 , officials planned the two - minute Ares 1 - X test launch to occur before the rocket 's critical design review .
That will give engineers enough time to incorporate lessons learned from the demonstration flight into the final vehicle .
The rocket includes a stock four - segment solid rocket booster from the shuttle program , a simulated fifth segment of the first stage , a dummy second stage , and a mock Orion capsule , where the crew would be seated for liftoff during a real launch .
Back in October , not long after Lehman Brothers collapsed and triggered a meltdown on Wall Street , the usually prim Financial Times mocked the alumni at Harvard Business School ’s 100 - year anniversary gala as they “ sipped champagne and chatted fondly about old times . ”
( “ We will leave the talk of fixing the blame to others , ” Harvard ’s dean assured the gathering . )
BusinessWeek piled on , hosting an online debate : “ Business schools are largely responsible for the U.S. financial crisis .
Pro or con ? ”
These and other critics wondered :
What had they been teaching our nation ’s best and brightest in these MBA programs , anyway ?
“ In a way , finance professors caused this problem — I ’m not bragging about this , ” says Charles Trzcinka , who chairs the finance department at Indiana University –Bloomington ’s Kelley School of Business .
He points out that many of the financial tools that played a starring role in the current crisis , from the countless ways to divvy up and sell mortgage - backed securities to the explosion of credit default swaps , were taught in business schools without , often , a full appreciation for how they could go sour — if , say , housing prices cratered or large counterparties went bust .
Business schools are n’t , of course , primarily responsible for the implosion of global finance .
But , across the country , business - school faculties are grappling with the possibility that they ’ve been instilling generations of students with a naive faith in free markets , teaching them to focus solely on short - term profits , and justifying some of the more outrageous executive - compensation schemes that have become Exhibit A in the case against corporate America .

In recent decades , the swelling of the U.S. financial sector has meant boom times for B - schools .
By 2007 some elite business schools were shipping out roughly 40 percent of their graduates to large investment banks , hedge funds , and private equity firms , while students were elbowing their way into electives like “ Corporate Financial Engineering . ”
Trouble was , students often were n’t learning as much as they should have .
“ There were so many people who just wanted to learn enough to get a job in this field , ” says Trzcinka .
Out in the corporate world , many managers failed to grasp the subtleties and limitations of the mind - boggling mathematical models that were helping them earn outsized returns .
“ Look at Lehman Brothers in 2005 :
If you were one of the chief risk officers , what could you have done to convince senior management that you were heading for disaster ? ” asks Andrew Lo , who teaches financial engineering at MIT .
“ I ’d argue virtually nothing .
Unless senior management understood these models to the extent that [ their quantitative analysts ] did , there ’s no way you could convince them to pull back — business was too profitable . ”
Instead it was blown off course by strong winds and crashed on its side by trees and hedges half a mile away in a farmer 's field by the A428 .
The story of how the President 's Special Advisor for Green Jobs became the biggest , scariest villain of the right wing ( this week , anyway ) is also the story of how the right wing information delivery process works now .
Here 's the biography of Van Jones : he was a bookish black kid from Tennessee who went to Yale Law and moved to San Francisco and became a radical .
Then he decided to use his law degree and smarts to clean up and make things better from inside the establishment .
He was , he openly acknowledges , a " full - on Marxist " in early ' 90s California .
He joined a revolutionary Marxist group and protested police brutality .
Then he founded the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights , which combats over - incarceration , police brutality , and urban poverty and violence .
Running a civil rights group dedicated to producing real and immediate improvements in urban life will make a revolutionary Marxist a bit more pragmatic .
Jones began focusing on job creation , and , with a bit of prognostic intuition that ought to put Thomas Friedman to shame , he decided , in the late - '90s , to focus on " Green Jobs . "
This is , you know , capitalism — he wants to create wealth , and use market forces to make the world and black communities better places !
And in 2008 he wrote a book called The Green Collar Economy , and it made the Times best - seller list , making him as much of a figure of the mainstream as Sean Hannity or Malcolm Gladwell .
So here we have a radical youth turned respectable liberal .
Respectable enough to be on Time magazine listicles and win World Economic Forum prizes and everything .
Respectable enough for Tom Friedman to profile him .
And The New Yorker .
Respectable enough for Meg Whitman , as in former eBay CEO and wealthy Republican California gubernatorial candidate and John McCain advisor Meg Whitman , to proclaim herself " a huge fan of Van Jones . "
And for both his activism and his charm he was rewarded with a White House job with the Council on Environmental Quality .
He was tasked with making sure stimulus money for green jobs actually went to green jobs .
And he 's a great person to have in this administration — he is a genuine environmentalist and the only special interest he 's beholden to is poor people .
He is the sort of person we were all praying Obama would bring with him to DC , instead of Larry Summers .
And that is one of the reasons he is now being ritually and savagely demonized .
To understand why and how he 's being demonized , we have to look at the way information and misinformation makes it way from crazy blogs to crazy pundits to crazy citizens to , suddenly , the non-crazy regular media .
The " why " is simple : he is a genuine left - wing liberal with a White House job .
He is black .
He used to be radical , and probably still has radical sympathies ( you know , caring about poor black people and all that ) .
He is , in other words , fucking terrifying , if you frame his story right .
World Net Daily is an old and hugely popular far - right conspiracy " news " website .
We 've discussed their promotion and popularization of the birther conspiracy but both their influence and insanity cannot be understated .
They have a huge email list .
The people on that list click on ads and spend money .
WND is almost as profitable as Gawker Media .
The RNC needs access to that list .
So they humor them .
And they sponsor them .
And these are the people who insist that there will be FEMA concentration camps and a NAFTA superhighway and a single North American currency and , yes , it is birther central .
WND discovered Jones in April .
They took publicly available information about Jones ' civil rights past , his arrest at a Rodney King protest ( he was not charged with anything because it was one of those illegal but common mass arrests ) and his own statements about his youthful radicalism and made a scary , scary story called " Will a ' red ' help blacks go green ? "
Wow , right ?
And , yes , these were not secrets — remember the Friedman and New Yorker profiles ?
Dave Weigel explains how this all snowballed in The Washington Independent : On July 23 , Glenn Beck talked about this " self - avowed communist " he discovered in the Obama administration .
He brought him up again and again and again over the next month , until his amazing late - August week - long series almost entirely about how Van Jones and Van Jones alone is proof that Obama has a goon squad of violent leftists looking to remake the country as some sort of collectivist Soviet Republic .
Here is the message machine in its platonic form : Glenn Beck introduces his audience to a group Jones once belonged to called " The Apollo Alliance " on August 24th .
72 hours later a constituent is asking his ( Republican ) representative if this Apollo Alliance wrote the health care bill .
The Rep has no idea what the guy is talking about , but the rest of the audience certainly does ( " Van Jones ! " they shout ) .
And now , here we are .
His name on an old 9/11 truther petition is dredged up .
An amusing clip in which he calls Republicans assholes ( but explains that he , too , is an asshole ) is on CBS News .
Jake Tapper and Politico are on the case .
That is how a smear becomes a meme .
Schoolhouse Rock , 2009 style .
Does the concept of an intelligent designer make sense ?
Human beings explain features of the world around them in two main ways .
One way is to supply naturalistic explanations that appeal to features of the natural world , such as natural events , forces and laws .
The explanations of physics and chemistry fall into this category .
The other way is to offer intentional explanations – explanations that appeal to the beliefs and desires of more or less rational agents .
Why is there a tree in this spot ?
Because
Ted wanted to see a tree from his bedroom window , and so planted a sapling here correctly supposing it would grow into a handsome tree .
When we are unable to explain something naturalistically , it is , of course , tempting to look for an intentional explanation instead .
When we could not offer naturalistic explanations for why the heavenly bodies moved about as they did , we supposed that they must be , or must be moved by , agents - gods of some sort .
When we could not otherwise explain diseases and natural disasters , we put them down to the actions of malevolent agents , such as witches and demons .
When we could not provide naturalistic explanations for the growth of plants and the cycle of the seasons , we again invoked agents – sprites , fairies , and gods of various sorts .
As our scientific understanding of the world has increased , the need to invoke witches , fairies , demons and other such agents to account for features of the natural world has diminished .
However , when we ask : why does the natural world exist at all , and what explains why it has the fundamental laws does ?
such naturalistic explanations are not available .
So an explanation in terms of the activity of some sort of transcendent agent might seem attractive .
But does such an explanation even make sense ?
Suppose I claim that there exists a non-spatial mountain .
It ’s a mountain – with a sharp summit flanked by valleys and steep crags .
Only it is not located or extended in space at all .
It does not have spatial dimensions .
This mountain transcends our spatial world .
You might well ask me why I suppose there is any such mountain .
And if I cannot give you good reasons , you will rightly be sceptical .
But actually , is n’t there a rather more fundamental problem with my claim that such a mountain exists ?
Ca n’t we know , before we get to the question of whether there is any evidence for the existence of my non-spatial mountain , that there can be no such thing ?
For the very idea of such a mountain makes no sense .
My hypothetical mountain has a summit and valleys and steep cliffs , but these are all features that require spatial extension .
A summit requires that one part of the mountain be higher than another .
A valley must be lower than the surrounding terrain .
The concepts of a mountain , summit , valleys , and so on are concepts that can only sensibly be applied within a spatial context .
Strip that context away and we end up talking nonsense .
But if we now turn to the concept of a transcendent designer , does that make any more sense ?
The concept of an agent has its home within a temporal setting .
An agent is someone or thing that performs actions as a result of its various beliefs and desires .
But actions are events that happen at particular moments in time .
And beliefs and desires are psychological states that have a temporal duration .
Now when we suppose that the spatio - temporal universe was created by some sort of agent , we are presumably supposing it was designed by a non-temporal agent – an agent that does not ( or at least did not then ) exist in time .
For there was not yet any time for the agent to exist in .
But if desires are psychological states with temporal duration , how , then , could this agent possess the desire to create the universe ?
And how did it perform the act of creation if there was not yet any time in which actions might be performed ?
It is hard to see how talk of a non-temporal agent makes any more sense than talk of a non-spatial mountain .
We could sidestep these puzzles by supposing that God exists , and has always existed , in time .
This provides God with the necessary temporal dimension in which he might possess the desire to produce a universe , draw up a design , and perform the act of creation
But it raises a host of other bizarre questions , such as : why did God wait so long before creating the universe ( presumably , if God did not himself have a beginning , an infinitely long time ) ?
And what was he doing in the meantime ?
There are many essential things that you may not think of when you go away to school .
You may get through the semester without them , but after you have these , your life will never be the same .
Okay maybe that was a little dramatic but get ready because college life is full of drama .
College is exciting and nothing else in your life is quite like it .
So get ready for some good times and make sure that you have these items included in your suitcases .
1. Soundproof headphones .
These are a college essential .
Sometimes you need to shut out the world and this is the best way .
If you need to study for a test , get a good night 's rest which does n't include listening to your roommate snoring , or you do n't want to listen to the boy band downstairs , or other noises and distractions , these headphones are a great way to go .
2. Cork Board .
A cork board is not only fairly cheap but it can be used to take telephone messages , write notes , keep announcements of upcoming parties or study sessions , and used to hang pictures of you and some friends or family .
3. Putty .
The last and final thing is putty that can be used on your walls to hang things up .
While nails and pins used to hang pictures may not be allowed in your apartments because they leave holes , there is a simple solution .
You can use putty to hang your favorite pictures on the wall , without leaving a scratch or a hole .
The putty is easy to remove and if it leaves anything on the wall , it can be wiped off .
4. Hot Water Bottle .
A hot water bottle or rice bag can also be really nice if you are going to school in a place that has more than one season .
Sometimes it can be chilly while doing homework or at night and the heating bill can get expensive .
This is a cheap way to warm yourself up .
5. Air Freshener .
Another item that may seem fairly simple is an air freshener .
Sometimes your roommates may not have the same rules of cleanliness that you follow .
By having an air freshener you are more likely to maintain your sanity .
College is a once in a lifetime experience and you can be ready for it by having these items .
These items will simplify and make your life more comfortable .
Whether you 're living on campus in the dorms , or off campus in an apartment , these purchases can help you in your life outside of the classroom .

Rajiv Janine is an 18 year - old Sri Lankan who was left without his arms after a train accident .
On Wednesday he fulfilled his dream of meeting Pope Benedict XVI and receiving his blessing after yesterday 's general audience .
Rajiv told the Holy Father his story and asked for a special blessing for his brother , who will soon be ordained to the priesthood , and for his sister who is a nun in the Philippines .
His older sister who helps take care of him was also present at the audience .
The prosthetic arms that Rajiv wears were purchased with help from a group of Italians that is also engaged in a series of solidarity projects in Sri Lanka to aid those affected by the 2004 tsunami , Fr. Giuseppe Iasso explained .
He told L’Osservatore Romano the money raised to help Rajiv was collected by “ sending letters and knocking on the doors of parishes and families until $ 56,000 dollars were raised .
Many kids gave all of their savings and even an elderly woman in a wheelchair helped us with her savings . ”
The meeting with Pope Benedict took place after the priest sent a letter to the Holy Father recounting Rajiv ’s story .
“ I opened my priestly heart to him and Benedict XVI wanted to personally meet with this young man to encourage him .
Rajiv ’s testimony , with his serenity despite all the pain of his handicap , is an invitation for all those who suffer not to be discouraged and to never lose hope , ” he said in conclusion .
“ I’m Prozak ! ”
A short story by Wilhelm ( 2009 )
****
[ Early Morning .
Somewhere in a discreet New York subway station .
A large aggregate boards the train .
Train takes off .
Silence inside .
Dreary souls abound . ]
[ A man , face twisted with determination stands from his seat and confronts the aggregate .
He shouts : ]
Random person # 1 : I ’m Prozak !
[ Momentary silence .
Then an obese woman , age undetermined , bounces off her seat and retorts : ]
Random person # 2 : No …… I ’M PROZAK !
[ Young punk with green runners and bullring throws down his iPod and screams : ]
Random person # 3 : Hey , fuck you bitch , I 'M PROZAK and I have PROOF !
[ The aggregate begins to seethe and suddenly the train erupts into disorder : ]
Random person #4 : I ’m PROZAK !
Random person # 5 : No , I am !!!!
Random person # 6 : [ knocks over elderly women on way to front of the aggregate ] PROZAK ?!?!?!!?
Hey , THAT ’S ME !!
Random person # 7 : [ throws scalding hot coffee onto Random person # 6 who falls over into a screaming heap ]
Oh no you ’re not !
I ’M PROZAK !!!!!!!!
[ More chaos , fights erupt , scalding hot coffee flies this way and that . ]
Persona al azar número 8 : ¡ Diablos !
¡ Soy Prozak !!!!!!!!
[ Train disappears into the darkness .
Quite in the shaft .
A rat scurries about ; water drips from a rusted pipe in the distance . ]
--
[…. Meanwhile , many miles above earth in a NASA space shuttle ]
Buzz # 1 : [ floating out of cockpit ]
Hey Buzz # 2 , I just received a strange transmission from Earth .
Buzz # 2 : [ back turned ; smearing peanut butter on a piece of toast ]
Yes Buzz # 1 , what was the transmission ?
Buzz # 1 : [ Pauses ]
Well sir , uh , it was coming from New York …. all I heard was something like “ I am Prozak . ”
Buzz # 2 : [ Tenses ; releases toast , bread drifts away ]
Buzz # 1 : Sir , are you OK ?
Buzz # 2 : IMPOSSIBLE !!!!!!!
Buzz # 1 : I do n’t understand , sir .
What is impossible ?
Buzz # 2 : IMPOSSIBLE !
[ turns around , brushes curly auburn hair from face ]
IMPOSSIBLE ……. I AM PROZAK !!!!!!!!!
Buzz # 1 : [ Mouth agape . ]

There 's some debate as to who Spinoza Ray Prozak is in real life .
Some claim he is another poster in the metal underground named Wilhelm ; others claim he is a group of people making up random stuff to make fun of others .
Still others suggest a single person is behind it all .
This story satirizes the situation :
If you read the writings on that site , it 's clear that it 's more than one person , which explains why there 's so much of it .

Facebook announced their new app for iPhone , version 3.0 with a hefty feature list .
Missing in the list was video capture and upload .
Joe Hewitt , a Facebook employee working on the iPhone app tweeted a day after , that video uploading has been implemented in the new Facebook iPhone app – but there ’s a catch .
You wo n’t be able to watch your friend ’s Facebook videos yet on the iPhone because Facebook videos are encoded in a very high bit rate which the iPhone does n’t play .
This might change in the future though , either through updates to the iPhone OS , or changes made by Facebook to encode videos in an iPhone compatible bit rate .
Even without the playback , it ’ll be great to use your iPhone 3G S to record and upload videos directly to Facebook .
Expect the new app to appear in the App Store this summer .
Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein have written a book entitled Nudge that advocates for a soft version of social engineering .
I have not read the book , but there is a short interview on Amazon.com that cites what I think to be most relevant :
Amazon.com :
What do you mean by “ nudge ” and why do people sometimes need to be nudged ?
Thaler and Sunstein :
By a nudge we mean anything that influences our choices .
A school cafeteria might try to nudge kids toward good diets by putting the healthiest foods at front .
We think that it ’s time for institutions , including government , to become much more user - friendly by enlisting the science of choice to make life easier for people and by gentling nudging them in directions that will make their lives better .
And
Amazon.com :
What is “ choice architecture ” and how does it affect the average person ’s daily life ?
Thaler and Sunstein : Choice architecture is the context in which you make your choice .
Suppose you go into a cafeteria .
What do you see first , the salad bar or the burger and fries stand ?
Where ’s the chocolate cake ?
Where ’s the fruit ?
These features influence what you will choose to eat , so the person who decides how to display the food is the choice architect of the cafeteria .
All of our choices are similarly influenced by choice architects .
The architecture includes rules deciding what happens if you do nothing ; what ’s said and what is n’t said ; what you see and what you do n’t .
Doctors , employers , credit card companies , banks , and even parents are choice architects .
We show that by carefully designing the choice architecture , we can make dramatic improvements in the decisions people make , without forcing anyone to do anything .
For example , we can help people save more and invest better in their retirement plans , make better choices when picking a mortgage , save on their utility bills , and improve the environment simultaneously .
Good choice architecture can even improve the process of getting a divorce–or ( a happier thought ) getting married in the first place !
A NYT article explains a very interesting example of nudging :
THE flies in the men ’s - room urinals of the Amsterdam airport have been enshrined in the academic literature on economics and psychology .
The flies — images of flies , actually — were etched in the porcelain near the urinal drains in an experiment in human behavior .
After the flies were added , “ spillage ” on the men ’s - room floor fell by 80 percent .
“ Men evidently like to aim at targets , ” said Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago , an irreverent pioneer in the increasingly influential field of behavioral economics .
Mr. Thaler says the flies are his favorite example of a “ nudge ” — a harmless bit of engineering that manages to “ attract people ’s attention and alter their behavior in a positive way , without actually requiring anyone to do anything at all . ”
What ’s more , he said , “ The flies are fun . ”
So why mention any of this on The Design Matrix ?
Well , I would think it obvious that nudging is essentially the same as front - loading .
For example , reword some of those sentences and the meaning does n’t really change :
“ A school cafeteria might try to front - load the choice of good diets by putting the healthiest foods at front . ”
“ a harmless bit of front - loading that manages to “ attract people ’s attention and alter their behavior in a positive way , without actually requiring anyone to do anything at all . ”
The Nudge approach advocated by Thaler and Sunstein is simply an attempt to alter human behavior by carefully front - loading situations such that they are designed to favor certain responses .
The key to nudging is that it is not determinism or predestination .
And it succeeds given a ) a good understanding of human nature when implemented to effect b ) large numbers over time .
For example , nudging does not allow us to determine that Ronald Heffer will choose a salad over fries on any particular day .
But it does allow us to successfully expect that a population of lunch eaters will choose salad over fries more often than they would without the nudge .
This whole approach to social engineering comes very close to what I am talking about with biotic design .
Compare .
Nudging : Choice architecture is the context in which you make your choice .
Suppose you go into a cafeteria .
What do you see first , the salad bar or the burger and fries stand ?
Where ’s the chocolate cake ?
Where ’s the fruit ?
These features influence what you will choose to eat , so the person who decides how to display the food is the choice architect of the cafeteria .
All of our choices are similarly influenced by choice architects .
The architecture includes rules deciding what happens if you do nothing ; what ’s said and what is n’t said ; what you see and what you do n’t .
Doctors , employers , credit card companies , banks , and even parents are choice architects .
We show that by carefully designing the choice architecture , we can make dramatic improvements in the decisions people make , without forcing anyone to do anything .
Front-loading ( from The Design Matrix and previous entries on this blog ) : Front - loading is plausible because , across all forms of life , cells share the same basic architecture and components ….. Just as the researchers , as artificial selectors , set up their in vitro selection experiment such that it was rigged to find ATP - binding proteins , so too may life ’s initial conditions have been rigged by the design of the cell ’s architecture and the choice of which components to employ …..
The original sequence , working in conjunction with the genetic code and the rest of the cellular architecture , biased what the second functional gene could look like …
… To sum up thus far , if we view evolution as a function , it stands to reason that life would be endowed with a tool kit of evolution genes .
Such genes would interface with life ’s architecture to facilitate evolution ….. This interaction would set up a selection pressure that would be guided by the architecture and composition of the bacterial porin and the MTS .
Front - loading would thus take this strategy of nudging , a form of design , and build it into the “ choice architecture ” of life – it ’s form and composition – to improve the “ choices ” evolution would subsequently make without “ forcing ” it to do so .
Nudging / front - loading represent a subtle and sophisticated form of design .
If life ’s designer was clever enough to develop carbon - based nanotechnology , why think anything less subtle and sophisticated was involved with the design of evolution ?

Intel 's
Atom processors have rocked the global computing market since their release last year , but plans for migration from the existing N270 and N280 parts to the successor Pine Trail platform , are not as clear .
The Pine Trail platform consists of the new netbook CPU and southbridge which will reduce Atom to a two - chip system and cut netbook power consumption while increasing performance , but the timing of the platform 's rollout has run up against conflicts between the interests of different players in the netbook segment .
Current Atom platforms like Intel 's aging Menlow and GN40 use three chips : a CPU , Northbridge / GPU , and Southbridge , while NVIDIA 's Ion platform uses only two : Atom and NVIDIA 's 9400M Northbridge / GPU .
N270 's end - of - life notice has been issued , with last orders taken in February and shipments ending in March .
Like Ion , Pine Trail uses only two chips , a 45nm CPU / Northbridge / GPU called Atom N450 and an I/ O hub that will probably be fabbed on a legacy process .
Although Ion is higher - performing and parsimonious in chip count , it consumes more power than Menlow or GN40 , while Pine Trail will use significantly less .
Pine Trail will be more expensive than Menlow ; while rumors place a complete Menlow system at $ 25 , and an unbundled N270 at $ 45 , a Pine Trail CPU and southbridge will run a cool $ 64 in bulk .
Although OEMs have had engineering samples of the new system since last month , they 're proving skittish about moving to a higher - priced platform in the price - sensitive netbook segment .
Global computer shipments are expected to decline year - over - year in 2009 , for the first time ever in the history of the world , and the netbook is a bright spot partially because of low prices .
Digitimes reports that for this reason , Intel is delaying Pine Trail until the first half of 2010 to avoid overly disturbing the current market for prior parts .
This would have the effect of forcing an OEM transition by EOLing the oldest part in the same quarter the new one is rolled out .
The delay , if true , is a confusing disappointment , because Pine Trail is likely to be a marked improvement over the current Atom platforms , one Intel should be eager to bring to market .
The confusion and disappointment may be settled by Intel , which has
announced there is no delay , and that Pine Trail will launch in the
last quarter of 2009 .
Digitimes still maintains their information is
correct , and that Pine Trail shipments are being delayed until next
year .
It 's possible that Intel will merely restrict the pipeline of
Pine Trail parts until next year , turning Pine Trail into a boutique
part until then .
Alternately , we might consider the remote possibility that this explanation of the delay is a smokescreen for some kind of technical problem with Pine Trail .
Although working samples have been distributed , it 's possible that the integration of CPU , Northbridge , and GPU on one die , a die possibly manufactured at TSMC instead of Intel 's own fabs , is causing yield trouble for Intel , prompting a delay .
The 45nm process is a mature one , so yield trouble would n't ordinarily be expected , but GPU integration and a possible new fab could conceivably cause trouble .
AMD 's similar " bulldozer " project , which also puts the GPU on - die , has already been delayed .
Given that next to no information about Pine Trail 's GPU has been released , it 's hard to say how difficult the integration would be .
This remote possibility , which is mere speculation on our part , is also suggested by the seeming urgency of Intel 's market war with Ion .
Clarity about the succession of Atom models , and the specifics of the Pine Trail rollout , and its effect on prices , Ion , and performance , will become clear later this year .
In the meantime , netbooks will keep flying off the shelves at a rate of a hundred thousand a day .
Update : Intel ombudsman Mooley Eden has announced that " Pine Trail is on schedule .
You can quote me on that ...
The three chip solution down to two chip solution [ is ] coming this year . "
It appears that the DigiTimes report of a delay may have been incorrect .

Wren Hex - Yemenni woke early .
They had to teach her everything from scratch , and there was n’t time for her to learn anything new before she hit fifty and had to be expired .
“ Watch it , ” the other techs told me when I was starting out .
“ You do n’t want a Hex on your hands . ”
By then we were monitoring Wren Hepta - Yemenni .
She fell into bed with Dorado ambassador 214 , though I do n’t know what he did to deserve it and she did n’t even seem sad when he expired .
When they torched him she went over with the rest of the delegates , and they bowed or closed their eyes or pressed their tentacles to the floors of their glass cases , and afterwards they toasted him with champagne or liquid nitrogen .
Before we expired Hepta , later that year , she smiled at me .
“ Make sure Octa ’s not ugly , okay ?
Just in case — for 215 . ”
Wren Octa - Yemenni hates him , so it ’s not like it matters .
It ’s not often that I ’m left speechless in Hello Kitty
Hell these days , but it still does happen from time to time .
Like today .
Seriously folks , you just ca n’t make this stuff up :

a high - end photo manipulation application that supports creating original art from images ;
a high - end application for producing icons , graphical elements of web pages , and art for user interface elements ;
a platform for programming cutting edge image processing algorithms , by scientists and artists ;
user - configurable to automate repetitive tasks ;
easily user - extend able , by simple installation of plug-ins
Adobe Photoshop on the other hand is a graphic editing program which is developed and published by Adobe Systems and is currently the market leading program for image manipulation .
Since I installed Linux on my PC , one of the few programs that forced me to have windows installed , was Adobe Photoshop .
I must confess that at the time I found Adobe Photoshop better than GIMP and irreplaceable .
I gave GIMP a try but as an addicted Photoshop user I could not replace it .
During my first months as a GNU / Linux user I started making second thoughts about using GIMP .
“ The free software is a matter of liberty , not price .
To understand the concept , you should think of “ free ” as in “ free speech ” , not as in “ free beer ” . ”
This is written on GNU ’s official website and since GIMP is free software while Adobe Photoshop is not , I decided to give GIMP a chance .
You can find GIMP at it ’s official website or just install it from your package manager or the terminal
$ sudo apt - get install gimp
One of the first things you should learn about GIMP is the user interface .
In the video below you can find one of the easiest ways to understand GIMP ’s GUI ( I know the video is about GIMP 2.3 user interface but is very similar to the user interface of GIMP 2.6 , if you have in mind a video of GIMP 2.6 user interface please post it on a comment ) .
You can also visit the GIMP Documentation website where you can find a good user interface manual .
Here are the links :
1.Main window and main toolbox
2.Image window
3.Dialogs and Docking
For those of you that can not get used to GIMP ’s UI , you can check out GIMPshop .
GIMPshop is a modification of GIMP , intended to replicate the feel of Adobe Photoshop .
( I never tried it though and I would be interested in comments on this one from someone who did ) .
But if you really want to learn how to use GIMP you should start using it and experiment .
I know that most of you did n’t actually read the documentation above , I would n’t if I were you .
Let ’s see some tutorials that you can start with .
I placed the tutorials in an order so that the easiest are at the start .
Red eye removal : Easy tutorial to start with and also one of the reasons I use GIMP almost daily .

Conclusion
I know it is hard to make the switch from Adobe Photoshop to GIMP , but once you get used to it you will find that GIMP can replace Adobe Photoshop for your every day photo editing needs .
I definetely reccomend it .
It is after all a free software , and a good one too !
A much - publicised law designed to stop wealthy tax exiles bankrolling political parties has been quietly dropped until after a general election , the Observer has learned .
The disclosure means that key Labour donors such as Lakshmi Mittal as well as Tory donor Lord Ashcroft will still be able to pump millions of pounds into the forthcoming election campaign , despite promises to curb the influence of wealthy backers .
It has prompted accusations that the government has " nobbled " an act of parliament by failing to ask the electoral commission to enforce the rule .
Lord Oakeshott , the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman , said he suspected Labour had abandoned its principled stand of just a few weeks ago because of concerns that the party cannot fight a cut - price general election against cash - rich Tories .
" To support an important piece of legislation stopping this underhand practice and not bring it in before a general election is like banning a drug - taking footballer but allowing him to play in the cup final , " he said .
" I suspect the electoral commission is not being pushed by the government to get on with it .
Labour needs to realise that they will never win an arms race with the Tories on dodgy donations . "
The Political Parties and Elections Act was given royal assent two weeks ago .
It included an amendment which was supposed to limit donations from individuals who are domiciled abroad for tax purposes – so called " non-doms " – to no more than £ 7,500 a year .
It was finally voted through after months of behind - the - scenes battles between Labour backbenchers , who wished to curtail the power of donors , and ministers who were minded that their party receives significant support from " non-doms " such as Gordon Brown 's confidante Lord Paul , and the packaged food tycoon Sir Gulam Noon .
Last month Jack Straw , the justice secretary , accepted the amendment amid a flurry of press releases and briefings , claiming that only those who pay all their income tax in Britain will be able to give significant funds to political parties .
But the electoral commission , the political watchdog charged with implementing the law , told the Observer this weekend that the law is not expected to be enforced until the summer of 2010 – weeks after the expected date of the next general election .
A commission spokesman said that officials are waiting for Straw to lay an order before parliament before the law can be implemented .
" In the meantime , the rules will stay as before and someone who is non-domiciled abroad can still donate , " he said .
The failure to enact the law has angered Labour MPs who backed the amendment .
Sir Peter Soulsby , the Labour MP for Leicester South , said : " This really is extraordinary .
Everyone who voted for this could not have been more clear .
We were expecting it to be implemented quickly , certainly in time for the general election . "
Lord Campbell - Savours , the Labour peer who first drew up the amendment , said that it should be enacted as soon as possible .
" If the electoral commission continues to advise those who are impermissible donors under my amendment that they are still free to donate , it should be considered a breach of the spirit of undertakings given to me at the time .
This needs clarification , " he said .
The treasury says there are about 116,000 residents with non-domiciled status .
Mittal has given more than £ 1 m to Labour while other wealthy non-doms have donated more than £ 3 m since the last general election .
Lord Ashcroft , the Tory deputy chairman , has directed millions of pounds to help his party target marginal seats in recent years and was granted a peerage in 2000 after agreeing to become resident in Britain for tax purposes .
He refuses to discuss his tax status .
Lord Laidlaw , one of the Tory party 's biggest backers , lives in Switzerland and has been described as a tax exile .
The Liberal Democrats have also received funds from donors domiciled abroad .
Bhanu and Dhruv Choudhrie , businessmen who originate from India , have given more than £ 475,000 through their companies .
Bhanu 's father Sudhir Choudhrie is also domiciled abroad and has given the party £ 95,000 .
A spokesman for the Justice Ministry confirmed that curbs on " non-doms " will not be implemented until after the general election but said that the delay was because the act was difficult to enact .
He declined to comment on claims from ministry officials that the law would be launched earlier .
Hollywood stars have expressed sadness at the passing of Patrick Swayze , who died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 57 yesterday .
Demi Moore , who starred opposite Swayze in 1990 's tear - jerker Ghost , led the tributes .
" Patrick you are loved by so many and your light will forever shine in all of our lives , " she wrote on Twitter .
" In the words of Sam to Molly : ' It 's amazing Molly .
The love inside , you take it with you . '
I love and will miss you Patrick , " she added .
Whoopi Goldberg , who won a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Ghost , said that - as in the film - Swayze will " always be near . "
" Patrick was a really good man , a funny man and one to whom I owe much that I can't ever repay , " she said .
" I believe in Ghost 's message , so he 'll always be near . "
In the movie , Swayze 's slain character communicates with Moore via Goldberg , who plays a psychic .
Swayze shot to superstardom in 1987 with Dirty Dancing , an international blockbuster in which he played a dance teacher to a young wallflower who wants to bloom .
Co-star Jennifer Grey described Swayze as a " real cowboy with a tender heart . "
" When I think of him , I think of being in his arms when we were kids - dancing , practicing the lift in the freezing lake , having a blast doing this tiny little movie we thought no - one would ever see , " she told People magazine , adding that Swayze was so fearless doing his own stunts that " it was not surprising to me that the war he waged on his cancer was so courageous and dignified . "
Drew Barrymore , who starred with Swayze in the 2001 film Donnie Darko , learnt of her co-star 's death during a press conference at the Toronto Film Festival .
" I'm in a bit of a shell - shocked state myself , " she said .
" I feel as though I 'm the wrong person to [ comment ] because it 's such a personal thing for people who are close to him , but I met him when I was seven years old .
He was the nicest man that one could ever , ever know .
" He was a hero to us all - from The Outsiders to all the wonderful films that he made .
He was a pleasure to work with in Donnie Darko .
" Our blessings are with the people around him that knew him and loved him the best , " she added .
In Hollywood , meanwhile , flowers have been placed on Swayze 's star set into the sidewalk on the Walk of Fame .
There California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger paid tribute to a " talented and passionate artist who struck a memorable chord with audiences throughout the world . "
" He played a wide range of characters both on stage and in movies and his celebrated performances made the hard work of acting look effortless - which I know from experience is not easy , " Schwarzenegger added .
Swayze was diagnosed with advanced stage four pancreatic cancer in January 2008 .
The actor bravely fought the disease in the public eye , continuing to work despite treatment and significant weight loss .
He is survived by his wife of 34 years , Lisa Niemi .

Police were stunned when a 17 year old girl confessed to a serial killing spree that started when she was 15 and has resulted in the death of 30 men – that she has admitted to .
Even to young to be named the girl said she started targeting men in her home of San Paulo , Brazil , for “ money , revenge and justice ” .
The police are totally puzzled as to what kept her on wanting to kill even as she bragged to police that she could n’t use a gun but she could always hold a knife .
The only reason she ’s confessing now – to avoid being charged and convicted as an adult .
“ I am confessing because I promised I would do so before becoming 18 – to avoid upsetting my family . ”

MyFoxDC ’s Roby Chavez reported :
Prince William County Police responded to a noise complaint at a child ’s baptism party .
By the time they left , a grandfather and a pregnant woman had been Tasered .
On Tuesday night , a Manassas family said cops went too far .
The 55 - year - old homeowner is a church family counselor and a bible study teacher .
He says he was hosting a party for his new godchild .
However , he and the pregnant mother of the baptized boys face serious charges .
Relatives are charging police used excessive force just to quiet down the backyard party .
Going on vacation , as rewarding as it may be , can also be exhausting .
Just ask anyone who has ever tried to make the most of their vacation days by working up to the last minute before taking off , and then immediately returning to work with not even a weekend or an extra day off to recover .
It is not uncommon for said vacationers to come back declaring they need a vacation to recover from their vacation .
The unemployed , as ridiculous as it may be , have it even worse when it comes to taking time off for a vacation .
For starters , many unemployed people from this recession are basically already on a paid vacation – courtesy of the government .
They are essentially paid to do nothing with the expectation that they continuously job hunt in order to receive unemployment benefits .
While they might be struggling to make ends meet while desperately pretending to look for a job , at least they ’re able to do it from the comforts of their own home , in front of the TV , wearing the same pajamas for days .
That alone draws envy from scores of employed people who would kill for a couple of days off to meander like the unemployed .
So when the unemployed actually decide they need a break from being paid to do nothing and head out on a vacation , they end up being surprised by the toll it might take .
After getting accustomed to not leaving the house for days at a time and pathetically trying to make up for inactivity by killing themselves to complete backed up errands , having to balance time with leisure , relaxation , and fruitful activity can be somewhat incomprehensible for the unemployed .
A real vacation is very different from a forced - time - off vacation .
Days of eating out , visiting friends , site seeing , and experiencing sun for the first time in ages can leave the unemployed feeling invigorated .
A few days into the vacation and the unemployed might even appear to radiate positivity and a newfound optimism for finding a new job so that the next time they travel , they can actually afford it .
“ This is exactly what I needed ” is a thought that runs through a vacationing unemployed soul ’s mind , finally ready to return to the grind .
And then the unemployed face the daunting return home – a seemingly endless road journey , multiple layover flights , overbooked Greyhound buses – whatever was the cheapest option to get away no longer seems as grand getting back .
When they finally get back to find their email inbox empty , answering machine blank save for automated telemarketers , gone is that optimism .
“ Forget it , I ’m hiding out in bed for a few more days , ” is the thought that runs through their defeated and exhausted minds .
“ I need a vacation for this vacation from my vacation . ”
Over at Wired 's Danger Room blog , news that an environmental nonprofit has obtained photos of the Department of Energy 's " specially designed trucks " used to transport nuclear material around the United States .
They pretty much look like any other transport truck , which is a little creepy , considering what they contain while they 're rollin ' down the highway .
Just this week , a similar vehicle carrying missiles overturned — so , safety concerns are in the air right now .
Snip :
" The trucks carrying nuclear weapons and dangerous materials such as plutonium pass through cities and neighborhoods all the time and the public should be aware of what they look like , " says Tom Clements of the Friends of the Earth group based in Columbia , South Carolina , which obtained the photos through a Freedom of Information Act request .
" Release of these photos will help inform the public about secretive shipments of dangerous nuclear material that are taking place in plain view . "

What should we have for dinner ?
When you can eat just about anything nature ( or the supermarket ) has to offer , deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety , especially when some of the foods might shorten your life .
Today , buffeted by one food fad after another , America is suffering
In recent years , Nestle has been hard fought by communities across the country over bottled water plants , as citizens are concerned that local aquifers will be depleted .
Â From Washington to California , towns have been divided and long battles fought as the maker of Perrier , Poland Spring , S. Pellegrino , and Arrowhead bottled waters plans to expand .
Â
Nestle is the largest bottled water company in America .
Â
Recently , the company won approval in south central Colorado for another source of its bottled water brands .
One of the towns that has fought a long battle with Nestle is McCloud , California in the shadow of Mt. Shasta .
Â
This community of 1300 continues a six year battle over fear that the town ’s water would be placed into the “ corporate giant ’s hand “ .
Â Business
Week explains what is at stake in McCloud :
It is here that NestlÃ© Waters North America ( NWNA ) , a subsidiary of the Swiss food and beverage giant , plans to operate one of the largest spring - water bottling plants in the U.S.
The 1 million - square - foot facilityâ€ ” picture five Wal - Mart ( WMT ) supercenters strung togetherâ € ” is to rise on the site of McCloud ’s defunct lumber mill , a 250 - acre swath of land that bends around the base of the mountain .
NestlÃ© aims to draw 1,250 gallons a minute of water from McCloud ’s glacier - fed springs .
The company would then pack 300 semi-trailers a day full of Arrowhead brand water , truck it as far away as Los Angeles and Reno , and sell it at prices that are as much as 1,000 times more than the cost of tap water .
In exchange , NestlÃ© has agreed to pay McCloud roughly $ 350,000 a year for the water and create up to 240 jobs in and around the town .
Last year , Nestle canceled its bottled water contract in McCloud ; however , this spring they proposed a reduced water bottling project in Squaw Valley Creek and are renegotiating a “ new deal “ .
Despite difficulties with the community of McCloud and similar responses in Washington state , Nestle has its eyes on the Columbia River in Oregon and a spring in Chaffee County , Colorado .
Â
Richard McIntyre , a consultant helping Nestle opponents in McCloud and Chaffee County , Colorado explains Nestles tactics of targeting small communities for its water bottling plants :
Nestle ’s MO is to target small , struggling communities that have lost their resource base and make them a deal it appears they ca n’t refuse .
Â
They do n’t tell you that most of the jobs are $ 10 an hour , or that you ’re going to have trucks running through your community 24/7 .
These low wages are exactly what Nestle promised the community of McCloud .
Â
Nestle currently operates over 50 spring - fed sites in the US .
Will Chaffee County , Colorado be the home to the next water plant ?
Â
County commissioners have agreed to allowing Nestle to withdraw 65 million gallons of water a year , as long as they restrict truck traffic during the summer tourist season .
Â
In addition , the company must allow access to fisherman and place conservation easements on its land ; however , residents are n’t convinced their own drinking water supply will not be affected .
Â
According to the LA Times , Nestle plans to mitigate these effects :
Nestle ’s plan in Colorado is to extract water from the aquifer , pipe it several miles to a truck stop , then send it to a bottling facility in Denver .
Because it will be taking water that otherwise would flow into the Arkansas River , Nestle intends to replenish the river with water purchased from the Denver - area city of Aurora .
Only time will tell if the residents of Chaffee County will be able to pull the plug on Nestle ’s latest bottled water project .
The days of rises in the A - level pass rate year after year may soon be numbered , according to academic experts .
This Thursday , when more than 250,000 teenagers get their A - level results , could well mark the end of a period spanning three decades .
The pass rate is set to rise again this year for the 27th year in succession – but only by about 0.3 per cent to 97.5 per cent .
The percentage of A grades achieved is expected to rise , too , by about 0.6 per cent to 26.5 per cent – the highest figure in the history of the exam .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
However , Professor Alan Smithers , of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham , said : " If you go to 97.5 per cent this could be the beginning of the ceiling .
" There are always going to be people who enter the exam who do n't finish .
It is difficult to see the failure rate becoming much less than 3 per cent . "
In addition , there are moves to make the questions more taxing for next year 's exams .
Examiners have been told that the questions should be more open - ended next year – a return to the traditional A - level – in an attempt to give candidates more scope for freedom of expression and to show their thinking skills .
It is what university admissions staff – beleaguered by being presented with so many candidates with three straight A - grade passes for popular courses – have been demanding for several years now .
They argue it makes it almost impossible to select the brightest talent for oversubscribed courses such as law and medicine at elite universities .
This year Oxford and Cambridge have rejected more than 12,000 candidates predicted to get three straight A - grade passes on Thursday .
Next year 's candidates will also be the first who can aim for an A * pass , again designed to help universities with selection problems .
As a result of the changes , Dr Geoff Parks , head of admissions at Cambridge University , said he would not be surprised if there was a " dip " in performance next year as teachers had to get to grips with preparing their pupils for the new - style exam .
This year , though , is also expected to see girls outperform boys in virtually every subject – although the girls ' pass rate at 97.8 per cent is unlikely to improve much as it has almost hit the ceiling for passes .
As a result , the gap in performance , which was at 2.4 percentage points in 2002 , is set to be reduced to about one percentage point this year .
The biggest problem this summer , though , will be the scramble for university places .
Ucas , the university admissions service , said that applications have reached a record level of just over 600,000 – 10.3 per cent up on last year .
The number of home - based candidates , though , has soared by 12.5 per cent , thought to be as a result of the recession .
Even with the Government 's announcement that universities can take on an extra 10,000 students this autumn , there will not be enough places – and there have been predictions that as many as 60,000 candidates may face rejection .
Some universities , including Cambridge and Oxford , have spurned the idea of increasing the number of student places , particularly as the Government has refused to increase the teaching grant to allow them to take on more staff to cope .
They argue that to take in extra students without extra staff would dilute the quality of the education they could offer .
The following example , taken from an introductory text in object oriented programming , demonstrates a common flaw in object oriented design .
Can you spot it ?
public class Rectangle { private double width ; private double height ; public void setWidth ( double width ) { this .
width = width ; } public void setHeight ( double height ) { this .
height = height ; } public double getHeight ( ) { return this .
height ; } public double getWidth ( ) { return this .
width ; } public double getPerimeter ( ) { return 2 * width + 2 * height ; } public double getArea ( ) { return width * height ; } }
public class Square extends Rectangle { public void setSide ( double size ) { setWidth ( size ) ; setHeight ( size ) ; } }
( I ’ve changed the language and rewritten the code to protect the guilty . )
There are actually several problems here .
Thread safety is one , but let ’s assume the class does n’t need to be thread - safe .
Another is that it ’s possible to give the sides negative lengths .
That we could fix with a couple of judiciously thrown IllegalArgumentExceptions .
However the problem that most troubles me is demonstrated here :
Square s = new Square ( ) ; s.setWidth( 5.0 ) ; s.setHeight ( 10.0 ) ;
In object oriented programming , it is necessary that a subclass be able to fulfill the contract of its superclass .
In this case , that means the square has to respond to setHeight ( ) and setWidth ( ) calls .
However doing so enables the square to violate the nature of a square .
A square can not stand in for a rectangle .
You can try to work around this by overriding the setHeight ( ) and setWidth ( ) methods .
For example , one might call the other :
public class Square extends Rectangle { public void setWidth ( double width ) { super.setWidth ( width ) ; super.setHeight ( height ) ; } public void setHeight ( double height ) { super.setWidth ( width ) ; super.setHeight ( height ) ; } public void setSide ( double size ) { super.setWidth ( width ) ; super.setHeight ( height ) ; } }
However this is fundamentally unsatisfying because there is no reasonable expectation that calling one of setHeight ( ) on a Rectangle object will also invoke the setWidth ( ) method or vice versa .
The contract of the Rectangle class is that you can set the width and the height independently , and the Square subclass violates that .
Setting width when you ’re setting height is an unexpected side effect .
It violates the single responsibility principle1 .
We could instead just forbid setHeight ( ) and setWidth ( ) completely by throwing UnsupportedOperationException :
public class Square extends Rectangle { public void setWidth ( double width ) { throw new UnsupportedOperationException ( ) ; } public void setHeight ( double height ) { throw new UnsupportedOperationException ( ) ; } public void setSide ( double size ) { super.setWidth ( width ) ; super.setHeight ( height ) ; } }
However , this is really just a louder way of warning the client that the Square class does not fulfill the contract of the Rectangle class .
It does n’t address the fundamental problem that , in object oriented terms , a square is not a rectangle .
The geometric nature of a square is incompatible with the object - oriented definition of a rectangle given above .
There is , however , a way out of this conundrum .
Our problem only arises because of the setter methods .
If constructor were used instead , and no setters were exposed , then it would be possible to make a square a subclass of rectangle without violating any contracts .
For example ,
public class Rectangle { private double width ; private double height ; public Rectangle ( double width , double height ) { this .
width = width ; this .
height = height ; } public void getHeight ( ) { return this .
height ; } public void getWidth ( ) { return this .
width ; } public double getPerimeter ( ) { return 2 * width + 2 * height ; } public double getArea ( ) { return width * height ; } }
public class Square extends Rectangle { public Square ( double size ) { super ( size , size ) ; } }
As long as the Rectangle class is immutable , we can define subclasses that are limited to a particular subset of rectangles , such as squares .
This is one more reason to prefer immutability .
To the extent possible , define the public interface in terms of what an object is and what it does rather than what you can do to it .
However that ’s not always possible , and in those cases you need to be extremely careful around inheritance .
Otherwise constraints can be violated when you least expect , thus introducing subtle and potentially dangerous bugs in your code .
Actually the single responsibility principle is usually understood to apply to classes , but it ’s even more critical that it apply to methods .
each method should do exactly one thing and one thing only .
Side effects should be avoided .
We witnessed that rarest of things last week — a politician 's public humility .
When France , along with Germany , reported an unexpected uptick in economic growth for the second quarter , French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde called the return to growth " very surprising . "
Imagine that — a major global economy stops shrinking , without the benefit of trillion - dollar stimulus packages or major reforms , and a politician does n't rush to claim credit for the achievement .
Politicians do n't " grow " an economy like a vegetable garden , ...

At least nine people have died after a ferry with over 960 passengers on board sank off the southeast coast of the Philippines on Sunday .
Thirty more are still unaccounted for .
According to coast guards , 931 people were rescued from the SuperFerry 9 , which had departed from General Santos City and was headed for the peninsula of Zamboanga .
The vessel began to list at 02.30 local time ( 18.30 UTC ) , and issued a distress call an hour later .
The captain reportedly tried to correct the list , but ordered the ship 's rafts to be released when it became clear it was impossible to get the vessel straightened back out again .
The cause of the incident is not yet certain .
Maritime accidents occur frequently in the Philippines , mainly due to poor maintenance of ships , relaxed safety enforcement , overcrowding of ships , and inclement weather .
Last year , 802 passengers including crew were killed when the MV Princess of the Stars ferry sank during a typhoon .

HAS Iranian President Mah moud Ahmadinejad won his first diplomatic victory since his disputed re-election in June ?
Last Thursday , Tehran presented what it calls “ an updated package ” as the basis for fresh talks with the G+1 ( the UN Security Council ’s five permanent members , plus Germany ) .
On Friday , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called the package “ unacceptable ” but added that America would seek “ an early meeting ” and give the Islamic Republic until year ’s end to make up its mind .
On Monday , Iran announced that fresh talks would start on Oct.
1 . The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that European Union foreign - policy czar Javier Solana accepted the date after studying the Iranian “ package . ”
If the proposed round — the first since last fall — occurs , Ahmadinejad could claim a diplomatic victory , for three reasons .
1 ) For the first time since the nuclear dispute started a decade ago , the agenda would be set by the Islamic Republic — not the big powers .
Even before his election , President Obama had promised “ direct and unconditional talks ” with the Islamic Republic .
Yet he ’s wound up with conditional talks — with Iran fixing the conditions .
Nor did Obama get the one - on - one talks he wanted .
America will be “ engaged ” in a multilateral context , with China and Russia acting as “ restraining powers ” to prevent undue pressure on Iran .
2 ) Ahmadinejad has managed to engage the major powers on a range of issues — creating the impression that they acknowledge Iran as a partner in “ a new global order . ”
The Iranian leadership resents the fact that it ’s shut out of the G - 20 negotiations , which include such smaller powers as Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Algeria and South Africa .
Ahmadinejad likes to refer to Iran as “ a world power ” with “ the right and duty to offer mankind an alternative vision . ”
His hope is to transform the 5+1 into a new G - 7 — with Iran as a full partner .
The Tehran media describe his coming address at this month ’s UN General Assembly in New York as a “ blueprint for a new world order . ”
3 ) Even if Ahmadinejad fails to secure a place at the top table through the 5+1 group , the talks could provide a mechanism for buying time .
Weeks if not months could go to “ clarify ” aspects of the proposed “ package . ”
Counterproposals could fly in both directions , consuming yet more time .
With those delays , Obama will have given Ahmadinejad at least a year free of pressure and more sanctions .
The consensus in Tehran is that Iran will reach the “ nuclear threshold ” in the next 18 months — meaning it would have the technical , scientific and industrial wherewithal to build a nuclear arsenal whenever the leadership so decides .
Once that threshold is reached , all talk of preventing Iran from getting the bomb would be academic .
The issue becomes one of persuading it not to build nuclear weapons .
There are two reasons for Tehran ’s self - assurance as it prepares for October talks .
First , Ahmadinejad and his advisers are confident that the Obama administration has accepted a nuclear Iran , but dare not say so publicly for fear of the “ Zionist lobby ” in Washington .
Islamic Republic News Agency senior analyst Ata -Allah Bahrami puts it this way : “ Leaving aside the literature of propaganda and judging by the real yardsticks of national interests and threats , the US has no problem with Iran ’s nuclear project and does not regard it as a threat to itself . . .
“ American [ officials ] have repeatedly spoken of accepting a nuclear Iran and tried to propose countermeasures .
[ Secretary of State ] Hillary Clinton has spoken of an American nuclear umbrella for the Middle East . ”
Second , Ahmadinejad thinks that Obama is anxious to organize a US strategic retreat from the Middle East .
With help from Iran , he could obtain an orderly retreat .
With a hostile Iran , it could turn into a “ historic catastrophe ” for America .
Here is Bahrami again : “ The United States ’ extensive problems stem from its widespread military presence in the Middle East .
Because Iran is the most powerful nation in the Middle East , the US , under any circumstances , would need Iran ’s help to solve its problems . ”
He adds : “ The new proposed Iranian package reflects the new conditions in the region , a region in which the United States ’ position is weaker than ever , ” claiming that “ Obama ’s retreat from preconditions for talks with Iran is a positive move . ”
Tehran ’s message to Washington is simple : Your time in the Middle East is over .
You are looking for ways of getting out without being routed .
Recognize the Islamic Republic as the new dominant power in the region and we shall help you get out with minimum losses .

She Wears the Pants
Lubna Hussein ’s trial for the " crime " of wearing trousers went ahead in Khartoum yesterday morning .
It was her third official court appearance — on previous occasions the court delayed its decision in the hope that the international media attention on Lubna , the " Sudan trouser lady , " would fade .
The court ’s verdict was eminently predictable .
Trying to save face , the court played it both ways .
The judge decided Lubna was guilty under Article 152 of Sudan ’s so - called indecency laws — a nod to the government , which maintains that the law is just and that Lubna simply fell afoul of it .
But the court decided to fine her 500 Sudanese pounds ( about $ 200 ) rather than flog her — a nod to the sensitivities of the global media watching from outside the courtroom , where Lubna ’s domestic supporters were once again protesting .
Presumably the court hoped that Lubna , grateful to be spared flogging , would happily pay the fine and the world could move on .
Case closed .
That was a miscalculation .
I spoke to Lubna by phone shortly after the verdict was handed down and was not surprised when the first thing she said was that she had no intention of paying the fine .
While most of the media coverage of her story to date has focused on the most sensational part of the case — the possibility of her facing a public flogging — for Lubna , her decision to take on the government was a challenge to the justness of Article 152 in its entirety .
From Lubna ’s perspective , paying the fine would legitimate an illegitimate law .
I lost contact with Lubna last night after she was jailed for refusing to pay the fine .
But having spoken to her earlier in the day , I knew that going to jail to continue her protest of a vaguely worded law that allows for the harassment of women was something she was perfectly prepared to do .
Lubna had advised friends and family that she did not want anyone to pay the fine on her behalf .
From the perspective of the Sudanese government , this was not a satisfactory result .
With the " trouser lady " now in jail , how could the global media move on ?
Enter Mohideen Totawi , head of the Sudanese Journalists ’ Association ( SJA ) .
Totawi paid Lubna ’s fine and this afternoon she was forcibly freed .
If anyone thinks this was an act of solidarity by one journalist toward another , think again .
Independent journalists in Khartoum refer to the SJA in the same scathing tone as they do the " Gongos , " the governmental " nongovernmental organizations " that Khartoum runs to demonstrate to the West its robust civil society .
Indeed , the links between the government and the SJA are too tight to claim anything approaching independent status .
The truly independent association of journalists in Sudan is called the Sudanese Journalists ’
Network — but you ’ll be hard - pressed to hear anything about it because any statements it issues are censored from Sudanese papers .
So , for today it looks as though the government has won .
In effect , it paid the fine to shut down both Lubna ’s challenge to Article 152 and the unwelcome media attention that her act of civil disobedience spurred .
But two questions remain .
First , will it be this easy to stop the activism of Lubna and her many domestic supporters ?
My guess is no .
Lubna ’s case is now part of a larger campaign by a group of similarly brave Sudanese women , working for women ’s rights from inside a repressive system .
Second , will any Sudanese court again dare to flog a woman for wearing trousers ?
Let ’s hope not .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate voted Thursday night to extend the " Cash for Clunkers " program with an infusion of $ 2 billion .
President Obama is expected to sign the OK to spend $ 2 billion more on the " Cash for Clunkers " program .
White House aides said earlier that President Obama will quickly sign the bill into law to prevent any interruption to the popular incentive .
The Senate voted 60 - 37 to approve the measure already passed by the House .
" [ President Obama 's ] going to want to make sure the funds are in place by this weekend , " one senior White House official noted , because of the particularly brisk weekend business the program has sparked .
The program under Obama 's economic stimulus package pays people up to $ 4,500 for trading an older - model vehicle with low fuel efficiency for new vehicles that get better miles per gallon .
" ' Cash for Clunkers ' has been a proven success .
The initial transactions are generating a more than 50 percent increase in fuel economy ; they are generating $ 700 to $ 1,000 in annual savings for consumers in reduced gas costs alone ; and they are getting the oldest , dirtiest and most air polluting trucks and SUVs off the road for good , " Obama said in a statement Thursday night .
" I want to thank Leader Reid and the members of the Senate who moved quickly to extend a program that benefits our recovery and our auto industry while reducing our economy 's dependence on oil , " he said .
The program was intended to run until autumn , but higher than expected participation caused the government to warn last week the program would run out of money without an infusion from Congress .
The extension would keep the program going through Labor Day .
The House voted to add $ 2 billion to the program before it adjourned for the summer on Friday .
With the Senate vote , the additional money will become available right away .
Several top Republicans , including Sen. John McCain of Arizona , raised concerns about pouring more money into the program at a time when the government is deep in debt .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and other top Democrats had been lining up votes for the expansion by making the case that the program is providing a boost to the economy by increasing weak auto sales , while also helping the environment by getting " clunkers " off the road in favor of more fuel - efficient vehicles .
The program calls for the engines of the clunkers to be made inoperable so the cars cannot be returned to the road .
Watch what happens to ' clunkers ' »
Democratic officials said several hurdles were cleared in order to allow the Senate to pass the bill with new money on Thursday night .
On Monday , two key senators who opposed more money for the program announced they had changed their minds and now supported the extension .
The announcement by Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - California , and Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , boosted Democratic efforts to secure enough votes to pass the measure this week .
CNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry contributed to this report .

Moral Hazard and Capital Structure By Arnold Kling
Russ Roberts is working on a paper suggesting that the fragility of our financial system could be the result of past bailouts , in which unsecured creditors and counterparties of financial institutions were always made whole .
In some sense , the fact that the Fed fears contagion makes them turn such liabilities into ex post nearly riskless assets for investors .
This reminded me of the history of the economics of corporate capital structure .
My version of that history follows .
Take a company with a given set of investment projects ( you can think of my favorite example , fruit trees ) .
Should they be financed with equity or with debt ?
Before economists got involved , the thinking was that shareholders could earn a higher return with more leverage ( more debt ) .
The thinking went something like this :
Suppose that the fruit trees earn a 4 percent return per year , and debt costs 3 percent per year .
If you go with 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity , then the equity holders earn ( approximately ) 5 percent per year .
But if you go with 90 percent debt and 10 percent equity , then that leaves the equity holders with ( approximately ) 13 percent returns . *
This thinking was challenged by Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani .
They said that the debt - equity mix should not matter !
That is because investors can offset the leverage decisions of firms .
If the firm is only 50 percent leveraged , and I want 90 percent leverage , I borrow most of the money to buy the stock .
If the firm is 90 percent leveraged and I want 50 percent leverage , then I buy a combination of bonds and stock .
In fact , the easiest way to think of the Modigliani - Miller theorem is to assume that a single investor owns both the debt and the equity of the firm .
If a firm issues $ 100 in stock and $ 100 in debt , and I own all of both , then why would I care if the firm changes to a capital structure of $ 20 in equity and $ 180 in debt ?
Either way , I still own the entire firm .
As Miller liked to say , whether you cut a pizza into 6 slices or 8 slices , it ’s still the same pizza .
Next , we introduce tax costs and bankruptcy costs .
There is a tax advantage to using debt rather than equity , so if nothing else mattered , you go for almost entirely debt financing .
However , there are bankruptcy costs –there is a loss of resources when a firm goes bankrupt .
To reduce the probability of bankruptcy , you want to have some equity .
The optimal capital structure is one where the marginal tax cost of equity is offset by the marginal benefit of the additional reduction in the probability of bankruptcy .
Next , we introduce principal - agent problems .
Maybe as an equity - holder I am not sure that management will really pay out dividends –what if they go for salary and perks instead ?
So I would rather be a debt - holder .
Another agency problem is that management may be risk averse .
They would rather have a sure salary than take a reasonable risk on behalf of shareholders .
So you do what America ’s financial wizards of the 1980 ’s did –you encourage leveraged buyouts , hostile takeovers , and other means to put pressure on management to maximize shareholder value .
Next , suppose we introduce the moral hazard issue .
Suppose that the market gradually learns that the probability of a debtholder losing money in the case of the default of a large financial firm is really low , because the government almost always comes to the rescue .
What this amounts to is a very large subsidy to issuing debt .
It should shift the balance in favor of high leverage .
The capital structure at large financial firms should tend toward huge amounts of debt piled on relatively little equity .
Now , there is an offset .
If you are a large financial firm with the ability to issue subsidized debt , you have a profit machine .
Going bankrupt would mean that you lose your machine .
So you do make some effort to remain solvent , in order to keep your machine .
But basically , to get the most out of the machine , you go for the most leverage .
One does n’t have to tell this capital structure story to make the point that the moral hazard caused by past bailouts was a cause of fragility .
But I happen to like doing it this way .
In any case , Roberts points to some very disturbing implications .
* Suppose $ 100 investment in fruit trees , with $ 10 equity , $ 90 in debt .
Annual profit is $ 4 , of which $ 2.70 goes to debt holders , leaving $ 1.30 for dividends , or a 13 percent return .

The popular Digsby instant messenger client not only bundles half a dozen " optional " crapware applications , it 's also using your computer to crawl the web , do stock market research , and more .
It 's time to uninstall .

Bundling Crapware is a Despicable Business Model
Many popular freeware applications bundle crapware into their setup files , prompting you during the installation process to install something that nobody wants — like the Yahoo / Ask.com /SomeRandomCompany browser toolbar .
Tech - savvy users may consider this nothing more than an annoyance , but this practice preys on unsuspecting or less knowledgeable users that click " Next " through every setup screen , and the makers of any software that do this should be ashamed of themselves .

Digsby takes bundled crapware to a whole different level , however .
During the install you are prompted for not one , not two , but six different pieces of junk software , and then for good measure they offer to replace your home page with something terrible and take your search engine down a notch .
Do n't think it 's all that bad ?
Here 's an example of one of the bundled crapware applications — a piece of software that tracks everything you are searching online and shows you " offers " in a sidebar window .
Does that really sound like something anybody anywhere would ever want ?
It Gets Even Worse : Your PC is Being Used Without Your Knowledge
You can debate the merits of bundled crapware , and brush away the despicable nature of preying on those lacking adequate tech skills , but did you realize that Digsby is also using your processor to make money ?

That 's right .
Buried in the Terms of Service that almost nobody ever bothers reading , there 's this exploiting - the - fine - print gem explaining that they will use your CPU to run distributed computing problems that make them money :
15 . USAGE OF COMPUTER RESOURCES .
You agree to permit the Software to use the processing power of your computer when it is idle to run downloaded algorithms ( mathematical equations ) and code within a process .
You understand that when the Software uses your computer , it likewise uses your CPU , bandwidth , and electrical power .
The Software will use your computer to solve distributed computing problems , such as but not limited to , accelerating medical research projects , analyzing the stock market , searching the web , and finding the largest known prime number .

Hold everything !
They are going to use my computer for " searching the web " without explicitly asking for my permission ?
What exactly are they indexing , and how do I know they are n't accessing something illegal with my computer ?
Why are they trying to hide this in the first place ?

To be fair , they do give you a way to disable this absurd nonsense — though they bury the setting behind a " Support Digsby " item on the menu , with no clear description on exactly what they are doing with it .
It 's clear they are abusing their users , but since they technically explain it in the TOS and let you disable the feature , they weasel out of any responsibility .
Think it 's just paranoia ?
This has been reported , on the Digsby forum , more than a few times , and in fact was announced on the Digsby blog as an official way they are going to make some money , with Plura Processing as a partner .
The Plura Processing blog confirms that they are , in fact , crawling the web using your computer :
Custom Web Crawling – 80 legs is using Plura to do distributed web crawling .
Rather than having data centers with very fat pipes , they use a portion of the bandwidth of the Plura nodes to crawl the web .
In order to improve the success ratio for each work unit , 80 legs sends out Plura WUs with very few URLs to crawl .

This is n't just some language buried in the TOS .
It 's a sneaky way they are planning on making money from people without explicitly asking them first .
If you really want to be paranoid , consider that these people have the credentials to all your online accounts .
Just Need to Pay the Bills ?
Give Me a Break !
While there 's no way to tell exactly how much money Digsby is making from the sneaky use of your computer and abusing the less knowledgeable with loads of crapware , there is one disturbing fact that you should consider :
They are paying up to $ 1 for every new user that you refer to them through their affiliate program .
If they can pay that much money for every new user , they are n't just paying the bills anymore .
What do I get paid for ?
You get paid for every new user that installs Digsby .
How much do I get paid ?
You get paid up to $ 1.00 for every new user that installs Digsby .
The amount varies depending on the geographic location of the person installing Digsby .

The Guise of Ad - Free Does n't Get You Off the Hook
Digsby and other subtle - but - shady software makers excuse themselves from their crapware - bundling behavior by saying that this model enables them to provide the product free of charge , and free of ads .

Except in this case , that argument is completely bogus .
Digsby sends out " Announcements " containing ads or , in at least one case , requests for you to vote in a poll of the five best instant messenger clients .
As far as I can tell , there 's no way to switch off this behavior , and while they might not be abusing it too badly right now , if they are willing to try and sneakily use your computer , you can bet it 's not going to stop .

Summary : Stick with Open Source
The only way you are definitely going to avoid greedy software developers exploiting you is to stick with open source , make sure to donate to your favorite open source projects , and stop installing software with bundled crapware .

I ’m sitting here watching my cats fight one another .
Not actually fight , like in a manner that would make Michael Vick blush with pride , but sissy slap at one another .
Since both cats arrived declawed from the pound , this equals good , clean , safe fun for all involved .
Except maybe the cats .
Having pets makes you realize that Pokemon games are just this side of electronic cockfighting .
A generation of kids are growing up believing the best use for newly discovered species is to cram them in a cage and , at the appropriate time , release them to fight other rare creatures .
This was the plot of one of the Beastmaster films , but hardly seems a valid life lesson .
Still , I ’m not one to intervene into the cats ’ squabbles .
It ’s when considering this I wonder if I ’m a god ?
Not the God ( no lightning strikes , please ) , but a god–to my cats at least .
I ’m a benevolent being that provides them with food , water , shelter , and can magically heal many of their ailments with my magic elixirs ( $ 49.99 from my friendly neighborhood veterinarian ) .
I often whisk them up from the ground and transport them out of harm ’s way , and my voice bellows from the heavens both praising and chastising them .
Of course , to really be a god I would need to have worshipers , and I ’m fairly sure that ’s exactly what my cats are doing right now .
One is sniffing around my foot while the other forces its way into my lap .
I ’d cuddle up in God ’s lap , and I ’m not entirely unsure that what I do each Sunday is n’t tickling His toes .
Sure , the praise into groveling might not seem equal between my cats to me to God , but I ’d argue that ’s all perspective .
For all we know we sound like a bunch of hairy beasts begging for mushy sustenance to the Almighty .
Maybe when
He drops a few apples onto that deserted island you find yourself shipwrecked on he also walks away holding one hand to His nose before throwing the empty package in the trash can .
God or no god , I am not getting that left over cat food all over my hands .
Is there a point to this rambling ?
Sure , why not ?
I think we far too often presume to know the inner workings of the minds of creatures both greater and smaller than ourselves .
This usually results in us forcing our own opinions , wants , and even needs upon their actions .
That does n’t sound very benevolent to me .
That ’s not the kind of god I want to be .
As you can imagine , KoK favorite , RHP - Lee Roberts had a couple of busy days when he was promoted from the AZL Royals to the Burlington Royals on August 7th .
Now that things have settled down for him a little bit , I asked him if he could take a few minutes and share how things went down when he was given the good news .
Lee continues to go above and beyond for Kings of Kauffman , and was kind enough to respond with the below :
I was actually running a bit late to the field that day so when MD , one of our pitching coaches , called me in I was a bit nervous that I was about to get chewed out !
I got in the office and sat down with all of the other coaches at the table .
Our head coach Bruno then proceeded to tell me that I was being moved .
Then he told our other pitching coach Carlos to fill me in on the details .
From there on it was pretty easy .
I packed all of my stuff and said my goodbyes to all my teammates .
I shipped out the next morning on a 9 am flight and arrived in NC in time to catch the second half of the double header .
Since then , I have made good friends with some of the guys out here and I ’m loving the beautiful weather .
Today was the first game he pitched in since his debut for Burlington .
Lee took the mound to start the 6th inning and proceeded to throw 3.0 innings while allowing 3 hits , 1 run , and 1 walk while striking out 5 .
He picked up his 2nd win in as many appearances for the B - Royals and has now pitched 5.2 innings with 5 H , 1 R , 1 BB , and 6 SO since his promotion .
On the season as a whole he has racked up 20 SO against 3 BB in 19.0 IP while allowing 18 H and 3 ER .
Those numbers translate into a 1.42 ERA , 1.11 WHIP , and 6.67 SO / BB .
So far so good for KoK ’s favorite !
The people of Wanganui are " angry , upset and disappointed ” by a New Zealand Geographic Board ruling that the city 's spelling must include an " h " , Mayor Michael Laws says .
" This council will fight for the democratic rights of its constituents , " Mr Laws said at a packed press conference this afternoon .
He said Wanganui was not a Maori word , but had a culture , heritage and mana all of its own .
The Geographic Board 's decision was " racist " , biased and failed to take referendum results into account , he said .
But he had always been confident in democracy and he would be petitioning Land Information Minister Maurice Williamson to uphold the wishes of the Wanganui community .
The board met yesterday to debate the request from local iwi Tupoho , before issuing its decision this morning .
The issue will now go before Mr Williamson , who will consider whether to formalise the change to Whanganui .
" I will be carefully considering the board 's report and the submissions , after which I will make a decision .
Until then I will not be making any further comment , " Mr Williamson said .
TURIA : 'RIGHT THING TO DO '
Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia wept when she heard the news .
" I know that they were many of our old people who wept this morning at this result .
" It 's quite emotional I have to say ... because our people have been hoping for it a long time . "
The spelling change was " the right thing to do " , and she did not agree with Mr Laws that it was a racist decision .
" I hope that Michael will take a stance which is more unifying than he has . "
" I think that those who value doing what is right will see that this is a very important step in going forward .
" It 's about who we are , it 's about our genealogy . "
BOARD'S DECISION
Almost 900 public submissions were received on the issue , which has raised debate across the country .
Mr Laws has fought the name change , and earlier this month made headlines after angrily responding to Otaki schoolchildren who wrote to him asking him to reconsider .
A Wanganui District Council referendum held in May found 77 per cent of respondents wanted the spelling of their city 's name to remain unchanged .
However , the board had already concluded Wanganui - without the ' h ' - was not an official place name as it had never been formally gazetted .
Board chairman Don Grant said the board was referring the final determination to the minister because objections were received on the proposal , and they were not upheld .
" If the minister confirms Whanganui as official , Government departments and local authorities that publish new / revised documents ... will be expected to use the official name .
" However , for private businesses and organisations , it would only apply to publications they produce that are intended for travellers or tourists , and for geographic and scientific publications . "
Dr Grant said businesses could choose whether to adopt the official name in names and publications , or whether to retain the current spelling Wanganui .
Even within the tourist industry , there would be no requirement to change the names of any business or company .
" The board wants to minimise the costs involved in a decision such as this , and believes the 12 - month minimum transition period will ensure costs are kept down for those affected , " Dr Grant said .
Public submissions on the proposal were fairly evenly split , with 444 opposed , and 436 in support .
Nine were neutral .
Views expressed directly to the Land Information Minister included 22 opposed and one in support .
" We took careful note of the Wanganui District Council submission , the referendum conducted by the council in 2009 , and the research of Dr Diana Beaglehole commissioned by the council , " Dr Grant said .
Other information the board considered included evidence of the use of the 'h ' in early historical records , and the fact that the issue of spelling was one that began from the 1840s .
Views of the Human Rights Commission and the Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Maori ( Maori Language Commission ) were also noted .
" In the end we could not overlook the fact that Wanganui is not correctly spelt and it is a Maori name that is of significant cultural importance , " Dr Grant said .
" Historical evidence has shown that early settlers clearly intended the name of the city to be derived from the Maori name for the river , and consistent modern usage of the language showed the spelling should be Whanganui , not Wanganui . "
Te Runanga o Tupoho and the Wanganui District Council were advised of the board 's decision this morning .

Can vaccines cause chronic illnesses ?
Advertisement
Dr. Garth Nicholson , microbiologist and director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine , says yes .
The government does n't require vaccine makers to test for certain biological contaminants and pharmaceutical companies certainly do n't volunteer .
Because the vast majority of physicians are unaware of this common source of chronic illness they do n't test for it or have protocols to treat it .
I imagine most doctors , after taking their fees , tell patients suffering from these illnesses that it 's " all in their heads . "
American Missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints will continue to appeal orders to leave the country although they are still to determine a way forward and the opposition PNCR yesterday condemned the government over its handling of the matter .
On Wednesday the Ministry of Home Affairs said the missionaries violated the Immigration Act , as they remained in the jurisdiction despite being issued letters denying Work Permits and Extension of Stay .
Fifty of them were ordered to leave the country in 30 days .
“ Right now we are in a discussion with our committee , ” Colin Goodluck , the Georgetown , Guyana District President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints said when contacted yesterday afternoon .
He added , “ We are currently discussing how we will address this matter and will issuing a statement addressing it soon . ”
Goodluck further directed this newspaper to Leslie Sobers , the Church ’s local Director of Public Affairs , whom he said would be in a better position to comment on the issue .
The District President declined to comment further but indicated he would contact this newspaper as soon as more information was available .
“ We have nothing to hide , ” Goodluck stressed .
Sobers meanwhile told Stabroek News yesterday that “ most likely ” after this batch of missionaries leave , another set should be arriving .
However , this had not yet been “ finalized ” by the church as a collective body , he explained , noting that there is also a possibility that the foreign missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints may very well not return here to offer their social and humanitarian services to Guyana .
The incident , which saw almost 50 missionaries being taken into police custody at the Criminal Investigation Department , Eve Leary on Wednesday , before they were given a 30 - day period to leave , was condemned yesterday by the main opposition party as an assault on the religious community and an act of disregard for the rule of law .
Acting Chief Justice Ian Chang issued an order on Wednesday afternoon which prevented the state from arresting and or detaining the members of the Church for the purposes of removing them from Guyana before the hearing and determination of the Appeals filed by them in the High Court .
The matter was adjourned to September 16 .
Court proceedings , according to Sobers , will be continued and allowed to take their natural course .
He said that the Missionaries have been directed by the government to leave and that is absolute .
However , he pointed out that the Missionaries will not travel until their time has elapsed .
Despite “ this problem ” , Sobers said , travel arrangements have not been made , not one of the Missionaries had left Guyana and they all went about their usual activities of rendering help and support to Guyanese yesterday .
Extension of Stay
Sobers explained that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , which has been here for two decades , has nine branches locally which are managed by Goodluck and two councillors .
Goodluck ’s council , Sobers further explained , in turn answers to the West Indies Mission .
Currently , he said , a member of the West Indies Mission is in Guyana aiding the local church officials with the immigration issue .
A copy of the Ministry of Home Affair ’s statement , which detailed the sequence of the events leading up to the decision to have the Mormons leave , was sent to Sobers .
According to the Ministry , the Missionaries had overstayed their time here and did not possess valid work permits since November 2004 , April 2005 , April 2007 , January 2008 and March 2009 respectively .
In October of 2007 , the church had requested work permits and the extension of stay for ten US nationals to be attached to the church as missionaries but that this was denied .
Further , in February , 2008 a new application was received by the ministry requesting work permits and an extension of stay for another twenty - two American missionaries the church was asked to submit a list of foreign nationals and their locations for the purpose of processing that application .
This list , the ministry reported , was submitted in February 2008 and showed that there were fifty - four missionaries attached to the church and included those who were previously denied work permits and extensions .
While the application for the fifty - four missionaries was being processed the church again applied for work permits and extension of stay for an additional sixty - nine American missionaries and included in this list were eight from the list of fifty - four .
The ministry said that they were given slips acknowledging receipt of their applications .
The ministry had said that the church was informed of the findings and invited to an interview in September 2008 .
Wayne D. Barrow , then Georgetown District President of the church and attorney Nigel Hughes , had attended the interview and the matter was ventilated with the Head of the Immigration Support Services .
In June this year , the ministry said that the church was again asked to supply a list of foreign nationals with the organization along with their location and copies of their passports .
The ministry said that on June 10 , 2009 the church replied and provided a list showing that sixty - six persons were attached and the reply also requested permits and extension of stay for them .
“ Of the sixty ( 60 ) Missionaries , the records showed that fifty ( 50 ) Missionaries had overstayed , ( whereabouts of 13 ) were unclear and three ( 3 ) had valid Work Permits , ” the Ministry noted .
The head of the organization resident here was then invited for a meeting and current District Councilor Sanjay Pooran reported to the ministry and the matter was discussed .
“ He was informed of the Ministry ’s decision and issued a letter denying work permits and extension of stay to the fifty ( 50 ) persons who had overstayed their time in Guyana ” , the ministry related .
Pooran , because of the Church ’s cooperative effort to deal with the issue , could not comment on this .
Addressing this section of the Ministry ’s statement , Sobers said that he is “ not sure that the ministry ’s statement is all together accurate . ”
He confirmed that there were applications for the extension of stay and subsequently appeals were made but as far as he has been informed the Church was never told that those applications had been denied .
“ When applications for the extension of stay are submitted then the immigrants are not expected to leave the country and return when they have been granted that extension , ” Sobers explained .
“ As far as I am informed there was no response from the ministry with and the Missionaries were awaiting confirmation on whether or not their stay had been extended . ”
Sobers also said that there are Missionaries who were granted extensions of stay and were in possession of valid work permits .
The Mormons , he maintained , were not in breach of Guyana ’s Laws and always followed the rules and regulation of any place to which they are assigned .
Cycle of Service
It is highly unlikely for Missionaries to stay more than two years in any given country unless they are the elder members of the Church , Sobers told Stabroek News yesterday as he explained the normal cycle of service followed by the Church .
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints from all over the world , according to Sobers , are required to give two years of service .
When the necessary immigration processes are complete and a member receives their document they are then assigned to a geographical location .
Missionaries , Sobers added , can stay for as little as three months and up to two years provided that they are granted permission by their host country .
The younger Missionaries , he explained , are more likely to stay in one place for shorter periods of time as it is easier for them to travel .
Sobers noted that the section of the statement by the ministry , which reported that some Missionaries overstayed their time here and did not possess valid work permits since November 2004 , April 2005 , April 2007 , January 2008 and March 2009 , is questionable .
He said that a Missionary would not have been in Guyana since 2004 or 2005 since this exceeds the maximum two year period .
“ It is very unlikely that the same missionary would have remained in Guyana since 2004 because a five - year period would have elapsed and no missionary stays in one place that long , ” he stated .
Meanwhile , in a post - Cabinet briefing yesterday , government spokesperson Roger Luncheon also noted that the Missionaries worked on a rotation system .
They come here , are accredited and permitted to stay for “ a variable period of time ” and they are replaced by a new set , he said .
“ There ’s no missionary that is in Guyana for a decade , ” Luncheon said when questioned .
“ You stop being a missionary and you become a resident …
They are granted a stay for a variable period of time and are granted renewals . ”
At the end of that time , Luncheon said , the missionaries themselves will say they are ready to go home or will have to go home because of countries ’ laws .
Assault on religious community
Meanwhile , the main opposition party PNCR yesterday condemned the detention and expulsion of the Missionaries , saying the disregard for due process has severe implications for the rule of law .
Noting that the Church has been operating in the country for more than two decades , PNCR leader Robert Corbin said the arbitrary actions of the government should be considered an assault on the religious community .
He told reporters during a news conference at Congress Place that all Guyanese , and in particular religious organizations , should take note of the incident , since there is need to ensure government is held accountable .
“ So we can hold our heads high when we travel abroad and ask for equitable treatment in those countries , ” he said , while warning , “ It is quite possible Guyanese could be the loser in all these shenanigans . ”
According to Corbin , the PNCR intends to give moral support because of the work of the Church , which he said has been engaged in social projects in this country , providing support to many communities , including those in hinterland areas .
He also emphasized that citizens should be concerned that the actions of the law enforcement authorities disregarded due process by denying the missionaries the right to exhaust all legal appeals .
Meanwhile , newly - elected PNCR Vice - Chairperson
Dr George Norton said that the incident sets a bad example even as the administration criticizes similar treatment of Guyanese by regional and extra-regional governments .
According to him , the PNCR was reliably informed that members of the Church have been complying with the law and have used the relevant procedures to represent their interests .
“ What is evident , however , is an apparent vendetta by the PPP / C Administration towards this religious body , which has been carrying out religious and social development activities in Guyana for more than two decades , ” he emphasized .
Norton charged that the government ’s official report of the episode also deliberately misinforms about what transpired , therefore raising questions about the motivations of the PPP/C administration .
He questioned : “ … Why would the PPP/ C administration carry out this vendetta against an established Church group that has been involved in providing tremendous humanitarian and economic assistance to many communities in Guyana ? ”
He said there are suggestions that the act is one of the ways that the administration has agreed to respond to the withdrawal of the US Visas from certain officials including Former Home Affairs Minister Ronald Gajraj .
Further , he said there are also suggestions that the actions of the government is in retaliation for the US government ’s treatment of Roger Khan and the recent exposure of Guyana government in the US Courts .
In these circumstances , Norton said the nation deserves a truthful explanation from the government , and he said the party is calling on President Bharrat Jagdeo for a full and complete statement on the matter .
Jagdeo , according to the Home Affairs Ministry , convened a meeting at the Office of the President on Wednesday with Rohee and two High Representatives of the church to resolve the issue after the missionaries were detained .
The Ministry said Church representatives were told that the laws of the land must be respected by all and that there was no intention to deport the 50 , who will leave the country voluntarily within one month .
Referring to the involvement of President Jagdeo , Norton argued that it was again evidence of his continuous disregard for the law , the constitution and the judiciary .
According to him , the very fact that after refusing to accept the court order , President Jagdeo invited two of the religious representatives to deliver his personal “ 30 - day clemency period ” for their departure , demonstrates that he is above the law .
First Solar , based in Tempe , Ariz. , is also likely to build a factory in China to make thin - film solar panels , said Mike Ahearn , the company ’s chief executive .
“ It is significant that a non-Chinese company can land something like this in China , ” Mr. Ahearn said in an interview .
Most proposed large - scale solar projects use solar thermal technology , which deploys mirrors to heat a liquid to create steam that drives an electricity - generating turbine .
But as photovoltaic technology becomes more cost - competitive , utilities are turning to companies like First Solar for big solar power farms .
Such projects generally have fewer environmental impacts and can be brought online faster than solar thermal plants .
“ This is nuclear power - size scale , ” Mr. Ahearn said of the China project .
“ A two - gigawatt solar project , if this is connected and is economical at the grid level , demonstrates that solar on a large scale really does work . ”
Financial terms of the agreement have yet to be reached and will depend on China completing a feed - in tariff that pays a premium for electricity generated by renewable energy projects .
First Solar said the 2,000 - megawatt power plant would cost $ 5 billion to $ 6 billion if built in the United States today , but it said the cost to build such a project in China would probably be lower .
The Ordos agreement is the latest large - scale solar farm deal that First Solar has signed in recent months as it expands its business from manufacturing solar modules to building power plants .
The company also has agreed to supply two California utilities with 1,100 megawatts of electricity from three big solar farms .

Gerard LaRocca , a senior executive at Barclays Capital , the investment bank , got an emergency phone call from one of his employees in the bank 's operations department .
The employee was looking at Barclays ' bank statement from its account with JPMorgan .
There had been $ 7 billion in the account , and the employee had been authorized to move the cash from JPMorgan to the Bank of New York , which was Barclays ' regular , or custodial , bank .
But now the money was gone .
Of course , there were a lot of ways you could lose money last September in the weeks following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers .
Banks had stopped lending money , first to one another and then to everyone else .
The stock market crashed , and trillions of dollars were evaporating from the economy .
Lehman Brothers employees who had equity with the firm were left with nothing .
But Barclays had n't lost money in its dealings with Lehman Brothers .
It was in the process of buying Lehman Brothers , the profitable portions of it anyway , in a deal that one of its traders likened to " hitting the lottery . "
It had done what it had set out to do when its executives had surveyed the once - in - a - lifetime wreckage of the American financial system in search of a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , and the $ 7 billion was part of its spoils .
It was more than money to Barclays ; it was money that Barclays had won after struggle — won from battle with the dominant player in banking , JPMorgan Chase — and so the $ 7 billion 's very existence was proof that Barclays had what it took to compete for preeminence in America and therefore around the globe .
The $ 7 billion also happened to be in cash at a time when Barclays , along with just about every other bank in the world , needed it desperately .
The only problem with the $ 7 billion was that it was no longer there in the account managed by JPMorgan .
It was lost .
No , not lost — Barclays had n't lost the $ 7 billion the way other banks were losing their billions , the result of bad bets , insane risks , overleveraging that expressed a feeling of institutional immunity when in fact it was an indication of systemic disease .
No , it was simpler than that , and also infinitely more complicated , given the sheer size of the sum .
The $ 7 billion had been taken .
I was waiting in front of a restaurant in Hell 's Kitchen , on the West Side of Manhattan , when a hired car , gleaming and black but fairly modest as these things go — a Lexus — pulled up to the curb .
One of the back doors opened and out stepped Bob Diamond , the CEO of Barclays Capital , who , upon seeing me , thrust both of his arms up in the air , fists closed , in a sudden and awkward expression of triumph .
I had met Diamond twice before , in his office , and he had been wary and constrained , to the point of seeming genially coiled .
He is a trim and compact fifty - eight - year - old man who identifies himself as a Bostonian , as an Irish - Catholic , as a former teacher , and as a banker , and though he means to be approachable , he can come off as severe as , well , an Irish - Catholic teacher - turned - banker from Boston .
There is , indeed , something almost priestly about him — the sense that he 's using his ebullience to get you to mass .
He has a long pink face and a long pink nose upon which he perches his rimless glasses .
Under his gray eyes he shows fatigue with colorless dents instead of dark circles .
He has a full head of coarse hair the color of a railroad spike , just now starting to turn gray at the temples .
His body language is sprawling , aggressively relaxed , until it is n't — until , say , he 's asked a question that puts him on the alert — and he contracts and snaps to .
His modesty can appear pained and his informality studied .
He has a habit of taking off his suit jacket and slinging it over his shoulder before sitting on the edge of one of the trading desks — a habit that his traders describe as his move , as in , " he has this thing he does with his jacket , when he wants to talk to us , it 's his move ... "
See , everybody has a move , and that 's what I was expecting when Bob Diamond got out of the black Lexus : a move , from a man in dogged control of himself .
Instead , he pumped his fists to the sky , and he looked endearingly goofy and boyish — a conqueror somehow made innocent by the act of celebration .
Of course , Bob Diamond has plenty to celebrate , starting with his conquest .
He is the man from an English bank who bought an iconic American one , after Lehman Brothers defaulted last September 15 on $ 613 billion of obligations and became the biggest bankruptcy in American history .
He is the man who stayed calm in a time of chaos , who stayed ambitious when dreams were dying , who thought big when others thought only of survival , who viewed America as the prize when most of the globe was recoiling from its contagion , who contended with forces vastly stronger than himself and emerged vastly strengthened , who made a $ 45 billion bet and got everything he wanted , saving thousands of American jobs in the process .
He won when everyone else was losing , or , to put it more bluntly , he 's a winner in a historical moment defined by losers , and his only problem is that he is a banker who lives in a time when bankers are mistrusted , especially the happy ones .
Diamond is aware of this .
The first time I met him , I asked him what his answer would be if someone sitting next to him on an airplane asked him what he did for a living .
" I'm a banker , " he said , before adding , " which used to be kind of cool . "
Was being a banker ever cool ?
Maybe not , but it was a profession that certainly conferred exactly what Diamond is at pains to embody — the status of the solid citizen , the kind of old - fashioned eminence that 's rooted in community and a recognizable set of values .
But that was before the expansion of the financial markets and the incessant movement of global capital redefined our notion of what a banker is , what a banker does , and what we might assume about his values .
It is still possible to sit next to Bob Diamond on an airplane , because he is one of the few global financiers who will fly commercial .
But Bob Diamond is one of the highest - paid bankers in the world , earning $ 42 million in 2007 before forgoing his bonuses in 2008 .
He became a British citizen , in addition to being a solid American one , and is such a regular at Davos that his decision to skip the financial summit this year was seen as an indicator of an era 's end .
He is no more still " a banker " than he 's still " a Bostonian " ; rather he is a member of the tiny global caste created in the last forty years or so by capitalism 's elastic effect on the money supply and its acid one on national sovereignty .
This is not to say that he 's a bad guy , or that he 's being disingenuous when he shows up to a photo shoot in the sackcloth of a plain navy - blue suit because he understands that his preferred pinstripes might make him a target .
No , he 's supposed to be a good guy , as good as a guy spearheading the consolidation of the world 's banks is likely to get .
Hell , in the events that begin with the death of Lehman Brothers and end with Barclays ' purchase of its lucrative carcass , he was the underdog , though probably the richest and most resourceful underdog in the history of the world .
And so this story — which is the story of Bob Diamond and Barclays and how capitalists behave when capitalism is under siege — provides a test case .
Last year we despised and distrusted and derided the bankers who failed .
This year we 're in the process of doing the same with the ones who succeed .
But public opinion , like banking itself , is a zero- sum game , and one of these days we 're going to have to decide whom we can live with : the banker hauled before Congress to shamefacedly account for his staggering losses , or the banker who travels the world with his fists in the air .

On September 12 , 2008 , the three masters of the United States economy — Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , SEC Chairman Christopher Cox , and New York Fed President Timothy Geithner — called the half dozen masters of the universe to a weekend meeting at the downtown offices of the New York Fed .
The meeting was , to say the least , not open to the public or to journalists ; indeed , it was nothing short of cabalistic .
The men who were called to the meeting were the CEOs and senior executives of Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , and Citigroup .
These were men invested with the consciousness that they knew how the world worked , and also that they ran it .
On this day , though , their confidence , in themselves and in one another , was shaken ; the week before , there had been a run on the 160 - year - old investment bank Lehman Brothers , and they had come to the terrifying understanding that they were responsible not just for their own losses , but for one another's .
They had established an empire of shared power by extending an empire of shared risk , and now they were realizing that the risk they 'd passed off to others was in the process of coming home .
And so the meeting 's local focus was really a global one :
They were being asked what they were willing to do to save Lehman Brothers .
But they were really being asked what they were willing to do to save capitalism and themselves .
There were two CEOs at the meeting who had more at stake than anyone else .
One was fifty - three - year - old Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase , arguably the most powerful banker in the world .
He was the private hand on the U. S. financial system , as Paulson and Cox were the public ones ; and although his hand had for the most part a steadying effect , it was also very close to the till .
What was at stake for Dimon in the Lehman crisis was , quite simply , cash : JPMorgan was Lehman 's bank .
It cleared Lehman 's trades , which meant that the exchange of cash and securities arranged by Lehman 's traders actually took place at JPMorgan .
If Lehman failed , JPMorgan was , in Wall Street parlance , " exposed " — it would be stuck with the securities and the losses .
During the previous week , Morgan had been advancing Lehman Brothers more than $ 100 billion a day in collateralized lending so that Lehman had the liquidity to cover its debts and stay in business , but the night before — September 11 — it had frozen $ 17 billion of cash and securities in Lehman 's account and had , in the view of Lehman 's executives , effectively finished it off .
The execution came in the form of phone calls to a few key executives , and Dimon had earned their undying enmity by being on those calls but saying nothing .
The other executive with a lot at stake was , of course , Bob Diamond , and what he had at stake was his own ambition :
He was looking to buy Lehman Brothers and thereby become a Wall Street player , a man who men like Jamie Dimon could n't afford to ignore .
And , indeed , on the morning of Sunday , September 14 , the assembled masters agreed to admit Diamond into their company — agreed , that is , to let Bob Diamond save the global financial system by buying Lehman Brothers .
It did n't work .
The deal did not go through , the trade was not closed , and the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings triggered a stock - market crash , a global bank run , and the destruction of trillions of dollars of capital .
The meeting of minds and money that had been called to save capitalism did n't , and so people started writing capitalism 's epitaph , or least epitaphs for capitalism in its most unfettered form .
They even wrote about the meeting itself and how it proved that even the power of men like Dimon and Diamond has its limits .
What was not written about , however — what has never been written about because nobody knew about it — was a meeting that was held just a week later , in the offices of Weil Gotshal , the law firm providing Lehman its bankruptcy counsel .
It was not so grand a meeting as the meeting held at the New York Fed , but it had as much to say about capitalism and how it was being reconstituted .
Indeed , it was either the last meeting of capitalism 's expansion or the first meeting of its contraction , for it pitted JPMorgan against Barclays in a kind of cage - match fight as the rest of the world was collapsing .
In the seven days between those meetings , between the meeting at which Barclays failed to buy Lehman and the meeting at which its takeover of Lehman was completed , it became apparent that the two banks ' primary concerns were less the survival of capitalism than who walked away with a big pile of cash .

In April 2008 , Bob Diamond had received a phone call from one of the undersecretaries of the U. S. Treasury .
His name was Bob Steel , and he was one of Diamond 's friends .
He 'd worked for Henry Paulson at Goldman Sachs and now worked for him at Treasury , but in between he had served on Barclays ' board .
He had stayed in touch with Diamond through the market turmoil of the subprime - mortgage crisis as it unfolded early that year .
Diamond says , " He made it very clear he had no official capacity to ask these questions , but he had two questions to ask me :
Is there a price at which you 'd take Lehman , and if so , what would you need for us to do ? "
Now , you have to understand : Barclays is an old British name and an old British bank .
It 's been in business for 320 years .
But Barclays Capital is a new investment bank .
It 's been in business twelve years , and Diamond has been running it from the start .
When Barclays first hired him to run a new investment - banking business , 80 percent of its revenues were from its retail and commercial - banking business in the UK , which is to say the business side of a bank you see at an ATM machine or a branch office .
He created Barclays Capital out of a threadbare remnant of corporate acquisition and amalgamation called BZW , and then after BarCap promptly lost hundreds of millions of pounds in the Russian debt crisis of 1998 , he had to go before the Barclays board and ask if they wanted to stay in the business of investment banking at all .
They did and wound up strengthening his hand .
Since then , he has made a practice of building BarCap " organically " during times of stability and " strategically " during times of crisis , and by April 2008 he had succeeded in making Barclays the fastest - growing investment bank in the world , if not one of the biggest .
Diamond lived in London and became not just a British banker but also a British citizen , rooting for Chelsea with the same privileged fervor he displayed for the Red Sox , Patriots , and Celtics .
But he was still an American , and he still dreamed of America .
The subprime crisis that had begun in the summer of ' 07 gave him his chance to crack the American market .
When he started Barclays Capital , he did so with the intention of competing with " American bulge - bracket firms , " by which he meant the six or seven traditional American investment banks that had dominated global markets for the last thirty years — Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch , and , yes , Lehman Brothers .
By his own standard , he had failed — " for all our success we were still a second - tier firm in the U. S. " — but he was convinced that he had failed because , while standing for free markets , the big U. S. investment banks were in fact " an oligopoly " that discouraged competition .
He felt that crisis would deliver him opportunity , and when the subprime crisis fell at his own front door , he did two things : first , report his billions of losses to the board , and second , ask the board for money to begin building his business in America .
" It is only in times like these that organizations can improve their relative positions , " he says .
Still , he figured that he would start by luring the most talented traders from banks most shaken by the crisis .
He never thought he'd be able to buy a bank outright — until JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns for some small percentage of its book value the week before Easter 2008 , and then a few weeks later , Bob Steel called and asked him to name his price for Lehman Brothers .
Barclays buying Lehman Brothers ?
It was as if Schweppes were being asked how much it was willing to pay for Pepsi-Cola .
And yet Diamond was not so sure he wanted the deal at all .
There was overlap between the two banks in Europe , and there was " absolutely no track record of success " when one investment bank bought another — especially when a foreign investment bank bought an American one .
Besides , he had done so much right at Barclays , when Lehman had done so much wrong .
How could an investment banker famous for instituting a " no- asshole " rule at Barclays buy an investment bank whose all - asshole rule was just as strictly enforced ?
" Our first impulse was no , " he says .
But when he started looking at the business Lehman Brothers had in the United States , he went back to the board and reminded them what Bob Steel had asked .
" I said , ' Let 's remember the question .
The question was , What price ?
So let 's say the price is a dollar .
Are you going to tell me that this would n't be transformational ? ' "
At the time , his question was hypothetical .
He did n't really expect that Lehman Brothers would be available for a dollar .
He also did n't know — " I know now , " he says — that Lehman 's CEO , Dick Fuld , was already having conversations with Henry Paulson , and Paulson was telling him , in Diamond 's paraphrase :
Get a deal done — we 're not going to bail you out .
Steve Pyke and Paul Stuart
On Thursday , September 11 , 2008 , a week that began with Henry Paulson 's announcement that he was putting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into federal receivership , Paulson called Diamond to ask , officially , if he was interested in buying Lehman Brothers , which was enduring what one of its former executives called a " good old - fashioned bank run , " could n't get financing for its suspect assets , and had lost 70 percent of its value since the opening of trading that Monday .
Diamond , who was in London for an investors ' conference , took the call with his boss , John Varley , and with his two closest confidantes , BarCap COO Rich Ricci and BarCap president Jerry del Missier .
Ricci and del Missier had both been with Diamond from BarCap 's inauspicious beginnings .
They asked Paulson if there was an American company also bidding on Lehman , because they were concerned about being used as a foreign stalking horse .
Paulson said he could n't promise exclusivity but told them to " come here and do your work . "
Diamond , Ricci , and del Missier took the last flights out of Heathrow for New York .
They flew commercial .
On Friday , September 12 , Diamond went to the Barclays building on Park Avenue , where he was picked up by Dick Fuld 's chauffeur in Fuld 's car .
He was taken to the underground parking garage and then took the freight elevator to Lehman 's executive floor — the thirty - first , known as " Club 31 " for its extravagances — and met the beleaguered Fuld in his office .
He found out that there was indeed another bank in the bidding for Lehman Brothers , Bank of America .
With Ricci and del Missier , he then went to the offices of Lehman 's bankruptcy attorneys , and even as Timothy Geithner was calling the richest financiers on the planet to the New York Fed 's headquarters and challenging them to come up with a solution to Lehman 's problems over the weekend , they waited till almost eleven o'clock before they engaged with Lehman executives .
As they waited , they had a chance to look at Lehman 's books and were amazed by what del Missier calls the " size and concentration of its positions " in commercial real estate and private - equity lending .
Simply put , Lehman had taken an ownership piece in virtually every deal it had ever done , until it had a portfolio of $ 50 billion that was the most radioactive portfolio on Wall Street .
And , as Ricci says , " We decide we do n't want it . "
What they wanted was " to take Lehman at a price , without those assets . "
It was the principle that would hold them in good stead in the week to come :
Get the good stuff .
Do n't worry too much about who gets the bad .
On Saturday , September 13 , Diamond and the Barclays team went to the meeting at the Fed .
The mission was clear : Save Lehman Brothers , hence Wall Street , hence the world , all in " business casual . "
Since he was making a bid , Diamond was off in one room ; since he was also making a bid , Ken Lewis of Bank of America was off in another .
The rest — Jamie Dimon , Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , Vikram Pandit of Citigroup , et al. — were all discussing whether they wanted to pay to liquidate Lehman 's radioactive portfolio , its $ 50 billion pile of crap .
They decided they did .
They decided they would .
Barclays and Bank of America both bid for Lehman .
Bank of America wound up asking for guarantees that Henry Paulson could n't fulfill , since Paulson made it very clear he did n't want to do anything that smacked of a Lehman Brothers bailout .
Ken Lewis went on to bid for Merrill Lynch , and Bob Diamond stood alone with his bid for Lehman Brothers .
At the end of the day , the bid was accepted .
A deal had been made .
Barclays was buying Lehman Brothers .
The world was saved .
On Sunday morning , all that remained was for the deal to be sent to the British regulatory body , the Financial Services Authority , for its approval .
But there was a problem : A purchase of such magnitude required a shareholder vote .
For that requirement to be waived , the FSA had to provide a waiver .
The FSA declined .
The deal was dead .
Instead of being saved , Lehman Brothers was told to file for bankruptcy by Christopher Cox , the chairman of the SEC .
The meeting that was designed to save Lehman Brothers ended with Merrill Lynch saved — purchased by Bank of America — and Lehman Brothers in Chapter 11 .
There is still some suspicion , given what was to come , that Diamond never really wanted to buy a solvent Lehman Brothers — that he wanted to buy the bankrupt entity , and orchestrated a piece of subterfuge with the FSA .
There is , however , not a Barclays executive who does not voice regret over the death of the deal that was on the table at the New York Fed , and Rich Ricci says that he and Diamond were " absolutely gutted . "
They went from the Fed to the bar at Smith & Wollensky , a macho New York steakhouse , where , Ricci says , " there was drinking involved . "
There , Diamond got a call on his cell phone .
It was Bart McDade , Lehman 's president .
He told Diamond that Lehman Brothers Holdings , the bank , was going to file for bankruptcy .
But Lehman Brothers North America , the broker - dealer , was still in business , and it was for sale .
He wanted to know whether Diamond was still interested .
" I came back to work , " Ricci says .
" I came back over here [ to 745 Seventh Avenue , Lehman Brothers ' headquarters ] at about four o'clock in the morning .
Very little sleep .
I started working with Bart on how this would work .
And of course all hell broke loose Monday morning .
The world sort of collapsed .
And it was very odd here , very odd . "
The crisis they had tried to avert was upon them , and upon the whole financial system .
The Dow dropped 504 points that day , the bank - to - bank lending rate doubled , and the run that eradicated Lehman Brothers began to spread even to banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs .
The next day , one of the principal money - market funds wrote off its Lehman holdings as worthless , and the value of money - market shares dropped below a dollar for just the second time in history .
At the end of the day , Henry Paulson announced the Treasury 's $ 85 billion bailout of AIG .
Even amidst the chaos on those two days , Diamond and Ricci and McDade , together with teams of lawyers , bankers , analysts , and " deal guys , " camped out on the thirty - first and thirty - second floors of the Lehman building .
They were served food from the dining room on thirty - two ; they did n't sleep .
They knew , in the words of Skip McGee , who headed investment banking for Lehman and now for Barclays , that the value of Lehman Brothers was " melting like ice on a summer day .
If we did n't do the deal when we did , there was no deal to be done . "
At around noon on that Tuesday , Diamond left the building .
He showered and grabbed a change of clothes .
He called London and spoke to his boss and his board .
Around three o'clock in the afternoon , he showed up with Bart McDade on one of Lehman 's trading floors — the fourth .
He was not wearing his jacket .
He told the traders , over the intercom , that they had been bought , that they would continue to get paid , and that he would try to save the bulk of their jobs .
Then , as if to remind the gathered traders that Diamond was their conqueror as well as their savior , the intercom played " God Save the Queen . "
This was the first public announcement that Barclays had purchased Lehman Brothers , and it was repeated on all seven trading floors and then in the auditorium .
He got standing ovations and tears .
The world had ended — was still ending — but Lehman , the cause of it all , had not .
Diamond had done exactly what he set out to do , buying Lehman Brothers " at a price . "
No , the price was n't a dollar , but it was pretty close :
He got Lehman 's U. S. operations and its headquarters building for $ 1.75 billion , including the assumption of some liabilities and a $ 250 million fee .
And Diamond was pretty damned proud of it — pretty damned proud of getting his price .
I asked him once if , seen in retrospect , the Lehman Brothers acquisition was a " no - brainer , " and this was his response : " If it was such a no - brainer , why did no one else bid for it ?
We 're buying the U. S. broker - dealer of Lehman Brothers for $ 1.75 billion , which is roughly the price of this building , which we needed anyway .
No one else bid .
Where was Deutsche ?
Where was Credit Suisse ?
Where was Goldman Sachs ?
Where was Morgan Stanley ?
Where was HSBC ?
This is a U. S. bulge - bracket firm , operating at the very top level , and you 're getting only the crown jewels . "
And then , on Wednesday afternoon , Diamond heard from the Fed .
There was yet another price to be paid .
Bob Diamond was in for the fight of his life .

There was something people said about Bob Diamond pretty much universally .
Current executives , former executives , traders , and friends .
Bob Diamond ?
Good guy , great with people .
Charismatic .
Has built a culture of decency at Barclays from the top down .
Does n't like to hear bad news , though .
Will sometimes stand up and leave a meeting if the news is bad .
Or will stop somebody midsentence — " Why are you telling me this ? "
So if you talk to Bob , you better tell him good news .
Because Bob Diamond is a good - news guy .
It seemed like something to mention in an interview — the kind of softball question that gets someone to talk about himself .
So I did .
And I watched Bob Diamond 's face change as if I 'd ambushed him with secret documents .
His hands , which had been poised in his pinstriped lap , closed into fists .
He got up and went to his computer , then sat down again with his arms crossed .
He had his glasses on , and he peered at me over the lenses .
By force a smile flickered on his face , then went away .
" Who wants to hear bad news ? " he said .
A lot of people think government action saved capitalism .
It did n't .
Capitalism saved capitalism .
A lot of people think the government did n't have any plans with regard to Lehman Brothers .
It did .
The plans just did n't work .
The government , in the form of the Federal Reserve , had two plans , in fact .
It had Plan A and Plan B. Plan A was to find someone to buy Lehman Brothers .
When that did n't happen — when that did n't happen because the Fed did n't want to fund the guarantees necessary to make it happen — they went to Plan B. Plan B was the Fed 's plan to deal with a bankrupt Lehman Brothers .
It was a plan to keep order in the markets once Lehman went out of business .
It called for closing Lehman Brothers the holding company but keeping open its broker - dealer — the part of the operation that bought and sold securities .
That way , the broker - dealer could close all its trades , and all the people doing business with Lehman Brothers could get paid .
So on Monday night , September 15 , the Federal Reserve began advancing the broker - dealer $ 45 billion a day to stay open .
The idea was to keep people from freaking out .
People freaked out .
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was like an eclipse in the Middle Ages , a portent and a fulfillment of portent all at once .
It was the darkness that had the power to burn and blind .
The birds of the marketplace went quiet , and the dogs howled at the sun instead of the moon .
The Fed went from being in control of the situation to being as scared as anyone else .
It was a bank , after all .
Banks were scared .
And then , on Tuesday , Bob Diamond played " God Save the Queen " on the trading floors at Lehman Brothers .
It was the one unalloyed triumph in a week of unnatural disasters , and the people at the Fed had nothing to do with it .
They had not been consulted when the dealmakers were holed up on the thirty - first and thirty - second floors of Lehman Brothers .
They found out about the deal only about an hour before everyone else did .
They were , in the words of one Fed official , " surprised . "
By Wednesday afternoon , they'd had some time to think about it , and the Fed 's general counsel called the general counsel at Barclays .
If you 're going to do this , he said , you 're going to have to step in for us on the funding .
It was a request of sorts .
But it was also a requirement .
There were a series of meetings between Barclays and the Fed that day , and what was clear to one of the participants was the role that fear had started play .
" It was understood that the Fed was desperate to get the Lehman trade off its books , " he says .
Another says simply : " They wanted to get paid . "
Barclays had no objection to doing what the Fed was asking and even saw opportunity in taking over the funding .
The Fed wanted out ?
Barclays was in .
That was the good news .
The bad news ?
As Lehman Brothers ' bank , JPMorgan was also lending Lehman Brothers money .
And JPMorgan wanted out , too .
Barclays Capital and JPMorgan are often presented as heroes of the crisis .
Barclays bought what was left of Lehman Brothers when nobody else wanted to and saved thousands of jobs .
JPMorgan operated as a quasi- public trust , its sheer size exerting a stabilizing force .
Their CEOs even had similar names — Jamie Dimon and Bob Diamond .
A few days before , they 'd agreed on the proposition to create a liquidating trust for Lehman 's toxic assets , with Jamie Dimon urging his Wall Street colleagues to fund it .
But the meeting at the New York Fed was n't capitalism .
It was about capitalism , and it was attended by capitalists .
But it was a nearly collectivist exercise , with government inducing capitalists to cooperate for their own good and the good of one another .
Now , what happened later in the week , between Barclays and JPMorgan — now that was capitalism .
It was n't a deal , you see .
It was a trade .
The Fed was involved with Lehman Brothers in that it was lending Lehman Brothers billions of dollars in return for collateral — sort of like a pawnshop loan .
It wanted Barclays to take over that transaction — to be the one lending Lehman Brothers the billions of dollars in return for the same collateral .
That was the trade .
What made the trade complicated was the fact that JPMorgan was also involved in a pawnshop loan with Lehman Brothers , advancing Lehman Brothers on average $ 69 billion a day .
It had a lot of Lehman Brothers collateral and was looking for someone to take it .
Specifically , it was looking for Barclays to take it .
And it went into the trade with what a JPMorgan official calls a clear understanding that Barclays had agreed to step in for its funding and accept the assets it had on hand .
Barclays went into the trade with no idea how JPMorgan came to such an understanding .
Rich Ricci and Gerard LaRocca figured that the collateral that Lehman Brothers had pledged to the Fed was of good quality .
They suspected that the collateral that Lehman Brothers had pledged to JPMorgan was not as good .
They wanted the good stuff and only the good stuff .
JPMorgan wanted to give them the bad stuff .
This was an elemental Wall Street confrontation , and so , although Barclays ' purchase of Lehman Brothers was supposed to be good for a Wall Street in grievous peril , it ended up a knife fight in an operating room .
The trade was supposed to be simple .
Barclays was supposed to wire $ 45 billion to Lehman Brothers .
In return , Lehman would send $ 49.7 billion in assets back to Barclays .
The difference in the value of the cash and the assets is called the " haircut , " and it rewards the sender of cash for the risk it is taking .
There were , however , some problems .
First , the Fed was so eager — so desperate — to get its money back that it gave Barclays only one day to complete the trade .
Second , the trade was so large and put such a strain on the Wall Street infrastructure that nobody knew if it could actually be completed in a day .
Third , it was not simultaneous , as most trades are .
In most trades , cash and assets are exchanged simultaneously at the bank where the money is changing hands — the so - called clearing bank .
This trade was different , because the world was different .
This trade was a fucking bet .
Barclays was going to be sending the cash out first over the wire and waiting for the assets to come back .
And fourth , the clearing bank was JPMorgan , which gave it tremendous power .
I mean , think of it : Morgan was going to have the money and the securities .
So if you were Barclays , you had to trust JPMorgan .
Which leads us to the fifth problem :
It did n't .
The trade started out simply enough .
On the morning of September 18 , 2008 , Barclays wired its first $ 5 billion to Lehman Brothers through JPMorgan .
And then it waited to receive the collateral back .
It took a long time .
It took six hours to get $ 5.06 billion in collateral .
Ricci 's plan was to keep sending the cash $ 5 billion at a time and then make sure he got the collateral he wanted in return .
But late in the afternoon there was a phone call from Bill Winters , the co-CEO of JPMorgan 's investment bank .
It was to Bob Diamond .
Winters had a request , or maybe a challenge .
Listen , he said , at the rate we 're going , we 're never going to get this done .
Cut this $ 5 - billion - at - a - time crap and let 's get it over with .
Send us $ 40 billion all at one time .
Diamond looked at Rich Ricci .
The deal of the century would require the risk of the century .
Your call , Ricci said .
Ricci wanted to keep sending the cash out $ 5 billion at a time .
Forty billion dollars was a lot of fucking money .
But he knew that this was Wall Street , that this was some kind of you - show - me - yours - I 'll - show - you - mine moment .
Winters was asking Diamond if he was in — all - in .
Your call , Ricci said .
On Wall Street , there are two kinds of jobs : back office and front office .
The people who work in the back office support the people who work in the front office .
The people who work in the back office are the analysts , the risk managers , the computer programmers .
The people in the front office are traders .
What separates the two kinds of jobs — what makes the front office so much more prestigious and lucrative than the back office — is risk .
Risk is not just the lifeblood of Wall Street ; it 's the juice .
If you can take risks , you get a front - office job ; if you can't , you get a back - office job .
Both are fine , but only one allows you to be a hero .
Bob Diamond had started in the back office .
In 1979 , he took his first Wall Street job in Morgan Stanley 's IT department .
He did very well at it and became assistant to the CFO .
But he could see what was happening on the Street , could see that banks like Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers were , in his words , " starting to take real risks . "
He had started his career on Wall Street just as the expansion of the risks banks were willing to take was about to change Wall Street forever , and he wanted to be part of it .
So he accepted the assistant CFO job only on the condition that he'd get a chance to work in the front office .
A year later , he got a job on the financing desk , as a so - called repo trader , doing the very same kind of pawnshop loans that Barclays was trying to do with Lehman Brothers .
Repo traders are not heroes ; most traders do n't regard them as real traders , because they do n't take positions , and their trades simply finance the trades that real traders make .
" We still kid Bob about starting out on the repo desk , " Ricci says , and if there 's anything Diamond is sensitive about , it 's his ability to take risks .
He tells the story of being a young trader looking with pride at his book of trades because he'd never made a trade that lost money , until he realized that never losing money on a trade made him a loser on Wall Street , not a winner , because it meant he was n't taking enough risk .
He was shortchanging his company , shortchanging himself ...
At about five minutes to seven , on September 18 , 2008 , Barclays Capital wired $ 40 billion to JPMorgan .
In an instant , he had put his bank at risk .
Bob Diamond was all - in .
Bob Diamond does n't like to talk about it .
He does n't like talking about his role in the trade , figuring that there 's no upside to a CEO commenting on a controversy .
When he does talk about it , he 's cagey .
He does n't even come out and say that there were talks with JPMorgan about assurances with regard to taking over JPMorgan 's financing of Lehman ; rather , he says that " if there were talks with JPMorgan , then I was in on them . "
When he's told the story of Bill Winters calling and challenging him to send the $ 40 billion all at once , he smiles shrewdly , while keeping his dead - level gaze , and says , " Well , if Rich Ricci told you that story , then it must be true . "
It 's only when JPMorgan , through an official close to the trade , says that JPMorgan received assurances about the trade from senior Barclays executives , including Bob Diamond , that Diamond rouses himself into an unequivocal denial .
Assurances to JPMorgan ?
There were no assurances , not from Diamond , nor from anyone else at Barclays .
What 's clear from Diamond 's cloaked admissions , however , is the fact that executives at the highest levels of both firms played a part in the trade of September 18 and 19 .
And when the official at JPMorgan speaks of the bank feeling deceived , it 's clear he means that JPMorgan felt deceived by , among others , Bob Diamond himself .
There are two numbers you have to remember :
The first is $ 15.8 billion .
The second is $ 7 billion .
The $ 15.8 billion is the loan that Barclays extended to Lehman Brothers the night before , when the Fed forced the trade on Barclays .
The payment of that loan led JPMorgan to believe it was going to have its way with Barclays — that Barclays was going to take over funding for Lehman Brothers , and also take the collateral JPMorgan was looking to get rid of .
The bad stuff .
But a loan of this type has to be renewed every night .
And late on Thursday , the back - office guys at JPMorgan notice that Barclays has not renewed the $ 15.8 billion loan .
A back - office guy at Barclays says that it 's just an oversight , and the loan will be renewed .
After all , Barclays has more to worry about than a $ 15.8 billion loan .
Barclays has to worry about the $ 40 billion .
You see , it has n't gotten the collateral back for it .
And although the Fed is working to keep open the wire — the electronic conduit for securities transfers — time is running out , and it is clear that Barclays is not going to get paid , not tonight anyway .
For the day , Barclays has sent $ 45 billion cash to Lehman Brothers via JPMorgan .
It 's supposed to get $ 49.7 billion back in collateral .
It 's gotten $ 42.7 billion .
It 's short .
Barclays is fucked .
Diamond , it seems , has lost his bet .
And then , at one in the morning , there 's a deal : JPMorgan agrees that it owes Barclays a lot of money .
A custodial account is created at JPMorgan for just this purpose .
It 's Barclays ' account .
It 's Barclays ' cash : $ 7 billion .
Somebody wakes up Friday feeling they 've gotten screwed .
Take your pick :
It could be JPMorgan , when it discovers that Barclays did n't pay the $ 15.8 billion loan , and Barclays explains that it was under no obligation to do so .
It could be Barclays , when it discovers that JPMorgan has frozen the account with the $ 7 billion .
So let 's change our opening proposition :
Everybody wakes up Friday feeling they 've gotten screwed .
And it 's still early .
It 's about 5:00 A.M. , in fact , when Mike Keegan of Barclays tells Alex Kirk of Lehman Brothers that JPMorgan has started to freeze Lehman 's assets .
Keegan is , like a lot of the people Diamond has brought in to consummate the Lehman purchase , somebody who has been with Diamond a long time .
He has , indeed , the honor of having been one of Diamond 's first hires at Barclays Capital .
Alex Kirk is a Lehman managing director .
Like a lot of the Lehman people who have been brought in to consummate the deal , he has the honor of being with the company only a few months and of being both a newcomer and a survivor .
He has been asked by Lehman president Bart McDade to close the trade because Lehman 's original closer , its mergers - and - acquisitions guy , quit the day before .
When Keegan tells him about the frozen assets , he tells Keegan , " Call Bob [ Diamond ] and Rich [ Ricci ] .
Tell them we 've got a problem .
JPMorgan is not going to close .
They 're not going to sell you one thing you want . "
He is a Lehman person , you see , and like all of the Lehman people , he has dealt with JPMorgan before .
In the week leading up to Lehman 's bankruptcy , the Lehman people saw how JPMorgan responded when threatened : like a raging , squatting behemoth , " seizing and freezing assets left and right , " in the words of another former Lehman managing director .
" JPMorgan does n't want to save the universe , " he says .
" JPMorgan wants to profit from the destruction of the universe . "
To Lehman guys like Kirk , JPMorgan is nothing but a predator .
And so he warns Keegan and Ricci :
You 're going to have to rewrite the entire deal .
The deal , of course , is not a handshake agreement .
And at the heart of the deal is the list of assets that Barclays has agreed to purchase from Lehman Brothers , consisting of thousands of securities .
The list , like everything else in the deal , has to be approved by the bankruptcy - court judge after a hearing .
And the hearing is today , Friday afternoon .
At four o'clock .
It 's now seven in the morning .
Kirk is telling Keegan and Ricci that they have to rewrite the asset - purchase agreement in nine hours .
That means going back to Lehman 's books and finding securities that might actually be worth what Barclays is going to pay .
But the bigger problem is the $ 7 billion .
One of the reasons the trade went slowly the night before was that the collateral that started coming over the wire was not the collateral that Barclays believed it was paying for .
It was n't the good stuff , from the Fed .
It was , in the words of a Barclays executive , crap .
As in , I know crap when I see crap .
Fortunately for Barclays , some of the Lehman people on hand recognized it .
They should .
They 'd sold it .
These were assets that bore the kind of name that historians will decry when they write of the last days of the Era of Expanding Risk :
RACERS .
Restructured Asset Certificates with Enhanced Returns .
They were issued with an Aaa rating from Moody's .
Now they were practically worthless , so worthless in fact that Lehman people had been warning Barclays people about them .
Do n't take the RACERS ...
So Barclays rejected the collateral that JPMorgan was sending over .
" I do n't know if Barclays knew that it was starting a holy war when it refused the collateral , " says the former Lehman managing director .
" But that 's what happened .
I think that JPMorgan got pissed because they 're usually so clever at doing this stuff .
Now it was being done to them . "
But JPMorgan has a clever move left because it has the $ 7 billion — $ 7 billion is still a lot of money , and JPMorgan holds it hostage .
If Barclays wants its money , it has to take the RACERS and pay the $ 15.8 billion .
The knife fight in the operating room has begun .
It 's Sunday morning , one week after the most powerful bankers in the world tried and failed to save capitalism .
That morning , Alex Kirk turns to Bart McDade and says , What are we going to tell people ?
How are we going to explain this ?
What Kirk and McDade fear they are going to have to explain is unusual indeed :
Two days earlier , at a bankruptcy - court hearing that lasted eight hours and ended at close to one in the morning , Judge James Peck had approved the rewritten deal .
He 'd approved the deal because he deemed it significant to the markets , to " the national economy , and the global economy . "
And now Kirk and McDade fear that they wo n't be able to close it .
The deal of the century is on the brink of collapse .
The $ 7 billion is still frozen .
And JPMorgan wo n't return Barclays ' calls .
Because JPMorgan is furious that Barclays did n't return its calls .
The world is ending in silence .
That night , however , there is an emergency meeting at the offices of Weil Gotshal , Lehman 's bankruptcy lawyers .
A Barclays contingent led by Rich Ricci is there on one side of the table .
They do n't even know if JPMorgan is going to show up .
But it does , and the common assumption is that the Fed prevailed upon it to do so , at the highest levels .
The JPMorgan contingent is led by its general counsel , Stephen Cutler .
He looks at the assemblage on the other side and says :
You did n't really think you could close without us , did you ?
Some of the people at the meeting remember it for its mayhem — for JPMorgan " trying to bully Rich Ricci , " and Ricci showing that he " does n't bully well , " and both sides eventually calling each other thieves .
But one of the lawyers remembers it as a " bunch of bankers yelling about what bankers usually yell about — money . "
And at the end , there was a settlement — " well , we thought there was a settlement , " the lawyer says .
And so it was that sometime early on Monday morning , September 22 , precisely one week after Lehman 's bankruptcy filing ended the era of Wall Street expansionism , a trade was completed that began the era of global financial consolidation .
Lehman Brothers NA , the surviving broker - dealer of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings , sent a package of securities to Barclays Capital .
Barclays Capital wired back cash , thereby obligating Lehman Brothers NA to pay it back by the terms of the repo contract .
As foreordained , Lehman Brothers NA defaulted .
Barclays forgave the debt , taking possession of the company instead .
The trade was closed , and Bob Diamond had his prize , for his price .
One day later , Gerard LaRocca discovered that the $ 7 billion he thought was in the Barclays account at JPMorgan was no longer there .
You get the sense that they are still taken aback about what they had to contend with — the furies they unleashed — in their dealings with JPMorgan .
They say they would never want to go through something like that again .
They say that it was Wall Street hardball at its best and worst .
They say that they 've gone up against many Wall Street tough guys , but this was something different .
This was inappropriate .
This was ruthless .
This was one firm making a bad situation much worse .
This was a Wall Street giant exacerbating the distress of the markets .
Sure , there were things that JPMorgan was unhappy about .
It was unhappy about the deals it had on the books with Lehman Brothers and so it became unhappy about its deal with Barclays .
But there was nothing that Barclays did that could have possibly justified JPMorgan taking its money .
In fact , by taking the money without warning or authorization , JPMorgan did something that was unprecedented .
But for all that — for all of JPMorgan 's ruthlessness — Barclays won at every turn .
They won everything they wanted to win .
They got the good stuff .
They made sure someone else got the bad .
They went by the simple if pitiless principle articulated by Rich Ricci :
" What happened was we then decided very consciously we were only going to take these liabilities , these assets .
That 's it .
The rest of it is in the hands of the bank , of the court , and of the receiver ...
Now , certainly we 're worried about the past and trying to help our clients .
But we are under no obligation to settle those things because of the way bankruptcy works .
We have the advantage of a clean slate going forward but the disadvantage of trying to deal with Lehman clients who want to talk about the past . "
Compare that with how JPMorgan fared .
JPMorgan went into the trade looking to unload its worthless Lehman assets , and looking to get Barclays to fund the operations of the Lehman broker - dealer .
Instead , an official speaking for JPMorgan admits ,
We kept the dregs , and did n't get paid .
JPMorgan was not very happy with Barclays Capital .
And so , when the $ 7 billion went missing , perhaps it was inevitable that Bob Diamond 's winning streak would continue .
It was shocking to Barclays executives that the Fed was n't able to just make JPMorgan give it back — was n't able to convince JPMorgan to right such an obvious wrong .
But when the Fed forensically reconstructed the trade and both sides were called upon to settle , Barclays got satisfaction : $ 1.3 billion in cash and $ 5.7 billion in securities .
Bob Diamond got everything he wanted , because he knew what he wanted .
He named his price , and he got it .
" Was it fun ? " I asked Bob Diamond .
It was one of those easy questions he did n't like .
Hard questions he could answer with dignity , with his combination of priestly remove and priestly magnanimity .
The easy questions made him look a little queasy .
He blanched a little bit , and his mouth tightened , like the knot of a skinny tie .
" I do n't think there 's any way you could describe anything we did over that period as fun , " he said .
" I think , in looking back , there 's definitely things that we accomplished that we felt very gratified about — felt , gosh , given the situation , we really executed well .
But there was no aspect of it — from the intensity , from vested interests on so many sides , from disagreements with people you trust and know well , to being frankly just plain tired — there was no aspect about it that could be described as fun .
But we knew that when we started this process .
We got on a plane Thursday night to come to New York .
We understood the seriousness .
We expected this to be one of the most intense experiences .
We felt that if it was n't something we were prepared to do , we should move aside . "
They did n't move aside , of course .
At no time did they ever move aside , and now Diamond was an American again .
He moved to New York and went to work in the big building at 745 Seventh Avenue , which used to be the headquarters of an American investment bank called Lehman Brothers .
Its facade used to throb with the color of lucre — Lehman green , in honor of all those employees who attested that they " bled green " — but now its pulse was Barclays blue .
Dick Fuld used to go to work in the carved isolation of the thirty - first floor , but now Bob Diamond 's office was made of glass and it was located in the corner of one of his trading floors .
He had intended the purchase of Lehman Brothers to be " transformational " for Barclays , and for evidence of his success he did n't have to look much farther than just outside the walls that were his windows and the windows that were his walls .
It was n't just that Barclays Capital was now an American bulge - bracket firm in its own right ; it was n't just that out of the integration of Barclays and Lehman Brothers he had built what Jerry del Missier called a " flow monster " that kept capital moving with incredible efficiency .
It was that in taking over Lehman Brothers , he had also allowed Barclays to be taken over , in what one Barclays trader called the " goddamnedest reverse takeover you ever saw . "
The culture at Lehman Brothers was American and aggressive , replete with its " animals " and its " killers , " not to mention its jerks and assholes , and while Diamond cherished the culture he had built at Barclays from the beginning , he was willing to put it in play .
And so I asked him if the purchase of Lehman Brothers had been as transformational for him as it was for Barclays .
Of course , being a journalist rather than a capitalist , I was thinking in sentimental terms — thinking that he might answer by speaking of what he'd lost , in terms of innocence , rather than what he 'd gained , in terms of power and prestige .
But his answer was right in front of me , as well as all around me .
His jacket was off , slung on a chair .
He was wearing a blue - striped shirt , with a green tie dotted with tiny emblems in the shape of Nantucket , where his father had once been the high school principal , and where he was flying that evening in a NetJet to spend the summer weekend at his mansion .
His whole being was transformed and his innocence was the innocence of acquisition .
He was transformed exactly as Barclays had been , and when , two weeks later , Barclays Capital announced — largely on the strength of its Lehman acquisition — a half - year profit of nearly $ 2 billion , Diamond 's staid English bank stood with JPMorgan as one of the biggest investment banks in the world ... or , as Ricci would have it , as " one of the big boys , for better or for worse .

A model that replicates the functions of the human brain is feasible in 10 years according to neuroscientist Professor Henry Markram of the Brain Mind Institute in Switzerland .
" I absolutely believe it is technically and biologically possible .
The only uncertainty is financial .
It is an extremely expensive project and not all is yet secured . "
The apparent complexity of the human mind is not a barrier to building a ' replica ' brain claims Professor Markram .
" The brain is of course extremely complex because it has trillions of synapses , billions of neurons , millions of proteins , and thousands of genes .
But they are still finite in number .
Today 's technology is already highly sophisticated and it allows us to reverse engineer the brain rapidly . "
An example of the capability already in place is that today 's robots can do screenings and mappings tens of thousands of times faster than human scientists and technicians .
Another hurdle on the path to a model human brain is that 100 years of neuroscience discovery has led to millions of fragments of data and knowledge that have never been brought together and exploited fully .
" Actually no one even knows what we already understand about the brain , " says Professor Markram .
" A model would serve to bring this all together and then allow anyone to test whatever theory you want about the brain .
The biggest challenge is to understand how electrical - magnetic - chemical patterns in the brain convert into our perception of reality .
We think we see with our eyes , but in fact most of what we ' see ' is generated as a projection by your brain .
So what are we actually looking at when we look at something ' outside ' of us ? "
For Professor Markram , the most exciting part of his research is putting together the hundreds of thousands of small pieces of data that his lab has collected over the past 15 years , and seeing what a microcircuit of the brain looks like .
" When we first switched it on it already started to display some interesting emergent properties .
But this is just the beginning because we know now that it is possible to build it .
As we progress we are learning about design secrets of our brains which were unimaginable before .
In fact the brain uses some simple rules to solve highly complex problems and extracting each of these rules one by one is very exciting .
For example we have been surprised at finding simple design principles that allow billions of neurons to connect to each other .
I think we will understand how the brain is designed and works before we have finished building it . "
The opportunities for this neuroscience research challenge are immense explains Professor Markram : " A brain model will sit on a massive supercomputer and serve as a kind of educational and diagnostic service to society .
As the industrial revolution in science progresses we will generate more data than anyone can track or any computer can store , so models that can absorb it are simply unavoidable .
It is also essential to build models when it comes to treating brain diseases affecting around two billion people .
At present , there is no brain disease for which we really understand what has gone wrong in the processing , in the circuits , neurons or synapses .
It is also important if we are to replace the need for the millions of animal experiments each year for brain research . "

Advertisement A rescue operation is under way in the Philippines after a ferry sank with more than 960 people on board .
Coastguards say 931 people have now been rescued from the SuperFerry 9 but nine people have died and more than 30 are still unaccounted for .
The passenger ferry was sailing off the southern Zamboanga peninsula when it began listing .
It issued a distress call , prompting the coastguard , the navy , the air force and private boats to help .
In pictures : Philippines ferry sinks The Philippine Defence Minister , Gilberto Teodoro , told the BBC that the rescue operation had been helped by good weather and the presence of other vessels close to the site .
The SuperFerry 9 was said to be carrying 847 passengers and 117 crew plus four sea marshals on its journey from General Santos to Iloilo .
A statement issued on the SuperFerry website said that the ship began listing to the right at 0230 on Sunday ( 1830 GMT Saturday ) .
Passengers were told to don life jackets while the captain tried to correct the list , the statement said .
When the captain determined that the list was irreversible , he gave the order to abandon ship , and life rafts were launched .
Shocked passengers were brought ashore by other vessels
The statement said that the crew were the last to leave the ship at 0842 local time , when the ferry tilted and sank .
Officials said that those rescued were transferred to navy ships , two nearby civilian vessels and other smaller boats which had responded to the Mayday call .
The coastguard in Manila said nine bodies had been brought in so far by rescue boats and fishing vessels .
However the death toll could rise if reports of more fishing boats bringing in dead bodies proved accurate .
The Philippine air force and army have sent helicopters to help in the search for those still missing .
The cause of the sinking was unknown , but the weather was reported to be fair at the time of the incident .

Abu Sayyaf claims it planted a bomb on board
The ferry ran into trouble about 530 miles ( 860 km ) south of the Philippine capital , Manila .
One passenger said the ship began listing in the middle of the night , but he was assured by the crew that everything was all right .
However , a couple of hours later the situation worsened .
" The ship shifted suddenly and some people just panicked , " a man named as Roger Cinciron was quoted as telling a local radio station by phone .
He was speaking from one of the life rafts as he waited to be rescued .
The ferry had been due to arrive in Iloilo later on Sunday , AP quoted the ship 's owner , Aboitiz Transport System , as saying .
A BBC correspondent says maritime accidents are common in the Philippines because of tropical storms , poor ship maintenance and lax safety enforcement .

National Geographic has a fascinating simulation of why the US World Trade Center towers collapsed after the planes hit them on September 11 2001 .
It 's part of a program investigating " science and conspiracy " .
Basically , it 's because the fuel in the ( nearly - full ) tanks caught fire , which weakened the columns , which bent slightly , which meant that the roof - and other floors - fell in .
We know that from the real - life example , of course .
But it 's interesting to see it demonstrated here .
Not , of course , that this will satisfy the wingnuts who think it was a conspiracy .
Their loss .
But sometimes this is what engineering is about : figuring out why things happen after the event .
( Other videos on the National Geographic site ask whether controlled demolition could have done the same job , and whether the hijacked planes were replaced by planes carrying explosives .

“ Hello , I ’m Gross ” Tattoo , Pic .
Sometimes your tatt talks volumes about you .
This one does not say you ’re tough , or that you have good hygiene .
It just says you ’re gross .
When I wrote my last two blog entries ( not counting the announcement about my new developerWorks article ) , Modeling your data with DBpedia vocabularies and Big legal publishers and semantic web technology , I had no idea that I would soon stumble across a nice collection of US Supreme Court case metadata in DBpedia .
After writing about modeling with DBpedia vocabularies , it occurred to me that if Wikipedia has pages with infoboxes for individual professional wrestlers and Battlestar Galactica episodes , they probably have them for important Supreme Court cases as well .
I checked for Roe v. Wade ( popular in legal publishing because along with being a famous case , its title is short and easy to spell ) and there it was at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade.
Even better for the semweb geek , its DBpedia page at http://dbpedia.org/page/Roe_v._Wade showed properties for most of the key bits of information you want for a court decision : the date , the reporter volume and page , names of concurring judges , names of dissenting judges , laws applied , and more .
Wikipedia and DBpedia even include my favorite case , Campbell v. Acuff - Rose Music , Inc. , in which Appendix B of the Supreme Court decision includes the following lyrics from the 2 Live Crew song that Roy Orbison 's publisher sued " Luther Campbell aka Luke Skywalker " ( as he 's known in the case 's dbprop : fullname ) over : " Big hairy woman all that hair it ai n't legit / ' Cause you look like ' Cousin It ' " .
( I like my landmark Supreme Court IP law decisions to include Addams Family references . )
Wikipedia currently has pages for 198 Supreme Court decisions , according to their Category : United States Supreme Court cases page .
After going to the DBpedia equivalent of that page , I realized that I could retrieve a list of them all with a simple SPARQL query on DBpedia 's query form :
SELECT DISTINCT ?s WHERE { ?s < http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#subject>
< http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:United_States_Supreme_Court_cases> }
Even better , I noticed at the bottom of the Wikipedia page for Campbell v Acuff - Rose that it belonged to the Wikipedia category US copyright case law , a pretty important bit of categorization metadata .
Sure , you can look at that page to see the list , but you can also retrieve the list with a slight modification to the SPARQL query above :
SELECT DISTINCT ?s WHERE { ?s < http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#subject>
< http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:United_States_copyright_case_law> }
The most interesting part of the metadata included with the cases is the connections between them .
For example , the DBpedia page for Brown v. Board of Education shows that it " is dbpprop : overruled of " Plessy v. Ferguson .
The DBpedia page for Plessy v. Ferguson shows that it 's dbprop : overruled by Brown v. Board of Education .
There are not enough of these links to threaten a commercial cite - checking service such as LexisNexis 's Shepard 's product — a lawyer checking whether a potentially citable case was has been overruled is a classic example of when search recall trumps precision , because missing just one search result can be disasterous for the lawyer .
Still , the current amount of SPARQL - addressable fielded metadata about US caselaw on Wikipedia ( and hence on DBpedia ) is a big step beyond the amount of law metadata on the web that was available when I wrote about this in early 2006 .
It will be great to see this collection grow and to see more applications take advantage of it .
“ Restoration ” Damage to Khaju Bridge at Isfahan
According to reports and pictures provided by Shahin Sepanta of the Pasargard Foundation the Khaju Bridge of Isfahan ( known as Pol - e - Khaju in Persian ) is being severely threatened due to various “ improvement ” projects .
Sepanta ’s alarming reports have recently been verified by the Payvand news of Iran network and the Mehr news Agency in iran on August 2 , 2009 .
In strictly archaeological terms , the photographs provided by Shahin Sepanta , Payvand news and Mehr news of iran portray what can be termed as a “ restoration ” disaster .
Shahin Sepanta has written extensively on the dangers to archaeolgical sites in Iran as a result of the systematic efforts of certain official authorities .
The Khaju Bridge has been variously known as Pol - e - Shahin , Pol - e - Shiraz and Pol - e - Roknedin has a length of 133 meters and 12 meters wide was built duering the reign of Shah Abbas II ( 1632 -1666 ) .
The bridge served various purposes : it was often used by ordinary and more disitnguished travellers ( including the Safavid nobility ) for travel .
The bridge was also part of an engineering system for maintaining nearby parks as well as the storage of water .
The site has been able to withstand the ravages of time and invasions over the centuries – until now .
As noted by Shahin Sepanta , Mehr News and Payvand News , Pol - e - Khaju is in grave danger .
There is currently an “ improvement ” project in place which is in fact damaging the structural and historical integrity of the site .
The pictures provided by Shain Sepanta , Mehr News and Payvand News , provide vivid illustrations of the damages that are being inflicted to the site .
It would appear that the authorities have not considered the finer details of restoration in these recent efforts at Pol - e - Khaju .

Smashed masonry of Khaju .
These were once part and parcel of the Bridge structure , but have been deliberately broken off to be destroyed .
Safaivd era blocks with inscriptions now lie in ruins .
Another example of ruined Safavid inscription works .

The purpose of these actions are not clear , but it is clear that the “ restoration ” team is not cognizant of archaeology and the historical heritage value of the site .
Bulldozers have levelled the area to even out the terrian with the riverbed .
There are fears that this action may inflict further long - term damage to the site .
Stones with legends representing “ signatures ” of the different masons who originally constructed Pol - e - Khaju in Safavid times .
These very stones are also being imperilled by the current “ restoration ” efforts .
Legend for the symbols seen on the stones at Khaju .
Use of heavy construction machinery for the “ improvement ” of Pol - e - Khaju .
Instead of using proper archaeological tools and competently trained archaeologists , restorers , etc. authorities have often used conventional construction methods , tools and personnel , ultimately resulting in irreversible damage to ancient Iranian sites .
Graffiti vandalism at Pol - e - Khaju .
Despite her plethora of ancient and UNESCO - heritage sites , there is no system in place to protect sites from hostile or vandalism - type acts .
Another example of graffiti vandalism at Pol - e - Khaju .

but you are still in a world that 's breaking , " Taleb said on " Squawk Box . "
Anything that 's fragile like the financial system will eventually crash , he said .
" We 're in the middle of a crash , " Taleb said .
" So if I 'm going to forecast something , it is that it 's going to get worse , not better . "
The government needs to deleverage debt and not try stimulus packages that will inflate assets , he said .
" What makes me very pessimistic in not seeing any leadership or awareness on parts of government on what has to be done , which is deleverage $ 40 - to - $ 70 trillion , " Taleb said .
Katrina victims in Oprah homes indicted
They are accused of taking FEMA money after moving
Three Hurricane Katrina evacuees who found homes in Houston thanks to Oprah Winfrey 's charitable foundation are accused of bilking the government of tens of thousands of dollars in housing assistance .
Federal agents arrested the women Wednesday morning at their homes on Angel Lane , to the surprise of neighbors who have struggled to build a thriving community in their southwest Houston subdivision .
They plan to arrest the sister of one of the women today on similar charges .
“ It was a shock to everyone on the block , ” said 18 - year - old Julie Paxton , who said one of the women was a nurse and another was a probation officer .
“ We did n't know people like that would do something like this . ”
Darlene Poole , 30 , and her sister Lashona Victor , 37 , who lives in Louisiana , are charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud for allegedly filing for rental assistance from FEMA after Poole bought a Habitat for Humanity home on Angel Lane three years ago .
According to the federal indictment , Victor registered with FEMA as Poole 's landlord and the two submitted false lease agreements and rent receipts that prompted FEMA to pay them more than $ 14,000 .
Poole also told FEMA she was unemployed , although she was actually working for Harris County 's Community Supervision and Corrections Department , the indictment alleges .
If convicted , each sister could face up to 20 years in prison .
Others charged
Next door to Poole , 38 - year - old Angela Payne was charged with theft of government property and making false statements to FEMA for filing for rental assistance after she bought her Angel Lane home .
Down the street , 34 - year - old Kiesha Murphy faces the same charges .
The indictment alleges Murphy also filed for unemployment assistance despite having a job at Memorial Hermann Hospital , netting more than $ 12,000 in benefits .
Both Murphy and Payne could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
A man who answered Payne 's door Wednesday afternoon had “ Angela ” tattooed on his arm but said he did not know the details of the arrest .
No one answered the door at Murphy 's address , nor Poole's .
But word had already spread from house to house down the snug two - block street where residents helped build their own homes in 2005 , side - by - side with Habitat volunteers , using tools hand - delivered by Oprah .
The 65 families selected to live on Angel Lane were given highly affordable , interest - free mortgages on homes decorated and fully furnished by Oprah 's Angel Network .
“ They 've got everything Oprah gave them — a house and everything — and then they 've got to do that , ” lamented Paxton .
Paxton , who knew Poole , Murphy and Payne , said all three were friendly and apparently upstanding community members — the last people she 'd suspect of fraud .
“ It 's completely devastating , ” said Patricia Isaac , 63 , who lives down the block from Payne and Poole .
Angel Lane residents have struggled to overcome the challenges of building a new community from scratch after Katrina swept their New Orleans homes away .
When the quiet street started becoming a backdrop for vandalism and thefts , they fought back .
Members of the homeowners association worked to quell discord among neighbors .
The street has been calm in recent months , neighbors said .
But Wednesday 's arrests dealt a frustrating new blow .
Tanika Thomas , the vice president of the homeowners association , works full time while pursuing her master 's degree .
She hopes the arrests wo n't reflect badly on the hardworking families who constitute the bulk of the neighborhood .
“ That 's four isolated cases .
That can't speak for the whole 65 families , ” she said .
“ We can't punish everybody for what these four did . ”
Habitat for Humanity officials declined to comment Wednesday on whether the residents charged with fraud would lose their homes ; a spokeswoman would only say that the agency is cooperating with the investigation .
Appeared in court
A spokeswoman for Oprah's Angel Network , Angela De Paul , said only that “ we were disappointed to learn of these alleged actions by a few homeowners , but we remain proud of and committed to the hundreds of families we have been able to help through our hurricane rebuilding efforts . ”
Wednesday morning , Poole , Murphy and Payne made appearances in federal court , where they were appointed attorneys and released on bond .
Victor is expected to surrender to Houston authorities today , according to a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors who have already charged 90 other people with abusing hurricane relief efforts in the Southern District of Texas .
“ The response to natural disasters brings out the best and worst in people , ” said U.S. Attorney Tim Johnson .
“ Generous acts of charity are tarnished by those who , despite the generosity of others , fraudulently make claims for government relief funds . ”
Chronicle reporter Mary Flood contributed to this report .

What is behind the opposition to the Obama healthcare plan ?
12 August 2009
President Obama ’s proposed restructuring of the US healthcare system has come under ferocious attack over the past week .
Right - wing activists , in many cases organized by groups affiliated with the Republican Party or financed by sections of the healthcare industry , turned out at town hall meetings to shout down Democratic congressmen or Obama aides .
There have been death threats and some actual violence .
The right - wing attack combines hysterical distortion of the provisions of the Obama plan ( frequently , and falsely , branded as “ socialized medicine ” ) with an appeal to the concerns of wide layers of the American population who sense , quite correctly , that the healthcare restructuring being promoted in Washington will come at their expense and will benefit only the big corporate interests .
Chief among the distortions has been the claim , fostered most notably by former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , that the Obama plan promotes euthanasia and that millions of elderly people will be hauled before a federal “ death panel ” to decide whether paying for their healthcare was warranted based on their “ level of productivity in society . ”
The actual provision , Section 1323 of one version of legislation that has passed one committee in the House of Representatives , merely states that Medicare will now reimburse doctors who hold end - of - life counseling sessions for beneficiaries who want to know their options on hospice care , living wills , and similar services .
Palin , who resigned as governor of Alaska July 26 in order to pursue a national career as spokeswoman for the fascistic wing of the Republican Party , is appealing to the same Christian fundamentalist elements who mobilized around the case of Terri Schiavo in 2005 .
The popular disaffection with the Obama healthcare plan goes much further , however , than the fanatical right - to - life constituency .
The Obama administration has based its program for healthcare restructuring entirely on the argument that healthcare costs are bankrupting the US economy and that controlling and reducing these costs is essential .
The logical conclusion of this policy — even if officially denied by the White House — is that somebody ’s healthcare is too expensive and must be cut back or eliminated .
Millions of people fear that that somebody is likely to be them and their families .
One opinion poll published last week showed that 53 percent believed they would be worse off or no better than before under the Obama plan .
Obama and the congressional Democrats have sought to use the frenzied outpourings of his right - wing critics to discredit all opposition to the measures that the administration is pursuing to cut social benefit programs like Medicare and impose even greater burdens on American working people .
The crudest effort along these lines came in a column published in USAToday Monday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , which branded the opposition to Obama ’s healthcare plan “ un-American attacks . ”
They criticized the right - wing disruptions as an effort to suppress discussion , then pledged that the healthcare “ reform ” would mean higher - quality care , an end to insurance company abuses and “ stability and peace of mind for the middle class . ”
In his radio speech Saturday and at a carefully controlled town hall meeting in New Hampshire Tuesday , Obama sought to soothe popular concerns over the implication of the healthcare cost- cutting and put a “ progressive ” gloss on what is a fundamentally reactionary and pro-corporate policy .
The president told his New Hampshire audience that charges that his program will cut Medicare benefits for the elderly were false .
“ It ’s a myth that we ’re going to be cutting your Medicare benefits , ” he said .
“ We ’re not . ”
He claimed that the only cut in Medicare would be $ 177 billion in subsidies to insurance companies that operate private Medicare Advantage plans .
But all the plans moving through the House and Senate — with full backing by the White House — call for substantial reductions in Medicare reimbursement to hospitals and doctors , which will inevitably be translated into cutbacks in care for the elderly and disabled .
One of the first questions taken by Obama — no doubt prearranged by White House political operatives — was from a woman denied coverage by her insurance company because of a pre-existing condition .
Expressing sympathy for her plight , Obama sought to use the exchange to present his program as a benefit for those whose healthcare benefits have been cut back or eliminated by profit - driven insurers .
The real relationship of Obama and the Democrats to the insurance industry was far more accurately described by BusinessWeek magazine in its current cover story on healthcare “ reform , ” headlined , “ The Health Insurers Have Already Won . ”
The magazine details how UnitedHealthGroup , the largest US health insurer , has used its influence in Washington , particularly with conservative congressional Democrats in the “ Blue Dog ” caucus and Obama advisers like former senator Tom Daschle , to effectively dictate the parameters of the healthcare legislation moving through Congress .
“ The industry has already accomplished its main goal of at least curbing , and maybe blocking altogether , any new publicly administered insurance program that could grab market share from the corporations that dominate the business , ” BusinessWeek wrote approvingly .
UnitedHealthCare , Aetna and Wellpoint have “ also achieved a secondary aim of constraining the new benefits that will become available to tens of millions of people who are currently uninsured .
That will make the new customers more lucrative to the industry . ”
In other words , the corporate profiteers have a tight grip over the healthcare legislation .
Their political servants in both the Republican and Democratic parties can be relied on to guarantee their financial interests are served by any healthcare restructuring , or to torpedo the bill outright if that proves necessary .
Over the past several weeks , there has been detailed press coverage of the enormous sums that the drug companies , the insurance companies , the for - profit hospital chains and other corporate interests have poured into “ lobbying ” and “ campaign contributions ” — the two Washington euphemisms for outright bribery .
( See “ US health care lobby pumps millions into Obama ’s cost - cutting drive ” and “ The drug lobby demands , and gets , Obama pledge to protect health care profits ” )
According to press reports
Tuesday , the drug industry lobby PhRMA will launch a $ 150 million advertising blitz in support of Obama ’s healthcare reform drive , after the White House reaffirmed its promise that it will limit the industry ’s “ contribution ” to the cost of healthcare restructuring to the $ 80 billion agreed on in closed - door talks between Obama aides and PhRMA chief Billy Tauzin ( a founding member of the “ Blue Dogs ” before he left Congress to become an open rather than concealed representative of the drug manufacturers ) .
Obama has repeatedly avowed his support for capitalist medicine , and the “ right ” of drug companies , the insurance companies , the medical equipment manufacturers , and a host of other parasites to profit from the sick .
His differences with his Republican opponents are purely tactical , and largely concern which sections of corporate America will benefit the most from the current legislative undertaking .
Nothing that emerges from the machinations of big business politicians and corporate lobbyists in Washington can serve the needs of working people .
Medical care must be made available to every American citizen and resident , provided for at state expense as a basic human right .
This requires the nationalization of the insurance companies , the drug companies , and all the other healthcare profiteers , and the establishment of a system of socialized medicine provided free to all who need it .

CO2 disconnect couplers are no longer only for tank to keg gas lines .
Now CO2 filters are on the market , creating a market for high quality quick disconnects .
For those utilizing " Jockey Boxes " , CO2 disconnect couplers can also come in handy , and can help upgrade your single keg system into a multi-keg system in a snap ( literally ) .
These disconnects come in brass , stainless steel , and plastic .
Installing these CO2 disconnect couplers is a snap , and here we will go over the tools and techniques for doing so .
Source : Kegerators.com Archives
Here is our CO2 gas line tool check list :
some sharp scissors , clippers , or a utility knife
hose clamps , preferably of the screw tight variety
an appropriate screwdriver for the hose clamps you 've selected or a pair of needle nose pliers for pressure clamps .
If you are modifying an existing CO2 gas line set - up , you may want to buy an extra length of surgical tubing to help with space issues .
The process is quite simple , and the CO2 disconnect couplers on the market today are very much like ball lock units on Cornelius kegs .
These couplers are basically compressed air fittings , something that anyone who has worked in any kind of mechanic 's shop will recognize instantly .
First , turn off the CO2 gas at the tank and disconnect the CO2 line from any keg it might be attached to .
You should now judge whether or not you will need more tubing .
Your choice should be based on the purpose for the CO2 disconnect coupler .
If you are placing an in - line CO2 filter , for example , then you should take into consideration the rigid length of the unit , and determine if you need a tubing extension .
It is always wise to err on the side of more length .
Once you figure this out , you have two ways to go : either you cut your CO2 line in half , and install the couplers in between , or you disconnect one end of your gas line and install the couplers in between that and the new length of tubing you have acquired .
Either way , you will then be mounting CO2 lines onto the CO2 disconnect couplers on either side of the middle .
Use the following process :
First , place the hose clamp over the hose you are attaching .
Next , force the hose over the hollow nipple on the CO2 disconnect coupler .
Once the hose is forced all the way over the nipple , bring up your hose clamp and tighten it enough so that the plastic tubing is slightly bulging out of the slats in the clamp .
Do not tighten it too much , or you may compromise the tubing by cutting into it with pressure .
If you are adding a length of gas tubing , simply disconnect the CO2 line that you currently have in service , either at the CO2 regulator or at the keg .
Remove the hose clamp from whichever end is easiest to work on .
Now repeat the above process to connect your couplers and re-connect your CO2 system .
Easy as pie !
Maybe even easier .
Hello there !
Welcome to Designing Obama , your source of designs and information when it comes to political creatives .
Designing Obama has actually started because of the strength and role of creatives and designs in the Obama campaign .
The designs were so good that they have actually become very much iconic .
In this website , the focus is really in looking at the roles of creatives in political campaigns .
We have various offerings here that you can look at in order to see how to use continually use creatives in political campaigns , what works and what does n’t and determine future roles and functions of graphic designers and creative people .
Designing Obama was started by a small group of designers who used to work out of a small garage with a carriage house garage door in Phoenix .
Some of us have worked with the design team of the Obama campaign while others have worked on other political campaigns .
We have started this website because of an advocacy — to promote the use and development of political designs and creatives in order to forge a new path for designers who are interested in this kind of endeavour .
As such , this website provides the following kinds of services :
Inspiration Boards
We have made available here some inspiration boards of the designs that we have worked on before .
The goal really is to show you the kind of designs that have worked in political campaigns .
You are all welcome to add in your own designs .
There are also comment threads available under each design board .
The point is to encourage everyone to comment and discuss .
We want this website to be very engaging and want to encourage everyone and all designers to talk proactively in order for us to be able to discuss current and future design trends in political campaigns .
News and Information
We have a specific section providing news and information on what ’s new in political creatives and designs .
We cull these from trends not just in the United States but also from around the world .
The goal is to find some design pegs and at the same provide as much information as possible for the use and reference of our design community .
We also feature here some known designers or innovators in the field of design for all of us to learn from and who can serve as inspiration or icons for our community .
Forum
We have a forum section where everyone can talk and engage with each other .
We call on you to post questions or concerns and respond to others too .
We hope that this can serve as a freedom page for everyone as well as a page where each member of this community can help each other .
Feel free to create threads , to help and even to debate each other , all in the spirit of community and in the improvement of the design field , especially in the area of political creatives and designs .
I ’ve noticed that many recent discussions about changes to Perl 5 core development spiral off into circular discussions about deprecation cycles , definitions of compatibility , source code branch strategies , timeboxing , volunteer motivation , and so on .
Consensus has been slow to converge and conflict is in the air .
I think the problem is that people have different goals for Perl 5 .
Some of these goals mesh well , but others conflict .
Some of the remedies support many goals , some only one or two .
And some remedies work against some goals .
Placing some goals above others has big implications for changes to the development process and for priorities for new development .
I ’ve started brainstorming some of the goals that I ’ve heard or read or imagine might be out there .
Maybe if we can find some common ground around some goals , getting to common ground about methods wo n’t be quite so difficult .
Read these over and tell me what you think , here or on a blog or site of your own .
Do you agree with some ?
All ?
None ? **
If you had to pick just one or two , what would it be ?
How would you know if they happened ?**
What would it look like ?
What would be different ?
What do you want Perl 5 to be ?
I want Perl 5 to be more innovative
I want Perl 5 to be less dependent on the heroic efforts of a shrinking pool of maintainers
I want Perl 5 to be rock solid for enterprise use

Of all the businesses that the News Corporation , the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch , owns , just one is performing well : cable networks , in particular Fox News .
The company , which also owns the Fox broadcast television network , MySpace , the 20th Century Fox film studio and newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post , said Wednesday that fourth - quarter operating income , adjusted for certain items , plunged more than 30 percent .
Including nearly $ 680 million in charges , mainly at Fox Interactive Media , the unit that houses MySpace , the company reported a net loss of $ 203 million .
“ The last year has been one of the toughest we ’ve faced in our history , ” Mr. Murdoch said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts .
But he added , “ I think the worst may be behind us . ”
Of the News Corporation ’s eight business segments , just one  cable programming  reported a significant rise in operating income , which rose to $ 434 million , from $ 313 million in the same quarter last year .
While the company did not disclose a specific figure , it said operating income at Fox News increased 50 percent .

The prohibition on marijuana makes its use a more addictive habit , says a prominent author and psychiatrist .
Dr. Julie Holland , a psychiatrist at the New York University School of Medicine and author of Weekends at Bellevue , told Matt Lauer of NBC ’s Today
Show that the feelings of shame and suspicion associated with an illegal habit , as well as the adrenaline kick it fuels , all make marijuana use more habit - forming and harmful than it needs to be .

“ The fact that [ marijuana is ] illegal is a very big deal , ” Holland said .
“ People have to hide and they feel like criminals and there ’s a lot of shame and guilt , and it ends up making … it decreases self - esteem a little bit and it makes [ the habit ] more adrenalized .
The fact that you add adrenaline into it , and you have to hide and you have shame , can make it more addictive and more dangerous . ”
Holland and Lauer were discussing a recent article in Marie Claire magazine that argues marijuana use is gaining social acceptability among female professionals , a trend that bucks the common perception of potheads as young and lacking in ambition .
That article cites a study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in stating that eight million women in the United States have smoked pot in the past year .
That figure , as Lauer pointed out , did not include teenagers experimenting with the drug .
Marie Claire editor - in- chief Joanna Coles disagreed with Holland ’s view that there is a large social stigma attached to smoking marijuana .
“ I have to say , that ’s not what we are hearing from readers , ” she said on the Today Show .
“ First of all , it ’s decriminalized in 13 states , and I do n’t think this is a generation of people who get excited about the fact that it ’s illegal . ”

The inspiration for the article , Coles said , was “ hearing from readers that they were feeling stressed .
Clearly , the economy is a great deal of stress for people and they wanted a way to unwind .
And they found more and more of them were doing this [ smoking marijuana ] and they found it had less impact on them when they were going to work the next morning .
So they did n’t want to drink .
It ’s cheap and they felt they could do it in the privacy of their own home , and it was a very effective way to calm down . ”
Holland agreed that marijuana may be a less harmful drug than alcohol , saying that marijuana has “ psycho - therapeutic ” properties that booze lacks .
“ It ’s more of a mind drug , ” she said .
“ Alcohol ’s sort of a deadening , numbing … maybe more like a body drug . ”

On pot , “ people are unwinding and they ’re relaxing , but they ’re also able to think and maybe analyze or think clearly …
I think cannabis is … more functional than alcohol , certainly in terms of anxiety .
It can be a treatment or a medicine . ”
Coles added that the Marie Claire article seems to have struck a nerve with readers .

“ Feedback from our readers is really that they ’re very pleased that they recognize themselves ” in the article , Coles said .

This smelter in Shaanxi province is also blamed for lead poisoning
Authorities in China have closed a second metal smelter after more than 1,300 children fell sick with lead poisoning , state media have reported .
The children were living near a manganese plant near Wugang , in Hunan province , Xinhua news agency said .
Two executives of the plant have been detained over the poisoning .
It follows the closure of another smelter in northern Shaanxi province , where more than 600 children were found to have lead poisoning .
In both cases , the smelters were closed after angry parents confronted authorities over their children 's illnesses .
Lead poisoning can cause a range of health problems , from learning disabilities to seizures .
Children under six are most at risk .
Air , soil and water pollution is common in China , which has seen rapid economic growth over the past few decades .
Protests
An official in Wenping , part of Wugang city in Hunan , said that 1,354 children living in four villages near the Wugang Manganese Smeltering Plant had excessive levels of lead in their blood , Xinhua said .
All the children are under 14 years old .
Adults in the area began to suspect the smelter as the cause of a rash of illnesses among their children and on 8 August blocked a road in protest .
One man told the China Daily newspaper that his 10 - month - old daughter became sick and started losing her hair .
The smelter , which had been operating since May last year without approval from the local environmental protection bureau , was closed on 13 August .
On Monday , angry parents in Shaanxi province broke into the Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting Company , near the city of Baoji .
More than 600 children were found to have lead poisoning , with at least 150 of them treated in hospital .
Cath Elliott has written an excellent piece on street harassment over at The Guardian ’s Comment is Free , and once again the comments section has filled up with comments from arrogant little pricks whose thoughts on the matter can be summed up in one of three ways :
(1) When will these bloody misandrist women stop whinging and get the hell off the net ?
(2) Street harassment hardly ever happens and it ’s all ironic , harmless fun anyway .
(3) But women love it and ask for it – look , they ’ve got boobs !
I really do n’t think I need to waste any time taking down these these charming ( for the most part ) gentlemens , so instead I thought I ’d ask for a quick hands up of anyone who ’s experienced street harassment ; no need to leave a description or anything unless you want to , just a nod to show how depressingly normal street harassment is .
And because , unlike the CiF commenters , I actually understand that street harassment is one of those things whose effect can only be measured and understood by the victim , you get to define what it is .
I ’ll start the ball rolling with a big hands up ( and that ’s just one of many ) .
We ’re having a meeting in a pub tonight , it ’s free to get in and open to all , we ’ll talk about the problems with science journalism .
Apparently science journalists wo n’t tolerate this .

Steve Connor : Lofty medics should stick to their day job Science Notebook : Doctors claim media coverage is “ lazy , venal and silly ” Independent , Tuesday , 30 June 2009
The sixth World Conference of Science Journalists is underway in London .
I ca n’t say it ’s going to change my life , as I missed out on the previous five , but I did notice that it has attracted the attention of a bunch of medics with strong views on the state of science journalism today .
Related articles “ A few of us felt they were might [ sic ] not adequately address some of the key problems in their profession , which has deteriorated to the point where they present a serious danger to public health , ” according to the Bad Science website of Dr Ben Goldacre , who is turning into the bête noir of science journalists .
The medics met in a pub in London last night to explain why the “ mainstream media ’s science coverage is broken , misleading , dangerous , lazy , venal and silly ” .
All three speakers are gainfully employed by the public sector so they do n’t actually have to worry too much about the sort of pressures and financial constraints the mainstream media are under .
But they nevertheless condescended to offer some advice on the sort of “ best practice guidelines ” I should be following , for which I suppose I should be eternally grateful .
But their arrogance is not new .
Medical doctors in particular have always had a lofty attitude to the media ’s coverage of their profession , stemming no doubt from the God - like stance they take towards their patients .
Although I would n’t go as far as to say their profession is broken , dangerous , lazy , venal and silly – not yet anyway .
Genius .
Interested to see if they publish our brief letter .
Dear Sir ,
Your science journalist Steve Connor is furious that we are holding a small public meeting in a pub to discuss the problem that science journalists are often lazy and inaccurate .
He gets the date wrong , claiming the meeting has already happened ( it has not ) .
He says we are three medics ( only one of us is ) .
He then invokes some stereotypes about arrogant doctors , which we hope are becoming outdated .
In fact , all three of us believe passionately in empowering patients , with good quality information , so they can make their own decisions about their health .
People often rely on the media for this kind of information .
Sadly , in the field of science and medicine , on subjects as diverse as MMR , sexual health , and cancer prevention , the public have been repeatedly and systematically misled by journalists .
We now believe this poses a serious threat to public health , and it is sad to see the problem belittled in a serious newspaper .
Steve Connor is very welcome to attend our meeting , which is free and open to all , yours ( Drs ) Vaughan Bell , Petra Boynton , Ben Goldacre
It seems journalists have a lot in common with homeopaths when it comes to rage .
Update 2/7/09
Just FYI really , my email to Guy Keleny , the letters editor at the Independent .
I think it ’s a shame that mainstream media are so intolerant of discussing these problems , and I really do think they ’re serious .
Oh well .
Shame if they do n’t print our letter though .
hi guy , i think it would be good to print this letter from all three of us .
we
all take the issue of misleading science and health reporting very
seriously , and feel passionately that patients and the public need to
be well informed to make good decisions about their own health .
unfortunately the media do often make serious errors in their coverage
of health and science , we do n’t think it is unreasonable for us to
hold a small meeting in a pub to discuss this , and i think it ’s part
of the problem that the profession of science journalism and
journalism generally are so unwilling to face up to the problems ,
discuss them , and engage with criticisms .
a good example of that , sadly , was steve ’s column which was , sadly ,
repeatedly factually incorrect .
it talked about a meeting that had n’t
happened yet as if it had , it described us all as medics , which we ’re
not , and it failed to address any of our concerns about the serious
negative impact that misleading reporting can have on public health .
i
would have hoped that this is exactly the kind of social justice and
patient empowerment issue that the independent might take a serious
interest in .
i should say i like steve ’s work , although we ’ve never met , and
there ’s nothing personal about this , i just think it would be good if
you could correct on ther factual inaccuracies and give us the chance
to have a small say on such a serious issue by printing our letter .

The number of broadband lines has risen above expectations in the first half of this year , according to broadband specialists .
Point Topic announced today that 445,000 more lines were added this year , making the total in the UK over 17.8 million .
This beat the analyst company 's initial forecast by about 100,000 and has led to it adjusting its yearly forecast to 900,000 new lines .
Point Topic predicted that there will be over 23 million broadband lines in the UK by 2013 , which is 1.2 million more than its previous estimate .
However , the report points out that there are still over nine million homes without internet access and the number is only slowly decreasing , leading to the forecast that there will still be 6.5 million homes without internet access by 2013 .
The Government has earmarked 12 million over three years , following the Digital Britain report , to help get people online but Tim Johnson , chief analyst at Point Topic , does n't think this is enough .
Johnson said in a statement : " Allowing only twelve million to get more homes online looks pretty weak when you consider the size of the task on one side and the potential benefits on the other . "
" We think it 's going to be easier to build networks than to change people 's minds . "
Happy birthday , Google , but all this messing with your logo is just a little too precious , do n't you think ?
And maybe the two ones in Goog11e should have been birthday candles ?
I am all for , as one of my editors described it , " quirky and interesting . "
I liked the Morse code logo and the telescopes , but a series of flying saucers and crop circles ?
Sci - fi game references ?
I know what those referred to and could n't care less .
Waste of time and wonder .
And it took me -- and the friend who called to ask me about it -- a minute to realize the two " L "s in the logo today are really 1's , as in 11 , as in a birthday .
Again , happy birthday .
( The actual birthday was Sunday and the Goog11e logo appears to have been removed ) .
There is nothing wrong with what Google is doing , mind you .
However , when it is n't obvious enough that people have to start investigating and reading tweets to figure out what the fun logos -- or doodles , as Google calls them -- are supposed to be about , I think a line has probably been crossed somewhere .
If people look at the logo and wonder , " what 's that about ? " and have to go to a news story to find the answer , Google has wasted a bunch of people 's time for no good reason .
Which is odd since Google , and other search engines , are supposed to be about saving time .
I am all for having fun , but perhaps Google could create a clickable link or maybe add small print at the bottom of the page ( where you 'd have to scroll to see it ) that explains what the fun doodles are about .
( On the Goog11e logo you could mouse over it to find out what it represented ) .
Then they could do them all the time and it would be easy for everyone to play along at their homes or offices and then just click or scroll to the answer when its time to do more important -- if less fun -- things .

Remarkably , the latest iPod nano looks almost identical to its , but this player packs so much more into its small frame : A video camera , an FM tuner ( a first for iPods ! ) , a pedometer for joggers , and a larger screen .
Priced at $ 149 for 8GB and at $ 179 for 16GB ( $ 20 less than last year 's 16 GB player ) , this nano is more affordable , and it's more capable than similarly priced players , so it 's our latest Editors ' Choice .
With a new polished and colorful paint job ( you can choose from nine hues ) , the new nano is one good - looking device .
At 3.6 by 1.5 by 0.2 inches ( HWD ) and a mere 1.3 ounces , it 's truly identical in size to the previous ( 4th - generation ) nano .
The screen , however , is significantly larger 2.2 inches as opposed to 2 ( it may not sound like a lot , but on such a tiny player , that 0.2 inch makes a big difference ) , and its 376 - by - 240 - pixel resolution is a bit higher too the display on 4th - gen nano is 320 - by - 240 .
The big news here is the inclusion of a video camera , a mic , and a built - in speaker on the back panel .
At the bottom left on the back of the player , the orientation of the camera is slightly awkward .
Since the player is so small , it can be tricky to start recording without a digit slipping into the frame .
It 's nothing practice can't fix , but my first few videos were full of fingers .
The proprietary connector ( now on the left ) and the earphone jack ( on the right ) on the bottom panel of the player are reversed , but the scroll wheel remains the same size and is in the same spot below the display as on the previous nano .
The included ( and terribly underwhelming - sounding ) earbuds act as an antenna for the new FM radio , and the device also ships with a proprietary cable for computer syncing , a plastic dock adapter , and , of course , two Apple logo stickers .
File support on the nano is standard for Apple .
You can play AAC ( both old Apple DRM and unprotected files ) , MP3 , MP3 VBR , Audible , Apple Lossless , AIFF , and WAV files .
There 's still no FLAC or OGG support .
Video is limited to H.264 ( this is also the format the video camera shoots in ) , and MPEG - 4 .
For photos , JPEG and most other common photo formats are supported .
One note :
While the new iTunes LP feature , which includes video , song lyrics , and liner notes with album purchases is very cool , you can only experience those extras in , not on the nano ( same goes for the touch , classic , and iPhone too ) .
The menus have n't changed much in appearance a small space below the main menu displays a visual for whatever menu option is currently highlighted scrolling album covers if you 're on Music , or the last radio station you heard if you 're on Radio , for instance .
Cover
Flow still pops up when you select music and turn the player sideways to landscape view , but since there 's no touch screen , like on the or the , you can only scroll through your albums using the wheel , which dulls the experience a bit , but it 's still the best user interface you 'll find among comparably priced players . 
Video Capture and More !
Adding a video recorder to the nano without increasing the size of the device is an impressive feat .
And the recorder makes good use of the nano 's accelerometer ; you can switch between landscape and portrait mode while filming .
There 's no question that a built - in videocam makes the slim iPod nano a far more attractive option than a ( relatively ) bulky , single - purpose , standard - definition handheld video camera , such as the $ 140 or the $ 100 .
You 're not going to get HD , but despite its low resolution ( VGA , 640 by 480 at 30 fps ) , video captured with the nano is crisp and vibrant and rivals footage from the Mino or the Vado .
And it looks and sounds better than video from the iPhone 3GS .
As I mentioned earlier , the placement of the lens makes it a bit too easy for your fingers to get in the way of your recordings .
Figuring out how to hold the device so that you can operate the touch wheel 's center control button ( to start and stop recording ) can be a bit tricky at first .
There are also some pretty cool effects you can use while filming including Sepia , Film Grain , Black and White , and even zanier ones like Thermal ( which looks like the hunting scenes from Predator ) and X - Ray ( which does n't get under clothes , but plays with negative images in a fun way ) .
All 15 effects are accessible in a menu that will show you how they look in real - time ; just hold down the center button for a few seconds when you 're in Video mode .
The built - in mic does n't provide stellar audio , but high - quality audio and video are n't the point ; you just want to be able to quickly capture a moment and store it without carrying an extra device .
The nano does this quite well , organizing your videos by date on a scrollable list under the Video menu .
Once imported using , sharing your video via or uploading it to is a snap .
The biggest disappointment : Inexplicably , the camera can't capture still images .
Even so , the fact that no other portable media player offers a built - in video camera negates many of its shortcomings .
A huge surprise : After all these years , this is the first iPod to feature an FM tuner .
Using your earbuds as an antenna , the nano tunes in FM stations and displays radio call letters whenever possible .
Like the , the iPod nano lets you tag songs from the radio that you can purchase later via iTunes .
The tuner 's graphics are simple and clean , but not as spiffy as on the Zune HD .
Live Pause allows you to pause the radio and record up to 15 minutes of content , which can be played back later .
But these recordings are not meant to live anywhere other than the device , so you can't import recordings into iTunes .
This is the first nano model to include VoiceOver , a feature that made its debut on the last iteration .
Simply press the Center button from the Now Playing screen , and the player announces the title and artist of your current song selection in a mildly entertaining robotic voice .
The built - in mic means the nano can act as a voice recorder using the Voice Memo function another new feature .
And a built - in speaker means that you can listen to your videos right after you record them , and if you play your tunes sans earbuds , you 'll hear them through the speaker in all its tinny , lo - fi glory .
( You need the earbuds to act as an antenna for the FM tuner , however . )
As with every iPod to date , the earbuds sound lousy , and as always , I recommend upgrading .
The good news is any earphones will work as antennae for the FM tuner , so you are not tethered to this pair .
For a better listening experience , try the affordable $ 50 .
The general music experience on the iPod nano does n't change much with this iteration .
Most notably , Genius Mix builds on the existing Genius feature , and organizes " mixes " of your music library according to genre .
It might lump together all of your Folk music , or all of your Jazz , for example , and has the ability to become more granular over time .
The pedometer works intuitively enter your weight , and start walking .
The device will tell you how many steps you 've taken and how many calories you 've burned once you press the center button .
And you can sync this information to the online app for a more in - depth workout analysis .
Apple rates the battery life for the nano at 24 hours for audio and 5 hours for video respectable , if not mind - blowing , numbers .
We were able to eke out close to 30 hours ( 29:51 ) of audio from our test unita strong showing .
While the iPod touch has seen many challengers , most notably the forthcoming Zune HD , the nano does n't have a serious enemy in sight since nothing else in this price range comes close to its ease - of - use and graceful design .
The video camera is merely a bonus .
Sure , I wish it captured still images , and that the earbuds sounded better , and that you could do more with radio recordings , but these are minor gripes .
Apple has once again improved on a fantastic product .
Simply put , you wo n't find another player with a video camera , and even if you take that variable out of the equation , given its other features , the iPod nano would remain our Editors '
Choice for portable media players in the $ 100 - 200 price range .

More MP3 Player Reviews :
With AIDS vaccine efforts at an impasse , microbicides -- virus - blocking gels inserted into the vagina before sexual intercourse -- have risen from their own string of setbacks to once again offer hope of preventing HIV infections , at least in women .
Microbicides blocked the primate form of the virus in monkeys in studies reported online Wednesday in the journal Nature and last month at an AIDS meeting .
A third microbicide tested in 3,100 women showed potential for protection in findings presented at the meeting in Montreal .
Identifying a microbicide that works even partially could have a huge effect .
Almost half of the more than 33 million people living with HIV worldwide are women ; in sub-Saharan Africa , the figure is 60 % .
“ It would empower women to protect themselves in a sexual situation in which they may not have complete control , ” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .

Abstinence and condoms have been the only proven ways to prevent or reduce the spread of HIV among adults .
Circumcision lowers the risk for men , and already - existing AIDS drugs are used prophylactically to reduce mother - to - child transmission during birth or breast - feeding .
In many parts of the world , it is difficult or impossible for women to refuse sex or persuade a partner to use a condom .
An effective microbicide would be something that women could initiate on their own .
Microbicides might also prevent infection during anal intercourse , although most studies have focused on vaginal transmission .
That scientists would be so encouraged by two animal studies and a minor success in a human trial is a sign , in part , of how stymied they have been in two decades of trying to find a microbicide or a vaccine to stem the spread of HIV .
Advertisement
“ There ’s no vaccine on the immediate horizon , ” said Dr. Lynn Paxton of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
“ After a number of microbicide trials failed to show any effect or in some cases showed a negative effect , this is good news . ”
Until now , all microbicides tested in human trials have failed -- two spectacularly in that they increased the risk of infection .
In 2000 , human trials of nonoxynol - 9 , a spermicide gel already used for birth control , were halted because the gel was found to irritate the vaginal lining , making it easier for the virus to gain entry .
In 2007 , human trials of a cellulose sulfate gel were halted after it was also found to increase vulnerability to the virus .
Experimental vaccines have also proved disappointing .
For 25 years , U.S. health officials have vowed to get a vaccine to the market , saying it was the best hope for containing the AIDS pandemic .
Advertisement
But two years ago , a much - anticipated human trial of a Merck & Co. vaccine was halted not only because the vaccine was n’t working , but out of fear that it also might have increased the risk of infection .
And last year , U.S. health officials called off plans for a large human trial of what had been considered a promising vaccine , and urged scientists to go back to basic research on the immune system and animal tests .
Antiretroviral drugs have been the one concrete success in the AIDS battle , almost overnight commuting what had been a certain death sentence into , for most people , a manageable chronic disease .
But the drugs have limitations .
They are expensive .
They suppress HIV but do n’t cure it , so they must be taken for life .
Although advancements have eliminated many side effects , no one knows what the cumulative effects of the drugs will be or whether they will eventually stop working .
And for some people , the drugs simply do n’t work .
Advertisement
What is promising about the recent experiments , researchers say , is that each of these so - called next - generation microbicides uses a more targeted strategy than earlier efforts .
The early microbicides attempted to block the virus from attaching to the cell lining of the vagina .
The new microbicides target the virus itself .
The human trial reported last month at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections involved a vaginal gel called PRO 2005 / 5 that acts by binding to HIV and hindering its entrance into human cells .
The gel reduced infections by 30 % when tested in women in six sites in Africa and one in the United States -- shy of the 33 % protection that would have been considered statistically significant .
Despite the statistical shortfall , this was the first human clinical study to provide a glimmer of hope .
A larger study by British and African researchers on 9,100 women is in progress ; interim results are expected this year .
The monkey experiment presented at the Montreal conference used already - existing antiretroviral drugs in a vaginal gel .
The 12 monkeys exposed to the virus after receiving the gel were protected from the monkey form of HIV ; 10 of the 11 monkeys that did not receive the gel became infected .

The study published Wednesday in Nature used a third approach that focuses on the body ’s immune response .
After exposure to HIV , the immune system rushes infection - fighting T cells to the site .
But these are the very cells that HIV hijacks and uses to spread infection throughout the body .
Dr. Ashley Haase , head of the microbiology department at the University of Minnesota Medical School , and colleague Patrick M. Schlievert , a microbiologist , found that a naturally occurring compound called glycerol monolaurate dampens the immune response to the primate version of HIV , depriving the virus of cells to infect .
Five of five monkeys given a vaginal gel containing the compound showed no signs of infection two weeks after being exposed to the virus ; four of five monkeys not given the vaginal gel were teeming with viruses .
Advertisement
“ It is a relatively preliminary study but worth sharing because it establishes a novel approach , ” Haase said .
But one of the five monkeys that had initially tested negative for HIV was tested again months after the experiment ended and found to be infected , a sign that an undetectable level of virus had been transmitted and later established itself .
The scientists said that more animal trials were needed to test whether the microbicide should be given over a longer time or at a higher dose to prevent breakthrough infections .
A mathematical model suggested that even if a microbicide were only 60 % effective and used just 20 % of the time , it could prevent 2.3 million new infections over three years , they said .

As a number , π can be anywhere from three to 22/ 7 .
It represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter .
π looks like a table , and pi is often found in tables .
In non-Euclidean states , [ 2 ] it is usually agreed upon to be exactly three , which then defines the curvature of their local space - time continuum .
Circles become hexagons in places where pi is 3 .

Pi was a movie about four American high - school mathematicians who turned economics into a board game that requires all players to czech - mate .
Dean Martin popularised π in his 1953 hit That 's Amore
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza π

MMM ... floor π!
-- Homer Simpson
π was the title of an independent movie in the late 1990s by Darren Aronofsky .
Sadly , the movie was about a number other than π .
The television series Twin Peaks frequently displayed the wonders of π .
A sign at the Springfield graveyard in The Simpsons exhorts passersby to " Come for the funeral , stay for the π " .
The book and movie Life of π are about a kid named Piscine , who shortens his name to Pi because otherwise it sounds too much like " pissing " .
Oh , and he may or may not be stuck on a raft with a tiger .
Pi as body modification [ edit ]
If you want to be the hardest kid in your university 's math department , tattoo pi to one hundred places on your arm .

Or someone doing like that dude in " American Pie " .
You know - the sex thing .

RationalWiki officially holds a grudge on π for being irrational - and therefore disobeying the fundamental Rational Wiki policies .
The reasons for such behaviour on Pi's part are unclear : a popular theory is that π is a creationist - and may therefore need some education on evolution .
Johann Lambert 's proof that it is impossible to rationalise π - no matter how hard we try and how many reasonable approximations we find - supports this theory .

There 's been a lot of talk about the N900 Maemo " tablet " , especially about how it looks suspiciously like a phone .
And even if Nokia ( inexplicably ) plays it down in their now - official announcement , that 's exactly what it is : an amazing - looking handset .
Advertisement
Beyond that Maemo Linux OS we 've been begging Nokia to bring to phones for the better part of a year , the N900 is , as Nokia handsets tend to be nowadays , a healthy piece of hardware .
It 's got a 3.5 - inch resistive WVGA screen , slide - out QWERTY keyboard , an ARM Cortex 8 processor , and 1GB 256MB of RAM , and is crammed with 32 GB of internal memory with a MicroSD slot for expansion , GPS , an FM transmitter , a 5 - megapixel camera , a 3.5 mm jack and a gajillion - band cellular radio , including , crucially , support for T - Mobile 's 1700M Hz slice of the spectrum .

Since Maemo is based on Debian Linux , the app selection should be interesting .
Stock , the N900 will ship with Firefox ( Fennec , I assume ) and Flash support and a panel - based multitasking system , as well as tight VoIP integration and near - total video and audio codec support .
Maemo is fresh in a phone context , but it looks fantastic here — I see bits of Pre , pieces of Android and a whole lot of Nokia freshness .
More than anything , I really just want to touch this thing .
Try getting that excited about an N97 , sometime .
Nokia : Maybe not doomed !
The N900 will launch " select markets " — all of which sadly seem to trade in Euros — for €500 , or about $ 700 .

Last week , Deutsche Bank analyst Karen Weaver published a report that shook up the " housing is recovering " crowd .
She predicted that , by next year , nearly half of American homeowners with mortgages will be underwater .
Before we go into the details , here 's a basic refresher on the US housing market :
There are approximately 110 million households in the U.S .
About 75.5 million of these are homeowners .
Approximately 68 % of the 76 million , or 51.6 million , have mortgages .
14 million U.S. homeowners , 27 % of those with mortgages , were underwater at the end of Q1 ( DB estimates )
DB estimates that nearly half of the 52 million mortgagors will be underwater by the end of next year .
( Note that this is half of those with mortgages , not half of all households )
DB 's estimates are based on city - level projections of where house prices will bottom .
DB made these projections before the startlingly good Case Shiller numbers last month .
If the Case Shiller numbers herald a recovery , as many bulls suggest , then DB's " underwater " forecasts may be too aggressive .
On the other hand , if the June Case Shiller numbers were just a head - fake , as we and other analysts suspect , then DB 's estimates will probably be right on the money .
From the death penalty to " three strikes " laws , Americans love tough responses to crime — but not necessarily smart ones .
Nils Christie has a better idea : Stop treating lawbreakers like criminals .
" I do n't like the term crime — it 's such a big , fat , imprecise word , " says the renowned University of Oslo criminologist .
" There are only unwanted acts .
How we perceive them depends on our relationship with those who carry them out . "
If a teenager swipes a wallet , we call it a crime .
If he snakes a twenty from his dad , it 's a family issue .
Locking up the pickpocket only sets him up to learn worse tricks from hardened thugs .
Better , Christie says , to treat him like a badly behaved son .
Send him to counseling and require that he compensate his victim .
Similarly , drug abuse should be considered a matter of public health , not criminal justice .
Give addicts treatment instead of incarceration and you 'll cure more of them and ( bonus ! ) foster a more humane society .
Of course , seriously violent criminals should be locked up , but Christie points out that the justice system does a poor job of determining which ones are so incorrigible that they need to stay behind bars .
Christie 's approach may sound implausible in the US , where crime is far more prevalent than in his home of Norway .
But our national predilection for punishment has gotten out of hand .
The Land of the Free incarcerates more citizens per capita than any other country on Earth , almost half of them for nonviolent offenses .
And it 's not because of a rise in crime rates — in fact , those have been falling for nearly a decade .
Rather , tough sentencing and anti-drug laws have put a growing number of marginal offenders behind bars .
Maybe that 's why some US officials are starting to think like Christie .
California and a few other states now mandate treatment rather than imprisonment for certain drug offenders , and many communities have launched victim - offender mediation programs .
If nothing else , cutting the prison population helps the bottom line .
Each inmate costs US taxpayers more than $ 22,000 a year .
And return on the investment stinks :
Two out of three prisoners released are arrested again , according to government studies .
Now that 's a crime .
Wired 's Smart List 2009 12 Shocking Ideas That Could Change the World
Frank Herbert 's
Dune is a sweeping epic , one filled with complex world - building , family drama , religions , economic systems , and space travel .
And yet , one science - fiction fan wonders if Dune 's multi- layered success has ruined the science fiction novels that came after .
Advertisement
A user on LibraryThing posting under the name bookmonkey 00 k has set forth the theory that Dune ruined science fiction novels .
It 's not that Dune is a bad book — quite the contrary , the poster admits he quite enjoyed Dune and the rich universe it portrayed .
His issue is that he suspects
Dune 's success is behind the increasing girth of science fiction novels after 1965 :
Basically , people looked at it and instead of saying , " Wow – you can have this kind of massive family drama / economic intrigue / war story / mystical journey all in the context of SF " , they said , " Dune must be awesome because it 's really long . "
So after 1965 all SF started to get really , REALLY , BIG .
I mean , when I 've lined up my copy of Dune with three SF books that had been written in the previous decade ( Double Star and Starship Troopers by Heinlein , and Mission of Gravity by Hal Clement ) , all of them award winners , all of them critically acclaimed , and all of them barely adding up to the page count that is DUNE .
Advertisement
Gone are the days of the 200 page book , which could be devoured in a couple of days .
Instead , he says science fiction novels are less interested in telling interesting stories with novel ideas than in cramming in every detail until the book is better as a doorstop than a form of entertainment .
Moreover , reading these tomes can take weeks , turning what should be a simple pleasure into an onerous commitment .
The poster implores Herbert - loving science fiction writers to take their cue from William Faulkner ( when rewriting , " kill your darlings " ) , and trim the fat from their books , leaving a trimmer , more engaging story behind .
But other posters in the forum suggest some other reasons why novels started getting longer after 1965 : Like , for example , the fact that novels were no longer being serialized in magazines before coming out in book form ( and magazines had tended to have less space for longer books ) .
Or the fact that fantasy books , influenced by Lord Of The Rings , were going longer and more epic , and this bled over into SF .
And then there 's the simplest explanation : " People like thick books .
It makes them feel like they get more for their money . "

Things I 've noticed : Dune really wrecked Science Fiction [ LibraryThing ]
A group of the biggest U.S. banks said they would stop accepting California 's IOUs on Friday , adding pressure on the state to close its $ 26.3 billion annual budget gap .
The development is the latest twist in California 's struggle to deal with the effects of the recession .
After state leaders failed to agree on budget solutions last week , California began issuing IOUs -- or " individual registered warrants " -- to hundreds of thousands of creditors .
State Controller John Chiang said that without IOUs , California would run out ...
" Some think legalization will reduce the violence , " Kerlikowske said .
" It will not .
If drugs were to become legal , I doubt very seriously that ( the criminals ) would take up jobs at Microsoft or Intel .
Criminals are not going to change . "
[ El Paso Times ]
Opponents of legalizing drugs often argue that you can’t really eliminate the cartels because they 'll just move on to other crimes .
Here 's the drug czar 's version of that argument :
It 's an interesting debate in light of today 's news that Mexican drug cartels have been tapping into oil pipelines , stealing astronomical amounts of oil , and then selling it to corrupt American businessmen .
It 's easy enough to assume that many of these diabolical criminal masterminds will look for ways to stay in business even if we take away their drug profits through legalization and regulation .
There 's some truth to this and it's pretty creepy to think about what these horrible thugs will do when their primary funding source suddenly vanishes .
But that 's not an argument against legalization .
Selling drugs is what made them greedy and evil .
It 's how they learned to launder money .
It 's how they paid for their weapons and armies .
It 's where they got the capital to fund other criminal enterprises like stealing oil from the Mexican government .
All their power comes from selling drugs , and anyone who supports the drug war shares responsibility for what the cartels do next .
Maybe legalization wo n't crush them overnight , but it will close down the massive criminal college that the drug war has become .
It will stop future generations of potential super - criminals from ever becoming indoctrinated into a life of crime , because there will be far fewer jobs in the crime industry .
In the meantime , those criminals that remain wo n't have any more drug money to line the pockets of public servants and pervert justice at every turn .
They can attempt other criminal endeavors , but it will never be the same because selling drugs is the easiest most - profitable crime on the planet and it can never be replaced .
More than a few drug war idiots have suggested that the drug lords will simply switch to human trafficking , as though you could just start selling slaves to the people who used to buy marijuana and cocaine .
One could write a very long book about how stupid that is , but it would n’t make a bit of difference .
What would really happen to the cartels if drugs were legal ?
There 's only one way to find out .

Presenter , The Secret Life of Twins
Twin brothers , but not quite identical My identical twin brother Chris is 2 cm taller than me .
Barely noticeable you would think .
I can see what it is like to be him by standing on tip - toes just a little and frankly the world does not look much different from up there .
Nonetheless it bothers me : I could have been that tall .
I have exactly the same genes as my brother .
Genes that , in the right environment , could have made me a full 185 cm tall as opposed to my current 183 cm .
Something , somewhere went wrong and I got stunted .
Not by much but it is a reminder of what could have been .
And that is the real problem .
It is not the height , not that trousers fit him a little better or that he does not need to reach as far to change a light bulb .
It is that I wonder how many other things I am missing out on .
Ten points of IQ here , some grey hair there .
Perhaps I will need glasses at age 35 instead of 40 .

Most people do not have any way of knowing whether or not they are getting the most out of their genes but if you have a twin sibling then you have an exact comparison .
So how did these differences arise ?
The differences between identical twins - people who should be exactly the same - are becoming increasingly useful to medical researchers interested in everything from mental illness to our ability to do maths .
Long term changes
Most people are used to thinking of our DNA as a fairly fixed code , a bit like a blueprint for a building .
We know that some things can change the code itself - exposure to radiation can cause mutations that lead to an increased risk of cancer for example - but usually the code remains the same .
Finnish twins Miia ( left ) and Noora ( right ) are 24 - years - old Noora weighs 17kg more than Miia due to their different lifestyles But Miia is also likely to put on weight if she becomes less physically active However , production of the molecules for which our genes are responsible - things like digestive enzymes and muscle protein - is constantly getting switched on and off .
And it seems that some environmental influences can have much more lasting effects - permanently activating or inactivating certain genes .
It is becoming apparent that this aspect of genetic control - a process dubbed epigenetics - is very important in human health .
In 1944 there was a severe famine in Holland .
The children born during this period are more susceptible to diabetes , obesity and heart disease compared to siblings who were older during the famine .
It seems that the period of starvation prompted their bodies to switch certain genes on or off to cope with the lack of food .
These changes may , in subsequent times of plenty , have made them gain weight and get diabetes .
This change in the particular genes we express is controlled chiefly through a process called " methylation " in which chemical groups are attached to the DNA molecule to tell the body whether or not to use the " methylated " genes .
It is one of the ways in which our bodies ' attempt to adapt to changing environments .
Twins play a key role in discovering more .
In the summer of 2009 Chris and I joined the twin research study at St Thomas 's Hospital where we were investigated in great detail .
They measured our height , weight , bone density , grip strength even ability to hear if a nursery rhyme is in tune .
All these are traits that are to some extent genetic .
Other differences
It turned out that we are different in more ways than height .
For a start I was 15kg heavier than my brother .
What about my missing 20 mm of height ?
It is probably an epigenetic effect caused by some long forgotten environmental difference when we were little
Of the thousands of twins enrolled in the research program only 10 were more different in weight than us .
Professor Tim Spector who leads the research unit was frank : " You 're ( he meant me ) a disgrace . "
My excess weight , unlike my brother 's excess height , is easily explained .
I have been living in America and eating too much .
So far no surprises .
But environmental exposure to a lot of cheap , high - fat food in America may have caused more than temporary weight gain .
It may have permanently altered the way my genes are expressed .
Scientists are only just beginning to understand these processes but it is possible that I may have permanently altered my metabolism to accommodate those extra pounds : the health effects could last a long time .
Key role in disease Epigenetics seems to play a role in a large number of diseases .
Twins studies show us that some cancers are not caused by DNA mutations but by epigenetic changes , which potentially offers new targets for drugs .
Similarly with heart disease or diabetes we might one day be considering therapies that change our epigenetics .
This is a long way off but twin studies are beginning to shed new light on how our bodies react to the environment .
What about my missing 20 mm of height ?
It is probably an epigenetic effect caused by some long forgotten environmental difference when we were little .
I will never get it back but if it is of use to medical science I can live without it .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Companies in the U.S. private sector shed 473,000 jobs in June , according to the ADP employment report released Wednesday .
The report comes one day before the Labor Department reports on changes in the nation 's nonfarm payrolls for June .
The decline in employment was close to the consensus forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch in which they had called for a decline of 498,000 .
Over the past three months , monthly employment losses have averaged 492,000 .
This is an improvement from the first quarter 's average -- 691,000 in monthly job losses .
Although many economists say the economy is improving , the labor market has shown no signs of life .
" Despite some recent indications that economic activity is stabilizing , employment , which usually trails overall economic activity , is likely to decline for at least several more months , although perhaps not as rapidly as during the last six months , " said Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC , which created the report .
Economists expect payroll employment to drop by 325,000 in June and for the unemployment rate to rise to 9.6 % .
In a television interview , Prakken said that the June ADP report was consistent with the unemployment rate hitting 10 % later this year .
Employment in the service - providing sector in June fell by 223,000 .
The goods - producing sector declined 250,000 , and employment in factories dropped 146,000 .
Employment in manufacturing has declined for 40 straight months .
Large businesses saw employment fall by 91,000 .
Medium - sized firms declined 205,000 , and small firms dropped 177,000 .
In a separate report , recruitment and outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas reported that job - cut announcements totaled 74,393 in June , a 15 - month low .
Josh Shapiro , chief economist at MFR Inc. , said the two reports suggest that the pace of economic decline has moderated from the steep decline in the last six months .
Also Wednesday , the Institute for Supply Management reported that the pace of decline of activity in the hard - hit factory sector appears to be moderating .
The ISM index rose to 44.8 % in June from 42.8 % in May .

I expected this to happen , California Wo n’t Accept Its Own IOUs :
Small businesses that received $ 682 million in IOUs from the state say California expects them to pay taxes on the worthless scraps of paper , but refuses to accept its own IOUs to pay debts or taxes .
The vendors ’ federal class action claims the state is trying to balance its budget on their backs .
Lead plaintiff Nancy Baird filled her contract with California to provide embroidered polo shirts to a youth camp run by the National Guard , but never was paid the $ 27,000 she was owed .
She says California “ paid ” her with an IOU that two banks refused to accept – yet she had to pay California sales tax on the so - called “ sale ” of the uniforms .
The class consists mostly of small business owners , many of whom rely on income from government contracts to keep afloat .
They say California has used them as “ suckers ” as it looks for a way to bankroll its operations while avoiding its own financial obligations .
“ Instead of seeking funds through proper channels , the State has created a nightmare , ” the class says .
“ Many of these businesses will not survive if they are required to wait until October 2009 to have these forced IOUs redeemed by the State . ”
The class claims the state is violating the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments .
It demands that California be ordered to honor its own IOUs , plus interest .

Although this steel fastener can support extreme loads , it can also be reused ( Image : TUM Institute of Metal Forming and Casting )
For all its usefulness , Velcro hardly inspires excitement .
But German engineers have taken inspiration from the mild - mannered fastener to create a version of the hook - and - loop concept with enough steely strength for extreme loads and environments .
A square metre of the new fastener , called Metaklett , is capable of supporting 35 tonnes at temperatures up to 800 ºC , claim Josef Mair and colleagues at the Technical University of Munich , Germany .
And just like everyday Velcro it can be opened up without specialised tools and used again .
Conventional hook - and - loop fasteners are used for everything from bandages to cable boots in aircraft and securing prosthetic limbs .
Mair thinks his spring - steel fastener is tough enough to be used for building facades or car assembly .
“ A car parked in direct sunlight can reach temperatures of 80 °C , and temperatures of several hundred °C can arise around the exhaust manifold , ” he says , but Metaklett should be able to shrug off such extremes .

The fastening is made from perforated steel strips 0.2 millimetres thick , one kind bristling with springy steel brushes and the other sporting jagged spikes .
Metaklett can support maximum weight when pulled on in the plane of the strips , and a square metre can hold a perpendicular load of 7 tonnes , says Mair .

We wo n't adopt the German system or French system or anything of the like .
But I think we can get clues on the fundamental differences of various systems .
In the book , he talks about four different kinds of systems .
The Bismarck model , which is like Germany , the Beveridge model , which is like England , the national health insurance model , which is like Canada , and then out of pocket .
The distinction he makes between the Bismarck model and the Beveridge model is a very important distinction to keep in mind for the debate here .
Both achieve universal coverage , Both have quality outcomes .
Both are less costly on a GDP basis than ours .
But there are big differences .
In the Beveridge model , which is Great Britain , waiting lines are an issue .
The Bismarck model , which has largely been adopted in France , Germany , Japan , Belgium and Switzerland , is not government - run .
That does n't mean there 's no government involvement .
But it 's not a government - run system .
They have largely private insurance , with employers contributing .
The big difference between those systems and ours is that private insurance is not - for - profit insurance .
That is the distinction he draws .
They 're not government - run .
The major role for government is to help people who can't afford coverage on their own .
That 's the proper role .
But that runs over some fairly large variations .
In France , for instance , the insurance really is government - run .
The vast majority of people are on public insurance , and there 's private supplementary insurance atop that .
So too with Japan .
They 're not confined to simply subsidizing the poor .
But it 's not government - run .
The doctors and hospitals are private .
You 're right that in France there 's more of a government involvement beyond providing money for those who can't afford coverage .
There 's a regulatory involvement in terms of what 's required by the plans .
But the plans themselves , the mutuals , are not government .*
You 're talking about France here ?
Not Germany ?
Both of them .
The intermediaries are not - for - profits .
The model is universal .
Employers contribute .
Reid says we are in part a Bismarck model , where employers contribute .
Part which is that Beveridge model , like the Indian Health Service and the Veterans Health Service .
We have a national health insurance model with Medicare .
And then out - of - pocket for people with no coverage .
We have a real mixed system .
We really do n't have a system .
That 's kind of what you get down to .
I remember being at the Prepare to Launch event that kicked off the Senate Finance Committee 's work .
Sen Baucus spoke , and so did T.R. Reid .
But building what Sen. Baucus calls a " uniquely American " system seemed to limit our ambition .
A lot of people would look at the British and French and Canadian and Germany systems and say , sure , much separates them , but what unites them is they pay half what we do , cover everyone , and get comparable outcomes .
Actually , some of them have outcomes better than ours .
But we decided not to change that much .
The real lesson from Reid 's book is that we do this badly .
If the French came up with a great new medical procedure , we would n't say that 's just some French procedure .
We 'd adopt it .
But when they come up with a better way to do health care , we dismiss it as French , and inapplicable .
Yeah .
We do n't want anything to do with it .
He talks about that in the book .
It 's an odd thing .
How much of this is a product of political systems ?
Reid has a line in the book where he says the difference between America and France is that the French love their system and change it all the time .
The Americans hate their system and can't seem to touch it .
It 's fascinating , is n't it ?
I just do n't know .
I 've been trying to figure this out for a long time .
I was very involved back in the '90s reform effort .
I was part of the Chafee - Durenberger centrist alternative to the Clinton plan .
I 've been searching ever since for models that I thought would fit America 's values and American culture .
I 've felt for a long time that a system that 's not government - run , but does have universal coverage , does a good job on quality and containing costs , and has the elements we see in some of these other countries is most likely to fit here and win political acceptance and be effective .
Somehow in this debate , we 've gotten very sterile .
If it 's not public option , somehow it wo n't be effective at providing competition to the insurance industry .
I just do n't think that 's what the Reid book shows or what other observers of international systems would conclude .
The question of values always runs into the existence of Medicare .
You can imagine people saying that Medicare was simply too government - driven when President Johnson was trying to enact it .
But Americans love Medicare .
I 've thought about that a lot .
T.R. Reid 's book is so interesting on this point .
Different parts of our system fit different models .
Part fits the Beveridge model .
Part fits the Bismarck model , where employers and employees contribute and it's private doctors and hospitals .
And other parts are national health insurance , which is Canada , and that 's Medicare .
For our senior citizens , we have adopted the model that is closest to the Canadian model .
But there are serious issues with that model if it spreads society - wide in terms of waiting times .
I do n't think that fits American culture .
Is n't that a simple question of funding , though ?
The Canadians spend much less than we do , as do the British .
If they spent as much , they 'd presumably not wait as long .
But if that system spread nationwide , I would be concerned that we would wind up in the waiting lines issue .
I think America would be much less accepting of waiting lines than the Canadians or British have proven to be .
France and Germany and Japan have no trouble with waiting lines .
But in Canada , [ it can take ] months to see a specialist for your shoulder .
One more question before we move to the public option .
We can agree that Clinton 's plan was much more ambitious and transformative than this plan .
It would have done much more to change the average American 's system .
Can I interrupt you for a second ?
When we were working on that plan , a high official in the Clinton administration came to see me and said , " What do you think , Kent ? "
I said I 'd spent hundreds of hours trying to understand how this will work , and I did n't understand it .
He laughed , and he said , " Do n't tell anybody , but I do n't understand it either ! "
That ;s a true story .
I wo n't out who it was .
But a high official !
But for all of its ambition and all of its flaws , the political trajectory was very similar .
Obama is doing a bit better , but back then , there was one solid Republican vote in Sen.
Jim Jeffords , there were angry grassroots events , and lots of lies and anger and polarization .
It 's been striking how much the two plans have not created a different political conversation .
No Republicans say they 've really trimmed their ambitions on this .
They 're really trying to take into account American values and culture .
It 's very striking .
I do n't know .
It 's incredibly hard to do .
When you were involved in the Gang of Six , you produced a plan very similar to the one we 're looking at .
It 's also a plan similar to the one proposed by Sen.
John Chafee , a Republican , in the '90s .
And it 's very similar to what the Republican members of the Gang of Six said they wanted .
But it emerged without their support .
What happened ?
What lesson did you take ?
I honestly do n't know .
I think part of it is we ran out of time .
We were very close to reaching a conclusion .
Now whether or not the politics would have ever permitted all three of the Republicans to agree , I do n't know .
But I can tell you in those discussions , right up to the end , they were very collegial .
They were very professional .
There appeared to be solid agreement on the outlines of the plan .
If somebody had participated in those discussions , I do n't think you could have said there was an ideological divide or a partisan divide .
it was very professional discussion .
You know , we met 61 times .
It seemed that as time went on , agreement became harder .
The politics made it more difficult .
You 're right about the politics making it more difficult .
The dynamic in that room was very positive and very constructive .
We kept making progress until we just sort of ran out of time .
I felt we were getting to the point where we were reasonably close .
Several more weeks , and there might have been an agreement .
But that 's outside the political discussions .
Do you support the public option ?
No .
Why ?
I go back to the T.R. Reid book .
I do n't think a government - run plan best fits this culture .
A plan that 's not government - run has the best chance of succeeding in being passed into law .
Second , and this is very important to my thinking , the public option as defined by the committee of jurisdiction in the House , the Ways and Means Committee , is tied to Medicare levels of reimbursement .
My state has the second - lowest level of Medicare reimbursement in the country .
If my state is tied to that reimbursement , every hospital goes broke .
People say , " Just fix it . "
I 've been on the Finance Committee more than 15 years .
I 've been trying to fix the unfair aspects of Medicare reimbursement all the time .
We run into the House .
Membership is determined by population , and the big population states write levels of reimbursement that unfairly treat hospitals in states like mine .
My hospitals get one - half as much as urban hospitals to treat the same illnesses .
What about a public plan that can't use Medicare rates ?
There are discussions going on about that .
Obviously , it would be very important that it would be clear that it 's not tied to Medicare levels of reimbursement .
Those of us in low - reimbursement states would have our health infrastructure put at risk .
I was also struck when I read the chairman 's mark that the co-op option seemed shackled .
It could n't sell to large employers .
It could n't set payment rates .
The co-ops are not public .
But they were being prevented from competing with insurers on a level playing field .
It seemed like private insurers were being protected from competition .
I think there are things I would like to see that would make certain co-ops be given the full ability to compete that others are .
So you would like to see those restrictions lifted .
I would .
Why are they there ?
Because that came out of the Group of Six discussions .

Scientists from the Tel - Aviv University ( Israel ) discovered that coffee can help us rid of bad breath ( halitosis ) .
On one hand , brewed coffee can cause halitosis as it has a dehydrating effect in the mouth .
However , there is a way to get rid of breath odor with the help of coffee .
The risk of halitosis is particularly high when milk is added to coffee , as milk is processed by the enzymes found in saliva .
Yet , coffee extract has absolutely opposite effect – it inhibits the bacteria that cause bad breath ; such bacteria cover over 90 per cent of the mouth .
Now the scientists are trying to separate the active substance from the extract to use it as foundation for special anti-odor products .

Starting editing wars ( Image : Frederic Sierakowski / Rex Features )
Wikipedia has rapidly become one of the most used reference sources in the world , but a new study shows that the website ’s explosive growth is tailing off and also suggests the community - created encyclopaedia has become less welcoming to new contributors .
Ed Chi and colleagues at the Palo Alto Research Center in California warn that the changes could compromise the encyclopaedia ’s quality in the long term .
“ It ’s easy to say that Wikipedia will always be here , ” says Chi , a computer scientist .
“ This research shows that is not a given . ”

Launched in 2001 , the English language Wikipedia grew rapidly to its current size of almost 3 million articles .
However , when the Palo Alto team analysed a downloaded version of the encyclopaedia they found its growth has peaked .
The number of articles added per month flattened out at 60,000 in 2006 and has since declined by around a third .
They also found that the number of edits made every month and the number of active editors both stopped growing the following year , flattening out at around 5.5 million and 750,000 respectively .
Editor wars
The balance of power within the people who contribute to Wikipedia also appears to have shifted – away from casual contributors who make infrequent changes , toward more active and established contributors .
Chi says the trend could shut out new users .
“ Occasional ” editors , those who make just a single edit a month , have 25 per cent of their changes erased , or reverted , by other editors , a proportion that in 2003 was 10 per cent .
The revert rate for editors who make between two and nine changes a month grew from 5 to 15 per cent over the same period .
“ This is evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content , ” say the Palo Alto team .
Chi told New Scientist that the changes could harm Wikipedia in the longer term by deterring new editors from taking part and so reducing the number of people available to spot and correct the vandalism that constantly threatens the encyclopaedia .
“ Over time the quality may degrade , ” he warns .
Chi thinks that Wikipedia now includes so much information that some editors have turned from creating new articles to improving existing ones , resulting in more disputes about edits .
Such disputes are not a level playing field because established editors sometimes draw on extensive knowledge of Wikipedia ’s guidelines to overwhelm opposition in a practice dubbed “ wikilawyering ” .
Spam to blame ?
The Wikimedia Foundation , the non-profit company that operates Wikipedia , has noted these changes and last month launched a strategic review of Wikipedia in an effort to understand them .
But one of the experts leading that review , Eugene Eric Kim of Blue Oxen Associates in San Francisco says that Chi ’s arguments are only one of several possible explanations for the changes seen in Wikipedia .
The high number of reverts , for example , may be due to the increasing use of spam software that inserts promotional text , such as links to company websites , into articles .
Kim says the review will report this time next year and that any Wikipedia editor can contribute to the process .
The Palo Alto team will present their analysis at the International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration in Orlando , Florida this October .
A blog post by Chi summarises the study .

Marshall : A friend of mine knows a band from his hometown who played on one of the ferries that go between Finland and Sweden .
When they were about to board in Stockholm , the Swedish equivalent of the DEA shows up with dogs and everything , so the guys in the band freak out ' cause they 've ( obviously ) got their dope with them .
After a few minutes of " fuck maaaan , what 're we gonna do maaaaan ! ? " , one of them goes to a Wal - Mart type store and buys a little remote - controlled helicopter .
They proceed to plant the stash on it , leave it on the quay , board the boat and then use the remote to fly the drugs onto the ship
Susan Atkins , who committed one of modern history ’s most notorious crimes when she joined Charles Manson and his gang for a string of killings in 1969 that terrorized Los Angeles and put her in prison for the rest of her life , has died .
She was 61 .
Atkins was diagnosed in 2008 with brain cancer and was receiving medical treatment at the Central California Women ’s Facility in Chowchilla , where she died at 11:46 p.m. Thursday , said Terry Thornton , a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
Thornton attributed the death to natural causes , but an official cause of death will be determined by the Madera County coroner ’s office after a review of Atkins ’ medical history .
Convicted of eight murders , Atkins served more than 38 years of a life sentence at the California Institution for Women in Chino .
She was the longest - serving prisoner among women currently held in the state ’s penitentiaries , Thornton said .
That distinction now falls to Patricia Krenwinkel , who was convicted along with Atkins in the Tate - LaBianca murders
Although prison staffers and clergy workers commended Atkins ’ behavior during her many years behind bars , she was repeatedly denied parole , with officials citing the cruel and callous nature of her crimes .
In June 2008 , she appealed to prison and parole officials for compassionate release , but the state parole board denied the request .
On Sept. 2 , she was wheeled into her last parole hearing on a hospital gurney , but was turned down by a unanimous vote of the 12 - member California Board of Parole .
Atkins confessed to killing actress Sharon Tate -- the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski -- who was stabbed 16 times and hanged ;
Tate ’s nearly full - term fetus died with her .
The next night , Atkins accompanied Manson and his followers when they broke into the Los Feliz home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca and killed them .
“ She was the scariest of the Manson girls , ” said Stephen Kay , a former Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who helped prosecute the case and argued against Atkins ’ release at her parole hearings .
“ She was very violent . ”
Former chief prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi , who sought and won death sentences for Atkins , Manson and other followers , said Atkins would be remembered “ obviously as a member of a group that committed among the most horrendous crimes in American history .
She apparently made every effort to rehabilitate herself . ”
He added : “ It has to be said that she did pay substantially , though not completely , for her incredibly brutal crimes .
And to her credit , she did renounce -- and , I believe , sincerely -- Charles Manson . ”
It was Atkins who broke open the case when she bragged of her participation in the slayings to cellmates at Sybil Brand Institute in East Los Angeles , where she was being held on other charges ; two of her cellmates told authorities of her confession .
Atkins subsequently appeared before a grand jury , providing information that led to her own indictment , as well as that of Manson and others .
Later , in a lurid , 10 - month trial , she provided crucial testimony that fed the public ’s fascination with Hollywood celebrities , drugs , sex and violence .
It also left an unshakable image of Atkins as a remorseless killer , who taunted the court at her sentencing with chilling words : “ You ’d best lock your doors , ” she said , “ and watch your own kids . ”
In 1971 , two separate juries found Manson , Atkins , Krenwinkel and Charles “ Tex ” Watson guilty on seven counts of first - degree murder .
Another Manson follower , Leslie Van Houten , was convicted of two murders .
All received the death sentence , later reduced to life terms after the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty in 1972 .
( The Legislature later reenacted the death penalty statute . )
Manson , Krenwinkel , Watson and Van Houten remain in prison .
Atkins also pleaded guilty to the murder of musician Gary Alan Hinman , who was killed in a dispute over money shortly before the Tate - LaBianca murders .
She received another life sentence for the Hinman killing .
In prison , Atkins embraced Christianity and apologized for her role in the crimes .
Prison staff endorsed her release at a hearing in 2005 , but she was denied parole for the 13th time .
Born Susan Denise Atkins in San Gabriel on May 7 , 1948 , she grew up in San Jose , the middle child of three .
When she was 15 , her mother died of cancer .
Her father sold the family home and all their furnishings to pay the hospital bills .
Atkins began failing school and her father became an alcoholic who frequently left Susan and her younger brother , Steven , to fend for themselves .
Her father eventually abandoned them for good .
Susan and her brother moved to the rural Cental Valley town of Los Banos , where their grandparents lived .
Susan enrolled in high school and got a job as a waitress but was overwhelmed by the stress of trying to care for her brother , work and go to class .
At one point , she and Steven were in foster care .
Susan dropped out of school in the 11th grade and started drifting .
Years later , she would describe her frame of mind during this period as “ extremely angry , extremely vulnerable and directionless . ”
Of all the Manson family killers , except for Manson , Atkins “ had the most unfortunate background , ” Bugliosi said .
The petite , dark - haired teenager hitchhiked to Washington , then Oregon , where she accepted a ride in a stolen car and was arrested on charges of car theft and concealing stolen property .
She was released on probation and moved to San Francisco , where she worked briefly as a topless dancer in a North Beach bar .
In 1967 in Haight - Ashbury , San Francisco ’s haven for hippies and other wanderers , she met Manson , an aspiring songwriter with an affinity for hallucinogenic drugs and free sex .
He called himself and his followers “ Slippies , ” who posed as peace - loving hippies while planning a hair - raising assault on society .
According to Bugliosi in “ Helter Skelter , ” his bestselling 1974 book on the case , Atkins was instantly drawn to Manson , who seduced girls by playing on their insecurities .
She testified under questioning by Bugliosi that before she met Manson she had felt she was “ lacking something , ” but then “ I gave myself to him , and in return for that he gave me back to myself .
He gave me the faith in myself to be able to know that I am a woman . ”
Manson also gave her a new name , partly to make a joke on the establishment he loathed but also to cut her off from her past .
“ Tell them your name is Sadie Glutz , ” he told Atkins .
As in all other matters , she followed his command .
By August 1969 , the Manson family ’s base of operations was Spahn Ranch , a 500 - acre property in the Santa Susana Mountains above Chatsworth where many old westerns were filmed .
They took drugs , had group sex , stole credit cards and scrounged trash bins for food .
They also practiced what Manson called “ creepy crawling , ” which involved randomly picking a house somewhere in Los Angeles and entering it while the occupants were asleep .
Bugliosi called these expeditions “ dress rehearsals for murder . ”
On the night of Aug. 8 , Manson instructed Atkins and other followers -- Krenwinkel , Watson and Linda Kasabian -- to don their dark clothes and pack knives .
Manson stayed at the ranch while they drove through the Hollywood Hills , winding up at the Tate residence in Benedict Canyon .
Around midnight , the nightmare began .
The first to die was Steven Parent , 18 , a friend of Tate ’s caretaker , who encountered the murderers as he was leaving the estate .
The other victims were inside the main house :
Tate , 26 , best known for her role in the movie “ Valley of the Dolls ” ; Hollywood hairstylist Jay Sebring , 35 ; Voytek Frykowski , 32 , a friend of Polanski , who was out of the country ; and Abigail Folger , 25 , a coffee heiress and Frykowksi ’s girlfriend .
Atkins later admitted stabbing Frykowski and Tate .
She said that before fleeing the scene , Watson ordered her to leave a message in the house that would “ shock the world , ” so she used Tate ’s blood to write “ PIG ” on the front door .
At her parole board hearing in 1993 , an official asked Atkins if Tate said anything to her in her last moments .
“ She asked me to let the baby live , ” Atkins said tearfully .
“ I told her I did n’t have mercy for her . ”
The night after the Tate killings , Manson led a group that included Atkins , Watson , Krenwinkel and Kasabian on another expedition .
They wound up at the LaBianca home .
Manson tied up Leno , 44 , and Rosemary , 38 , then left the killing to Watson , Krenwinkel and Van Houten .
Afterward , they took a shower and made a snack in the LaBiancas ’ kitchen before departing .
Atkins stayed in the car .
The ‘ 60s “ abruptly ended on August 9 , 1969 , ” Joan Didion wrote of the shocking crimes that closed a decade pocked with assassinations , Vietnam War deaths and other violence .
The Tate - LaBianca murders made some people fear “ that they had somehow done it to themselves , ” Didion said , “ that it had to do with too much sex , drugs and rock and roll . ”
Atkins married twice while in prison .
In 1981 , she married Donald Laisure , a self - proclaimed Texas millionaire who had been married 35 times before .
The marriage ended when Laisure said he planned to take his 37th wife .
In 1987 , she married James W. Whitehouse , an Orange County attorney who represented her at her last few parole hearings .
He survives her along with a son she gave up when she went to prison .
