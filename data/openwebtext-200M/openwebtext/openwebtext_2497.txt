JUST WHO OR WHAT IS THIS " IRS ? " Devvy Kidd
February 6 , 2000
The letter below was composed by Larry Becraft and sent by me to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service back on February 5 , 1997 .
I have never received a response to this letter but is n't that the way this rogue operation works ?
As regular readers of this web site know , Larry has been defending Americans against this IRS scam for 20 years .
I have spent the past nine years with my nose stuck in books at the law library , and now with the Internet to help cut down on some of those trips to the library , verifying everything he researches .
When will America decide enough is enough ?
Mrs. Margaret M. Richardson
Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service
1111 Constitution Avenue , N.W .
Washington , DC 20224
Dear Mrs. Richardson ,
Many years ago , I tried to find within the Internal Revenue Code the section which created your agency , but I was unable to do so .
I then decided to locate other sources of information regarding how the Internal Revenue Service was established and what I found was nothing short of amazing .
In 1972 , an Internal Revenue Manual 1100 was published in both the Federal Register and Cumulative Bullet ; see 37 Fed. Reg. 20960 , 1972 - 2 Cum .
Bul. 836 , a copy of which is attached for your convenience .
On the very first page of this statement which was published in the Bulletin , the following admission was made :
" (3 ) By common parlace [ sic ] and understanding of the time , an office of the importance of the Office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue was a bureau .
The Secretary of the Treasury in his report at the close of the calendar year 1862 stated that ' The Bureau of Internal Revenue has been organized under the Act of the last session ...'
Also it can be seen that Congress had intended to establish a Bureau of Internal Revenue , or thought they had , from the act of March 3 , 1863 , in which provision was made for the President to appoint with Senate confirmation a Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue ' who shall be charged with such duties in the bureau of internal revenue as maybe prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury , or as may be required by law , and who shall act as Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the absence of that officer , and exercise the privilege of franking all letters and documents pertaining to the office of internal revenue . '
In other words , ' the office of internal revenue ' was ' the bureau of internal revenue , ' and the act of July 1 , 1862 , is the organic act of today 's Internal Revenue Service . "
This statement , which again appears in a similar publication appearing at 39 Fed.
Reg. 11572 , 1974 - 1 Cum . Bul. 440 , as well as the current IRM 1100 , essentially admits that Congress never created either the Bureau of Internal Revenue or the Internal Revenue Service .
To conclude that " Congress thought it had created this agency " is an admission that even the government itself cannot even find anything which created either agency .
The only office created by the act of July 1 , 1862 , was the Office of Commissioner ; neither the Bureau nor the Service was actually created by any of these acts .
I have no doubt that when employees of the IRS were researching its origins so that this statement could be included within IRM 1100 , those employees must have performed a very thorough investigation .
This obviously is the best position that your agency can develop regarding precisely how the IRS came into being .
But besides the problem that these acts simply did not create either the Bureau or the IRS is the fact that these acts were repealed by the adoption of the Revised Statutes of 1873 .
Therefore , it would appear that your agency has never been created by any act of Congress , and this is a serious flaw .
An act of legislative body is essential to create a public office .
At the state level , it is a well acknowledged rule that a duly constituted office of state government must be created either by the state constitution itself or by some legislative act ; see Patton v. Bd. Of Health , 127 Ca. 388 , 393 , 59 P. 702 , 704 ( 1899 ) ( " One of the requisites is that the office must be created by the constitution of the state or it must be authorized by some statute . " ) ;

Since I have reached the conclusion that the IRS has never been created by Congress , I am asking you to provide to me the citation of any statute which really did create the IRS .
Since this is a question of profound national importance , I request that you provide an answer to me within 20 days .
Failing a response within that time period , I shall conclude that you cannot find any such statute and shall act accordingly .
Sincerely , Devvy Kidd
That was February 5 , 1997 .
Today is February 6 , 2000 .
I have never received any response because the IRS , regardless of who warms the chair of " Commissioner , " cannot provide an answer without giving away the scam being enforced by dragoons , with the full blessing of the United States Congress .
I quote the Denver Post , April 13 , 1997 ( two days before National Extortion Day ) :
Weaker IRS May Favor The Wealthy Middle Incomers Would Suffer Most , Experts Say by George Rodrique , The Dallas Morning News " The chief losers , they add , would be the vast majority of middle - class wage earners who pay their taxes voluntarily . "
We do ?
With a gun to our head we are forced to " volunteer . "
I would highly recommend that the grassroots members of the two " main " political parties out there ask Jr. New World Order George ( Bush ) , McCain , Forbes , Bradley or Red Al ( Gore ) , when they are going to stand in front of this nation and tell people the truth about the unholy alliance between the un-Federal Reserve and the IRS .
In case you missed it , please read my piece about the swindle going on and where IRS funds really go :

And now for the kicker .
Larry Becraft sent me a set of court papers in the case of :
Diversified Metal Products , Inc. , Plaintiff , v. T - Bow Company Trust ,
Internal Revenue Service , and Steve Morgan .
Case No. CV 93-4117 , Complaint for Impleader .
In the District court of the Seventh Judicial District of The State of Idaho ,
In And For The County Of Bonneville Magistrates Court .
I was floored when I read these documents and will extract only two items from this paperwork which speak volumes :
In the Complaint for Impleader , prepared by the attorneys for plaintiff , page one , item # 4 :
Defendant Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) is an agency of the United States government which has presented to Plaintiff a lien against monies to which Defendant Steve Morgan , or presumably Defendant T - Bow Company Trust for him , may be entitled .
Now let us look at the response of the Attorneys for the United States of America , prepared by Betty Richardson , United States Attorney , Box 32 , Boise , Idaho 83707 .
Civil No. 93-405-E-EJL , United States ' Answer and Claim re : Diversified Metal Products , Inc. , Plaintiff v. T - Bow Company Trust , Internal Revenue Service and Steve Morgan , Defendants , page 4 , item # 4 :
Denies ( the U.S. government ) that the Internal Revenue Service is an agency of the United States government but admits that the United States of America would be a proper party to this action .
Admits that the IRS has served a Notice of Levy on plaintiff for funds owed to defendant Steve Morgan .
Now wait just a minute !
The liars , I mean lawyers , for your government state that the IRS is not an agency of the government .
My letter to then Commissar of the IRS , Maggie Richardson clearly lays out the truth of the matter and yet , day in and day out , this rogue operation continues to put people in jail for not volunteering to " pay their fair share . "
If anyone thinks these crooks , cowards and criminals in the Congress ( with the exception of a few who are kinda , sorta letting the truth out ) , are going to come clean to the American people , think again .
If you think Dan Blather or any of the other lairs - for - hire who make millions every night on the nightly " news , " will ever broadcast the truth , think again .
It 's up to US to broadcast the truth and I hope you will send this piece to everyone you know who has a computer and if you know someone who does n't have a computer , make a copy and send it to them .
Tell the recipient to make ten copies and keep doing that - we can reach millions of people in a short period of time using this method .
You might send this over to your house member there in Congress .
The big - shot wo n't read it but the staff might ....
Below are words from individuals who had a key role in shaping the past history of this nation .
I pray the events wo n't be repeated but their words are worth reading to remind US of the enormous amount of courage it took for our Founding Fathers to stand up to tyranny - the same tyranny we are looking at today .
This government is one , big , fat lie after lie .
The solutions are there for US , but we need to get everyone on the same sheet of truth .
I thank you for your time .
John Hancock , " Boston Massacre Oration , " 5 March 1774 ( The Boston Massacre was in 1770 ) :
Men , Brethren , Fathers , and Fellow - Countrymen : - The attentive gravity ; the venerable appearance of this crowded audience ; the dignity which I behold in the countenances of so many in this great assembly ; the solemnity of the occasion upon which we have met together , joined to a consideration of the part I am to take in the important business of this day , fill me with an awe hitherto unknown , and heighten the sense which I have ever had of my unworthiness to fill this sacred desk .
But , allured by the call of some of my respected fellow - citizens , with whose request it is always my greatest pleasure to comply , I almost forgot my want of ability to perform what they required .
In this situation I find my only support in assuring myself that a generous people will not severely censure what they know was well intended , though its want of merit should prevent their being able to applaud it .
And I pray that my sincere attachment to the interest of my country , and the hearty detestation of every design formed against her liberties , may be admitted as some apology for my appearance in this place .
I have always , from my earliest youth , rejoiced in the felicity of my fellow - men ; and have ever considered it as the indispensable able duty of every member of society to promote , as far as in him lies , the prosperity of every individual , but more especially of the community to which he belongs ; and also , as a faithful subject of the State , to use his utmost endeavors to detect , and having detected , strenuously to oppose every traitorous plot which its enemies may devise for its destruction .
Security to the persons and properties of the governed is so obviously the design and end of civil government , that to attempt a logical proof of it would be like burning tapers at noonday , to assist the sun in enlightening the world ; and it cannot be either virtuous or honorable to attempt to support a government of which this is not the great and principal basis ; and it is to the last degree vicious and infamous to attempt to support a government which manifestly tends to render the persons and properties of the governed insecure .
Some boast of being friends to government ; I am a friend to righteous government , to a government founded upon the principles of reason and justice ; but I glory in publicly avowing my eternal enmity to tyranny .
Is the present system , which the British administration have adopted for the government of the Colonies , a righteous government - or is it tyranny ?
Here suffer me to ask ( and would to heaven there could be an answer ! ) what tenderness , what regard , respect , or consideration has Great Britain shown , in their late transactions , for the security of the persons or properties of the inhabitants of the Colonies ?
Or rather what have they omitted doing to destroy that security ?
They have declared that they have ever had , and of right ought ever to have , full power to make laws of sufficient validity to bind the Colonies in all cases whatever .
They have exercised this pretended right by imposing a tax upon us without our consent ; and lest we should show some reluctance at parting with our property , her fleets and armies are sent to enforce their mad pretensions .
The town of Boston , ever faithful to the British Crown , has been invested by a British fleet ; the troops of George III .
have crossed the wide Atlantic , not to engage an enemy , but to assist a band of traitors in trampling on the rights and liberties of his most loyal subjects in America - those rights and liberties which , as a father , he ought ever to regard , and as a king , he is bound , in honor , to defend from violation , even at the risk of his own life . .
Let not the history of the illustrious house of Brunswick inform posterity that a king , descended from that glorious monarch George II. , once sent his British subjects to conquer and enslave his subjects in America .
But be perpetual infamy entailed upon that villain who dared to advise his master to such execrable measures ; for it was easy to foresee the consequences which so naturally followed upon sending troops into America to enforce obedience to acts of the British Parliament , which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make .
It was reasonable to expect that troops , who knew the errand they were sent upon , would treat the people whom they were to subjugate , with a cruelty and haughtiness which too often buries the honorable character of a soldier in the disgraceful name of an unfeeling ruffian .
The troops , upon their first arrival , took possession of our Senate House , and pointed their cannon against the judgment hall , and even continued them there whilst the supreme court of judicature for this province was actually sitting to decide upon the lives and fortunes of the King 's subjects .
Our streets nightly resounded with the noise of riot and debauchery ; our peaceful citizens were hourly exposed to shameful insults , and often felt the effects of their violence and outrage .
But this was not all : as though they thought it not enough to violate our civil rights , they endeavored to deprive us of the enjoyment of our religious privileges , to vitiate our morals , and thereby render us deserving of destruction .
Hence , the rude din of arms which broke in upon your solemn devotions in your temples , on that day hallowed by heaven , and set apart by God himself for his peculiar worship .
Hence , impious oaths and blasphemies so often tortured your unaccustomed ear .
Hence , all the arts which idleness and luxury could invent were used to betray our youth of one sex into extravagance and effeminacy , and of the other to infamy and ruin ; and did they not succeed but too well ?
Did not a reverence for religion sensibly decay ?
Did not our infants almost learn to lisp out curses before they knew their horrid import ?
Did not our youth forget they were Americans , and , regardless of the admonitions of the wise and aged servilely copy from their tyrants those vices which finally must overthrow the empire of Great Britain ?
And must I be compelled to acknowledge that even the noblest , fairest , part of all the lower creation did not entirely escape the cursed snare ?
When virtue has once erected her throne within the female breast , it is upon so solid a basis that nothing is able to expel the heavenly inhabitant .
But have there not been some few , indeed , I hope , whose youth and inexperience have rendered them a prey to wretches , whom , upon the least reflection , they would have despised and hated as foes to God and their country ?
I fear there have been some such unhappy instances , or why have I seen an honest father clothed with shame ; or why a virtuous mother drowned in tears ?
But I forbear , and come reluctantly to the transactions of that dismal night , when in such quick succession we felt the extremes of grief , astonishment , and rage ; when heaven in anger , for a dreadful moment , suffered hell to take the reins ; when Satan , with his chosen band , opened the sluices of New England 's blood , and sacrilegiously polluted our land with the dead bodies of her guiltless sons !
Let this sad tale of death never be told without a tear ; let not the heaving bosom cease to burn with a manly indignation at the barbarous story , through the long tracts of future time ; let every parent tell the shameful story to his listening children until tears of pity glisten in their eyes , and boiling passions shake their tender frames ; and whilst the anniversary of that ill - fated night is kept a jubilee in the grim court of pandemonium , let all America join in one common prayer to heaven that the inhuman , unprovoked murders of the fifth of March , 1770 , planned by Hillsborough , and a knot of treacherous knaves in Boston , and executed by the cruel hand of Preston and his sanguinary coadjutors , may ever stand in history without a parallel .
But what , my countrymen , withheld the ready arm of vengeance from executing instant justice on the vile assassins ?
Perhaps you feared promiscuous carnage might ensue , and that the innocent might share the fate of those who had performed the infernal deed .
But were not all guilty ?
Were you not too tender of the lives of those who came to fix a yoke on your necks ?
But I must not too severely blame a fault , which great souls only can commit .
May that magnificence of spirit which scorns the low pursuits of malice , may that generous compassion which often preserves from ruin , even a guilty villain , forever actuate the noble bosoms of Americans !
But let not the miscreant host vainly imagine that we feared their arms .
No ; them we despised ; we dread nothing but slavery .
Death is the creature of a poltroon 's brains ; 'tis immortality to sacrifice ourselves for the salvation of our country .
We fear not death .
That gloomy night , the pale - faced moon , and the affrighted stars that hurried through the sky , can witness that we fear not death .
Our hearts which , at the recollection , glow with rage that four revolving years have scarcely taught us to restrain , can witness that we fear not death ; and happy it is for those who dared to insult us , that their naked bones are not now piled up an everlasting lasting monument of Massachusetts ' bravery .
But they retired , they fled , and in that flight they found their only safety .
We then expected that the hand of public justice would soon inflict that punishment upon the murderers , which , by the laws of God and man , they had incurred .
But let the unbiased pen of a Robertson , or perhaps of some equally famed American , conduct this trial before the great tribunal of succeeding generations .
And though the murderers may escape the just resentment of an enraged people ; though drowsy justice , intoxicated by the poisonous draught prepared for her cup , still nods upon her rotten seat , yet be assured such complicated crimes will meet their due reward .
Tell me , ye bloody butchers !
ye villains high and low !
ye wretches who contrived , as well as you who executed the inhuman deed !
do you not feel the goads and stings of conscious guilt pierce through your savage bosoms ?
Though some of you may think yourselves exalted to a height that bids defiance to human justice , and others shroud yourselves beneath the mask of hypocrisy , and build your hopes of safety on the low arts of cunning , chicanery , and falsehood , yet do you not sometimes feel the gnawings of that worm which never dies ?
Do not the injured shades of Maverick , Gray , Caldwell , Attucks , and Carr attend you in your solitary walks , arrest you even in the midst of your debaucheries , and fill even your dreams with terror ? . . .
Ye dark designing knaves , ye murderers , parricides !
how dare you tread upon the earth which has drunk in the blood of slaughtered innocents , shed by your wicked hands ?
How dare you breathe that air which wafted to the ear of heaven the groans of those who fell a sacrifice to your accursed ambition ?
But if the laboring earth cloth not expand her jaws ; if the air you breathe is not commissioned to be the minister of death ; yet , hear it and tremble !
The eye of heaven penetrates the darkest chambers of the soul , traces the leading clue through all the labyrinths which your industrious folly has devised ; and you , however you may have screened yourselves from human eyes , must be arraigned , must lift your hands , red with the blood of those whose death you have procured , at the tremendous bar of God !
But I gladly quit the gloomy theme of death , and leave you to improve the thought of that important day when our naked souls must stand before that Being from whom nothing can be hid .
I would not dwell too long upon the horrid effects which have already followed from quartering regular troops in this town .
Let our misfortunes teach posterity to guard against such evils for the future .
Standing armies are sometimes ( I would by no means say generally , much less universally ) composed of persons who have rendered themselves unfit to live in civil society ; who have no other motives of conduct than those which a desire of the present gratification of their passions suggests ; who have no property in any country ; men who have given up their own liberties , and envy those who enjoy liberty ; who are equally indifferent to the glory of a George or a Louis ; who , for the addition of one penny a day to their wages , would desert from the Christian cross and fight under the crescent of the Turkish Sultan .
From such men as these , what has not a State to fear ?
With such as these , usurping Caesar passed the Rubicon ; with such as these , he humbled mighty Rome , and forced the mistress of the world to own a master in a traitor .
These are the men whom sceptred robbers now employ to frustrate the designs of God , and render vain the bounties which his gracious hand pours indiscriminately upon his creatures .
By these the miserable slaves in Turkey , Persia , and many other extensive countries , are rendered truly wretched , though their air is salubrious , and their soil luxuriously fertile .
By these , France and Spain , though blessed by nature with all that administers to the convenience of life , have been reduced to that contemptible state in which they now appear ; and by these , Britain , - but if I were possessed of the gift of prophesy , I dare not , except by divine command , unfold the leaves on which the destiny of that once powerful kingdom is inscribed .
But since standing armies are so hurtful to a State , perhaps my countrymen may demand some substitute , some other means of rendering us secure against the incursions of a foreign enemy .
But can you be one moment at a loss ?
Will not a well - disciplined militia afford you ample security against foreign foes ?
We want not courage ; it is discipline alone in which we are exceeded by the most formidable troops that ever trod the earth .
Surely our hearts flutter no more at the sound of war than did those of the immortal band of Persia , the Macedonian phalanx , the invincible Roman legions , the Turkish janissaries , the gens d'armes of France , or the well - known grenadiers of Britain .
A well - disciplined militia is a safe , an honorable guard to a community like this , whose inhabitants are by nature brave , and are laudably tenacious of that freedom in which they were born .
From a well - regulated militia we have nothing to fear ; their interest is the same with that of the State .
When a country is invaded , the militia are ready to appear in its defense ; they march into the field with that fortitude which a consciousness of the justice of their cause inspires ; they do not jeopardize their lives for a master who considers them only as the instruments of his ambition , and whom they regard only as the daily dispenser of the scanty pittance of bread and water .
No ; they fight for their houses , their lands , for their wives , their children ; for all who claim the tenderest names , and are held dearest in their hearts ; they fight pro aris et focis , for their liberty , and for themselves , and for their God .
And let it not offend if I say that no militia ever appeared in more flourishing condition than that of this province now cloth ; and pardon me if I say , of this town in particular .
I mean not to boast ; I would not excite envy , but manly emulation .
We have all one common cause ; let it , therefore , be our only contest , who shall most contribute to the security of the liberties of America .
And may the same kind Providence which has watched over this country from her infant state still enable us to defeat our enemies !
I cannot here forbear noticing the signal manner in which the designs of those who wish not well to us have been discovered .
The dark deeds of a treacherous cabal have been brought to public view .
You now know the serpents who , whilst cherished in your bosoms , were darting the envenomed stings into the vitals of the constitution .
But the representatives of the people have fixed a mark on these ungrateful monsters , which , though it may not make them so secure as Cain of old , yet renders them , at least , as infamous .
Indeed , it would be effrontive to the tutelar deity of this country even to despair of saving it from all the snares which human policy can lay .
. . .
Surely you never will tamely suffer this country to be a den of thieves .
Remember , my friends , from whom you sprang .
Let not a meanness of spirit , unknown to those whom you boast of as your fathers , excite a thought to the dishonor of your mothers I conjure you , by all that is dear , by all that is honorable , by all that is sacred , not only that ye pray , but that ye act ; that , if necessary , ye fight , and even die , for the prosperity of our Jerusalem .
Break in sunder , with noble disdain , the bonds with which the Philistines have bound you .
Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed , by the soft arts of luxury and effeminacy , into the pit digged for your destruction .
Despise the glare of wealth .
That people who pay greater respect to a wealthy villain than to an honest , upright man in poverty , almost deserve to be enslaved ; they plainly show that wealth , however it may be acquired , is , in their esteem , to be preferred to virtue .
But I thank God that America abounds in men who are superior to all temptation , whom nothing can divert from a steady pursuit of the interest of their country , who are at once its ornament and safeguard .
And sure I am , I should not incur your displeasure , if I paid a respect , so justly due to their much - honored characters , in this place .
But when I name an Adams , such a numerous host of fellow - patriots rush upon my mind , that I fear it would take up too much of your time , should I attempt to call over the illustrious roll .
But your grateful hearts will point you to the men ; and their revered names , in all succeeding times , shall grace the annals of America .
From them let us , my friends , take example ; from them let us catch the divine enthusiasm ; and feel , each for himself , the godlike pleasure of diffusing happiness on all around us ; of delivering the oppressed from the iron grasp of tyranny ; of changing the hoarse complaints and bitter moans of wretched slaves into those cheerful songs , which freedom and contentment must inspire .
There is a heartfelt satisfaction in reflecting on our exertions for the public weal , which all the sufferings an enraged tyrant can inflict will never take away ; which the ingratitude and reproaches of those whom we have saved from ruin cannot rob us of .
The virtuous asserter of the rights of mankind merits a reward , which even a want of success in his endeavors to save his country , the heaviest misfortune which can befall a genuine patriot , cannot entirely prevent him from receiving .
I have the most animating confidence that the present noble struggle for liberty will terminate gloriously for America .
And let us play the man for our God , and for the cities of our God ; while we are using the means in our power , let us humbly commit our righteous cause to the great Lord of the Universe , who loveth righteousness and hateth iniquity .
And having secured the approbation of our hearts , by a faithful and unwearied discharge of our duty to our country , let us joyfully leave our concerns in the hands of him who raiseth up and pulleth down the empires and kingdoms of the world as he pleases ; and with cheerful submission to his sovereign will , devoutly say : " Although the fig tree shall not blossom , neither shall fruit be in the vines ; the labor of the olive shall fail , and the field shall yield no meat ; the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the stalls ; yet we will rejoice in the Lord , we will joy in the God of our salvation .

It has been a real joy for me to go back and read all that I had forgotten from school .
Of course , I never went to school under the Federal Department of Education , so I was taught real American history and not this junk they try to pass off these days as " education . "
The Bible .
It ’s consistently the best - selling book on the planet and now it ’s gone green .
Publishing company Harper
One recently released the Green Bible , a new environmentally - friendly version of the Bible , and it ’s selling well .
In fact , more that 25,000 copies sold in the first few weeks of its release .
Printed on recycled paper with soy ink , the Green Bible has a sustainable beige linen cover embossed with a green picture of a tree .
Covering both the Old and New Testament , this eco-friendly Bible has all text that mentions something about the environment printed in green ( as opposed to the “ red letter bible ” where all the believed words of Jesus are printed in red ) .
In all , over 1,000 verses throughout the Bible have been printed in green .
And to make relevant issues ( air , pollution , gardening ) easy to find , there is even a Green Subject Index .
Endorsed by secular organizations such as the Humane Society and The Sierra Club , the Green Bible has been making waves among some Christian evangelical circles who are concerned that introducing environmental activism into the Bible could lead to people being distracted from their mission to follow and spread the word of God .
But while some are not happy with the Bible going green , others , particularly those involved in the Creation Care Movement , are more enthused by the emergence of a green ‘ Good Book ’ .
They are hoping that , with essays about global warming and other environmental issues written by well - known religious leaders such as Desmond Tutu , the new version will generate a lively theological debate about environmentalism .
I guess time will tell .
Treknobabble is a continuing series of columns written by uber - Trekkie Reed Farrington in anticipation of the upcoming J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie .
Since the articles that are the most popular on Film Junk are Top 10 Lists , I ’ve decided to succumb to the commercial pressures .
( Besides , Sean suggested that I do some . )
As usual , I ’ll be trying to subvert your expectations as best I can in order to avoid repeating the same things that other people have said in their similar lists .
I ’ll try to add some historical background as to how the invention actually came to be , and sociological effects that might not be so obvious .
And where possible , I ’ll try to add some notes on what future developments may be in store for further improvements .
I ’ll avoid being technical in order to avoid hurting your brain .
Ha ha .
My arrogance is unbecoming ; I should have said “ to avoid hurting my brain . ”
Gene Roddenberry was fond of saying that the success of Star Trek was partly due to its tact of not talking down to its audience because the television audience was smarter than how smart television executives thought it was .
I wonder what he would have thought of the Internet community .
Oh , also , Star Trek did n’t really invent these devices , but it popularized them , or provided inspiration for their realization in the everyday world .
They have become ubiquitous .
Here we go …
10 . Personal Computer
On the Original Series ( TOS ) , we saw small computers in the meeting room and in trial rooms .
We never did see any keyboards anywhere .
Computers and control consoles seemed to have plenty of lights , and the number of knobs , buttons , dials , and toggles was kept to a minimum .
Voice commands seemed to be the main interface .
I suppose major computer programming changes were performed off - site at a space station or perhaps in a room on the Enterprise that we never got to see .
Back in TOS days of the 1960s , computer processing was centralized with terminals accessing a main computer .
As miniaturization progressed , the idea of distributed processing caught on and personal computers became a reality .
So perhaps the computers we saw on TOS were supposed to be terminals connected to the main computer .
There were episodes that established a main computer on the Enterprise as the repository of information , but tricorders had a lot of processing power on their own , too .
The early Commodore personal computers did resemble the shape of the computer in the meeting room .
Five years after TOS went off the air , Ed Roberts introduced the Altair 8800 , named after a galaxy mentioned in Star Trek .
This blue box was a build - it - yourself kit that is acknowledged as the first personal computer .
It had no monitor and no software .
And it looked like it belonged on TOS .
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak , and Bill Gates and Paul Allen would add the functionality to the Altair and build the Apple and Microsoft empires , respectively .
I doubt many home users ever used personal computers for developing applications .
With the goal now being to imbed computers transparently into devices , I imagine the personal computer will become solely a tool for hobbyists .
The primary function of personal computers now is to connect to the Internet .
The rapid growth of the Internet is attributed to Trekkies and porn .
I ’m guessing the laptop market has overtaken the sales of personal computers , because all you really need for using e-mail and browsing the Internet is what a laptop provides .
9. Tablet
The yeomen were always getting Captain Kirk to sign off using a tablet and stylus .
We now have this in the form of Tablet PCs .
A Tablet PC is formally defined as “ a laptop or slate - shaped mobile computer , equipped with a touch screen or graphics tablet / screen hybrid technology which allows the user to operate the computer with a stylus or digital pen , or a fingertip , instead of a keyboard or mouse . ”
The technologies required for the creation of a Tablet PC have been slowly evolving .
As early as 1888 , Elisha Gray patented an electrical stylus device for capturing handwriting .
Before Star
Trek aired , the development of a tablet culminated with one being invented by the RAND Corporation .
I believe Star Trek ’s creator consulted with them , so this may have sparked the appearance of tablets on Star Trek .
After Star Trek , several Tablet PC - like devices were proposed and some were constructed , but it was n’t until 1989 that the first commercially available Tablet PC , the GRiDPad , was released .
The Apple Newton in 1991 was originally designed to be a Tablet PC , but it morphed into a Personal Data Assistant ( PDA ) without the graphics tablet / screen .
With PDAs now adopting touch screens for displaying video , perhaps the only difference in the future between a Tablet PC and a PDA will be the size .
In 2001 , Microsoft made a big push for Tablet PCs with a Tablet PC version of the Windows OS .
I do n’t think Tablet PCs have made much of an impression on the general public .
My brother used a Tablet PC while managing quality control .
I suppose Tablet PCs have their uses for specialized environments .
I would think they would be ideal in educational environments , but perhaps the cost does not justify their use .
8. Portable Memory
TOS showed solid , square disks of about 3 ″ x 3 ″ x 0.25 ″ .
( I ’m terrible at estimating sizes from visual evidence . )
The disks were inserted into computers and portable devices , and apparently contained information on them .
These disks were unlabelled , but came in a variety of colors .
I originally thought it was strange that TOS disks were n’t labeled once I started using real 3.5 ″ disks that came with labels , but using USB flash drives now makes me realize that this portable memory is only for temporary storage .
Since the TOS , I ’ve seen quite an evolution in portable memory in reality .
From 10 ″ floppies to 5.25 ″ floppies to 3.5 ″ disks ( that actually resembled TOS disks ) to memory sticks ( that resembled the Next Generation ( TNG ) isolinear chips ) , postage sized memory cards , and USB flash drives .
I think portable memory has gotten to its smallest size before it gets too small to handle with human fingers .
We are now seeing increased capacities .
7. Biometrics
Biometrics is the science of developing and applying statistical and mathematical methods in the analysis of physiological characteristics for the purposes of identifying and verifying individuals .
If a physiological characteristic is unique to each individual , and it can be measured reliably , then it serves as a candidate worthy of study .
The earliest form of biometrics was possibly used in 14th century China where they had a form of fingerprinting .
In Star Trek , we saw computers use voice recognition to identify users .
This is a behavioral biometric generally used for verification .
When Kirk was on trial , we saw palm registration used .
And in The Wrath of Khan , we saw the use of a retinal scanner .
These latter two cases are examples of physical biometrics used for either identification or verification .
Star
Trek guessed correctly that with advanced technology , biometrics would flourish .
In the real world , there are many more physiological characteristics that have been used in biometrics .
Regarding retinal scanning , research in the 1930s suggested that the patterns of blood vessels on the back of the eyeball were unique to each individual .
It was n’t until 1976 when a company called EyeDentify was founded that someone thought that technology had advanced enough to make retinal scanning a viable method .
Two years after The Wrath of Khan was released , EyeDentify released the first retinal scan device for commercial use .
Laptops have had fingerprint readers and face detection software available for years now .
As well as improving the technology for analysis , modifications are constantly in development in order to stay ahead of ways to deliberately deceive biometrics devices , called “ spoofing ” .
We ’ve all seen films where the bad guy , or hero , will kill his opponent and cut the person ’s hand or finger off , and then apply the dead appendage to the scanning device .
Well , if you find yourself in a similar situation and try this , it might not work since systems have been updated to measure blood flow .
One of the more promising biometrics in current development measures saccades , which is the rapid , involuntary reflex movements of the eyeball .
For most people , biometrics has played a somewhat negligible role .
There have been two developments that are slowly changing things .
One is the spread of identity theft .
( I had this happen to me .
There was an identity theft ring that was able to create Canadian driver ’s licenses .
I guess all they needed was your driver ’s license number , your address , and your date - of - birth .
I saw a photocopy of the fake license , and there was a photo of a chubby , balding occidental on it .
With these licenses and using my name , they were able to borrow money from banks and lending institutions .
I never did find out where they got my personal information from . )
There needs to be a better way to identify people .
Signatures are really kind of useless .
Credit card companies want to introduce a better form of biometrics .
The other development occurred on September 11 , 2001 .
From that day forward , it became extremely important to be able to screen people effectively .
The government agency in Canada responsible for passports wants to introduce biometrics .
With being reliably able to provide quick identification , biometrics will make life easier and increase security .
6. Wireless Earpiece
We currently have wireless Bluetooth headsets that attach to the ear and that are reminiscent of Uhura ’s communication ear piece .
Spock and Chekov also sported the earpiece on occasion .
The Bluetooth initiative was started in 1998 , and many companies endorsed it .
Its mandate was to allow electronic devices to communicate with each other without wires .
By the year 2000 , the first Bluetooth headset / earpiece was available .
Currently , to me , the Bluetooth headsets appear geeky .
I ’ve only seen a few people wear them in public , but I live in a relatively small town .
I wonder if communication devices embedded under the skin will be the future of communication so that the wireless headset will be long gone before the 23rd century .
5. Remote Location Finding
On TOS , the idea of locating someone was incorporated into the communicators .
This was a good way for keeping track of crew , but was also important for the transporter system to be able to lock onto your coordinates for beaming from one place to another .
Also if you needed your starship to send some firepower down to an area , you could have your starship use your communicator location for reference .
Nowadays , this idea has been implemented through a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) that relies on Earth orbit satellites .
We use GPS for navigation in the sky , on water , and on land .
Four years after Star Trek went off the air , the American Department of Defense decided to start development of GPS originally as the Navigation Technology Program , which became NAVSTAR ( Navigation System for Timing and Ranging ) .
The military continually launched satellites and refined the system over a period of time .
GPS was made available for civilian use after Korean Airline Flight 007 was shot down in Soviet territory in 1983 .
By 1995 , the system was fully operational , and by 2000 , civilian users could expect an accuracy of 20 meters .
As on Star Trek , GPS can be used in emergency situations .
With providers such as OnStar , GPS built into automobiles can allow services such as flashing the headlights or honking the horn to help you find your automobile in a parking lot .
And with GPS in cell phones , 911 operators no longer have to rely on the caller being able to say where he is .
One interesting future use of GPS is for automated driving systems where you can go to sleep and let your computer do the driving .
4. Sliding Doors
Before Star
Trek , I guess people were used to sliding doors in elevators .
Senior citizens will even remember having human elevator operators .
It was n’t until the 1950s that automatic push button control systems replaced manual controls in elevators .
( And then in the 1970s , electromechanical controls were gradually replaced with solid state electronic controls . )
But sliding doors were n’t common elsewhere even though they had been invented before Star Trek !
( I grew up in a small town , so I did n’t see a sliding door in real life until after I saw it on Star Trek . )
In 1954 , Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt invented the sliding automatic door using a mat actuator .
They founded a company , Horton Automatics , that developed and sold the first automatic sliding door in America in 1960 .
With the advent of shopping malls , the automatic sliding door would become ideal .
After the invention of the motion sensor , automatic sliding doors would incorporate this technology for ease of implementation and better reliability .
The sliding doors on all the Star Trek series were operated manually off - screen through either a pulley - system or levers .
This was probably a cost - saving measure , but it was also required because the AI controlling the doors seemed as though it could read people ’s intentions .
The Nitpicker Guides by Phil Farrand for various Star Trek series point out various inconsistencies in how the doors seemed to work between various episodes .
These inconsistencies were due to the dramatic requirements of scenes .
For example , if a character exited a door and turned around to say something , how close to the door would the character have to be in order to keep the door open ?
( As an interesting side note , video games have to deal with these sorts of problems when triggering level changes at doorways . )
Even with having grips operating the Star Trek doors , there are many bloopers showing what happens when doors do n’t open rapidly enough .
This is a problem with real sliding doors in that you need to pause to allow the door to open ; though , you still have to pause to open a hinged door .
Sliding doors have n’t caught on in domestic homes .
I imagine the convenience is n’t worth the cost and potential hassle in breakdowns .
I guess sliding doors make more sense in stores where you ’re more likely to have your hands full .
I ’ve always thought that patio doors should be automatic for convenience sake .
Sliding and automatic doors have eliminated one more situation for chivalry as men no longer have to open doors for women .
( As another case , with cigarettes being banned everywhere , a man can no longer be chivalrous by lighting a woman ’s cigarette . )
The movie Doom had the concept of a nano - door , which I thought could be the future of doors .
Basically , with nano - technology , you could have a door composed of tiny nano - devices that could allow solid objects to move them aside and pass in between them .
To lock a door , you could set the nano - devices to be rigid .
In Doom , they were able to “ close ” a nano - door and have it solidify with a person , or monster , trapped as it was going through a door .
I ’m not sure if the idea in Doom was that the nano - devices would actually penetrate the trapped object and potentially kill it , but in my conception , a live creature would not die .
3. Tricorder
The tricorder is the omnipresent landing party device .
( I ’ve never thought about why the thing is called a tricorder .
The name seems to suggest that it does three things . )
The tricorder is somewhat equivalent to our Personal Data Assistants ( PDAs ) of today .
Only recently with the iPod Touch and BlackBerry Storm have PDAs evolved to have a monitor screen that is present on the tricorder .
( However , the tricorder screen does not appear to be flat . )
It is only a matter of time before PDAs have the sensory capabilities of the tricorder .
In 1983 , the CASIO PF - 3000 was released .
Although the term PDA would not be introduced until 1992 by Apple , this device is considered to be the first PDA .
In 1996 , Nokia introduced the first mobile phone with PDA functionality , the 9000 Communicator .
In 1995 , a Canadian company called Vital Technologies marketed a tricorder - like device .
The company had a licensing agreement with Paramount Pictures so it marketed the device as Tricorder Model TR - 107 Mark 1 .
The TR - 107 uses the design graphics of the TNG tricorder and somewhat resembles it , except the TR - 107 does n’t fold .
The TR - 107 measures temperature , pressure , light , color , and EMF !
It also had an expansion port for connecting other sensory devices .
( Oh , it also has a timer , clock and calendar . )
And it only cost $ 500 .
Its major advertising was done through Shreddies cereal boxes !
There was a half - price introductory sale , and I bought one .
( My serial number is 941 . )
I only used it to measure the EMF being emitted from my computer monitors .
I should check my cell phone to make sure it ’s not giving me brain cancer .
Anyway , the company went out of business after a year or two .
The addition of sensory capabilities into PDAs will make PDAs more indispensable .
Imagine being in a basement parking garage , and you hear a noise .
You could then whip out your PDA and scan for human life forms .
You would be able to detect any potential muggers in hiding , and take appropriate action !
Currently , PDAs with phone capability sell over 150 million units per year while non-phone ( “ stand-alone ” ) PDAs sell about 3 million units per year .
The BlackBerry boasts a subscriber base of over 14 million currently .
With the popularity of the iPod Touch introduced in September 2007 , I ’m guessing a promising future for the tricorder .
2. Large View Screen
The Enterprise ’s bridge view screen has become a reality in homes everywhere with big , wall - mounted , flat - screen televisions .
Jerry Seinfeld used to joke about the bridge view screen in his stand - up act .
Captain Kirk had the best seat in the house .
Star
Trek did n’t come up with the idea of a large view screen , but it popularized the notion by having one on the bridge of the Enterprise .
I think most spaceships depicted on film had windows with possibly metal shutters that covered the windows when they were n’t needed .
We never saw big screens used for recreational purposes on Star Trek , but television and film were n’t popular by Star Trek ’s time .
( The crew of Voyager did have a movie night , but I think it might have been instigated by Tom Paris , who had a fondness for the 20th century .
Also , on a long voyage home , they needed as much entertainment as they could find . )
Science fiction literature used big , wall - mounted , flat - screen televisions .
Ray Bradbury used the idea in Fahrenheit 451 , and even had screens taking up entire walls and the ceiling in The Veldt .
At that size , we ’re getting into holodeck territory .
I recently got a 50 ″ plasma television .
Everyone I know seemed to get a big screen television this past Christmas .
I wonder how large big screen televisions will get in homes .
Currently , the 50 ″ size is at the price point where anything larger results in a large jump in price .
I suppose a wall sized television would be nice , but I ’m not sure how convenient it would be to replace a broken wall .
Perhaps screens would be modular so that you could replace broken segments .
Deep Space
Nine had view screens that materialized in empty space between two side frames with emitters .
So you could technically walk through the view screen if it was at floor level .
This would solve the hassle of transporting a big screen television home .
And I ’m using the word “ transporting ” in the reality sense rather than the Star Trek sense of the word if you catch my meaning .
No more having to worry about keeping the screen upright during transport .
Holographic displays could replace view screens in the future , but I imagine there will be an option to flatten a 3 - D holographic display in space challenged environments .
1. Communicator
Cell phones are our communicators .
Having watched Star Trek , I guess I was blasÃ© about the introduction of cell phones .
It ’s amazing how we all take for granted this technology .
I do marvel that , beginning with military walkie - talkie sized cell phones , we were able to miniaturize cell phones to the size of communicators and even smaller than the ones on TOS .
TOS communicators had only 3 buttons with all the other functionality being voice activated , I guess .
They never showed anyone retrieving messages from a communicator .
I wonder how they got around the use of voice - mail in the future .
One feature that I ’m waiting to be available for cell phones is the option to set it to overload for use as an explosive device .
By the time of TNG , the communicator was incorporated into a brooch aka a comm badge .
This idea has been used for some hospital personnel .
Martin Cooper , who worked for Motorola and is acknowledged as the inventor of the cell phone , says that Star Trek ’s communicator was the inspiration behind the cell phone .
Cooper made the first call on a portable cell phone in April of 1973 .
Note that automobiles had mobile phones prior to this , but this was the first cell phone designed for use outside of an automobile .
Time was needed to set up the communication infrastructure and to deal with Federal Communications Commission rules .
By 1987 , there were over 1 million cell phone users .
To keep up with the increasing popularity of cell phones , manufacturers added features such as photo taking , internet access , GPS capabilities , and PDA functionality .
These advanced cell phones are called smartphones .
More and more people are dispensing with land line telephone service , and using their cell phones exclusively for talking to people over distances .
I recently had my land line disconnected .
I imagine cell phones make it harder for spouses to stay out of reach of each other .
So it ’s harder to cheat on a spouse nowadays .
Although I guess you can say that you forgot your cell phone somewhere , or cell phone reception was n’t possible at your location , orâ€ ¦
I hope you learned something from this Treknobabble , because I certainly did when I researched it .
As William Shatner stated in How William Shatner Changed the World , we are indeed living in a Star Trek world .
In the coming weeks , assuming Treknobabble does n’t get cancelled , you can look forward to “ Top 10 Star Trek Inventions Yet To Be Invented ” , “ Top 10 Inventions That Star Trek Failed To Foresee ” , and “ Top 10 Timeless Inventions As Seen In Star Trek ” .
( I ’m serious . )
The developer of an iPhone game had a nice surprise when it suddenly saw a surge in users .
The game had around ten downloads a day from iTunes , which inexplicably transformed into more than 400 users in a single day .
The reason - the game got cracked .
Read what happened when the developer confronted the cracker .
Whack ’em
All is a newish game for iPhone and iPod Touch , based on the ‘ Whack - a - Mole ’ idea .
The creators are married couple Constance and James Bossert , who together form Fairlady Media .
James told TorrentFreak
“ We decided to develop a game for the iPhone while driving one evening and over the next couple of months put Whack ’em All together in our spare time .
Altogether , its taken us about 250 hours to develop the game with about 100 hours worth of graphics work and 150 hours worth of development , bug testing and submitting the app to Apple . ”
The game is available for purchase via the iTunes App Store and has steadily been achieving around 10 sales a day .
It ’s pretty cheap , at just 99 cents .
On January 4th , Fairlady Media got all excited .
Suddenly they discovered they had over 400 brand new users in a day , but after checking with iTunes , disappointment set in .
Only 12 people had actually purchased the game .
It turned out that the surge was down to pirates – someone had cracked the game and offered it for free on the web .
While mildly encouraged that there is demand for the game , James told us he decided to confront the person responsible to “ try and figure out why there was such a strong market for pirated apps . ”
“ I ’m the developer for Whack ‘em All .
I noticed you ’re being given credit for cracking Whack ‘em All and making it generally available for free , ” he said in his opening email to the cracker .
“ We ( just my wife and I ) have n’t even made enough money off of this to pay for the iPhone we had to buy to develop it on .
Just yesterday 40 times more people got your version of the app than bought it off the app store ! ”
James told the cracker he was curious about his motives .
Surprisingly , the cracker responded :
“ As many iPhone and iPod touch owners have discovered , Apple ’s iTunes App Store has many flaws which render it useless to the common user , ” he replied .
“ Apple has chosen to allow a multitude of ridiculous , worthless , poorly - represented applications through its ‘ strict ’ screening process , nearly all written by mediocre programmers with a dream of getting rich quick .
Many of these programmers game the reviews system , misrepresent their application in the description , and generally try to swindle the honest buyer . ”
The cracker , known as most_uniQue , went on to say that people are fed up with wasting money on these type of applications , so they simply stopped buying them .
He then went on to offer a solution .
“ Apple could quite easily solve this problem by implementing a sort of trial period for each application , but they do not .
The user is forced to buy blindly without ever getting to try the application first . ”
most_uniQue told James that he became motivated to crack iPhone games after he bought a few that did n’t live up to their marketing hype , feeling he could help others ‘ try before they buy ’ .
“ To solve this problem either talk to Apple to allow trials , ” he said , “ or you can release your game on Cydia with ads . ”
James told TorrentFreak that he was happy with the extra exposure generated by the cracked copy of the game , while hoping this would translate into cash to be invested in the development of future projects .
The outcome of this exchange ?
“ My goal would be to get a response from Apple about this , ” he told us , while going on to reveal that a free , ad - supported version of the game ( and future games ) is in the planning .
It was suggested a while back on this blog by SitePoint ’s own Matthew Magain as to Why The 10 Commandments Of Web Design Are Complete Baloney .
In his post Matthew waxed lyrical about how content was realistically not that important to the designing of a web site .
To an extent he is right , but he is also wrong — yes , this is another classic case of web design not being black and white .
I ’m now going to put to you the case for why content is still more important than design .
Now we all know that design and content can mean different things to different people , so let ’s start with a few definitions :
Design : the final visual interface design , the high - fidelity design for the site , not the interactive design or information architecture design , as these are separate to the final visual design process .
the final visual interface design , the high - fidelity design for the site , not the interactive design or information architecture design , as these are separate to the final visual design process .
Content : this is about having an understanding of the content types and the information that is expected to be delivered .
Also to know what information the users are expecting to see from their previous experience .
It ’s not about having every last morsel of the copy for the site .
Just to be clear , I ’m also not discussing the separation of content and design in terms of the developmental process — that ’s an entirely different topic .
Design and the Small Site
When we design a small site , we are usually presented with a business direction and some functionality requirements , an idea of the audience , maybe a logo , or previous marketing material ( if we are lucky ) .
These are all good design starting points and sources of inspiration — there usually is n’t much content at this point .
The outlining of the site map for the site really just follows the generic “ products , about , contacts ” structure suited for brochure sites ; there is generally nothing unusual that will present any problem here .
And even if there is an issue , you can usually just add a high level item to the menu , after some consideration without much of a problem .
The detail of the content that is delivered later on may present a layout issue — for example , suppose you were suddenly presented with a series of short testimonials for insertion into a shopping cart site .
However , because you can design the main content area to be very open , genetic and modular , this issue can be easily accommodated for .
In this case , design is more important than the content .
But wait — what of larger sites ?
Content and the Larger Site
When we consider a larger corporate site , other than the basic design specification information ( as I ’ve elaborated on above ) there is also often a history of previous legacy designs , as well as a large amount of content both online or waiting to go online that needs to be considered .
It ’s at this point that the sheer volume of information starts to out weigh the design in the overall developmental process .
This information becomes the driving force behind the web site , and it is at this point that content becomes king over design .
Ideally we really need to consider the content ; I know this often is n’t possible on smaller sites , as demonstrated above .
However when it is taken into account I have found that it allows for a considerably more robust design of a site in terms of the positive user experience it delivers .
When I design a site , I really want the design to flow with the content to the point that they become seamless .
Sure , in reality that does n’t always happen — I know I have worked on sites in which I have forced content into a design that just does n’t suit the topic of the story or the conversation the site is having with the user .
When that happens , it ’s bad design , and it really needs to stop .
Understanding the content of a site completely before you begin any design allows you to glean a number of design elements that may not be specified , for example :
The number of navigational areas that will exist on any given page .
The width of the main menu buttons : if the information architecture is not complete , how else can you finalise the structure and labels ?
Any themes in the content that could be extended into the visual design , by the telling of a story or visual conversation with the user .
Requirements for any breakout content such as testimonials , side comments , explanations , definitions or the like .
The general length of the page coming from the amount of content that is going to be displayed .
The use of new media elements , such as video , screencasts , inline audio players and the like .
The length of the content title elements , and if you are going to expect them to wrap .
Mind you , you should be allowing for this anyway , as you have no control over the fine details in the future content .
The size and style of images : you really need to know if there are going to ever be large images , such as graphs , charts , or maps that often do n’t scale well as bitmap images ( JPGs , GIFs or PNGs ) .
Allowance for marketing adverts , product links or ad - hoc content .
Any other requirements for ad - hoc content , such as news items or emergency response information .
Without knowing any of this information you are just second guessing from your own experience the type of site the client and users really want represented in the design .
For instance , you could specify a minimum and maximum content area width size incorrectly , due to a requirement for the insertion of large maps on a section of the site .
In this example , without knowledge of the content , as soon as the client inserts the large maps , they ’re likely to suddenly find that the entire visual design breaks .
What of Content Management Solutions ?
In the corporate and government sectors it is common to have the majority of the design in place before the content is delivered .
This occurs when an enterprise level content management system ( CMS ) is used within the final solution .
These content management systems vary ; often only allow a reskinning of the base design template to complete layout customisation .
In a way it could be seen that a lot of the design decisions have been made for you with the CMS implementation .
Is n’t this design before content ?
No — in such a scenario , the content is known , as in most cases the majority of the information architecture will have been finished before the CMS implementation .
Having the IA completed means that a good deal of the design considerations will have been dealt with , as the information architecture looks in - depth at the content to design issues .
For any items that have not been covered off by the information architecture , I have often found , in the last few years , that the system design and development team for the CMS vendor have developed such a generic template design for the CMS that most of the design issues have been already taken into account .
This will of course vary from platform to platform .
Like it or Not , Design Does n’t Matter
Of course these points all become moot when you discover that users really do n’t care a great deal about the visual user interface elements as long as they can find the content .
Getting to the information is their primary goal .
Sure , they have to use the visual interface extensively to get to the information , even if it ’s an application .
At end of the day , though , they ’re only focused on one thing — the content .
If the content is poor or unfindable , they will leave , no matter how pretty the site is .
This is why getting the information architecture right is so important ; it ’s also why content is king .

To those people that tell you work is n’t life :
You will spend at least 2,080 hours per year working a full - time job in the United States
This equals 87 straight days working per year without a single break to eat , drink or sleep
If you begin working full time at age 18 and stop at 65 you ’ll spend 97,760 hours at work
Or we can look at this as only 4,073 continuous days without a break
To put this in perspective , at a child ’s eleventh birthday they ’ll have barely experienced 4,000 days
Factoring out sleep , we only have 242 days per year to be awake
This means you spend greater than 36 % of your waking time working
If we average 2 hours a day eating then we only have 212 days to call our own
And this increases our time spent working to greater than 41 %
The average time spent behind the wheel each day for Americans is 87 minutes
If we consider this part of your work day , then you are at work for 45 % of your time
Each year you will work :
460 hours ( 57 work days ) more then a peasant in 13th century England
716 hours ( 90 work days ) more then an average worker in Germany
1456 hours ( 182 work days ) more then the !
Kung Bushman ( a group of hunters and gatherers )
Anyone that says work is not life is asking you to waste half of your life .
Make every minute on this planet valuable .
Find what you love to do and share your passion with the world .
When all you read is gloom , turn here for a much different perspective .
So in the last 15 years the relationship between femininity and sexuality ( never straight - forward ) has become increasingly problematic .
While I was busy watching cartoons and playing with action figures with my kids , the role of women and girls within the narrative of twenty - first - century American identity became publicly sexualized in a way that makes me feel old .
I tend to think of girls in terms of daughters , and having missed most of the 90s ( busy with Tom & Jerry – I love animated violence as much as my sons ) , I never knew Steven Tyler had made a video with his daughter , Liv. Somehow I ’d never even heard the song , but I watched Crazy with my friends on Youtube a while back .
Wow !
He had his 16 - year - old daughter work the pole to the lame music of his old , pervy - looking friends ?
On MTV ?
Who thought this was a good idea ?
More recently , I read a story in the Huffington Post on Britney Spears .
No longer hovering on the brink of a complete break - down , she is getting in shape and on the come - back .
Britney ’s father guides the now slimmer and more photogenic popstar through her apparent recovery .
But his description of her , and all of us daughters , struck me as sad and odd .
In commenting on the new - found closeness with Britney , he said that “ like all daughters , she is very manipulative and cunning . ”
Really ?
You mean she ’s not just all fucked up because you and the rest of her family promoted an unreal and exaggeratedly sexualized image of her body instead of insisting she develop her consciousness beyond childlike narcissism ?
Anyway , my goal here is not to join the chorus of Britney analysts , since Matt Stone and Trey Parker have said all perfectly and completely , but instead to explore where we women fit in the here and now , and how this generation of daughters can understand their identities .
What do we expect all the daughters to become ?
Of course fathers who feature their daughters pole - dancing in their music videos , or work from the assumption that all girls ( however damaged and / or ill - prepared ) cunningly deceive , are merely convenient caricatures of a popular culture that devours daughters .
But what really are the options ?
I propose that our girls face an impossible and irreconcilable triangle of choices .
Simultaneous and contradictory constructions of femininity bombard girls and women with unachievable and paradoxical standards of beauty , sexuality , success , validation and power .
When you boil it all down ( and omit crone , sorry Grandma ) we have three overlapping , yet ill - fitting options for our daughters : virgin , mother , and whore .
The paradox is immediately clear .
A woman cannot simultaneously be a virgin , a mother and a whore .
But the idea that a successful woman must be at least two out of the three is pervasive in modern society .
Ubiquitous advertising images reflect the widespread cultural emphasis on physical perfection and sexiness in the way we view and judge our girls and ourselves .
At the same time , purity and virginity are celebrated in churches , schoolrooms , and in charity programs all over the country .
This juxtaposition of expectations and instincts – purity and sexiness – has been explored in depth in literature and movies , but usually through a lens of masculine lust .
In a format that lays Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus , Bratz dolls , S & M Barbie and pole - dancing exercise videos alongside of Female Genital Mutilation ( FGM ) , Burkas , Hijabs , and the lucrative , if doomed , Abstinence - Only sex-ed and international AIDS programs , the relationship between purity and sexiness seems hopelessly contradictory .
Daughters navigate a treacherous path .
They are expected to be virgins , but suspected ( and encouraged ? ) to be cunning , manipulative and , ultimately , whorish – if not by a stage - father , than by a society awash in celebratory images of sexy daughters .
The virgin - whore construction is only one angle of the impossible triangle .
Both the other dual relationships involve women ’s roles as mother .
I should have saved “ ubiquitous ” for mothers because everyone has / had one to blame .
Mothers prop up the republic , birth and raise the next generation in the midst of hardship , and serve as the conscious of the people in times of extreme repression .
Many little girls ( presumably little virgins and future whores ) expect to grow up and become mothers .
A steady percentage of women in the US remain childless , but those who do usually have a well - worn explanation ready for conversations .
It ’s the social norm .
Maternal iconography attests to the timeless narrative of the cosmic womb and the depth of meaning attached to feminine fertility .
How do mothers fit with virgins and whores ?
Why force motherhood into this uncomfortable triangle with obviously contradictory feminine characteristics like chastity and promiscuity ?
Well , people do like the mothers of their saviors and kings to be virgins .
Mary and Isis were both virgins , as were the mothers of Buddha , Mithras , and Montezuma I .
This seems like a Jungian example of collective human mythology to me , unless all the women were hermaphrodites who had both male and female reproductive organs .
Either way , the virgin - mother is a popular construction that reflects ways we find meaning in our lives .
Mothers are great , but the really important ones should be sexually pure .
Kings and Messiahs come from unsullied vaginas .
Of course in real life , virgins can’t have babies unless they have sex first and just lie about it .
And this is where the paradox again becomes messy .
If our daughters are forced to live on the narrow border between virgin and whore that is presented to them in our society , than would n’t motherhood ( or some version of it ) be a potential outcome ?
Sex is often reproductive , if accidentally so , and for whatever reason reproduction takes a toll on women .
Having babies , using birth control , and getting abortions ( while hilarious when Sarah Silverman does it ) has a spectrum of personal , physical , emotional and economic consequences .
From the pill to planned parenthood , reproductive choices are part of almost every woman ’s life .
Few forms of birth control are ideal , as they are invasive , alter hormone levels , or put too great a burden on the female partner .
Abortion divides our society over false positions , pitting unreal “ do you want fries with that abortion ” attitudes against judgmental pro-lifers who , although riddled with their own metastasizing sin , throw the first stones .
Abortion , and the surrounding debates , also reveals the confusion over whom and what a mother should be in modern times .
Are we free to be what we want to be ?
Do we have agency over our bodies and ourselves ?
Or are we responsible for the safety and character of the next generation ?
Both ?
What would we do with the million or so extra babies that would be born if they were n’t aborted anyway ?
Are we really that into them ?
And who is lining up to assure women that motherhood is a preferable option ?
Does Sarah Palin really loves babies once they have exited the womb , or just her own self - righteous power to control the intimate and at times tragic decicions of others ?
For ordinary women , those not giving birth to kings and gods , motherhood has always been a risky endeavor .
Even today , motherhood puts one at a disadvantage .
Refugee camps teem with women and their children , not men and their families .
Social justice and reproductive rights are limited and denied throughout the world , and as a result women become less economically secure and mothers become increasingly vulnerable .
Here in the US , mothers have WIC , Head Start , foodstamps , public schools and school lunches .
In many western European countries , motherhood is treated like a public good , and rewarded monetarily .
Mothers in third - world countries often have no safety - nets , and even those who are n’t feeding their starving children dirt - cakes in Haiti , or fleeing Soviet invasion in Georgia , live with material uncertainty .
A mother ’s right to material security is often associated with her virtue .
A mother - whore shames the family , the community , the nation .
The patriarchy is threatened by nothing if not uncertainty over who may have fertilized the eggs .
The welfare queen condemned in Reagan ’s speech , the crack whore on COPS with nine children , the baby mama humiliated on Jerry Springer , and the adulteress stoned to death by the righteous – they all got what they had coming .
That far corner of the triangle makes neighbors gossip , children cringe , and men unite .
The mother - whore has no political , moral , economic or social capital .
Within the patriarchal structure that we all accept to one degree or another , women who are judged to be mother - whores can be laid low , neglected , and forced into poverty and cycles of violence .
So what will become of a generation of virgin - whores who grow up to be mothers ?
Has femininity been so redefined in the twenty - first century that seventeen and eighteen - year - olds can Go Wild every spring break , little girls can get stripper dolls for Christmas , and porn can be dirty and commonplace ?
Maybe humans are in the midst of a radical redefinition of gender norms and expectations .
Maybe when our daughters return from their service in Iraq and Afghanistan they will have only stories of egalitarianism , security and empowerment .
Maybe motherhood is on the brink of legitimacy as a civic contribution .
Perhaps the world our daughters must engage will encourage them to choose from a variety of feminine models – Sarah Silverman ’s singing vagina , my beautiful lesbian cousins , pundits , adventurers , vagabonds or minstrels .
But I fear the opposite .
I fear that we have forced our daughters into a double ( or even triple ) bind , no - win situation .
Allowed to enjoy neither chastity nor free love , inured to a culture that celebrates their degradation , and chasing the unachievable , our daughters may end up looking like anonymous Spears girls – not cunning and manipulative ( if only ! ) but dumpy and disappointed virgin - mother - whores who society has permission to screw , humiliate , and abandon .
In danger of being tricked into bartering their innocence and sexuality for the impossible modern female ideal , our daughters must be inoculated against destructive behavior and harmful expectations en masses .
Sort of like Gardasil , but instead requiring a complete cultural revolution , a robust examination of power and gender relationships , and a global commitment to both social justice and a moral , sustainable economy .
Until then , I guess I would keep them ugly – thick glasses , baggy clothes , no braces or acne medicine ( or nose and / or boob jobs – what the FUCK were you thinking mothers ? )
I would also go for girls - only private schools .
But then luckily , I only have sons .

So shame , which rightly belongs to the rebellious human will , gets deflected to the genitals , and every fig leaf so strategically placed reinforces the deflection .
Our sexual organs become pudenda , literally “ the shameful parts . ”
It ’s curious that this term is more often used to describe women ’s anatomy .
Consider , for instance , Masaccio ’s great Expulsion from the Garden of Eden : Adam bends forward in grief , his hands covering his eyes — but the eyes of the two , once opened , ca n’t truly be closed — and his penis clearly visible .
This is intentional : we see him from the right , with his left foot forward .
Had Masaccio placed the right foot forward , our view would have been blocked .
But we see Eve ’s wailing face clearly , because her right hand covers her breasts , her left her vulva , which is partly obscured anyway by her right leg .
She and Adam are out of step .
Adam ’s posture suggests that he does not want to see , Eve ’s that she does not want to be seen , though no one could be looking , as the angel with the flaming sword hovers behind them .
Everything in their portrayal suggests that they feel two different shames .
Adam ’s is closer to the Biblical account , Eve’s to the Augustinian shifting of responsibility to the genitals , the pudenda .
If Adam ’s shame comports with the Genesis narrative , Masaccio ’s overall depiction seems not to , since we are told that God clothed them in “ skin coats ” before he dismissed them from their Garden .
But Masaccio restores them to the moment they discovered their nakedness , thus telescoping the story , emphasizing the connection between exposure and expulsion .
Some centuries later , one of the Medicis ordered fig leaves painted onto the bodies of Masaccio ’s Adam and Eve , though presumably not out of a concern for Biblical fidelity .
It became common to correct the artists of the Renaissance in this way : some of the classical statuary at the Vatican was similarly covered , and when the Duke of Tuscany presented Queen Victoria with a plaster replica of Michaelangelo ’s David in 1857 ( cast from the original ) , she immediately gave the thing to the South Kensington Museum — now the Victoria & Albert — whose authorities in turn commissioned a fig leaf to give the Biblical hero proper coverage .
As V&A documents tell the story , the plaster leaf “ was then kept in readiness for any royal visits , when it was hung on the figure using two strategically placed hooks . ”
Today , David has regained his original nudity , but the leaf has been preserved : it sits in its own case just behind the statue , which is a good thing , for the leaf is a fine piece of work , elegantly formed .
We all know , or think we know , about “ Victorian prudishness , ” but even as we smile we should remember to distinguish the link between sex and sin from the link between nudity and shame .
The former was not created by Augustine , but he is our primary source for it , and he forged that link so strongly that for many centuries it has been hard to see the nude Adam and Eve without thinking Augustinian thoughts .
It might never occur to us that the miserable pair could be ashamed not of their organs ’ connection with sex but rather with the elimination of waste .
( In some cultures this is a far more private matter than sex . )
But if we could purge all such Augustinian assumptions from our minds , we would still be left , I think , with some discomfort — or , the story suggests , that ’s what we should feel .
How do we experience the nakedness of our First Parents ?
To take an oddly echoing episode from later in Genesis that clearly has no sexual context :
Are we like Ham , the son of Noah , who not only looked upon his father ’s nakedness as the old man lay drunk in his tent but also told his brothers about it ?
Do we , like Ham , experience no sense that Noah ’s nakedness was shameful , no desire to cover him and restore him to decency ?
Or would we be like Ham ’s brothers , who turned their heads away as they covered Noah and thereby saved him from further shame ?
The text says that when Noah awoke he “ knew what his youngest son had done to him . ”
We think , done to him ?
What have we done to Adam and Eve by looking upon their nakedness ?
Yet for his impudence Ham was cursed .
W. H. Auden , thinking of statues and saints , wrote that “ The blessed will not care what angle they are regarded from , / Having nothing to hide . ”
But we are not among the blessed ; like Adam and Eve and Noah , we have much to hide , much that we would not have exposed .
And nudity , while it can stand for many other human conditions — innocence , blessedness , desire — remains our strongest image of that exposure , that shame .
1 Said : " So help me God . "
The phrase is not required by the constitution , so it 's arguable that he , Barack Obama , was president by the time he said it , making these his first words in office .
2 Delivered a 17 - minute inauguration address , telling the crowds it was time to " pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America " .
3 Invoked biggest cheer of the day from the 2 million - plus crowd with the words : " Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real .
They are serious and they are many ...
But know this , America - they will be met . "
4 Then the words : " We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals . "
George Bush , sitting to his left , looks decidedly uncomfortable .
5 With his wife , Michelle , escorted George and Laura Bush to the waiting helicopter , where the two men hugged before the former president began his journey home to Texas .
6 As the helicopter disappeared into clear skies , Obama now had Washington , and the United States , all to himself .
His relief was palpable .
7 Inside the Capitol building , signed his first documents as president , including cabinet nominations .
8 " I 'm a lefty .
Get used to it , " he said , as he signed .

His seal .
18 Took his position in the reviewing stand outside the White House , to watch 40 bands and other groups parade past , including the World Famous Lawn Rangers from Illinois , who pushed decorated lawn mowers .
19 Tried out that salute , as cadets marched by .
Not bad , though he needs to keep his hand straight .
20 Instructed military prosecutors to seek a 120 - day halt to legal proceedings involving detainees at Guantánamo Bay .
21 Issued an order instructing government agencies to halt all pending regulations signed by Bush - a way of combating efforts by the outgoing administration to force through last - minute changes without congressional approval .
22 Danced with Michelle to Beyonce 's rendition of At Last , by Etta James , as the opening dance of the Neighbourhood Ball .
23 Appeared to step on the train of Michelle 's custom - designed gown by Jason Wu , but otherwise showed himself to be a decent dancer .
24 Gave a brief interview to ABC News , whose reporter said : " Mr President - sounds good , does n't it ? "
" It 's got a certain ring to it , " he replied .

The couple looked increasingly exhausted as the evening progressed , and sped up their appearances , ending the night ahead of schedule .
34 Back to White House at 12.55 am to spend his first night there .
35 The Obamas slept in the master bedroom in the private residence on the first floor of the White House .
Their daughters , Malia and Sasha , who were treated to a treasure hunt by White House staff on their first evening culminating with a surprise visit by their favourite music act the Jonas Brothers , slept in bedrooms over the corridor once occupied by Amy Carter , Tricia Nixon , Luci Johnson and Caroline Kennedy .
36 Four hours of sleep and he was up and at it on his first full day .
Lights were reported in the private residence at 5 am .

He has daily 45 - minute gym sessions .
38 Spent his first 10 minutes alone in the Oval Office .
39 Got to sit for the first time behind the Resolute desk , a gift from Queen Victoria to America in 1880 .
40 Read the letter that Bush had left for him , according to tradition , in the top drawer of the desk , marked : " To # 44 , From # 43 " .
Its contents have not been revealed .
41 Discussed the day 's events with his chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel .

55 Witnessed the swearing - in of about 50 senior members of White House staff .
56 Told his top team that " transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency " .
57 Biden made a joke about Chief Justice Roberts 's flubbing of the presidential oath as he prepared to lead the swearing in .
Obama did not look amused .
Was this one transparency too far ?
58 Personally greeted each of the newly sworn - in staff .
59 Obama hosted an " open house " in the White House for 200 people who had been granted tickets on a first - come , first - served basis ; some were in tears .

62 Met economic advisors to discuss his stimulus package , which could be worth $ 900bn .
63 Re-swore the oath of office in the White House Map Room out of an " abundance of caution " .
Or alternatively as a way of killing off the storm of right - wing agitprop that has been tearing through the internet suggesting that the first botched attempt at the oath means Obama is not rightfully president .
64 This time they got it right .
Roberts asked " Are you ready to take the oath ? "
Obama replied : " I am , and we 're going to do it very slowly . "
65 " We decided it was so much fun . "
Obama joked to reporters after the event .
" The bad news ... is there 's 12 more balls . "

73 Released statement on the 36th anniversary of the landmark Roe v Wade supreme court judgment , reaffirming his commitment to protecting abortion rights .
74 To applause , signed executive order requiring the closure of the military prison at Guantánamo within one year .
75 Obama said : " The message we are sending around the world is that the United States intends to prosecute the ongoing struggle against violence and terrorism ... and we are going to do so in a manner that is consistent with our values and our ideals . "
Was Bush watching on TV at home in Dallas cringing ?
76 Signed second executive order requiring the closure of the CIA 's network of secret overseas prisons , and making a commitment to not using torture in interrogations .
77 Signed third executive order establishing an interagency taskforce on detainees , including Hillary Clinton and the defence secretary , Robert Gates , to decide what to do with the remaining Guantánamo inmates .
78 Signed directive to delay proceedings in the case of Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , currently awaiting a hearing at the supreme court , so that the president 's team can review it .
Marri is accused of being an al - Qaida sleeper agent .
79 Visited the state department , where Clinton had earlier made an introductory address to staff .
80 Watched , with impassive face , as Clinton said that she had appointed two special envoys to world trouble zones .
The appointments had previously been billed as Obama 's own .
Was this a taste of rivalry to come ?
81 Endured second gaffe by his vice - president in a week .
Biden stepped into the tension between Obama and Clinton , saying at first that the president would announce the envoys and then hurriedly saying Clinton would present them .
82 Clinton got to name George Mitchell , the former Senate majority leader and Irish peace negotiator , as special envoy to the Middle East peace process .
Obama later claimed him as his envoy .
Who is in charge here ?
83 Clinton named the former UN ambassador Richard Holbrooke as special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Obama later names him as his envoy .
Bully to you , secretary of state !
84 Called on Hamas to end its rocket fire into Israel , and for Israel to " complete the withdrawal of its forces from Gaza " , adding that Gaza 's borders should be opened to humanitarian aid .
85 Paid brief surprise visit to the White House press area , startling journalists .
" Good to see you guys .
I just wanted to make sure that I had a chance to say hello , " he said .
" I gotta say , it 's smaller than I thought . "
86 Observing that CNN and Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News had adjacent booths , he likened them to the goal for Israel and the Palestinians : " Living side by side in peace and security , " he noted .
87 Slight tetchiness entered the proceedings when a reporter asked a serious question about his nomination of a former lobbyist as number two at the Pentagon .
" I can't come in and shake hands if I 'm gonna get grilled every time , " Obama said .

96 The Obamas had a choice of possible entertainments to round off their week .
The choicest of all , most past presidents agree , is the private theatre , where they can watch Hollywood films before they are put on general release .

There is no way Obama would miss his work - out on a Saturday .
98 Finally , a chance to take in the White House and its grounds at a slightly more relaxed tempo .
The Obamas have said they will continue to spend weekends in their Chicago home , but this weekend is likely to be a time for acclimatising in their new residence .

Interesting trade - off :
The FBI has been forced to transfer agents from its counter - terrorism divisions to work on Bernard Madoff ’s alleged $ 50 billion fraud scheme as victims of the biggest scam in the world continue to emerge .
The Freakonomics blog discusses this :
This might lead you to ask an obvious counter - question :
Has the anti-terror enforcement since 9/11 in the U.S. helped fuel the financial meltdown ?
That is , has the diversion of resources , personnel , and mindshare toward preventing future terrorist attacks — including , you ’d have to say , the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq — contributed to a sloppy stewardship of the financial industry ?
It quotes a New York Times article :
Federal officials are bringing far fewer prosecutions as a result of fraudulent stock schemes than they did eight years ago , according to new data , raising further questions about whether the Bush administration has been too lax in policing Wall Street .
Legal and financial experts say that a loosening of enforcement measures , cutbacks in staffing at the Securities and Exchange Commission , and a shift in resources toward terrorism at the F.B.I. have combined to make the federal government something of a paper tiger in investigating securities crimes .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Snipers or assassins could be spotted in their nests before even firing a shot thanks to laser surveillance technology to be unveiled in Britain Tuesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
European and U.S. companies are accelerating research into a anti-sniper defenses in response to threats in Afghanistan and Iraq and at home -- but most systems use acoustic or thermal sensors that depend on waiting for the first shot .
An alternative developed by the European aerospace group EADS aims to warn of attack and pinpoint the sniper before he pulls the trigger by bouncing light off his telescopic sight .
“ It is the same principle as ‘ cat ’s eyes ’ in the middle of the road , ” said Peter Talbot - Jones , research team leader at EADS Innovation Works at Newport in Wales .
‘ Cat ’s eyes ’ behave like the retina of a cat by reflecting light from a car ’s headlamps to illuminate lines on the road .
Resembling a speed radar on a tripod , the ELLIPSE unit sweeps a protected zone with laser beams .
These are reflected back off any lens they hit .
A processor then distinguishes the signature of a sniper ’s sight from that of , say , a camera lens .
“ We aim to use a sniper ’s technology against him , ” said Talbot - Jones , who served with British forces in Afghanistan , where ex-Soviet Dragunov sniper rifles are readily available .
If several machines are deployed around a dignitary at a political rally or in a sports stadium , the position of a sniper could be revealed as soon as the sight is spotted by “ triangulation , ” the technique used in GPS satellite navigation .
Harmless reflections from photographic lenses and binoculars would be identified and discarded , Talbot - Jones said .
For years , detecting snipers depended on the type of sleuth work depicted in Hollywood thrillers -- figuring out where a military marksman or lone wolf killer might try to hide .
Only recently has technology begun to tip the balance .
Britain ’s QinetiQ recently launched a palm - sized device called EARS to locate sniper fire through acoustics .
EADS , which stumbled on its optical technique through anti-missile research , hopes to present its idea to the hosts of London ’s 2012 Olympics as a way of shielding dignitaries .
The civil threat from snipers revives sensitive memories of past assassinations such as that of U.S. President John F. Kennedy , a week before Barack Obama is due to be sworn in amid tight security as the first African American U.S. president .
Colorado police last year arrested three men and seized sniper equipment over a suspected plot to kill Obama , but later said they did not pose a serious threat .
The EADS project reflects defense firms ’ efforts to diversify into security amid pressure on military budgets .
IN A cramped makeshift theatre in Istanbul , a Kurd in a purple dress titillates the audience with the story of how he was born a man but found he was a woman .
During her act , Esmeray wields a sharp tongue to expose the systematic violence faced by fellow transvestites .
“ I am a Kurd , a transvestite and a feminist , so I am screwed all round , ” she says .

Human - rights groups say hundreds of transvestites are detained , beaten , tortured or sexually abused every year .
Many are driven into prostitution .
“ They are seen as the lowest of the low and face more police brutality than any other group , ” says Eren Keskin , a human - rights lawyer .
And when anyone has dared to file a complaint , she adds , “ not a single policeman has been convicted . ”
Turkey is said to have more transvestites per head than anywhere bar Brazil .
Fascination with cross-dressing dates to Ottoman times , when winsome boys dressed as girls would belly - dance for the sultan .
But , just as tolerance of Christians and Kurds withered under Ataturk 's republic , so it did for transvestites and gays .
The success of a few transvestite singers disguises the “ general acceptance in Turkish society that we are freaks , ” says Funda , a transvestite dancer .
Same - sex relations are not banned in Turkey .
But like America , it bans gays and cross - dressing men from the army .
Yet to win exemption from mandatory military service , they must prove their sexual orientation .
A Human Rights
Watch report notes that this can involve “ abusive and intrusive anal examinations ” , and adds that many are forced into psychiatric treatment because they are deemed to be mentally ill .
Such abuses have drawn rebukes from the European Union .
Emboldened by EU - inspired reforms , gays are starting to speak up .
In June Istanbul hosted the country 's biggest gay pride parade , with hundreds of unfazed riot police looking on .
The parade featured veiled transvestites protesting against the ban on Islamic - style headscarves at universities .
A vocal band of pious women is now fighting discrimination against cross-dressing compatriots .
This alliance is just one example of Turkey 's unusual mix of Islam and democracy .
The government is not so liberal .
The interior ministry is said to be behind efforts to disband Lambda , an advocacy outfit , because it is sowing immoral values .
An Istanbul court has ruled against Lambda , which is now appealing .
And Esmeray is battling against two policemen who allegedly punched and kicked her as she was walking home in June 2007 .
The men are to appear in court next March on charges of causing her bodily harm .
“ Justice is slow , but it will come , ” she vows .
Obama : Gitmo Likely Wo n't Close in First 100 Days
" It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realize , " Obama says .
Jan. 11 , 2009  -- President - elect Barack Obama said this weekend that he does not expect to close Guantanamo Bay in his first 100 days in office .
" I think it 's going to take some time and our legal teams are working in consultation with our national security apparatus as we speak to help design exactly what we need to do , " Obama said in an exclusive " This Week " interview with George Stephanopoulos , his first since arriving in Washington .
" It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realize , " the president - elect explained .
" Part of the challenge that you have is that you have a bunch of folks that have been detained , many of whom may be very dangerous who have not been put on trial or have not gone through some adjudication .
And some of the evidence against them may be tainted even though it 's true .
And so how to balance creating a process that adheres to rule of law , habeas corpus , basic principles of Anglo - American legal system , by doing it in a way that does n't result in releasing people who are intent on blowing us up . "
But Obama said unequivocally that it will close .
" I do n't want to be ambiguous about this .
We are going to close Guantanamo and we are going to make sure that the procedures we set up are ones that abide by our Constitution .
That is not only the right thing to do but it actually has to be part of our broader national security strategy because we will send a message to the world that we are serious about our values . "
Obama said that he is not ruling out prosecution for crimes committed by the Bush administration and left open the possibility of appointing a special prosecutor or commission to independently investigate abuses of power and illegal activity .
Obama 's comments came in response to the most popular question on his own Web site , www.change.gov, which has received 23,000 votes on the " Open for Questions " portion of the site .
Bob Fertik of New York who runs the Democrats.com
Web site asks Obama , " Will you appoint a special prosecutor -- ideally Patrick Fitzgerald -- to independently investigate the gravest crimes of the Bush administration , including torture and warrantless wiretapping ? "
" We 're still evaluating how we 're going to approach the whole issue of interrogations , detentions , and so forth .
And obviously we 're going to be looking at past practices and I do n't believe that anybody is above the law . "
Obama said .
" But my instinct is for us to focus on how do we make sure that moving forward we are doing the right thing .
That does n't mean that if somebody has blatantly broken the law , that they are above the law .
But my orientation 's going to be to move forward . "
When pressed by Stephanopoulos as to whether he will instruct his Justice Department to investigate such accusations , Obama deferred to his nominated attorney general , Eric Holder .
" When it comes to my attorney general he is the people 's lawyer ...
His job is to uphold the Constitution and look after the interests of the American people , not to be swayed by my day - to - day politics .
So , ultimately , he 's going to be making some calls , but my general belief is that when it comes to national security , what we have to focus on is getting things right in the future , as opposed to looking at what we got wrong in the past . "
Obama criticized Vice President Dick Cheney for his public defense of " extraordinary " interrogation methods .
" Vice President Cheney I think continues to defend what he calls extraordinary measures or procedures when it comes to interrogations and from my view waterboarding is torture , " Obama said .
" I have said that under my administration we will not torture . "
When asked if he plans to require that every government interrogation program be under the same standard and in accordance with the Army Field Manuel , Obama said , " My general view is that our United States military is under fire and has huge stakes in getting good intelligence .
And if our top army commanders feel comfortable with interrogation techniques that are squarely within the boundaries of rule of law , our constitution and international standards , then those are things that we should be able to . "
Obama on the Economy : The Grand Bargain
The incoming president admitted that fixing the economy over the long - term will involve sacrifice from every American and scaling back on some of his campaign promises .
" Everybody is going to have to give .
Everybody is going to have to have some skin in the game , " Obama said .
George Stephanopoulos ' interview with President - elect Barack Obama kicks off ABC News ' week - long series on the economy , " America 's Economy : What 's the Fix ? "
" These are going to be major challenges .
And we 're going to have to make some tough choices ...
So what our challenge is going to be is identifying what works and putting more money into that , eliminating things that do n't work , and making things that we have more efficient .
I 'm not suggesting , George , I want to be realistic here , not everything that we talked about during the campaign are we going to be able to do on the pace that we had hoped . "
When pressed by Stephanopoulos and asked if he was " Really talking about over the course of your presidency some kind of a grand bargain ... where everybody in the country is going to have to sacrifice something , accept change for the greater good ? "
Obama simply said , " Yes . "
On when such sacrifices would be expected , Obama said , " Right now I 'm focused on a pretty heavy lift , which is making sure that we get that reinvestment and recovery package in place .
But what you describe is exactly what we 're going to have to do . "
" What we have to do is to take a look at our structural deficit , how are we paying for government , what are we getting for it , how do we make the system more efficient ? "
Obama on the Economy : " We Can Fix This "
Viewer questions for Obama came in by the thousands prior to the interview , the overwhelming majority of which focused on the economy .
When asked if he feels he will be able to repair the economy , Obama said , " I think we can fix this .
But it 's going to take some time .
It 's not going to happen overnight . "
" It 's going to take some time to fix it .
But what we tried to do was put forward a plan that says ' let 's act boldly , let 's act swiftly . '
Let 's not only provide a jumpstart to the economy and immediately or save 3 million jobs , but let 's also put a down payment on some of the structural problems that we have in our economy , " he said .
Obama has received some pushback on the tax break portion of his economic stimulus package , particularly the effectiveness of business tax cuts in stimulating economic growth and job creation .
Sen .
Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , expressed concerns that Obama 's plan amounted to " trickle - down " economics .
" Well , let 's look at the package as a whole .
The bulk of the package is direct government spending ...
Now there is no doubt that that probably gives you the most bang for the buck in terms of stimulus , in terms of getting the economy started , putting people back to work , " he said .
" But there are only so many projects that you can do quickly of that sort .
And so then the question becomes , do tax cuts also provide a stimulus ?
Do they also help ?
And they may not help as much as some of the direct spending projects do , but they still provide a stimulus , especially if they are targeted towards people who are really in need . "
But the president - elect also reiterated " our general philosophy .... is we do n't have pride of authorship . "
" There are a couple of basic principles that I laid out .
We 've got to move quickly .
We 've got to make sure that any investments that we make have good long - term benefits for the economy , not just short - term .... but , if people have better ideas on certain provisions , if they say , you know , this is going to work better than that , then we welcome that .
And so we 're going to have a collaborative , consultative process with Congress over the next few days .
But what we can't do is get involved in the typical partisan wrangling or pet project , you know , bartering that takes place . "
But red flags have already been raised over " pet projects . "
Obama responded to criticism surrounding funding for a planned Museum of Organized Crime in Las Vegas explaining , " let 's be clear , that was a project that was proposed as part of the mayors ' project .
The country 's mayors put together ... a range of projects we can do , we did n't include that . "
When pressed if he would want such projects funded , Obama reiterated , " I think that what we have to do is evaluate whether or not these are projects that , as I said , are going to provide long - term benefits to the economy . "
" In a package of this magnitude , will there end up being certain projects that potentially do n't meet that criteria of helping on health care , energy , or education ?
Certainly .
But what we do n't want is this thing to be a Christmas tree loaded up with a whole bunch of pet projects that people have for their local communities . "
While the President - elect has made it clear that the economic recovery package is his top priority , the timeline for passing such large legislation remains unclear .
Obama has said he wants it done by Presidents Day weekend .
" We 're not trying to jam anything down people 's throats , " he said .
" Here 's what we know though , that the sooner a recovery and reinvestment package is in place , the sooner we can start turning the economy around .
We can't afford three , four , five , six more months where we 're losing half a million jobs per month . "
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi dialed up the pressure on Congress earlier in the week , warning that that there will be no break for the Presidents '
Day holiday if the package is not completed by then .
TARP Funding For Foreclosures ?
On Capitol Hill , the debate continues over the use of the second half of the $ 700 billion bailout provided under TARP .
Obama weighed in on how the remaining $ 350 billion in rescue funds should be spent .
" I think that when you look at how we have handled the home foreclosure situation and whether we 've done enough in terms of helping families on the ground who may have lost their homes because they lost their jobs or because they got sick , we have n't done enough there , " he said .
In response to Chair of the House Financial Services Rep. Barney Frank 's proposal to put $ 50 billion of the remaining funds towards preventing foreclosures , Obama said , " What I 've done is asked my team to come together , come up with a set of principles around how we are going to maintain transparency , what are we going to do in terms of housing , how are we going to target small businesses that are under an enormous business crunch ? "
" Let 's lay out very specifically some of the things that we are going to do with the next $ 350 billion of money .
And I think that we can gain -- regain the confidence of both Congress and the American people that this is not just money that is being given to banks without any strings attached and nobody knows what happens , but rather that it is targeted very specifically at getting credit flowing again to businesses and families . "
Obama Speaks
Out on Gaza
Obama spoke out against criticism for his relative silence on the conflict in Gaza and defended his assertion that , when it comes to national security , " we cannot have two administrations at the same time simultaneously sending signals in a volatile situation . "
But he added that his team is preparing to get involved once he takes office .
" What I am doing right now is putting together the team so that on Jan. 20th , starting on day one , we have the best possible people who are going to be immediately engaged in the Middle East peace process as a whole .
That are going to be engaging with all of the actors there .
That will work to create a strategic approach that ensures that both Israelis and Palestinians can meet their aspirations , " Obama said .
The president - elect stood by his comments last July made on a trip to Israel that " If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I 'm going to do everything in my power to stop that .
I would expect Israelis to do the same thing . "
When asked if he would say the same in Israel today , Obama said , " I think that 's a basic principle of any country is that they 've got to protect their citizens . "
Comparing his approach to the Middle East to that of previous administrations , Obama suggested that he will not be making a clean break from the Bush policy .
" I think that if you look not just at the Bush administration , but also what happened under the Clinton administration , you are seeing the general outlines of an approach . "
Earlier in the week , Vice President Cheney told Obama that , " Before you start to implement your campaign rhetoric you need to sit down and find out precisely what it is we did and how we did it .
Because it is going to be vital to keeping the nation safe and secure in the years ahead and it would be a tragedy if they threw over those policies simply because they 've campaigned against them . "
" I think that was pretty good advice , " said Obama .
" I should know what 's going on before we make judgments and that we should n't be making judgments on the basis of incomplete information or campaign rhetoric . "
On the broader outlook for the Middle East , Obama reiterated his belief that " Iran is going to be one of our biggest challenges ...
And we are going to have to take a new approach .
And I 've outlined my belief that engagement is the place to start .
The international community is going to be taking cues from us in how we want to approach Iran . "
Since winning the election , Obama has become privy to classified daily intelligence briefings .
" We have made progress in certain areas but those dangers are still there .
And those dangers are not going to immediately go away because we 're not talking about conventional armies where we have very clear measures of what their capacity is . "
On the nature of the briefings , Obama said , " Most of what I 've learned are things that I 've anticipated , partly because I was in the Senate and although I was n't on the intelligence committee we would get top secret briefings .
So there has n't been something that was eye popping .
But the situation still requires vigilance . "
Looking Ahead : Inauguration and a New Puppy
Obama opened up about his upcoming inauguration address .
" I think that the main task for me in an inauguration speech , and I think this is true for my presidency generally , is to try to capture as best I can the moment that we are in it ...
This is the crossroad that we 're at .
And then to project confidence that if we take the right measures that we can once again be that country , that beacon for the world . "
" My focus is to try to be able to describe in simple , plain terms , the challenges we face , but then also to let people know I have every intention of working with the American people so that we meet those challenges . "
Obama has been drawing inspiration for his address from his predecessors , Lincoln in particular .
" Every time you read that second inaugural , you start getting intimidated , especially because it 's really short .
You know , there 's a genius to Lincoln that is not going to be matched .
People then point to Kennedy 's inauguration speech .
Sorenson and Kennedy together did an extraordinary job .
Some of the others are not as inspiring , " he said .
The Obama family moved to DC last week and while the President - elect said his two daughters , Malia , 10 , and Sasha , 7 , are adapting nicely to their new surroundings .
" I 'm trying to figure out why it is that they do n't seemed to be fazed by anything .
People think -- you know , folks think I 'm cool , they are a lot cooler than I am .
They just do n't seem to be intimidated , " Obama said .
But several questions about their lives in Washington remain unanswered .
In part because of the demands of the presidential campaign and the furor surrounding his former Pastor Jeremiah Wright , Obama has been without a worship community for about a year .
Obama acknowledges that he misses it .
" It 's been a difficult time , " he said .
" Now , I 've got a wonderful community of people who are praying for me every day , and they call me up and -- you know , but it 's not the same as going to church and the choir 's going and you get this feeling . "
Obama said he and his wife Michelle will be visiting churches in Washington , D.C .
" It is tougher as president , " Obama said .
" You know , this is not just an issue of going to church , it 's an issue of going anywhere .
You do n't want to subject your fellow church members , the rest of the congregation , to being magged every time you go to church .
And so , we 're going to try to be balancing , not being disruptive to the city , but also saying we want to be part of Washington D.C. , " he said .
" But one of the things that I do n't like historically about Washington is the way that you 've got one part of Washington , which is a company town , all about government , and is generally pretty prosperous .
And then , you 've got another half of D.C. that is going through enormous challenges .
I want to see if we can bring those two Washington D.C. 's together . "
And finally , Obama offered up some insight into the future first pooch .
The president - elect was accompanied to the " This Week " interview at the Newseum in Washington , D.C. by his two daughters .
On a visit to the control room the girls got on the executive producer 's headset and offered Stephanopoulos a question for their father .
" While you were getting made up , they went into the control room and played director and producer .
And they actually gave me a question they want me to ask you , " Stephanopoulos explained .
" You know exactly what it 's going to be . "
" Uh-oh .
Go ahead , " Obama replied .
" What kind of a dog are we getting and when are we getting it ? "
Stephanopoulos asked on their behalf .
" They seem to have narrowed it down to a labradoodle or a Portuguese water hound , " Obama explained .
" We 're closing in on it .
This has been tougher than finding a commerce secretary . "
Cormac Mac Ruairi
A woman in dark robes places a prayer mat on the floor and she begins to pray to Allah .
She is surrendering to her God and Allah 's wishes as expressed in the holy Koran .
When the camera moves closer , we see all is not as it first appears : her garments are transparent and her breasts are clearly visible .
The Koran forbids all Muslims — men and women — to show themselves naked in public .
And though it is probably not strictly banned , we can only imagine the quotes from the Koran written in calligraphy on her body must also breach the spirit of Islamic religious law .
The depicted texts from the Koran deal with the perscribed punishments for women who " misbehave " .
As the film continues , we hear four tragic stories of women being forced into arranged marriages , being whipped , beaten and raped .
We see images of backs marked by a whip and a woman 's face reduced to a bloody pulp by her man 's fists .
All the time these women , we are told , are meant to surrender themselves to Allah and accept their fate .
* Hirsi Ali denies Muslim film is plagiarism
The film has provoked a lot of controversy since it was shown on Sunday when its writer , Somali - born MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali , was interviewed on the " Zomergasten " , or Summer Guests , programme .
But the film Submission has little new to say that Hirsi Ali has not said before .
Since her election to the Dutch Parliament one and a half years ago , she has doggedly criticised the treatment of women under Islam , both in immigrant communities in the Netherlands and overseas .
She has made headlines for describing Islam as backward and its prophet Mohammed as a pervert because he married a 12 - year - old girl .
Remarks like that have drawn the wrath of fundamentalists : her life has been threatened more than once and she is accompanied everywhere by armed security officers .
Her criticism of Islam has been very heavy - handed and even some liberal thinkers have tended to dismiss her as an embittered crank .
( She fled , aged 22 , to the Netherlands when her father tried to force her into an arranged marriage in Kenya in 1991 . )
But with Submission , part 1 , Hirsi Ali is continuing her campaign , no matter how uncomfortable her message might be to Muslims and non-Muslims alike .
Her message remains as uncompromising as ever and the semi-nudity provides the necessary dose of shock value that always seem to accompany her public statements .
But this time round she has teamed up with Theo van Gogh , one of the most brilliant , if controversial , directors in the Netherlands to make her case through art .
One reviewer has described the movie as a monologue , but it is more in the tradition of the political pamphlets of the 17th and 18th centuries .
The arguments are drawn with broad strokes and there is no room for equivocation or even - handedness .
If the form veers towards the sensational or caricature , all the better to get attention and stimulate debate .
Van Gogh is not one to censure out a naked body when the script demands it — and Hirsi Ali says it does .
The woman 's nakedness strips away the cloak of the veil and reveals Muslim woman are just like everyone else ; flesh and blood humans , she claims .
The Koran tells women to cover themselves up and submit to Allah in all things
At first glance , Hirsi Ali and director Van Gogh are a bit of an odd couple .
She is slim and immaculately turned out , he is rotund , dresses " casually " with braces , and chain - smokes .
What they have in common is a drive to state their point of view forcibly , sometimes to the point of enraging their audiences and alienating people .
And neither seems to care .
Hirsi Ali was a member of the Labour PvdA party , but she left spectacularly in 2002 .
Having had to flee to the US following death threats in the Netherlands , she claimed the social democrats in the PvdA were only paying lip - service to women 's rights , particularly when it comes to rights for women in immigrant and Muslim communities .
She joined the right - wing Liberal VVD which welcomed her call for Muslims to integrate into Dutch society .
But even there , some of her pointed condemnations of Islam have sent her party colleagues running for cover .
VVD leaders Gerrit Zalm and Jozias van Aartsen have come out this week to express support for the central message of the film , but Zalm spoke for many would - be supporters when he added : " That naked body , eh ... " .
Writer and director Van Gogh is used to stirring things up too and could be described as the Netherlands ' Michael Moore .
He has been hired and fired many times as a columnist , he publishes his own internet page — entitled " De Gezonde Roker " , or The Healthy Smoker — featuring his thoughts on Islam ( negative ) , hypocrisy ( negative ) and a lot of other subjects ( usually negative ) .
Van Gogh is an artist with a passion for commenting on current events .
He has published a compilation of his columns in book form entitled Allah weet het beter , or Allah knows best .
' That naked body ' from Submission © Theo van Gogh
His remarks can sometimes be very offensive and totally unfounded .
Van Gogh once said " Muslims are goatf *** ers " , accuses Dutch - Moroocan website Maghreb.nl .
He is currently making a movie about Pim Fortuyn , the populist politician and critic of Islam who was murdered in Hilversum in May 2001 .
Earlier this month , cinema giant Pathe refused to show Van Gogh 's movie Cool ! , a story about a group of Moroccan criminals .
Van Gogh paid the EUR 18,000 price tag for Submission which was filmed in secret in a month .
The dialogue is in English and Van Gogh says he wants to sell it everywhere .
" I am going to send it to Arabic news channel Aljazeera .
They broadcast ( Osama ) bin Laden 's little films so they wo n't have a problem with this , " he quipped .
Given its subject matter though , Submission might never make top billing in cinemas in countries such as Saudi Arabia , Iran or Afghanistan .
He has been given bodyguards as a result of the controversy .
And " that naked body … " .
Theo van Gogh : a joker with a serious message ?
" That naked body " has created quite a stir in the media and on a multitude of internet forums , from a chat room on Dutch politics to one for gay Turkish men .
A correspondent on the latter saying Hirsi Ali and Van Gogh will do anything for attention .
Mohammed Sini of the Dutch foundation Islam and Citizenship told the Dutch media that Submission had gone too far and insulted many Muslims .
At the same time , he said many Muslims in the Netherlands felt their identity was under siege and , as a result , clung too rigidly to the Koran .
He said Muslims should not accept everything in the Koran too literally .
Other mainstream political parties have been broadly positive about the film , but the Christian Democrat CDA has so far stonewalled and refused to express an opinion .
The leader of the green - left GroenLinks party , Femke Halsema , said the film could have been slightly more refined and Hirsi Ali came across as a bit triumphant .
" I grew up with the film ' Turks Fruit ' so I am fairly used ( to the nudity ) ... but I really enjoyed the evening 's viewing , " she said .
Not everyone will react in the same way , but like the pamphleteers of old , Hirsi Ali and Van Gogh have certainly stoked up a lively debate .
" We had to wrestle it Steve Irwin style , " National Parks and Wildlife Service spokesman John Dengate said .
" But it was big enough to give us a bit of trouble before we grabbed it . "
Although authorities initially believed the animal was a saltwater crocodile , it was later found to be an alligator , Mr Dengate said .
" The distinguishing features are alligators have shorter rounder snouts , and there 's a difference in the scale pattern , " he said .
There was no way the alligator - which is native to Florida , in the US - could have made its own way to Pambula , Mr Dengate said .
" The Far South Coast is outside the animal 's natural range - it could not survive here during winter , " he said .
" We do n't know where it came from but it 's likely that it 's an escaped pet .
" The fact it 's an alligator is more intriguing , because it 's rather more difficult to get your hands on an alligator in Australia than a croc . "
A permit was required to keep an alligator as a pet , Mr Dengate said , although he suspected this reptile had been obtained and kept illegally .
Police checks confirmed no one living in the area was licensed to keep such animals .
Fortunately , no scouts were staying at the camp when the reptile was discovered , but about 20 people had been camping there , police said .
The capture of the alligator was also good news for other wildlife .
" The wetland area where it was found has a popular form of endangered frogs living there ... the last thing we want is for an introduced [ reptile ] to eat its way through a community of endangered frogs , " Mr Dengate said .
The alligator has been taken to Mogo Zoo , Mr Dengate said .
Anyone with information about the alligator can call the NPWS environment line on 131 555 .
Calls can be anonymous .
Gorged parrots at risk Meanwhile , the NPWS has also pleaded with truck drivers to cover their trucks properly , after reports that more than 20 endangered superb parrots died near Canberra after eating too much spilled grain .
" It 's very attractive to them and they sit there eating it , unaware that a car is coming along at 110 kmh , " Mr Dengate said .
" They just stuff themselves with the grain - it's a marvellous food resource and a lot of the birds are feeding chicks at the moment so they are hungry - but the more they eat the slower they become .
" A car comes along and their natural instincts do n't serve them well , and they end up on the grille of the car . "
The NPWS has received reports of dozens of the endangered parrots dying near Galong , where many grain transporters were travelling due to the harvest season , Mr Dengate said .
" We only found two [ dead birds ] but that 's not to say there were n't more because foxes might have [ eaten them ] , " he said .
" Superb parrots are quite rare ... and that 's the only area they are found in state . "
The total population of the superb parrot is estimated to be only a few thousand birds , according to the Department of Environment website .
It ’s 3:45 p.m. in Los Angeles .
Outside , the sun is shining , people are walking their dogs .
I can hear the laughter of children returning from school …
Out here , in the land of sunshine , a few footsteps away from Venice , one feels as safe and peaceful as can be .
Obama stickers adorn Priuses .
People ride bicycles .
They recycle , buy organic and free range .
They shop at Trader Joe ’s and Whole Foods .
Hope and optimism are in the air .
I ’m feeling peaceful and safe , too .
But only because a fully loaded .357 Magnum is sitting on my desk .
I spent four years observing this place from a safe distance in Moscow , and it makes me nervous now that I ’m back in my adopted home state .
There are just too many unknowables here to feel safe without some form of serious protection .
So the first thing I did after touching down in Los Angeles was buy a gun .
I went down there on a Sunday at 10:30 a.m. , and the store was already teeming with anxious gun consumers .
A mass of people were crowding the rifle section .
People were lining up at the handgun counter .
A young couple with a kid was testing out the weight of a pump- action 12 - gauge .
Meanwhile , more people streamed through the doors .
It felt more like WalMart on Black Friday than a neighborhood gun store on a sleepy Sunday .
“ They ’re buying up everything , ” a wiry Asian store clerk with a greaser hairdo and monster - sized pistol strapped to his hip said with a smirk .
“ People want equal opportunity explosives . ”
But people were clearly showing a preference for high - powered handguns , the kind that blow up a man ’s head .
“ We ’re sold out of the Smith & Wesson 686 , ” a military - type salesman shook his head in embarrassment .
Running out of this classic .357 was like Rite Aid running out of aspirin .
It seemed the Obama - inspired gun craze was living up to its name .
But this was n’t Texas or even Bakersfield .
This was West LA .
Sony Studios were just around the corner , Venice Beach a few miles to the West , Beverly Hills to North and Compton to South : the epicenter of Obama ’s California stronghold .
Sure enough , a 30 - something yuppie proudly sporting an Obama t- shirt queued up at the counter and started picking out a snub - nosed 38 special .
It was gonna be his first gun , a self - defense tool that even an anorexic valley girl — or a sissy white male — could fire with ease .
I looked around in shock .
Obama supporters arming themselves to the teeth ?
This is not what the media had been reporting .
Judging by the spike in the number of mandatory background checks , gun sales have been up by almost 50 % since Obama made his acceptance speech .
But gun haters of all stripes and colors have been trying to whitewash the scary idea by a ) attributing it to crazed rednecks or b ) denying it even exists .
“ We do n’t dispute the gun sales hike , but we think it ’s just a bit stupid , ” a spokesman for the Brady Campaign against Gun Violence was quoted as saying .
“ We do n’t think these are first - time buyers .
We think they are people who already have more than enough guns at their homes to protect themselves and are buying more . ”
He thinks , but has nothing to prove it .
His implication is clear : these people are crazies and need to be disarmed .
NOW !
Over at Slate , Jack Shafer went one step further .
He did a David Copperfield on the statistics and made the whole trend disappear altogether .
He pointed out that gun ownership rates have dipped and grown over the past ten years , but have remained largely unchanged for the past ten years ( at just over 8 million guns a year ) .
Meanwhile , the US population has grown .
So , what he ’s really saying is that despite the Obama - inspired spike , gun ownership is decreasing overall .
But ten days after I bought my gun , I found out just how wrong they really were .
The realization came , of all places , at a vegan Thai restaurant .
I had just come back from the firing range and was loudly discussing my spot - on target practice with a friend of mine .
“ There ’s an indescribable satisfaction in the knowledge that I can blow up a dude ’s head at 40 ft. with just a couple shots . ”
I was blessed with two undeniable gifts : a uncanny sense of smell and a steady hand .
Good traits for a hunter , but unusual for a skinny Jew like myself .
“ Are you going to keep it loaded all the time ? ” my friend asked .
“ Sure I will .
What ’s the point of having an unloaded weapon , ” I replied .
“ I did n’t buy it to use as a vase , did I ? ” I turned my head and I noticed a woman staring me down from across the room .
She was in her 50s , an old school urban hippie by the looks of her raggedy flannel shirt and worn PETA t- shirt .
Shit , I thought , I ’m committing a double crime : talking on a cellphone in a restaurant and boasting about a gun made for one and only purpose : killing living beings .
This is the sort of thing PETA would love to hang people for .
I hung up the phone , and the next thing I knew , she was hovering over me with a crazed look in her eye .
I cringed , expecting some sort of moralistic guns - are - for - killing diatribe , maybe even get a Thai iced tea thrown in my face .
But she was n’t angry .
She was concerned , and worried .
“ I ’m sorry to intrude , but I could n’t help overhearing you talking about buying a gun .
The thing is , I am actually buying one as well . ”
Her name was Pam .
She looked around , embarrassed at what she just said .
“ Do you know of any good gun stores around here ?
The one I went to was very expensive . ” A PETA member asking me for gun advice ?
And in a desperate I ’m - hurting - for - a - fix kind of way ?
“ Wow .
You really would kill a living thing ? ” I asked .
“ Yes .
Absolutely , ” she said .
A white - boy rasta with waist - long dookie dreads in the corner stole a quick glance at us and quickly returned to his soy roast beef wrap .
He was n’t about to start arguing with two gun psychos .
“ I know it sounds crazy .
I ’ve been a vegetarian for over ten years .
But with the way the economy is going …
I just do n’t feel safe .
The world has changed . ”
Pam ’s organic pepper spray did n’t cut it any more for self - defense .
These days , lethal force is the only sure thing .
Obama or not , Pam was not putting her hopes into anything but a piece of cold steel .
And she already signed up for a gun class to learn how to shoot to kill .
This was n’t just about exercising her constitutional right , it was about real fear .
You do n’t appreciate the warped American mind until you ’ve smelled the faint tang of red curry and soy fish on a gun owner ’s breath .
Pam was a new type , a PETA - NRA hybrid who prefers hunting for human flesh and
steers clear of anything with wings or more than two legs .
And Pam is not the only Obama - supporting Prius - driving lefty with fear in her heart and bloodlust in her eyes .
At a gun store , she ran into another vegetarian shopping for a kill tool .
He was looking for something small and simple that could take down a person with one shot .
“ He said he was vegetarian , too , ” she said .
“ And I believe him .
You could see that he does n’t eat meat by the freshness around his eyes . ”
If these two are any indication , a sleeper gun-toting community is rising up from the unlikely recesses of the liberal abyss .
Somewhere , just beyond the restaurant ’s glass door , hundreds — even thousands — of crunchy amateurs had their guns loaded and ready to go .
Educated white people gravitating towards firepower , it ’s a scary thought for gun control advocates .
Even Obama has been getting a little nervous .

You can make a cute little sea kitten character like this at the new section of PETA 's Web site , peta.org / sea_kittens .
You do n't have to look at the page views of Web sites like cutelittlekittens.com to know that a lot of people adore kittens .
Conversely , not as many people adore fish - in fact , cutefish.com has only the number 0 .
The animal rights campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , PETA , has decided to play off of our awe of kittens by re-branding fish as " sea kittens " in order to discourage people from killing and eating them .
" Would people think twice about ordering fish sticks if they were called Sea Kitten sticks ?
Help us save fish by changing their names ! " PETA writes on its Web site .
The new sea kitten Web portal is complete with a petition , cute little stories about sea kittens - some attend Clamster University ! - and a tool to design your own sea kitten .
The petition has more than 4,544 signatures as of this writing .
" Given the drastic situation for this country 's sea kittens - who are often the victims of many major threats to their welfare and ways of life - it's high time that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) stop allowing our little sea kitten friends to be tortured and killed .
Who 'd want to hurt a sea kitten anyway ? ! " the Web site says .
How far will this " sea kitten " label extend ?
Will people find themselves ordering the " Chilean striped sea kitten with mashed potatoes " ?
Certainly there are already vegetarians out there who do not consume fish for ethical reasons .
Princeton professor Peter Singer , famous for his arguments about why not to consume meat , similarly advocates avoiding eating fish in Animal Liberation , although notes that things do get fuzzier when considering simpler forms of marine life , such as mollusks and oysters .
Of course , besides being a favorite delicacy at restaurants and family dinners , fish also form part of specific eating rituals in certain cultures .
For example , in China , the fish is served whole - with the head and tail intact - to represent prosperity , especially on Chinese New Year ’s Eve .
In Slovakia , it is traditional to let a carp swim in the family bathtub in the days before the feisty critter becomes part of the Christmas meal .
And , it is a Jewish custom eat fish on the Sabbath , one reason being that the numerical value of the Hebrew word for fish , " dag , " adds up to 7 , and the Sabbath is the 7th day .
So what do you think :
Is it ethically acceptable to eat fish ?
Will the sea kitten campaign be effective ?
Would your goldfish mind being called a sea kitten ?

“ It seems at this moment the invasion is beginning at a number of points in the Gaza Strip , ” Ramallah - based reporter Hadir Shaheen declared on Saturday , January 3 .
And he was right .
Less than two hours later the beginning of Israel ’s ground invasion of the Gaza Strip was worldwide news , covered on every website and television station on the planet .
But Hadir Shaheen was the first … he and his fellow correspondent Mohammed Sarhan broke the story to a Beirut affiliate of the Iranian Al - Alam News Network .
And what did scooping the hundreds of high - profile international reporters who flocked to Israel during the beginning of the Gaza air campaign get the two for their troubles ?
In Israel , an indictment and potentially a hefty jail sentence .
Since the start of the war the Israeli government has used national security as an excuse to enact a myriad of draconian new military censorship laws , giving the military considerable power to regulate what private journalists are and are not allowed to say .
Reporting the truth about a major military operation before the Israeli military ’s Spokesperson Unit had decided it was fit for international consumption now constitutes “ passing information to the enemy . ”
Israel has had a long history of relative press freedom , but that image is being seriously tarnished by a censorship - happy military that cheerfully ignores the orders of its own Supreme Court in the hopes of keeping tight control over information about its ongoing war .
ABC News ’ Simon McGregor
Wood warns that the ongoing behavior is “ placing Israel at risk of appearing like a military dictatorship . ”
Maybe the longest bus on world
World longest bus
Let me introduce you with probably the world longest bus .
It has been presented in Shanghai ’s Busworld Asia 2007 .
With a top speed of 51 mph ( 82 km /h ) and a max capacity of 300 passengers , it works only in cities without corners or the other way would be to drive from one block to another without turning ( driving between Beijing and Hangzhou ) .
Its long 83 foot ( 25 meter ) and its is divided into 3 compartments .
Price of this very attractive bus ( also called “ red dragon ” ) is between US $ 155,000 to $ 258,000 – compared to the common bus that ranges between US $ 80,000 to $ 100,000 .

A test of popular processed foods from some of the biggest names in the industry found trace amounts of mercury , according to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy , a nonprofit group based in Minneapolis .
The amounts of mercury found was far less than that commonly seen in most fish and seafood , but turned up in many foods not previously known to be sources of mercury , including many preferred by children , the group said .
It includes Nutri-Grain Strawberry Cereal Bars , Quaker Oatmeal to go bars , Hershey 's Chocolate Syrup , Yoplait Strawberry yogurt , Market Pantry Grape Jelly and Coca - Cola , it said .
" This seems like an avoidable source of mercury that we did n't know was out there , " said David Wallinga , one of the study 's co-authors .
The study concluded that the mercury came from food plants that use caustic soda laced with mercury to produce high fructose corn syrup for major food companies .
The researchers cautioned that their study was limited .
It tested 55 consumer items , finding mercury in one third of the samples ranging from 30 to 350 parts per trillion .
A part per trillion is the rough equivalent of a drop of water in 20 Olympic - sized swimming pools .
Several companies named in the IATP report defended their products Monday , pointing to the very low levels of mercury detected .
" You would have to eat more than 100 pounds of ketchup each day to even come close to reaching the EPA 's safe exposure level , " said ConAgra spokeswoman Stephanie Childs .
A spokesman for General Mills challenged the science behind the report , saying it did n't identify which form of mercury was detected and that parts per trillion of mercury can be found in water , soil and plant and animal tissue .
" To suggest a safety concern on the basis of this study is irresponsible , " said Tom Forsythe , a spokesman .
A group representing the high fructose corn syrup industry said food plants no longer use the mercury - containing ingredients that caused contamination in the past , adding that four - year - old samples were cited in an academic paper that was released in tandem with the IATP report .
" This study appears to be based on outdated information of dubious significance , " said Audrae Erickson , president of the Corn Refiners Association .
The IATP , however , said four plants in Georgia , Tennessee , Ohio and West Virginia still use the " mercury - cell " technology that leads to contamination .
A fifth plant in Wisconsin has begun converting its plant to use mercury - free agents .
The report was published Monday in the peer - reviewed journal Environmental Health .
Lead author Renee Dufault , a former Food and Drug Administration scientist , said she presented findings about mercury in processed food to the FDA after preliminary testing in 2005 .
" Environmental mercury exposure via food , water and air is a threat to sensitive populations -- those who may not be able to effectively metabolize mercury ( autistic children and the elderly ) .
Sensitive populations may be bioaccumulating mercury and this leads to neurological effects , " she said in an email .
An FDA spokesman said the agency was overwhelmed with the peanut butter salmonella scare and could not respond immediately to this issue .
The mercury findings , while potentially alarming , should be viewed in context , said Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
The report found 300 parts per trillion of mercury in Jack Daniel 's Barbecue Sauce , but that 's still 30 to 3,000 times less than the amount of mercury found in fish and seafood .
" I suspect people eat more fish than barbecue sauce , " he said .
The type of mercury commonly found in fish and seafood is methyl mercury , and its effects are known to be toxic , but the type of mercury found in the packaged foods is not yet known , the report 's authors said .
Heavy metal contamination in the food chain of industrialized nations is not uncommon .
A 2004 study by the World Health Organization found an average adult consumes 100 micrograms of mercury per week in Portugal , and more than 50 micrograms per week in Italy , Germany and France .
Here are the responses about the report from some of the major food companies : General Mills : " We have serious doubts about the scientific merit of this report .
The main premise -- that the processing of high - fructose corn syrup is responsible for traces of mercury in products - is not established by this study .
Levels of elemental mercury at parts per trillion or greater can be found throughout the environment in water , in soil and in plant and animal tissues .
This study does not establish that any mercury detected comes from HFCS -- and there is no evidence that suggest it is in the organic form of mercury ( that which has demonstrated health impact ) .
To suggest a safety concern on the basis of this study is irresponsible .
Questions about the analytical methodology used in the study remain unanswered as well .
If this study is to be reported upon , it may be just as important for consumers to know that - even if present at the levels reported -- the levels supposedly cited in this paper would be minimal , and well below any concern level set by either U.S. or international regulatory bodies .
Of all of the many facts that this paper fails to mention , that may be the most important point for readers to know . "
Hershey's : Hershey products are safe to consume , and all ingredients meet our stringent quality and safety guidelines , as well as applicable federal requirements , said Kirk Saville , a spokesman for Hersheys .
Kellogg :
Was the company aware of this type of mercury contamination ?
The food industry tests at the parts per billion level .
This study looked at parts per trillion , a level that is 1,000 times lower than the already stringent threshold of parts per billion .
Cook , Ludwig , and McCrary : Setting the Agenda for Fighting Crime
With macroeconomic issues taking center stage , it is not clear that other issues , like crime , will get much attention in the Obama administration .
Personally , however , I think it is an excellent time to reflect on our current approach to fighting crime .
The United States has enjoyed a great deal of success over the last 15 to 20 years in reducing crime .
Crime rates today are a lot lower than they used to be , but crime still imposes enormous costs on society .
In addition to the costs associated with the suffering of victims , we have one million police officers , an enormous criminal justice system , and over two million Americans behind bars .
The fight against crime has gone well , but it is reasonable to ask whether we can do better .
Could we spend fewer government resources and achieve the same results ?
Have we gone too far in terms of punishment , or would society benefit from even harsher sentences ?
Should we be diverting resources away from the criminal justice system toward other interventions if our goal is to reduce crime ?
Three economists I know — Phil Cook , Jens Ludwig , and Justin McCrary — have been giving a lot of thought to these questions lately .
While I do n’t agree with all the specifics of what they propose , I think what they are doing is important , and I ’m delighted to be able to provide them the opportunity to use the blog as a forum for their ideas .
And as would be the case with any such list produced by good economists , there are plenty of ideas here that liberals will hate , and just as many to offend conservatives .
Setting the Agenda for Fighting Crime
By Phil Cook , Jens Ludwig , and Justin McCrary
A Guest Post
Virginia Senator Jim Webb has recently called for a national commission to revisit America ’s criminal justice policies , and in particular the policies that have resulted in the incarceration of more than two million people .
As The Times notes , “ most elected officials , afraid of being tarred as soft on crime , ignore these problems . ”
That political diagnosis sounds plausible to us , in the sense that most politicians and their constituents seem to believe that our only options are mass incarceration or increased crime .
But that ’s a lot like saying that your only choice is between spending $ 50,000 on a Cadillac Escalade or being housebound .
It ’s just not true .
Here are 10 ways to either reduce the prison population without increasing crime , or reduce both the number of prisoners and the number of crimes at the same time .
Our list is motivated by some basic insights from economics that : people respond to incentives , but they also tend to discount the future , which suggests we could make the criminal justice system more productive by exchanging long prison terms for a greater likelihood of some less - severe punishment ; people sometimes have trouble controlling their behaviors , particularly when drunk or high , but prohibition also comes at some cost , so we need to think carefully about how we regulate intoxicating substances ; and people choose between crime and legal behavior , so improving people ’s schooling and labor - market opportunities should be another component of our anti-crime strategy .
Taking these basic economic ideas seriously would let us do more with less .
Improving Deterrence
1. Restore funding for the federal government ’s COPS program , which provides grants to local and state police to put more officers on the street .
Bill Evans at Notre Dame and Emily Owens at Cornell have shown that more COPS means less crime .
Each dollar spent on the COPS program seems to generate from $ 4 to $ 8 in benefits to society .
2 . Test and quickly punish probationers for the use of hard drugs .
Many of the guys exiting prison fall back into bad habits and eventually recidivate .
We should help them get clean by implementing an idea from UCLA professor Mark Kleiman :
Test probationers frequently for hard drugs , and when they fail , rather than go through a long administrative process that may or may not lead to a lengthy prison term , just throw them in jail right away for a day or two .
3 . Make greater use of intermediate sanctions .
Kids who steal bikes should n’t go unpunished , but sending them to juvenile detention ( where the annual costs can run as high as $ 70,000 per year ) seems like a big waste of money .
Why not issue fines , or some sort of onerous community service or public - sector work requirement instead , which could , for instance , require kids to show up at the local soup kitchen or hospital by 6 a.m. on weekends ?
4 . Treat witnesses at least as well as we treat jurors .
Right now , fewer than half of violent crimes are reported to the police ; the figure is even lower for property crimes .
That ’s pathetic .
We should compensate cooperative crime victims for their medical costs and make sure other witnesses are compensated for lost earnings ; and we should waste as little of their time at court as possible .
5 . We should give out big rewards for tips that lead the police to gun arrests , which could reduce the prevalence of gun carrying and the number of shootings that happen each year .
( See Jens Ludwig ’s previous blog post on Freakonomics . )
Better Regulation of Intoxicating Substances
6. Decriminalize possession of small quantities of marijuana .
Frito sales might go up , but crime almost surely wo n’t .
7 . Raise the tax on booze :
We do n’t want to pay more for our beer , but it does n’t seem right that it ’s currently subsidized relative to its social cost .
Higher taxes have been shown to reduce at least some kinds of crime .
( One of us , Cook , has recently published a book called Paying the Tab from Princeton University Press that lays this out in detail . )
Improving the Life Prospects of Poor Kids
8. Spend more on early childhood education .
We ’ve long known that model early childhood programs like Perry Preschool reduce crime , but we ’re now accumulating decent evidence that large - scale programs like Head Start might also ( in part by boosting educational attainment , which is negatively associated with criminal behavior ) .
This wo n’t reduce crime right away , but still , there is something appealing about teaching a little kid to sit still , share his blocks , and stop poking his neighbor as an alternative to locking him up during adolescence .
9. Improve No Child Left Behind ( N.C.L.B. ) :
Since better schooling outcomes help to steer kids away from crime , we should fix the deficiencies in N.C.L.B. by pushing for a common achievement standard for all kids ( rather than let each state set its own standards , which has led to predictable gaming ) .
We should hold schools accountable for changes in the average test scores of all students — rather than just the proportion of students who score above some threshold , which encourages schools to focus attention just on kids who are right around that proficiency cutoff .
And we should even think about adding some element of student accountability to N.C.L.B. as well , which our friend Brian Jacob at the University of Michigan suggests did some good when implemented as part of school reform in Chicago back in the 1990’s .
10 . Spend more on the Earned Income Tax Credit ( E.I.T.C. ) , which supplements the incomes of working families .
Research that one of us ( Ludwig ) has done with Brian Jacob suggests that providing extra income to poor families reduces the chances that children become involved with crime .
With the economy tanking , this is a good time to use the E.I.T.C. to help families with kids at the bottom of the income distribution .
One problem with this list is that it is not ideologically consistent — there are things here for both Democrats and Republicans to hate .
But our current level of political dysfunction is a separate problem that does n’t undermine the general principle that there are ways of getting ourselves out of the “ less prison versus less crime ” trap .

Much of President Barack Obama ’s pre-election stump speeches focused on the perceived need to reinvigorate America ’s moral leadership around the world .
Indeed , rhetoric on the White House website says , “ President Obama and Vice President Biden will renew America ’s security and standing in the world through a new era of American leadership . ”
Critical first steps , many would argue , were his appointments of former rival and New York senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of State and adviser Susan Rice as ambassador to the United Nations .
The president has sent former senator George Mitchell to the Mideast and Richard Holbrook to Afghanistan and Pakistan as special envoys .
So far , so good .
Presidents appoint ambassadors to represent American interests abroad .
Presumably presidents appoint seasoned , experienced foreign diplomats to such delicate tasks .
So President Obama has dozens of ambassadors to appoint .
And the first rumor is … Dan Rooney as ambassador to Ireland ?
The owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and president and co-founder of The American Ireland Funds ?
Neither the White House nor Mr. Rooney have commented .
Now , Mr. Rooney may be qualified to be an ambassador .
But with a State Department stable filled with foreign - policy professionals , why would a president need to appoint the owner of a professional sports franchise as an ambassador ?
Well , we all know the answer , do n’t we ?
Patronage .
Presidents hand out ambassadorships like candy to those who helped — financially — put them in the White House .
In June 2007 , Scholars & Rogues examined the ambassadorial appointments of three presidents :
President Bush ’s 36 percent rate exceeds the 29 percent of President Clinton ’s ambassadorial nominees who were non-career appointees .
During George Herbert Walker Bush ’s presidency , about 31 percent were non-career appointees .
According to a Scholars & Rogues examination of records at the Office of the Historian of the Department of State , George W. Bush has made 370 ambassadorial nominations — of which 133 have been non-career appointees rather than career Foreign Service officers .
President Clinton ’s 431 nominations included 127 non-career appointees .
The first President Bush made 272 nominations , of which 85 were non-career appointees .
The post also examined the financial connections to President George W. Bush ’s campaigns of those appointed to patronage ambassadorships .
The post discerned that under these three presidents , some nations knew only non-career , or patronage , appointments .
The Obama White House website , under a section called “ Renewing American Diplomacy , ” says :
Obama and Biden will rebuild our alliances to meet the common challenges of the 21st century .
America is strongest when we act alongside strong partners .
Now is the time for a new era of international cooperation that strengthens old partnerships and builds new ones to confront the common challenges of the 21st century — terrorism and nuclear weapons ; climate change and poverty ; genocide and disease . …
To make diplomacy a priority , Obama and Biden will stop shuttering consulates and start opening them in difficult corners of the world — particularly in Africa .
They will expand our foreign service , and develop our civilian capacity to work alongside the military .
[ emphasis added ]
President Obama has a promise to keep to the electorate — improve American diplomacy .
He ran on that platform .
But he — as did the presidents before him — has a political need to retain or curry favor with political donors .
Eventually , you ’ll see some Obama appointments that produce a “ What the … ” response .
Should you wonder whom to look for as potential patronage appointments , consider this Center for Responsive Politics list of the 561 bundlers who secured at least $ 63 million for President Obama ’s campaign .
Then there ’s list of employers of President Obama ’s top contributors .
And this list of the top 20 industries that contributed to his campaign .
Should you wish to keep track of how seriously President Obama views ambassadorial relationships with foreign governments , check the White House website for “ Nominations and Appointments ” from time to time — as S&R will .
President Obama promised voters better government and better diplomacy .
Let ’s keep track of whom he appoints to do that .
" The Republic neither recognizes , nor salaries , nor subsidizes any religion . "
So says the 1905 French law on the separation of church and state .
Yet nowadays officials do everything in their power to promote the construction of mosques — even providing sweetheart land deals that push the bounds of legality .
A report finds that 30 % of the funding for mosques in France can be traced to public coffers .
While one Muslim leader credits " divine will , " the real driver is politics :
The mayors involved sometimes want more control but also to win votes in tight elections .
With the explosion of land prices , granting municipal land proves decisive .
The emphyteutic lease has become the principal tool of mayors , even if the courts sometimes punish rents which are too low , seen as explicit financing of religion .
This was the case in Marseille and Montreuil .
Since then the system has become more refined .
Mayors use the additional cultural activities of the mosque , sometimes a simple tearoom , in order to give subsidies .
An emphyteutic lease is a long - term contract that requires the lessee to improve the property .
French cities have been using the mechanism to transfer land to Muslim groups for rates as low as one euro per year , thus provoking outrage .
A lawsuit challenging the Marseille agreement ended with the rent being upped to  24,000 .
The Montreuil lease was struck down in 2007 , but an appeals court overturned the decision , contending that the symbolic amount is not a subsidy because the grounds and mosque will revert to government control in 2107 .
Yes , 2107 .
Ironically , the 1905 statute — which applies to all of France except Alsace - Lorraine — is used to argue for public support of mosques .
That law ended the funding of faith groups and made their buildings the property of the state , which now maintains them .
But critics assert that this favors Catholicism , whose pre-1905 churches were built with government aid , over Islam , whose late - arriving adherents bear the full cost of constructing and caring for new mosques .
Politicians as high as President Sarkozy sympathize with this view and even talk of modifying the legal code .
France is not the only Western nation to provide land for mosques , at times stretching the law to do so .
The government of Argentina handed off a parcel appraised at $ 10 million for a mega - mosque in Buenos Aires , while Boston has been embroiled in a scandal over the below - market - value sale of real estate to house an Islamic cultural center .
However , France stands out because the country , which banned religious symbols in schools five years ago , is reputed to be the most secular in Europe .
That it now finances , more or less openly , Muslim places of worship speaks to the social changes sweeping the nation and the continent .
For states looking to better manage those changes , here is a good place to start : resist the temptation to bend or alter laws for the exclusive benefit of any single group .
Rice refuses to deny CIA transported suspects to countries using torture Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday December 6 , 2008
Print This Email This New investigation opened into Spanish administration for allowing flights to continue ; Italy suspends rendition trial
Outgoing Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice on Friday refused to deny the CIA had engaged in transporting terror suspects to countries that routinely practice torture , when asked by a Danish television reporter .
A new Danish government report has drawn a blank as to whether the country 's airspace was used by the CIA to spirit away targets of interest , a highly controversial practice known as rendition .
Rice was asked by the reporter to comment on whether the intelligence agency had conducted flights , and she did not deny it .
" We have respected Danish sovereignty and will continue to do so , and I have given to the ( Danish ) foreign minister a guarantee , assurances how we will deal with these issues in the future , " she said , according to published reports .
The reporter backtracked , and asked the secretary if that means there had been no CIA flights over Denmark .
" I have given a commitment to the foreign minister about the future , and I have said that we will respect Danish sovereignty , " she said , dodging his inquiry .
In Spain , an investigation has been launched into whether the previous administration allowed the CIA to land its rendition flights at Spanish facilities .
The probe was launched after a top secret document was leaked to Spanish newspaper El Pais .
Former Prime Minister Aznar , a Bush ally , previously denied any knowledge of CIA flights stopping in his country .
On Nov. 30 , Spanish foreign minister Miguel Angel Moratinos insisted that the current administration was not informed of the flights , and vowed to see an investigation launched .
" We have nothing to hide , " he said in a report published by the Telegraph .
Similarly , in Portugal , the country 's top diplomat recently deflected allegations of his government 's involvement with the American intelligence agency .
Responding to a Spanish media report claiming the CIA had used Portugal for renditions , Luís Amado said : " I have no further information and add I have no knowledge of any document in Portugal in either the archives of the foreign or defense ministries to compromise in this area any of the governments in office in Portugal up to the present . "
As recently as April , the CIA admitted in documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act that the program will continue .
And , on Dec. 3 , an Italian court moved to postpone the trial of Italian intelligence agents as the administration of Silvio Berlusconi seeks a higher court ruling on the constitutionality of state secrets privileges .
" State secrecy cannot mean impunity , " said Armando Spataro , the prosecutor attempting to prove that Italian agents aided CIA kidnappings , according to a report by Adnkronos International .
" Despite the all the attempts to do so , you cannot stop the quest for the truth . "
A ruling on the government 's secrecy privileges is expected in May , after which the trial will resume .
RAW STORY was the first news outlet to identify the exact location of one of the sites in the CIA 's secret prison network , which was revealed first by the Washington Post .
Raw Story identified a prison in northeastern Poland , Stare Kiejkuty , that was used as a transit point for terror suspects .
Groups highly concerned about the Bush - era program still have reason to hope .
On Thursday , President - elect Obama , who has vowed to prevent any further torture by American captors , met with an assembly of anti-torture generals .
The same generals were responsible for legislation that President Bush vetoed , which would have restricted the CIA 's interrogation methods to those outlined in the Army field manual .
" President - elect Obama has said that Americans do not engage in torture , that we must send a message to the world that America is a nation of laws , and that we as a nation should stand against torture .
He believes that banning torture will actually save American lives and help restore America 's moral stature in the world , " an unnamed official told the Associated Press .
" This meeting is timely and very helpful to advancing this work . "

As Americans conjure images of ' 30s - era soup lines and fedora hats , policymakers are recalling President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the man often credited with ending the Great Depression .
But is his interventionist approach really what today 's economy needs ?
The Daily Beast caught up with Amity Shlaes , author of The Forgotten Man : A New History of The Great Depression , a best - selling book criticizing Roosevelt 's New Deal .
Shlaes has argued that Roosevelt made serious missteps in what he described as his " bold , persistent experimentation " with the economy — missteps that today 's politicians seem poised to repeat .
" You 've already seen politicians invoking the New Deal , and there 's some New Deal - ish chatter coming in Obama 's recent remarks , " Shlaes said .
" The troubling aspect of the current situation is that the Bush administration and Henry Paulson , the Treasury secretary , are seeking a lot of latitude .
Probably too much latitude . "
“ Now the ‘ forgotten man ’ is borrower , the person who 's paying the mortgage , who ’s currently kept up with the mortgage , and now will have taxes , direct and indirect , ” as a result of radical new policies , said Shlaes .
The popular history of the Great Depression goes something like this :
The banking industry collapsed as President Herbert Hoover stood idly by , trusting market forces to turn things around .
He was succeeded by Roosevelt , a self - described champion of what he called the " forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid . "
Roosevelt instituted the New Deal , a radical program of fiscal intervention fueled by government spending , that salvaged the economy until World War II finally ended the Depression .
But in her book , Shlaes contends that many New Deal reforms made America 's stagnation worse .
The government 's intervention in the 1930s was so broad , and often so arbitrary , that those facing bankruptcy and a collapsing share price did not know exactly how the administration would behave .
A similar confusion about exactly what Paulson intends — which firms to save and which to go to the wall — is dogging the current “ rescue . ”
Today 's participants in the economic debate swirling around the country are making the same mistakes as Roosevelt , said Shlaes , who serves as a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and also pens a column for Bloomberg News .
Limited intervention can be good , but not if it is undermined by a cacophony of vague government programs and near - arbitrary bailouts of individual companies .
" Rather than introduce a rules based system , we 're introducing a personality based system , " Shlaes said , referring to what she called an inappropriate focus on the political players at the center of the mortgage crisis .
" Markets do n't like that .
They want to know what the rules are . "
The Bush administration has been criticized for its inconsistent approach to bailing out financial institutions .
It rescued American International Group , a huge insurance company , just a week after it allowed Lehman Brothers to collapse .
It rescued the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which got in trouble partly because political support for extending home ownership had earned them unstated promises that they would receive a government bailout if needed .
The Roosevelt administration made similarly arbitrary decisions , Shlaes said , and that hurt markets in the long term .
She recommends laying out exactly what the markets should expect from the government .
" Before we give blanket deposit insurance to the world , we should say what banks are supposed to do , " she explained .
" If we believe that houses are an entitlement owed by the government , we should say that . "
Roosevelt ’s “ forgotten man ” was someone the market and the government passed by when bad times hit .
But according to Shlaes , the " forgotten man " of the 1930s was the man who waited for a recovery that would n't come , or the man who ultimately paid the price for the government 's misadventures in economic engineering .
The " forgotten man " of today fits something closer to the latter description , Shlaes said .
" Now the ' forgotten man ' is borrower , the person who 's paying the mortgage , who 's currently kept up with the mortgage , and now will have taxes , direct and indirect , " as a result of radical new policies , she said .
" That 's a really bad thing to impose on someone who may be about to lose his job , especially when it 's not his fault . "
( CNN ) -- Silvia Todorova has been heating water in a cooking pot so she can bathe her eight - month - old son Daniel .
Snow - covered ice floats down the Elbe river in Hamburg , Germany , as the temperature plummets .

Dijana Isakovic is running a temperature , taking antibiotics and wearing two shirts and a sweater to try to keep warm .
Workers in Slovakia are sitting at home , their factories idle .
All their problems stem from the same source : the seemingly endless dispute between Russia and Ukraine that has cut off supplies of natural gas to Europe .
Bulgaria , where Todorova lives , is among the hardest hit by the crisis -- it imports 90 percent of its natural gas from Russia .
" We were freezing for two days , " said Todorova , 33 , a teacher and mother of two .
" The electric heaters are working 24 hours a day , which affects our electricity bill .
This month it will be 40 percent more " than usual .
The crisis comes as much of Europe slogs through winter .
Temperatures have been well below freezing in Bulgaria since Russia shut off the gas to Europe on January 6 .
People " are cold at home , then they go to work and they are cold again , " said Sevdalina Voynova , government affairs director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Bulgaria .
Many schools in the country closed for lack of heat , she said , meaning parents had to leave their children at home in the cold .
" They have to go to work .
They have no idea how to warm the kids at home , " she said .
It 's even cold on public transport , she said .
" Heating on the vehicles was one of the first places they tried to save on gas , " she said .
" People were freezing moving from one place to another , freezing at home , and freezing in the office . "
But those who were freezing at work may be the lucky ones -- some factories have been forced to halt operations for lack of gas , Voynova said .
At least three companies that are members of the American Chamber of Commerce have shut down all production , she said .
Two major employers , the ceramics manufacturers Ideal Standard and Vidima , were already suffering due to the worldwide economic crisis .
" They put their workers on long holidays before Christmas .
They were supposed to come back to work January 9 , but they have extended their holidays for nobody knows how long , " she said .
Cosmetics company Alen Mak stopped production about 10 days ago , she said .
" All their employees are on enforced holidays .
They 're using up their holiday days for the year -- but that 's the better option .
The other option is to start laying people off , " she said .
The same thing is happening to the north , in Slovakia , which also gets all its natural gas from Russia and has been rationing its supplies .
" People are home , on forced leave " and reduced salaries , said Elena Mallickova of Slovak TV .
" The big factories are informing us how many millions of euros they are losing each day , " she added .
Ordinary people in Slovakia are not feeling the effects of the gas dispute the way Bulgarians are , she said .
But Dijana Isakova , a journalist in Bosnia - Herzegovina , is on sick leave , which she blames on the cold .
" A lot of people are sick with flu and fevers , " she said .
Her 74 - year - old grandmother has taken an old wood - fueled heater out of the garage to stay warm , Isakova said .
She herself is relying on electric heaters , but lives with her aunt in a large , drafty apartment , she said .
" It 's impossible to heat the whole apartment with two heaters .
The windows are not so good , so the cold air is coming inside . "
Kenan Cerimagic , who works with Isakova at NTV Hayat , said the price of electric heaters had gone up 50 percent since the gas was cut off .
" We 're getting icy rain .
There 's no snow but everything is frozen , " he said .
But although Bosnia - Herzegovina is relying on emergency supplies of gas from other countries such as Hungary and Germany , Cerimagic is looking on the bright side .
" Today it 's a little bit warmer : - 5 Celsius ( 23 Fahrenheit . )
Normally it's - 10 , - 13 , " he said .
And he pointed out that the country emerged from war less than a decade ago , which might make Bosnians more stoic about suffering through a cold winter .
" People are saying , ' At least there is no shooting , ' " he said .
" So we will survive . "

JERUSALEM 
With its punishing air attacks on Gaza about to enter a fifth day , its gunboats gathering near the Gaza port and its ground forces poised for imminent action , Israel said Tuesday that it was considering a 48 - hour cease - fire that would also require Hamas to stop its rocket fire .
The idea was in an early stage , a result of a conversation between Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner of France and Defense Minister Ehud Barak of Israel seeking at least a temporary pause in the fighting that would allow humanitarian relief to be delivered to the besieged coastal strip .
Aides to Mr. Barak said he was interested in exploring it and would do so with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the rest of the cabinet on Wednesday .
“ The leading option right now is still a ground invasion , but the target of this operation is an improved cease - fire , and if that can come without the invasion , fine , ” said a close aide to Mr. Barak , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he is not Mr. Barak ’s authorized spokesman .
“ But , of course , Hamas has to agree , and there has to be a mechanism to make it work . ”
In Paris , where Mr. Kouchner was meeting with his European Union colleagues over the Gaza crisis , he called publicly for a permanent cease - fire .
A similar call came from the so - called quartet of powers focused on the region  the United Nations , the European Union , the United States and Russia .
President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice made phone calls to Israeli and Arab leaders to explore prospects for halting the fighting .
They emphasized that any cease - fire should be “ durable and sustainable , ” compelling Hamas to end its rocket attacks , a State Department spokesman said .
“ That is different from the cease - fire that existed in the last six months , ” said the spokesman , Gordon Duguid , noting that Hamas had routinely violated the previous agreement by firing rockets into southern Israel .

The flurry of diplomacy appeared to be mostly byplay in Jerusalem and Gaza , as Israeli officials spoke of a continuing and expanding military operation , and Hamas vowed to step up its resistance .
Israeli warplanes attacked tunnels used to smuggle supplies in southern Gaza and destroyed the home of a top militant leader .
Mr. Olmert told the Israeli president , Shimon Peres , that the airstrikes were the first of several planned phases , according to spokesmen for the officials .
It was also clear that the number of targets available from the air was declining , making the likelihood of a ground offensive greater .
In Gaza , Hamas militants issued a taped statement vowing revenge for those killed in the Israeli air raids since Saturday and warning that a ground invasion would prove painful for Israel .
Palestinian officials say that more than 370 people have been killed , among them , the United Nations says , at least 62 women and children and an unknown number of civilian men .
Two sisters , ages 4 and 11 , were killed in a strike in the north as concern was growing around the world that the assault was taking a terrible toll on civilians .
“ It would be easier to dry the sea of Gaza than to defeat the resistance and uproot Hamas , which is in every house of Gaza , ” said the statement from the military wing of Hamas .
It was played on Hamas ’s television station , which had been shut down by an Israeli missile but went back on the air by broadcasting from a mobile van .
The statement added that if there was a ground invasion , “ the children of Gaza will be collecting the body parts of your soldiers and the ruins of tanks . ”
Hamas continued to fire longer - range rockets at Israel , shooting deep into the city of Ashdod for a second day as well as into Beersheba , a major city in Israel ’s south , where one landed in an empty kindergarten classroom .
There was a report of light injuries as well as a number of people in shock .
Israeli warplanes , returning repeatedly to the same section of Gaza City overnight , pummeled the main government complex with about 20 missiles , residents said Tuesday .
The building had been evacuated since the start of the operation on Saturday , which also hit nearly all of Hamas ’s security complexes , its university and other symbols of its sovereignty and power .
The Nakhala family , which lives next to the compound , was inspecting the damage on Tuesday morning and recounting the utter fear and panic they all felt as the missiles hit .
“ We have no shelters in Gaza , ” said the father , Osama Nakhala .
“ Where shall we go ?
I also have to worry about my mother , who is 80 years old and paralyzed . ”

Scientists have characterised a new form of elemental boron - a notoriously hard element to synthesise in a pure form - and found that ionic bonding helps hold the structure together .
There are at least 16 known polymorphs of boron , but only three of these are thought to correspond to the pure element .
Now Artem Oganov from Stony Brook University , New York , US , and colleagues have made a new structure to add to the list .
Termed gamma - boron , their new form of boron is made up of two forms of boron clusters - B 2 pairs and B 12 icosahedra - arranged in a sodium chloride type structure .
’ When I first saw the structure I was very surprised , ’ says Oganov .
B 2 pairs and B 12 icosahedra - clusters of twelve boron atoms arranged in a regular 20 sided polyhedron - are well known in boron chemistry , but Oganov ’s team found that differences in electronegativity between the two forms led to partial ionic bonding .
’ It is , say , 90 per cent covalent , ’ says Oganov .
’ But the ionic component is significant and that is something that we really did n’t expect . ’
The B 2 pairs and B 12 icosahedra act as anions and cations , respectively , affecting other properties of the material such as the IR spectrum and electronic bandgap .
Unlike other polymorphs such as alpha- and beta - boron , gamma - boron does not become metallic at increased pressure .
The new form of boron has also shed light on the element ’s previously unknown phase diagram , helping to map the element ’s phase changes in response to pressure and temperature .
’ We have found a phase which has a gigantic stability field . ’
Oganov told Chemistry World .
Between 19 and 89 GPa the new form of boron is more stable than any other structure , and it also keeps its structure at room temperature and pressure .
’ We have been able to find a key to the phase diagram of boron , ’ says Oganov .
’ It has been really embarrassing that boron was the only element for which the phase diagram was simply unknown - now we know a little bit more about how this element works ’
The team determined the structure of the new material using a computational technique that allowed them to predict the most favourable positions of the atoms from just the chemical formula .
’ It ’s a big step in understanding the phase diagram of boron , ’ says Mikhail Eremets at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany .
He was also impressed by the team ’s ability to predict and determine such complex structures .
’ It ’s an example of fundamental breakthrough of understanding of quite a complex system . ’

For a long time , we 've been hearing that Medicare Advantage programs , the private insurance wing of Medicare the Bush administration costs taxpayers more than previous government Medicare .
Today , in response to a request by Rep. Pete Stark ( D - Cal ) , the Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) issued a Medicare Advantage Organizations : Actual Expenses and Profits Compared to Projections for 2006 .
leaving little doubt .
Roughly 83.3 percent of the $ 10 billion dollars private insurance companies received from the federal government in 2006 were spent on direct care .
The rest . . . well see for yourself .
Highlights of the startling findings from the GAO :
How Medicaid Advantage ( MA ) works :
" Payments to MA organizations are , in part , based on the projected expenditures organizations submit in their bids for providing Medicare - covered services , as well as actual enrollment and beneficiary health status .
Once Medicare payments are determined , they are not modified based on differences between actual and projected expenses .
3 MA organizations are not required to submit claims data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) -- the agency that administers Medicare -- but they must report actual expenditures for the year 2 years prior to the upcoming contract year . "
" If MA organizations had more accurately projected their revenues and expenses in 2005 , they would have been able to provide beneficiaries with additional benefits or cost - sharing reductions , and still maintain the level of profits projected . "
Results :
" On average , MA organizations reported earning profits of 6.6 percent of total revenue in 2006 -- which was higher than their projected profits of 4.1 percent . "
Official response :
" CMS stated that the finding was not relevant to assessment of the MA program "
Why ?
" CMS officials stated that changes in the mix and health status of projected versus actually enrolled beneficiaries may have produced differences between actual expenditures and projections . "
Results :
" MA organizations included in our analysis received $ 1.7 billion more in revenues than projected , based on the actual number of enrolled beneficiaries .
. . increased payments were not accompanied by commensurately higher - than - projected expenses "
Says it all :
" Profits and Non-Medical Expenses Were Higher While Medical Expenses Were Lower Than Projected , on Average "
Offered under the rubric of choice , it appears as if the choices are all too clear : do you want insurance companies to earn more or less for a lot of less for people on Medicare Advantage ?
Or , who gets the " advantage " in Medicare Advantage ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - General Motors
Corp should replace its chief executive if it receives emergency government loans to avert likely collapse , a U.S. senator drafting bailout legislation said on Sunday .
Another senior Democrat involved in the matter said negotiators expected a final deal by Monday , but he was less sure whether there was enough support in Congress to help GM , Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC .
“ Obviously , that ’s a much more complicated question as to whether the votes are there , ” Sen . Carl Levin of Michigan told “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd of Connecticut said on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” that GM and Chrysler , also facing a likely near - term bankruptcy without help , should probably merge .
“ I think it ’s clear GM is in the worst shape .
Chrysler is , I think , basically gone , ” Dodd said as Democrats and the White House continued negotiations on terms for a $ 15 billion bailout of the distressed industry .
GM and Chrysler recently explored a merger .
Dodd said management changes have to be part of conditions for a bailout to help the companies restructure , but that does not mean an across - the - board housecleaning .
“ Ford is fairly healthy , so we do n’t want to brand all of these companies exactly the same way , ” Dodd said .
Dodd agreed with suggestions by fellow lawmakers that GM should probably consider replacing CEO Rick Wagoner and restructure with a new team .
“ I think he has to move on , ” Dodd said .
Auto industry management has been criticized in Congress for failing to innovate and take other steps to better position their companies to compete against leaner foreign competitors and weather financial downturns .
Wagoner has risen through the management ranks since joining GM in the late 1970s and is the longest serving chief executive at the Detroit Three companies .
He became president and chief executive in 2000 .
He now serves as chairman and CEO .
Ford ’s Alan Mulally and Chrysler ’s Bob Nardelli are recent arrivals .
Wagoner says he serves at the pleasure of the GM board and hopes to stay on to see GM through its worst crisis .
In response to Dodd , a company spokesman said Wagoner has the support of company employees , suppliers and dealers .
“ Its board of directors all support Rick Wagoner and is confident he is the person to lead GM through these difficult times , ” spokesman Steve Harris said .
" I am the greatest ! " the great boxer Muhammad Ali famously declared — later adding , " I said that even before I knew I was . "
According to a new study published in the journal Psychological Science , Ali 's opinion of himself echoes the self - esteem in much of today 's youth , who are more confident in themselves and their skills than earlier generations .
Some think the pendulum may have swung too far .
Researchers compared responses from teens in 1975 and 2006 , asking questions about their qualities and abilities .
The study , published last month , found that today 's kids consider themselves to be far more intelligent and capable than their 1970s counterparts , and more likely to report being " completely satisfied " with themselves .
The concern that teens — and especially young women — have low self - esteem has been around for decades , fueled by alarmist media reports and feminist authors such as Naomi Wolf ( in her international bestseller " The Beauty Myth " ) .
The supposed self esteem crisis has been blamed on everything from thin fashion models to gender bias in the classroom , yet there 's little evidence for a nationwide lack of low self esteem among girls or anyone else .
The new study confirms polls and surveys that find most Americans generally happy with themselves .
In one of the largest surveys ever taken of American youth , a 1998 poll surveyed more than a quarter of a million grade - school students ; 93 percent of teens said they feel good about themselves .
In fact , according to the study 's co-author , associate professor of psychology at San Diego State University Jean Twenge , for today 's youth " confidence has crossed over into overconfidence . "
Too much self - esteem ( overconfidence ) may be just as damaging as too little self - esteem .
Twenge and other researchers believe that the decades of efforts to boost self - esteem may have created unrealistic expectations in today 's youth , and their inflated self - esteem may lead to a sense of entitlement : " I 'm great , so I deserve great things . "
Despite the popular beliefs , the vast majority of teens are quite satisfied with their bodies , appearance , intelligence , and capabilities .
Efforts to instill self - esteem may have done their job too well , and like Muhammad Ali , most people feel pretty good about themselves — whether they should or not .

An environmental advocacy groupâ€™s tests of river water and ash near the site of a huge coal ash spill in East Tennessee showed levels of arsenic , lead , chromium and other metals at 2 to 300 times higher than drinking water standards , the group said Thursday .
The findings far exceed levels reported by the Tennessee Valley Authority , the Environmental Protection AgencyÂ or theÂ TennesseeÂ Department of Environment and Conservation .
Those agencies have reported elevated levels of thallium , lead and arsenic found near the spill but have not released the full results of those tests .
The T.V.A. and the state have released only the results of tests on water sampled from the Tennessee River just after the spill at a spot six miles away and upstream of the ash flow , which showed that the water at that spot met drinking standards .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The ash spill , which appears to be the largest in the countryâ€™s history , occurred Dec. 22 when an earthen dike at the Kingston Fossil Plant , a T.V.A. coal utility , gave way , spreading a billion gallons of wet coal ash , known to contain heavy metals , across about 300 acres and into tributaries of the Tennessee River .

CUBS 2008 results | Depth chart | Season stats | Playoff stats 2008 results | Depth chart | Season stats | Playoff stats LOS ANGELES  Somebody at MLB.com did some fancy math and determined that , with all four baseball playoff series standing at 2 - 0 , there was a 42.61 % chance that at least one of those teams trailing 0 - 2 would rally to win the series .
Well , turns out Math did n't do the Chicago Cubs any good in avoiding an embarrassing division series sweep against the underdog Los Angeles Dodgers .
Geography was a bust for the Cubs , too .
Home - field advantage ?
Pfft .
Do n't even mention History .
( Last Cubs World Series title : 1908 . )
And , of course , P.E. was a nightmare , especially down the stretch Saturday night , when some Cubs batters maybe would have been better off not dressing out .
But it 's all over now .
School 's out for the Cubbies , unless they want to use their unexpected spare time brushing up on their Home Economics skills .
Have a cool winter .
See ya next year .
How a team with the best record in the National League could flunk this badly and depart so early in the playoffs is a little mysterious .
Or maybe not , seeing as how the Cubs were outpitched , outhit and out - fielded .
So , in the bitter end , the Cubs did more cursing than curse - breaking .
That 's baseball .
Teams go cold .
Teams get hot .
This was an extreme example , which turned the 84 - victory Dodgers into a mismatch winner against the 97 - victory Cubs .
Both teams realized — one in a silent clubhouse , the other in one soaked in champagne and beer — that numbers like 97 and 84 meant absolutely nothing Saturday night .
" What happens in the regular season does n't matter , " Dodgers catcher Russell Martin said .
" I could n't care less what anybody does in the regular season .
We 're doing it when it counts — in October . "
Cubs outfielder Alfonso Soriano , 1 for 14 in the series and a strikeout victim for the final out of the Cubs ' season , had to agree .
" We had the best team in the league , but we did n't play good as a team in the playoffs , " Soriano said .
" We had a good team , but we 've got to get it done in the postseason . "
And there was this from Cubs catcher Geovany Soto : " It does n't matter how many games we won in the regular season .
What did it do for us ? "
Nothing .
The swaggering Dodgers mashed the Cubs in Wrigley Field in Games 1 and 2 and then had all the runs they 'd need after one inning in Dodger Stadium , courtesy of James Loney 's two - run double off Cubs starter Rich Harden .
The Cubs ?
They seemingly could have gone another nine innings and not come up with enough runs to win .
That , alone , was what Cubs manager Lou Piniella said lost the series for his team .
He 'd seen it before .
Last year , his Cubs were expected to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks and got swept , scoring one run in Game 1 , four runs in Game 2 and one run in Game 3 .
This year , it was three runs in Game 1 , two runs in Game 2 , one run in Game 3 .
" I actually was concerned , to be honest with you , about our offense heading into the playoffs , " Piniella said .
Why ?
" Because of last year , " he said .
" My concerns was realized . "
Up and down the lineup .
Soriano was the most obvious black hole , hitting .071 and failing to score a run or drive in a run .
Third baseman Aramis Ramirez hit .182 with zero RBI .
Really , only two Cubs — Derrek Lee ( 6 for 11 ) and Mark DeRosa ( 4 for 12 ) were the only Cubs hitters who lived up to expectations .
" We just did n't hit , " Piniella said .
" I 'm not making excuses .
But you 've got to score some runs .
" We were expecting more .
We played well during the summer .
We won our division convincingly .
And I thought we'd go further .
But six runs in three games ?
You do that during the regular season and you 're 0 - 3 , just like in the postseason .
" Look , if you score six runs in a three - game series , it 's going to be another 100 years before we win a World Series . "
Quick , somebody run the numbers on a 200 - year championship drought .

SILVERADO CANYON , Calif. , Jan. 11 ( UPI ) -- A California father says he discovered his 13 - year - old daughter sent 484 text messages per day last month -- one message every 2 minutes of every waking hour .
Greg Hardesty of Silverado Canyon , Calif. , told the New York Post his 440 - page cell phone bill revealed his daughter Reina had sent an astonishing 14,528 text messages .

" First , I laughed .
I thought , ' That 's insane , that 's impossible , ' " said Hardesty , 45 , a reporter for The Orange County Register .
" And I immediately whipped out the calculator to see if it was humanly possible . "
Hardesty said Reina had messaged a core of " four obsessive texters , " all girls between the ages of 12 and 13 .
Luckily , he was on an unlimited text messaging plan or his bill would have been $ 2,905 at a rate of 20 cents per message , the Post reported .
Hardesty told the newspaper he and his ex-wife have placed restrictions on Reina 's cellphone use , ruling she cannot text after dinner .
When it comes to texting , it appears Reina has much in common with a New Zealand teenager .
It was reported last month that Hannah Brooke , 16 , of Wellington frequently uses up the 6,000 messages she 's allowed each month and borrows phones from friends to keep on texting .

Sudan country profile Published duration 9 September 2019
Sudan , once the largest and one of the most geographically diverse states in Africa , split into two countries in July 2011 after the people of the south voted for independence .
The government of Sudan gave its blessing to an independent South Sudan , where the mainly Christian and Animist people had for decades been struggling against rule by the Arab Muslim north .
However , various outstanding issues - especially the question of shared oil revenues and border demarcation - have continued to create tensions between the two successor states .
Sudan has long been beset by conflict .
Two rounds of north - south civil war cost the lives of 1.5 million people , and a continuing conflict in the western region of Darfur has driven two million people from their homes and killed more than 200,000 .

Lieutenant - General Abdel Fattah al - Burhan was sworn in as chairman of Sudan 's ruling Transitional Military Council on 12 April 2019 , a day after the army overthrew veteran President Omar al - Bashir .
This followed months of street protests against President Bashir 's authoritarian rule .
The military said the Council would Sudan through a two - year transition to civilian rule , but opposition groups demanded a quicker transfer , and the African Union and Ethiopia negotiated a power - sharing deal that put a joint civilian - military government in place in September .
Lt - Gen Burhan has been accused of involvement in atrocities during military operations against non-Arab civilians in Darfur in 2003 , when he was chief of ground forces .

Success in the City may go hand in hand with finger length
The length of a man 's fingers may predict his success in the City , research findings suggest .
Scientists at Cambridge University found that financial traders whose ring fingers are longer than their index fingers make the most money .
The link could be down to testosterone exposure in the womb , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences says .
This exposure may improve rapid decision - making skills and has been linked with aggression .
The same ring - to - index finger ratio , which is determined in the womb , has previously been associated with success in competitive sports .
Researcher John Coates and his team reported last year that testosterone seemed to boost short term success at finance after they found City traders with higher levels of the male hormone in the morning were more likely to make an unusually big profit that day .
Aggression hormone
Their latest findings are based on a study of 44 men working as traders in London , some of whom earned more than £ 4 million a year .
Over 20 months those traders with longer ring fingers made 11 times more money than those with the shortest ring fingers relative to their index fingers .
This " biological " impact on success was about equal to years of experience at the job .
The most experienced traders made about nine times more than the least experienced ones .
When the researchers looked only at the experienced traders , those with longer ring fingers earned far more than those with shorter ring fingers - £ 838,000 compared to £ 154,000 on average , respectively .
The scientists believe that exposure to the " aggression " hormone testosterone in the womb may have improved the traders ' concentration and honed reflexes necessary to follow prices and make trades on extremely short notice .
This suggests that success on the financial markets is influenced by biology as much as experience , the researchers told PNAS .
Meanwhile , Belgian researchers have found men with longer ring fingers become less " socially minded " - less willing to give money to a fellow participant - after watching aggressive movies .
The reverse was also true - those with shorter ring fingers gave away the most money .
Lead researcher Kobe Millet said : " These results tell us that levels of testosterone people are exposed to before birth go on to affect their behaviour throughout their lives . "
He said studies suggested similar associations with finger length are also seen in women .

Ex-trade minister Lord Digby Jones says he was " amazed " to discover how many civil servants " deserved the sack " .
He told a committee of MPs he thought the civil service could " frankly ... be done with half as many " people .
The ex-CBI chief described being a junior minister as " one of the most dehumanising and depersonalising experiences " anyone could have .
Lord Jones spent a year as a minister as part of Gordon Brown 's original " government of all the talents " .
Lord Jones said he applauded the practice of bringing outside specialists into government by making them peers and called it " an excellent idea " .
I was amazed , quite frankly , at how many people deserved the sack
Lord Jones
Nick Robinson 's thoughts
He described the civil service as " honest , stuffed full of decent people who work hard " .
But he added : " Frankly the job could be done with half as many , it could be more productive , more efficient , it could deliver a lot more value for money for the taxpayer .
" I was amazed , quite frankly , at how many people deserved the sack and yet that was the one threat that they never ever worked under , because it does n't exist . "
Transcend factionalism Lord Jones ' period as a minister proved colourful and at times controversial and Jonathan Baume , general secretary of the senior civil servants ' union the FDA , said he was " disappointed but not surprised " at the latest comments given the ex-minister 's " traditionally maverick approach " .
Mr Baume said the government 's love of launching initiatives - and the current economic crisis - meant that there was an argument for more civil servants rather than less .
And he suggested that it might be better to halve the number of ministers - back to the levels that served the Churchill government well during the Second World War .
During his appearance before the public administration committee Lord Jones said the job of junior minister was " one of the most dehumanising and depersonalising experiences a human being can have .
The whole system is designed to take the personality , the drive and the initiative out of a junior minister " .
Lord Jones stepped down as a government minister in Gordon Brown 's reshuffle in October , saying it was not a judgement on Mr Brown 's performance .
His appointment in July 2007 was controversial at the time because he was not a member of the Labour Party .
He countered that criticism by saying that the job of promoting trade and investment " should transcend the factionalism of party politics " .
Lord Jones has been involved in some controversy during his time in the job - notably when he expressed concerns about plans to tax " non-domiciled " foreigners in Britain .

The Klein Bottle is a math joke , a surface with one side .
Just as it's about to enclose space like a regular bottle , it curves back with a twist and the inner face merges with the outer – and suddenly inside and outside are one , like the side of a Möbius strip .
This neat trick can't quite exist in three dimensions , since the surface has to cross through itself , but at least we can make approximate models .
This one is 3D printed in stainless steel , with some bronze for color .
It 's durable , washable and ergonomic , sized to fit the hand sweetly .
It 's the perfect finishing touch for any math fan 's kitchen , and you do n't have to know a lot of geometry to enjoy it .
Yes , it really opens bottles !
Although the interior ministry said that the protesters numbered just over one million , they were the biggest since Mr Sarkozy came to power in 2007 and on a par with the last huge demonstration , in March 2006 , which hastened the exit of the prime minister of the time , Dominique de Villepin .

We 've all been there :
You 're at a party hosted by that one fabulous friend , and populated with the best of your mutual circle of friends .
The atmosphere is almost carbonated with excitement ; the guests ' personalities flawlessly compliment each other ; and the conversations that abound are infused with intelligence , caustic wit , and a wide variety of knowledge that ensures the complete absence of any pregnant , awkward pauses .
Then , it happens : someone appears who just does n't ... fit .
A similar phenom happens on Twitter .
You 're having conversations with your established Twitter friends , you 're broadcasting useful information , news , or links to your followers , and you 're " engaging your Tribe , " etc. , when suddenly , someone begins following you who , much like that previously referenced party guest , just does n't fit .
This is the person whose follow on Twitter you simply cannot bring yourself to return .
This is the follow fail .
Run any number of searches on Google or Alexa and you will arrive at a veritable host of articles offering endless lists of tips on " how to get more followers on Twitter . "
What you will not find are lists compiled by Twitter " power users " regarding the major reasons why they will or will not return a Twitter follower 's follow when it happens , and this is my gift to you : " The Top Ten Reasons Why * I* Will Not Follow You In Return On Twitter . "
1 . You have no user avatar
... or your user avatar is neither a personalized photograph nor reflective of a brand .
More important than whether or not your Twitter profile background is " designed " is how you choose to present yourself in that seemingly insignificant 48x48 pixel square .
If that square is empty , impersonal , or otherwise lacking any qualities that will immediately allow me to visually associate it with you , that is an immediate Follow Fail .
If I am going to build a Twitter relationship with you , I want to see you , or your brand , and not , however humorous I may find it , a screen capture of a magical leoplurodon .
2 . You list no location , no website , or no bio
Clearly , Twitter is all about brevity .
So how difficult is it to provide a few additional characters of information that may offer potential followers more impetus to follow you in return ?
I 've returned countless follows from users whose Twitter streams I 've found " meh , " but whose listed blogs , sites , or portfolios were too amazing to not follow , or whose 160 - character bios were too humorous / intriguing to pass up , or who were in the same city as me and therefore potential project collaborators .
These fields take two seconds to populate ; it would behoove you to take those two seconds to populate them .
3. Your " website " listed is a MySpace profile
...or , far worse , an Angel Fire " page . "
I 'll admit it : I had a MySpace profile ... until I deleted it a year ago when it became obvious that only teenagers and musicians were still using it .
I also had a GeoCities / Angel Fire " page " ... for my very first website when I first got on the Internet in 1994 .
If the Twitter user in question happens to be an actual teenager , or musician whose MySpace presence truly works for them , then fine .
But I tend to pass over those users whose proffered web presence is , well , clearly doing it wrong .
It does n't take much these days to establish a web presence that seems genuine and thoughtful , and appears to intend to attract and build an online community based on the content it provides .
Angel
Fire pages simply do n't communicate that .
4 . You 're following over 1,000 users , have 20 followers , and no updates
...or , worse , one update that includes a shamefully ill - constructed mention of Jason Calacanis .
Who , aside from those running Twitter apps that automatically follow and unfollow followers , would add these Twitter users ?
While I may every so often and uncharacteristically give these users a chance , simply to see what sort of content , if any , they may eventually provide , the gratuitous mention of any higher - profile Twitterer or web - famous personality means little more to me than that you were properly able to spell " Calacanis " or " Kawasaki . "
5 . Your profile features any variation of " Internet expert "
... or " social media expert " and you have very few and / or insubstantial updates .
While I generally loathe any mention of the word " expert " in a Twitter bio , it is particularly egregious when paired with a Twitter stream of only five updates , or one with a plethora of updates that make me question your " expert " status .
You 're an " expert " who is only now tweeting about a Twitter app that everyone else was tweeting about two months ago ?
How awesome for you !
# instantfollowfail
6 . Your updates clearly indicate that your Twitter activity is always , only , about pushing your own service / product
So , you have decided to use Twitter as an online marketing tool in order to sell your amazing service and / or product , and you make this glaringly obvious .
I find this fabulous , because not only must this tactic be working for you , but it also allows me to immediately decide whether or not I want to follow you in return .
Since I do not use Twitter in this manner , I rarely follow any of these users in return , unless said product or service genuinely piques my interest / desire to support it .
7 . Your following and my return follow result in a poorly - constructed auto - DM reading , " Thx for the follow !
How can I help you get to a 4 - Hour Work Week ? "
I 've several Twitter friends who employ the automatic direct message tool upon any new follows , but their messages are carefully crafted and , well , thoughtful , and go far beyond the garden variety " click my junk " automatic direct message .
As I am an intelligent , savvy , thinking Twitter user , I am more than capable of reading all about how you can help me get to a 4 - hour work week by consulting your Twitter stream , Twitter background , or website .
An impersonal automatic direct message from you along these lines does not impress me , it insults my intelligence .
8 . Your most recent updates make references to any need to achieve " more Twitter followers "
... or " enough new followers to reach 10,000 followers by midnight ! "
For me , Twitter is not a shallow popularity contest , it is about forging interesting connections and conversations with other people .
My Twitter followers are far more to me than a simple follower count : they are friends , they are colleagues , they are collaborators , they are peers , and they are sources .
To follow someone in return whose only intent is clearly to acquire more followers would be to devalue the esteem with which I hold my other followers .
9 . Your Twitter stream indicates a propensity for consistent arguing
... with your followers / random
Twitter users / really anyone .
I am all for intelligent debate on any topic , and I 've been lucky so far in meeting Twitter followers who are still able to politely debate about a variety of passionate topics without constant and vitriolic argumentation .
If your Twitter stream is filled with nothing but mean - spirited opinions and argumentation that only advance your own beliefs and allow no consideration of others ' views , then my Twitter stream is definitely not for you .
10 .
You do not engage your Twitter followers
Probably the most important reason why I will not return your follow , though , is if it is glaringly obvious that you do not engage your Twitter followers .
Here I suppose I need to make a distinction between those Twitter users who use Twitter to broadcast their content , as opposed to everyone else ; these broadcasters , in my experience , are generally the ones who are followed , not those who are following .
Obviously , engaging their followers is not a priority .
Twitter is a major platform in social networking and social media , and they are n't called " social " networking and " social " media for nothing .
There are other people out there , and if you are not engaging or interacting with those users who take the time to follow you for whatever reason , that is a huge follow fail in my book .
The three tenets
My list is n't perfect , and it is definitely personal and therefore biased , but it is a start toward exploring the differences between a successful Twitter follow attempt and an outright follow fail .
In the end , and to return to those previously referenced lists of " how to get more followers on Twitter , " I think there are really only three tenets that should be followed should you desire to build a successful and quality Twitter network :
1. Present a cohesive personal brand , or , if presenting a brand is too much for you , simply present a cohesive sense of yourself 2 .
Always be consistent in your use of Twitter , i.e. , become known for the unique ways in which you use Twitter , and stick with what works for you 3 .
Engage with your network .
Genuine engagement with your network of followers will ultimately ensure that your mobile number is retained , and not " lost , " at the end of that fabulous party , and it will ensure that you do n't ( too often ) commit any serious follow fails .
What do you consider follow fails ?

New York ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As 2009 approaches , plummeting oil prices have sent the price of gasoline to the lowest level in nearly five years , according to a daily survey of gas station credit card swipes .
Gas prices fell for the tenth consecutive day Monday , according to motorist group AAA .
Regular unleaded fell to an average of $ 1.619 a gallon , the lowest since gas hit $ 1.617 a gallon in January 2004 .
Prices are down nearly $ 2.50 , or more than 60 % , since hitting a record average high of $ 4.114 a gallon this July .
Prices have plummeted along with the price of crude oil , the main ingredient in gas , as the current economic has crisis intensified and threatened demand for petroleum - based fuels .
Oil has shed more than $ 100 a barrel since July .
" When you have the price for the raw material drop over $ 100 a barrel , that 's why you see the price of gasoline drop , " said AAA spokesman Troy Green .
In the United States , the world 's largest oil consumer , citizens drove 100 billion fewer miles during the 12 - month period between November 2007 and October 2008 compared with the prior year , according to the U.S. Department of Transportation .
And crude demand in China fell 3.2 % in November compared to the prior year due to lower imports and a decline in refinery usage , according to estimates compiled by Reuters .
Gas may continue to sell at record lows heading into 2009 unless economic activity shows some sign of recovery , according to Green .
Usually gas prices rise in the spring as Americans take to the road .
" Will the economy be in such bad shape that we do n't see that typical runup ? " posed Green .
State prices : Prices remained above $ 2 a gallon in only two states Monday : Alaska ( $ 2.518 ) and Hawaii ( $ 2.332 ) .
Gas was cheapest in Missouri at $ 1.419 a gallon on average , and sold for less than $ 1.50 on average in ten states .
Diesel : Meanwhile the price of diesel fuel , which is used in most trucks and commercial vehicles , fell to $ 2.435 on average Monday .
The AAA figures , compiled by Oil Price Information Services , are state - wide averages based on credit card swipes at up to 100,000 service stations across the nation .
The Jewish social philosophy class at Yeshiva University was supposed to focus on repentance , but there seemed to be too much to atone for .
In the eyes of the students , Bernard L. Madoff had deceived scores of people , turned billions of dollars into dust and ruined many lives .
So instead , the graduate seminar of 15 began by debating whether Mr. Madoff ’s actions were sins , and whether it mattered that he was Jewish .
One by one , the students in Rabbi Norman Linzer ’s class last week wrestled with the headlines and their emotions .
Some said Mr. Madoff ’s religious affiliation was irrelevant ; others worried that his Judaism might tarnish their own , that outside eyes would not be able to see past his faith .
Since Mr. Madoff was charged by federal prosecutors with orchestrating a $ 50 billion fraud , each day has brought new pain to the nation ’s best - known Jewish institution of higher education  word that another familiar charity tied to Jewish causes had been thrust into financial uncertainty , another university family ’s savings depleted .
Yeshiva , a campus of about 7,000 students in Upper Manhattan , is grappling with a sense of personal betrayal that extends beyond the $ 110 million it says it lost in investments with Mr. Madoff , who had been on the board of trustees since 1996 .
There is resentment ; fear of the revival of ugly , old stereotypes ; and , after the fall of a favorite son , uncertainty about how Jewish institutions like theirs should choose role models .
Exclusive : Cheney ’s admissions to the CIA leak prosecutor and FBI
crooksandliars.com
Murray Wass
Vice President Dick Cheney , according to a still - highly confidential FBI report , admitted to federal investigators that he rewrote talking points for the press in July 2003 that made it much more likely that the role of then - covert CIA - officer Valerie Plame in sending her husband on a CIA - sponsored mission to Africa would come to light .
Cheney conceded during his interview with federal investigators that in drawing attention to Plame ’s role in arranging her husband ’s Africa trip reporters might also unmask her role as CIA officer .
Cheney denied to the investigators , however , that he had done anything on purpose that would lead to the outing of Plame as a covert CIA operative .
But the investigators came away from their interview with Cheney believing that he had not given them a plausible explanation as to how he could focus attention on Plame ’s role in arranging her husband ’s trip without her CIA status also possibly publicly exposed .
At the time , Plame was a covert CIA officer involved in preventing Iran from obtaining weapons of mass destruction , and Cheney ’s office played a central role in exposing her and nullifying much of her work .
Cheney revised the talking points on July 8 , 2003 ″ “ the very same day that his then - chief of staff , I. Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby , met with New York Times reporter Judith Miller and told Miller that Plame was a CIA officer and that Plame had also played a central role in sending her husband on his CIA sponsored trip to the African nation of Niger .
Both Cheney and Libby have acknowledged that Cheney directed him to meet with Miller , but claimed that the purpose of that meeting was to leak other sensitive intelligence to discredit allegations made by Plame ’s husband , former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV , that the Bush administration misrepresented intelligence information to go to war with Iraq , rather than to leak Plame ’s identity .
That Cheney , by his own admission , had revised the talking points in an effort to have the reporters examine who sent Wilson on the very same day that his chief of staff was disclosing to Miller Plame ’s identity as a CIA officer may be the most compelling evidence to date that Cheney himself might have directed Libby to disclose Plame ’s identity to Miller and other reporters .
This new information adds to a growing body of evidence that Cheney may have directed Libby to disclose Plame ’s identity to reporters and that Libby acted to protect Cheney by lying to federal investigators and a federal grand jury about the matter .
Still , for those in search of the proverbial “ smoking gun ”  , the question as to whether Cheney directed Libby to leak Plaime ’s identity to the media at Cheney ’s direction or Libby did so on his own by acting over zealously in carrying out a broader mandate from Cheney to discredit Wilson and his allegations about manipulation of intelligence information , will almost certainly remain an unresolved one .
Libby was convicted on March 6 , 2007 of four felony counts of lying to federal investigators , perjury , and obstruction of justice , in attempting to conceal from authorities his own role , and that of other Bush administration officials , in leaking information to the media about Plame .
One of the jurors in the case , Dennis Collins , told the press shortly after the verdict that he and many other jurors believed that Libby was serving as a “ fall guy ”  for Cheney , and had lied to conceal the role of his boss in directing information about Plame to be leaked to the press .
The special prosecutor in the CIA leak case , Patrick Fitzgerald , said in both opening and closing arguments that because Libby did not testify truthfully during the course of his investigation , federal authorities were stymied from determining what role Vice President Cheney possibly played in directing the leaking of information regarding Plame that led to the end of her career as a covert CIA officer , and jeopardized other sensitive intelligence information .
Speaking of the consequences of Libby ’s deceit to the FBI and a federal grand jury , Fitzgerald , who is also the U.S. attorney for Chicago , said in his Feb. 20 , 2007 closing argument : “ There is talk about a cloud over the Vice President .
There is a cloud over the White House as to what happened .
Do you think the FBI , the Grand Jury , the American people are entitled to a straight answer ? ” 

Newswise —
When cells are under stress , they blow off steam by releasing minute amounts of nitrogen oxides and other toxic gases .
In a recent paper , * researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) described a new method for creating gas detectors so sensitive that some day they may be able to register these tiny emissions from a single cell , providing a new way to determine if drugs or nanoparticles harm cells or to study how cells communicate with one another .
Based on metal oxide nanotubes , the new sensors are a hundred to 1,000 times more sensitive than current devices based on thin films and are able to act as multiple sensors simultaneously .
Gas sensors often operate by detecting the subtle changes that deposited gas molecules make in the way electricity moves through a surface layer .
Thus , the more surface available , the more sensitive the sensor will be .
Scientists are interested in developing gas sensors based on nanotubes because , having walls that are only a few nanometers thick , they are almost all surface .
Although nanotubes have proven to be well suited for gas sensing applications , fabricating the devices themselves is a difficult , imprecise and time - consuming process , according to Kurt Benkstein , an author of the paper .
Older methods include randomly scattering free nanotubes on a surface with preformed electrical contacts ( the hope being that a least a few of the nanotubes would tumble into place ) or laying contacts over the top of the nanotubes after they had been dispersed , among others .
These methods , though they can result in functional devices , preclude researchers from knowing where exactly the reactions are happening on the substrate .
This makes it impossible to do multiple simultaneous tests .
Also , these sensors are not as sensitive as they could be because there is no way to ensure that the gas is reacting with the interior of the tube .
To address these problems , the NIST group built upon another design using a sheet of aluminum oxide about the thickness of a human hair and perforated with millions of holes about 200 nanometers wide .
With the nanosized pores serving as a mold , the researchers dipped the aluminum oxide sheet in a solution of tungsten ions , coating the interior of the pores and casting the nanotubes in place .
After the nanotubes were formed , the team deposited thin layers of gold on the top and bottom of the aluminum oxide membrane to act as electrical contacts .
View schematic of the nanotube sensor .
The sensor 's high sensitivity derives from its design , which ensures that any sensor response is the result of the gas interacting with the interior of the nanotube .
The researchers also note that this same technique can easily be adapted to form nanotubes of other semiconductors and metal oxides so long as the ends of the nanotubes remain open .

These might be some of the coldest days of the year , but the warm sun has been causing havoc on the interstate highways during the late - morning rush hours lately .
Traffic has come to a near standstill on portions of the highways for eastbound motorists , causing some drivers to head to the exit ramps for fear that there are major accidents ahead .
But what 's been happening in many cases has been a " highway shockwave , " triggered by a bright sun low in the sky .

President - elect Barack Obama said Sunday that some of his campaign promises will have to wait - domestic - policy changes may be on hold because of the dire economic situation , and legal and national security concerns have postponed his promised closure of Guantanamo Bay .
In an interview with ABC ’s “ This Week ” that aired Sunday , Mr. Obama said he has come to realize that his pledge to close the federal detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , within his first 100 days in office wo n’t happen that soon .
When he was campaigning for the presidency , Mr. Obama regularly said the prison “ sends a negative message to the world ” and taints even trade - deal negotiations .
“ To the extent that we are not being true to our values and our ideals , that sends a negative message to the world , and it gives us less leverage then when we want to deal with countries that are abusing human rights , ” he said during a primary - season debate in Iowa in December 2007 .
Guantanamo faded as an issue during the general election campaign because the Republican presidential candidate , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , also wanted to close the facility .
But after Mr. Obama won the presidency , his transition co-chairman , John Podesta , said Nov. 11 that closing Guantanamo was “ under review ” and nothing definitive could be said because the situation is “ complicated . ”
On Sunday , Mr. Obama said that closing Guantanamo Bay was a challenge .
“ We are going to get it done , but part of the challenge that you have is that you have got a bunch of folks that have been detained , many of whom may be very dangerous , who have not been put on trial or have not gone through some adjudication , ” he said .
He said his legal and national security teams strive to balance creating a fair legal process that “ does n’t result in releasing people who are intent on blowing us up . ”
“ I do n’t want to be ambiguous about this , ” Mr. Obama said Sunday .
“ We are going to close Guantanamo , and we are going to make sure that the procedures we set up are ones that abide by our Constitution .
That is not only the right thing to do but it actually has to be part of our broader national security strategy , because we will send a message to the world that we are serious about our values . ”
In the wide - ranging ABC interview , Mr. Obama also said he would take a piece of advice from outgoing Vice President Dick Cheney : that he will not commit to changing interrogation practices until he has all of the information that the current administration holds .
“ I ’m not going to lay out a particular program because , again , I thought that Dick Cheney ’s advice was good , which is that let ’s make sure we know everything that ’s being done , ” Mr. Obama said .
He was responding to the vice president ’s warning in a recent CBS Radio interview that “ before you start to implement your campaign rhetoric , you need to sit down and find out precisely what it is we did and how we did it ” to keep the nation safe .
But Mr. Obama said he disagrees with the vice president and thinks that waterboarding is torture .
The most popular question on the Obama transition team ’s Web site is whether he will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate torture and warrantless wiretapping conducted by the Bush administration .
The transition team did not answer the question , and Mr. Obama on Sunday would not say firmly what he plans to do , in part because he does n’t want CIA officials or others worrying about “ looking over their shoulders ” and legal action .
“ We ’re still evaluating how we are going to approach the whole issue of interrogations , detentions and so forth , ” he said .
“ When it comes to national security , what we have to focus on is getting things right in the future , as opposed to looking at what we got wrong in the past . ”
The president - elect , in the discussion with ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos , also stressed that he would take a “ new approach ” with Iran , but he declined to go into detail about foreign policy , despite the turmoil in the Middle East , until he is sworn in .
The economy dominated the discussion , as Mr. Obama attempted to sell his proposed economic stimulus package as “ bold , ” warned repeatedly that “ tough ” choices will have to be made , and insisted that Congress must pass the plan by mid-February .
Mr. Stephanopoulos asked Mr. Obama whether he is seeking “ some kind of a grand bargain ” that includes tax reform , health care reform and entitlement reform .
Mr. Obama agreed when Mr. Stephanopoulos asked whether he wanted Americans to know that “ everybody … is going to have to sacrifice something , accept change for the greater good . ”
“ Everybody is going to have to give .
Everybody is going to have to have some skin in the game , ” Mr. Obama said during the interview , taped Saturday in Washington .
Mr. Stephanopoulos , who worked in the Clinton White House , asked which campaign promises Mr. Obama will be forced to cut as a result of the grim economic situation .
“ I want to be realistic here :
Not everything that we talked about during the campaign are we going to be able to do on the pace that we had hoped , ” he said .
Mr. Stephanopoulos also pressed Mr. Obama on earmarks , since one of the proposals for his stimulus package is a construction project that would build the Museum of Organized Crime in Las Vegas .
It would create jobs but would smack of the special earmarks that Mr. Obama said would not be inserted into his plan .
Mr. Obama said the museum was proposed by the nation ’s mayors and not by his team , and he would not say whether or not he would fund it .
“ What we have to do is evaluate whether or not these are projects that , as I said , are going to provide long - term benefits to the economy , ” he said .
He said there “ certainly ” will be projects that do n’t fall into his top criterion of health care , energy or education , but that those are his priorities and he does not want the package loaded with pet projects .
Mr. Obama lauded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , for saying recently that she would keep Congress in session rather than adjourning for the Presidents Day recess if the package is not complete by then .
“ Congress exercises all sorts of prerogatives .
They ’ve got all sorts of procedures .
Everybody wants to be heard , ” he said .
“ I ’m respectful of that . …
One of the things that we ’re trying to set a tone of is that , you know , Congress is a co-equal branch of government .
We ’re not trying to jam anything down people ’s throats . ”
He urged patience , saying : “ I think we can fix it .
But it ’s going to take some time . ”
The ABC interview followed Mr. Obama ’s weekly radio address on Saturday , in which he increased the figures for his stimulus plan , saying it could save or create between 3.3 million and 4.1 million jobs , a jump of more than 1 million from his previous estimate .
The president - elect ’s week ahead will be busy .
On Monday , Mr. Obama will meet with Mexican President Felipe Calderon .
The majority of his Cabinet picks face confirmation hearings this week in the Senate .
Mr. Obama said he is confident his attorney - general nominee , Eric Holder , will be confirmed despite expected resistance from Senate Republicans .
He noted that Mr. Holder has said his role in President Clinton ’s pardon of Marc Rich was a mistake , and he insisted no one is more qualified .
“ This is a man of unimpeachable integrity .
I have every confidence that he will be confirmed , ” he said .

It 's a new year and many of us have started thinking about various resolutions : updating that resume , cleaning out the attic , starting that exercise routine .
But the sad reality is that most of us will not follow through on these commitments , not because we 're insincere , but because tomorrow is always a better time to get going .
Procrastination is a curse , and a costly one .
Putting things off leads not only to lost productivity but also to all sorts of hand wringing and regrets and damaged self - esteem .
For all these reasons , psychologists would love to figure out what 's going on in the mind that makes it so hard to actually do what we set out to do .
Are we programmed for postponement and delay ?
Led by Sean McCrea of the University of Konstanz in Germany , an international team of psychologists wanted to see if there might be a link between how we think of a task and our tendency to postpone it .
In other words , are we more likely to see some tasks as psychologically " distant " -- and thus making us save them for later rather than tackling them now ?
The psychologists handed out questionnaires to a group of students and asked them to respond by e-mail within three weeks .
All the questions had to do with rather mundane tasks like opening a bank account and keeping a diary , but different students were given different instructions for answering the questions .
Some thought and wrote about what each activity implied about personal traits : what kind of person has a bank account , for example .
Others wrote simply about the nuts and bolts of doing each activity : speaking to a bank officer , filling out forms , making an initial deposit , and so forth .
The idea was to get some students thinking abstractly and others concretely .
Then the psychologists waited .
And in some cases , waited and waited .
They recorded all the response times to see if there was a difference between the two groups , and indeed there was a significant difference .
The findings , reported in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , were very clear .
Even though all of the students were being paid upon completion , those who thought about the questions abstractly were much more likely to procrastinate -- and in fact some never got around to the assignment at all .
By contrast , those who were focused on the how , when and where of doing the task e-mailed their responses much sooner , suggesting that they hopped right on the assignment rather than delaying it .
The authors note that " merely thinking about the task in more concrete , specific terms makes it feel like it should be completed sooner and thus reducing procrastination . "
They conclude that these results have important implications for teachers and managers who may want their students and employees starting on projects sooner .
In addition , these findings are also relevant for those of us resolving to have better time management skills in the New Year !

Advertisement Lewis Hamilton targeted a second World Championship as McLaren unveiled their new car for the 2009 season .
The Englishman and team - mate Heikki Kovalainen took the wraps off the new Mercedes - powered MP4 - 24 at the team 's base in Surrey .
And 24 - year - old Hamilton said : " This is now my third season and I 've got my targets .
I want the title again . "
Meanwhile , McLaren said Ron Dennis will step down as team principal on 1 March , to be replaced by Martin Whitmarsh .
Hamilton won last year 's title by a single point from Brazilian Ferrari driver Felipe Massa , who has already had a day testing his team 's new car .
The McLaren car is the third to be unveiled ahead of the new season after Ferrari and Toyota 's new models broke cover earlier this week .
And Hamilton said : " The car looks beautiful and it 's great to see the final outcome .
" But I certainly do n't feel any extra pressure being champion .
This season will be a whole new challenge for everyone , including me , because of the rule changes .
" I think this will be a very open season - no - one quite knows what to expect , and that should make it exciting - it's a great prospect for F1 fans . "
606 : DEBATE
If McLaren have got it right this year , they will be very hard to beat
Mr-Foglo Team - mate Kovalainen added : " I 'm fortunate enough to have watched behind the scenes as this year 's car has taken shape and I 've been amazed at just how hard everybody has worked .
" With so many new rules , adapting quickly will be essential and I feel more prepared than ever for the new season . "
Test driver Pedro de la Rosa will give the McLaren its debut in a private test at Portugal 's Algarve circuit on Saturday - the first of a series of critical tests before the start of the new season in Melbourne , Australia on 29 March .
Ferrari , Renault , Williams and Toyota - whose car was unveiled on Thursday - will join McLaren at the new Algarve circuit in Portugal next week .
Renault , fourth last year , and Williams both launch their cars at that test on Monday , while BMW Sauber - third overall in 2008 - have chosen the Valencia track in Spain for the first public appearance of their new model .
All the new cars have been designed to conform to the biggest set of F1 rule changes in 25 years , which are aimed at improving racing and making overtaking easier .
The Algarve test will be the first time Hamilton has driven an F1 car at speed since clinching the title and becoming F1's youngest ever champion in Brazil last November .
Hamilton and Kovalainen pose with their new F1 challenger
He has done a handful of publicity appearances and other engagements since then but has spent much of his time having a break from F1 with his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger , singer with pop group the Pussycat Dolls .
Following the unveiling of the Ferrari in Italy on Monday , much attention will be paid to how the McLaren compares .
New rules have forced modifications which lower and widen the front wing , and demand a tall , narrow rear wing .
Slick , untreaded tyres will also be reintroduced after 11 years on grooved tyres , and teams have the option of employing a kinetic energy recovery system ( Kers ) .
The Kers system stores energy that would otherwise be wasted as heat during braking , then reapplies it during acceleration to provide a boost in power , controlled from the cockpit by the driver .
2009 CAR LAUNCH DATES 13 Jan : Ferrari 15 Jan : Toyota 16 Jan : McLaren 19 Jan : Renault & Williams 20 Jan : BMW Sauber 9 Feb : Red Bull TBC : Toro Rosso , Force India , former Honda team And Hamilton supports the changes to the regulations , saying : " I think it 's important that F1 keeps moving forward and it's always been tough to overtake in the past so we need to get some of our competitiveness on the circuit back .
" Hopefully with the slick tyres , less downforce and Kers we 'll be able to do that . "
The fashion so far has been for a tightly - waisted rear to the car , to ensure effective airflow to the rear wing - with Ferrari 's particularly narrow .
McLaren 's new challenger is expected to follow that trend .

A couple of us ( Eric and Mike ) are co-authors on a paper coming out in Nature this week ( Jan. 22 , 09 ) .
We have already seen misleading interpretations of our results in the popular press and the blogosphere , and so we thought we would nip such speculation in the bud .
The paper shows that Antarctica has been warming for the last 50 years , and that it has been warming especially in West Antarctica ( see the figure ) .
The results are based on a statistical blending of satellite data and temperature data from weather stations .
The results do n’t depend on the statistics alone .
They are backed up by independent data from automatic weather stations , as shown in our paper as well as in updated work by Bromwich , Monaghan and others ( see their AGU abstract , here ) , whose earlier work in JGR was taken as contradicting ours .
There is also a paper in press in Climate Dynamics ( Goosse et al. ) that uses a GCM with data assimilation ( and without the satellite data we use ) and gets the same result .
Furthermore , speculation that our results somehow simply reflect changes in the near - surface inversion is ruled out by completely independent results showing that significant warming in West Antarctica extends well into the troposphere .
And finally , our results have already been validated by borehole thermometery — a completely independent method — at at least one site in West Antarctica ( Barrett et al.
report the same rate of warming as we do , but going back to 1930 rather than 1957 ; see the paper in press in GRL ) .
Here are some important things the paper does NOT show :
1 ) Our results do not contradict earlier studies suggesting that some regions of Antarctica have cooled .
Why ?
Because those studies were based on shorter records ( 20 - 30 years , not 50 years ) and because the cooling is limited to the East Antarctic .
Our results show this too , as is readily apparent by comparing our results for the full 50 years ( 1957 -2006 ) with those for 1969 - 2000 ( the dates used in various previous studies ) , below .
2 ) Our results do not necessarily contradict the generally - accepted interpretation of recent East Antarctic cooling put forth by David Thompson ( Colorado State ) and Susan Solomon ( NOAA Aeronomy Lab ) .
In an important paper in Science , they presented evidence that this cooling trend is linked to an increasing trend in the strength of the circumpolar westerlies , and that this can be traced to changes in the stratosphere , mostly due to photochemical ozone losses .
Substantial ozone losses did not occur until the late 1970s , and it is only after this period that significant cooling begins in East Antarctica .
3 ) Our paper — by itself — does not address whether Antarctica ’s recent warming is part of a longer term trend .
There is separate evidence from ice cores that Antarctica has been warming for most of the 20th century , but this is complicated by the strong influence of El Niño events in West Antarctica .
In our own published work to date ( Schneider and Steig , PNAS ) , we find that the 1940s [ edit for clarity : the 1935 - 1945 decade ] were the warmest decade of the 20th century in West Antarctica , due to an exceptionally large warming of the tropical Pacific at that time .
So what do our results show ?
Essentially , that the big picture of Antarctic climate change in the latter part of the 20th century has been largely overlooked .
It is well known that it has been warming on the Antarctic Peninsula , probably for the last 100 years ( measurements begin at the sub-Antarctic Island of Orcadas in 1901 and show a nearly monotonic warming trend ) .
And yes , East Antarctica cooled over the 1980s and 1990s ( though not , in our results , at a statistically significant rate ) .
But West Antarctica , which no one really has paid much attention to ( as far as temperature changes are concerned ) , has been warming rapidly for at least the last 50 years .
Why West Antarctica is warming is just beginning to be explored , but in our paper we argue that it basically has to do enhanced meridional flow — there is more warm air reaching West Antarctica from farther north ( that is , from warmer , lower latitudes ) .
In the parlance of statistical climatology , the “ zonal wave 3 pattern ” has increased ( see Raphael , GRL 2004 ) .
Something that goes along with this change in atmospheric circulation is reduced sea ice in the region ( while sea ice in Antarctica has been increasing on average , there have been significant declines off the West Antarctic coast for the last 25 years , and probably longer ) .
And in fact this is self reinforcing ( less sea ice , warmer water , rising air , lower pressure , enhanced storminess ) .
The obvious question , of course , is whether those changes in circulation are themselves simply “ natural variability ” or whether they are forced — that is , resulting from changes in greenhouse gases .
There will no doubt be a flurry of papers that follow ours , to address that very question .
A recent paper in Nature Geosciences by Gillet et al. examined trends in temperatures in the both Antarctic and the Arctic , and concluded that “ temperature changes in both … regions can be attributed to human activity . ”
Unfortunately our results were n’t available in time to be made use of in that paper .
But we suspect it will be straightforward to do an update of that work that does incorporate our results , and we look forward to seeing that happen .
Remember the credit crunch ?
Of course , you do .
Wed never seen anything like it , or so the highest financial authorities and their lapdogs in the news media told us not in a cool , calm , and collected way , either , but in a breathless delivery that suggested imminent economic doom unless the government immediately undertook to  do something .
Which it did , of course , on a scale never before witnessed in U.S. history .
So , looking back , as people are prone to do at this time of year , we can clearly see the telltale signs of the financial disaster that struck the financial markets last autumn : the terrible credit crunch , the frozen credit that portended a complete economic meltdown unless the government took drastic measures to head it off .
( The government spokespersons and the medias talking heads never got straight whether the thing was very cold or very hot , as they reached for horrifying metaphors in all directions at once . )
But , wait , something is terribly wrong in the statistical record !
The devastating credit crunch , the greatest threat to this country since the Russians exploded an H - bomb , the most menacing economic event since the stock - market crash of 1929 , the . . . ( sputter ) . . . ( sputter ) . . . ( words fail me in the face of such terrors as it evoked in the minds of bankers , finance ministers , and financial titans of all stripes ) . . . .
Well , I am rather embarrassed , on behalf of all these giants of the ruling elite , to inform you that the Monster from Lack - of - Liquidity Lagoon doesnt really show up as such in the most relevant statistical series .
Probably the most important measure of credit - market conditions is the amount of commercial - bank credit outstanding .
These figures show that although the middle part of 2008 does stand out in the long view , it does so not by virtue of credits frightening contraction , but only by virtue of its hitting a six - month plateau from April through September .
At no time during that interval , however , did the amount of commercial - bank credit outstanding fall below the amount outstanding at the beginning of the year .
In short , credit was actually ample , indeed , at an all - time high ; it simply stopped growing as usual for six months , stuck at about $ 9.4 trillion , while one Wall Streeter after another told NPR that no money is moving ; the credit market is completely shut down  or some such cock - and - bull story .
After which , commercial - bank credit zipped up again , so that by the end of the year , the amount outstanding stood more than 8 percent higher than it had a year earlier .
Some credit crunch !
Année terrible , indeed .
But dont write off this silly little hoax too fast , because , however baseless it might have been in economic reality , it was manifestly good enough for government work .
And that work has placed U.S. taxpayers on the hook for trillions of dollars in Treasury commitments and put all holders of U.S. dollars at risk of tremendous losses of their moneys purchasing power .
The beauty of the Great Hoax of 2008 , from the perspective of the ruling class , is that it was also a Great Scare , and such scares serve as the pretexts for the rulers  most audacious assaults on the peasants  lives , liberties , and purses .
Youd almost have to admire the elites ability to spook the rest of us into blind , unreasoning panic on such a flimsy basis , if it werent for the fact that after the episode has passed , we find ourselves enormously worse off , our economic prospects diminished greatly and our liberties throttled even more by an even bigger Leviathan , with nothing to show for it on the upside but the further enrichment of a handful of big bankers and other malefactors of great wealth .
Two lasers are used to record data in the form of a 3D hologram
How quickly things change .
Just as Blu-ray is starting to replace the DVDs in our homes , another technology is developed that could sound its death knell .
A dual - layer Blu-ray disc can store an impressive 50 gigabytes , but discs which can hold 20 times as much data have just taken a step closer , thanks to new materials that make reading and writing 3D holograms more reliable .
CDs and DVDs store data as pits on their surface that are read by a laser .
A Blu-ray disc can hold over five times more data than a standard DVD because the pits are much smaller .
Writing the data onto two layers within the disc instantly doubles the volume of data that can be stored .
But writing data to the whole thickness of the disc in the form of a hologram could dramatically increase storage capacity .
A pair of laser beams is used to write data into discs of light - sensitive plastic , with both aiming at the same spot .
One beam shines continuously , while the other pulses on and off to encode patches that represent digital 0s and 1s .

At the points where the lasers meet , the intense light causes molecules in the disc ’s material to merge into chains , creating a physical pattern that locks the 0s and 1s into the disc .
This pattern can be read back at a later date using another laser because the changed patches interact differently with light .
However , in the plastic normally used for holographic data storage , the structural changes caused by the laser also cause the material to shrink .
Even though the volume change is tiny – around 0.23 % – the distortion is enough to make reading the data from the disc tricky and means that the 1s and 0s ca n’t be burned at the highest densities .
Denser data
Craig Hawker ‘s team at the University of California in Santa Barbara has now solved that problem by replacing the polymer ’s small molecules with larger , branched ones .
These need to make fewer bonds to create a patch of the alternate form of the material , cutting distortion to just 0.04 % .
“ For real - world applications , the shrinkage values should be below 0.1 % , ” Hawker says .
Pioneering companies developing holographic data - storage devices could benefit from the new technique by squeezing at least 1000 gigabytes of data onto a standard disc .
One such company is Colorado - based InPhase Technologies , that sells bespoke products to the 20 or so companies around the world that are developing holograph - based data drives .
The company ’s vice president of sales , Art Rancis , thinks Hawker ’s work is promising .
“ We look forward to future results as [ Hawker ’s team ] evaluates the performance of the material in an actual high - density digital recording system , ” he told New Scientist .

A well chosen name wins an argument by assuming its conclusion .
Label cash subsidies to foreign government as " foreign aid " and who can be so hard hearted as to oppose them .
Call subsidies to the public schools " aid to education " and you neatly skip over the question of whether additional spending in the public school system results in more education .
Label something " pollution " and is no longer necessary to offer evidence that it is bad , since everyone knows pollution is bad — even thermal pollution , otherwise described as warm water .
Occasionally we even get dueling names .
Both " right to life " and " pro-choice " are obviously good things ; how could anyone be against either ?
For a more recent example , consider Obama 's economic policy .
Everyone — including Obama , back when he was running for President — is against deficit spending .
Relabel it " stimulus " and everyone is for it .
The label neatly evades the question of whether having the government borrow money and spend it is actually a way of getting out of a recession — a claim for which evidence is distinctly thin .
It is stimulus , so obviously it must stimulate .
The success of the relabelling with the general public is not surprising .
What is somewhat surprising is the way in which much , although not all , of the economics profession has suddenly adopted as gospel the 1960's Keynesianism that most of the profession rejected several decades back .
Everyone talks as though deficit spending was a way , indeed the way , of reducing unemployment , a central recommendation of that theory .
One explanation , of course , is that government spending is popular , taxes are unpopular , so a argument that converts deficits from a problem to a solution has a lot of natural supporters .
But that is not the whole story .
Another part of it is that the credit crunch seems to bear at least a family resemblance to what Keynesians expected to see , indeed believed they had seen , as the cause of depressions .
Interest rates are so low that holding money makes more sense than investing it , so demand drops , so everything spirals down — underemployment equilibrium due to the economy falling into the liquidity trap .
The solution they proposed was fiscal policy .
The government borrows the money that was accumulating under mattresses , spends it , gets things going again .
There is , however , one small problem with this account of the present situation .
The Keynesian liquidity trap was supposed to be a result of running out of investment opportunities .
All the productive things that could be done with capital had been done , so firms were only willing to offer a trivial reward to investors , so nobody bothered to invest .
That story has nothing to do with what actually happened .
Firms are eager to borrow money and invest .
The problem is not that we have exhausted investment opportunities but that lenders do n't know what borrowers , or what intermediaries , to trust , due to a malfunction of the capital markets set off by the bursting of the housing bubble .
One can argue about who to blame for that malfunction and what to do about it .
But whoever is to blame , it is not a liquidity trap , hence it is n't any reason to resurrect the economic doctrines of fifty years ago .
The first round of " stimulus " proposals , whatever their faults , could at least be defended as a response to the actual problem .
Lenders did not know who to trust but did trust the Federal Government .
So let the government borrow the money from them , lend it to the firms that needed capital , and so keep those firms from being destroyed by a temporary freezing up of the capital markets .
Skeptics might express doubt as to the competence of the government to allocate capital , but at least the policy could be seen as an attempt to get capital allocated .
The current proposal has no such defense .
It simply consists of borrowing very large amounts of money and spending it .
Insofar as it has any effect on the ability of firms to borrow , it makes it harder , since public borrowing is competing with private borrowing .
A dollar I spend in government securities floated to fund the deficit is a dollar I do n't invest in a private firm .
At 10 o'clock in the morning , Markus Frind leaves his apartment and heads to work .
It 's a short walk through downtown Vancouver , British Columbia , but somehow the trek feels arduous .
This is not because Frind is lazy .
Well , Frind is a bit lazy , but that 's another matter .
The problem is that he is still getting used to the idea of a commute that involves traveling farther than the distance between the living room and the bedroom .
Frind 's online dating company , Plenty of Fish , is newly located on the 26th floor of a downtown skyscraper with a revolving restaurant on the roof .
The gleaming space could easily house 30 employees , but as Frind strides in , it is eerily quiet -- just a room with new carpets , freshly painted walls , and eight flat - screen computer monitors .
Frind drops his bag and plops himself down in front of one of them .
He looks down at his desk .
There 's a $ 180,000 order waiting for his signature .
It 's from VideoEgg , a San Francisco company that is paying Frind to run a series of Budweiser commercials in Canada .
Like most of his advertising deals , this one found Frind .
He had n't even heard of VideoEgg until a week ago .
But then , you tend to attract advertisers ' attention when you are serving up 1.6 billion webpages each month .
That 's a lot of personal ads .
" One - point - six ba-hillion , " Frind says slowly , smacking his lips on the hard b.
" There are maybe 10 sites in the U.S. with more than that . "
Five years ago , he started Plenty of Fish with no money , no plan , and scant knowledge of how to build a Web business .
Today , according to the research firm Hitwise , his creation is the largest dating website in the U.S. and quite possibly the world .
Its traffic is four times that of dating pioneer Match , which has annual revenue of $ 350 million and a staff that numbers in the hundreds .
Until 2007 , Frind had a staff of exactly zero .
Today , he employs just three customer service workers , who check for spam and delete nude images from the Plenty of Fish website while Frind handles everything else .
Amazingly , Frind has set up his company so that doing everything else amounts to doing almost nothing at all .
" I usually accomplish everything in the first hour , " he says , before pausing for a moment to think this over .
" Actually , in the first 10 or 15 minutes . "
To demonstrate , Frind turns to his computer and begins fiddling with a free software program that he uses to manage his advertising inventory .
While he is doing this , he carps about Canada 's high income taxes , a serious problem considering that Plenty of Fish is on track to book revenue of $ 10 million for 2008 , with profit margins in excess of 50 percent .
Then , six minutes 38 seconds after beginning his workday , Frind closes his Web browser and announces , " All done . "
All done ?
Are you serious ?
" The site pretty much runs itself , " he explains .
" Most of the time , I just sit on my ass and watch it . "
There 's so little to do that he and his girlfriend , Annie Kanciar , spent the better part of last summer sunning themselves on the French Riviera .
Frind would log on at night , spend a minute or two making sure there were no serious error messages , and then go back to sipping expensive wine .
A year ago , they relaxed for a couple of weeks in Mexico with a yacht , a captain , and four of Kanciar 's friends .
" Me and five girls , " he says .
" Rough life . "
As Frind gets up to leave , I ask him what he has planned for the rest of the day .
" I do n't know , " he says .
" Maybe I 'll take a nap . "
It 's a 21st - century fairy tale : A young man starts a website in his spare time .
This person is unknown and undistinguished .
He has n't gone to MIT , Stanford , or any other four - year college for that matter , yet he is deceptively brilliant .
He has been bouncing aimlessly from job to job , but he is secretly ambitious .
He builds his company by himself and from his apartment .
In most stories , this is where the hard work begins -- the long hours , sleepless nights , and near - death business experiences .
But this one is way more mellow .
Frind takes it easy , working no more than 20 hours a week during the busiest times and usually no more than 10 .
Five years later , he is running one of the largest websites on the planet and paying himself more than $ 5 million a year .
Frind , 30 , does n't seem like the sort of fellow who would run a market - leading anything .
Quiet , soft - featured , and ordinary looking , he is the kind of person who can get lost in a roomful of people and who seems to take up less space than his large frame would suggest .
Those who know Frind describe him as introverted , smart , and a little awkward .
" Markus is one of those engineers who is just more comfortable sitting in front of a computer than he is talking to someone face to face , " says Noel Biderman , the co-founder of Avid Life Media , a Toronto - based company that owns several dating sites .
When he does engage in conversation , Frind can be disarmingly frank , delivering vitriolic quips with a self - assured cheerfulness that feels almost mean .
Yahoo ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) , he says , is " a complete joke , " Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) is " a cult , " and Match is " dying . "
Says Mark Brooks , a marketing consultant who has advised Frind since 2006 , " I 've never known anybody so competitive .
He always says exactly what he thinks . "
With friends and family , Frind expresses affection through playful pranks .
Frind will spend hours hiding in the three - bedroom apartment he and Kanciar share , furtively flipping light switches , tapping on doors , and ducking into rooms to play on his girlfriend 's fear of ghosts .
Another memorable valentine involved the secret consumption of a massive quantity of hot peppers .
Though his mouth was on fire , Frind calmly planted a kiss on Kanciar 's lips and feigned ignorance as she went scrambling for water .
Kanciar , a freelance Web designer who also helps out around Plenty of Fish , is a lanky blonde with an easy smile and a hearty laugh , which she often uses to try to get Frind to open up .
When I ask him to talk about what he does with the 23 hours a day in which he does n't work , Frind struggles to answer and then looks helplessly at Kanciar .
She offers a few suggestions -- video games , ski trips , walks -- then tries to focus his energies .
" We 're trying to convince Max that we 're interesting , " she says sweetly .
That 's not easy for Frind , who seems most comfortable with the world at arm 's length .
" He never raises his voice , " Kanciar says later .
" And he does n't like conflict . "
Frind prefers to remain a silent observer of others , who then constructs arguments and counterarguments about their motivations .
He seems perpetually lost in thought , constantly thinking about and studying the world around him .
" He 's always watching his environment to apply it to the site , " says Kanciar .
" Once in a while , from the middle of nowhere , he 'll say , ' Why is that girl doing that ? ' or ' Why is that guy posing like that ? '
He 'll check people out in restaurants and watch how they interact .
In a way , he 's thinking about the company all the time . "
Frind spent his formative years on a grain farm in the northern hinterlands of British Columbia -- " the bush , " in local parlance .
His hometown , Hudson 's Hope , is a cold , isolated place not far from the starting point of the Alaska Highway .
Frind 's parents , German farmers who emigrated just before his fourth birthday , bought a 1,200 - acre plot 10 miles from town and initially lived in a trailer without electricity , phones , or running water .
The family 's closest neighbors were a mile and a half away , and , apart from a younger brother , Frind had few friends .
" His problem was English , " says his father , Eduard Frind .
" If you do n't have English , you can't do anything . "
Frind eventually adjusted , but his was a lonely childhood .
He rarely visits Hudson 's Hope these days .
When his parents want to see him , they make the 14 - hour drive southward .
After graduating from a technical school in 1999 with a two - year degree in computer programming , Frind got a job with an online shopping mall .
Then the dot - com bubble burst , and he spent the next two years bouncing from failed startup to failed startup .
For most of 2002 , he was unemployed .
" Every six months , I got a new job , " Frind says .
" It 'd start with 30 people , then five months later , there 'd be five .
It was brutal . "
When he did have work , it felt like torture .
His fellow engineers seemed to be writing deliberately inscrutable code in order to protect their jobs .
" It would literally take me four or five hours , " he says -- an eternity in Frind time -- " just to make heads or tails of their code , when normally you 're supposed to spend , like , two minutes doing that . "
But cleaning up other people 's messes taught Frind how to quickly simplify complex code .
In his spare time , he started working on a piece of software that was designed to find prime numbers in arithmetic progression .
The topic , a perennial challenge in mathematics because it requires lots of computing power , had been discussed in one of his classes , and Frind thought it would be a fun way to learn how to sharpen his skills .
He finished the hobby project in 2002 , and , two years later , his program discovered a string of 23 prime numbers , the longest ever .
( Frind 's record has since been surpassed , but not before it was cited by UCLA mathematician and Fields Medal winner Terence Tao . )
" It was just a way of teaching myself something , " Frind says .
" I was learning how to make the computer as fast as possible . "
By early 2003 , the technology economy in Vancouver had yet to bounce back , and Frind 's sixth employer in three years was laying off half its workforce .
Worried that he would again find himself unemployed , Frind decided to bolster his qualifications .
He would devote a couple of weeks to mastering Microsoft 's new tool for building websites , ASP.net , and do it by building the hardest kind of website he could think of .
Online dating was an inspired choice .
Not only does the act of building an intricate web of electronic winks , smiles , and nudges require significant programming skills , but the industry has always been a friendly place for oddballs and opportunists .
Industry pioneer Gary Kremen , the founder of Match and the man who registered the Sex.com domain name , cites rapper Ice Cube and the bank robber " Slick " Willie Sutton as important influences on his business philosophy .
Another pioneer , James Hong , co-founded Hot or Not , a site with a single , crude feature .
Hong allowed users to upload pictures of themselves and have other users rate their attractiveness on a scale of 1 to 10 .
Hot or Not was acquired for $ 20 million in cash last year by Noel Biderman 's company , Avid Life .
Avid , which has also courted Plenty of Fish , derives most of its revenue from Ashley Madison , a dating website for married people ( tag line : " Life is short .
Have an affair " ) .
The site has 2.8 million members and revenue in the tens of millions of dollars .
Unlike many online dating entrepreneurs , Frind did n't start Plenty of Fish to meet women -- or even because he had some vision of business glory .
" It was a burning desire to have something stable , " he says .
" And I did n't really want to work . "
Frind 's eyes were also a factor .
He suffers from hypersensitivity to light , and his eyes were not taking well to long days in front of a screen .
Working a few hours an evening for two weeks , Frind built a crude dating site , which he named Plenty of Fish .
It was desperately simple -- just an unadorned list of plain - text personals ads .
But it promised something that no big dating company offered : it was free .
The idea came to Frind in 2001 , when he started checking out Canada 's then - largest dating site , Lavalife , hoping to meet women or at least to kill some time .
Online dating seemed like a good idea , but he was startled to discover that the site charged users hefty fees .
" I thought it was ridiculous , " he says .
" It was this rinky - dink little site charging money for something anyone could make .
I was like , I can beat these guys . "
This thought was not exactly new .
Since the mid-'90s , there had been dozens of free dating startups , but all had struggled to attract users because they were competing with the outsize marketing budgets of paid competitors like Lavalife .
Paid sites could afford to spend $ 30 or $ 40 in advertising to acquire a user .
A free site could afford to spend perhaps 40 cents , making it exceedingly hard to attract daters and still turn a profit .
Frind 's answer to this problem was somewhat radical .
Rather than try to compete directly with Match , the industry leader , he created a website that cost almost nothing to run and was aimed at the sort of people who wanted to browse a few profiles but were n't ready to take out their credit cards .
In doing so , he had found a way to reach a large , underserved market .
Even better , he had created a perfect place for paid dating sites to spend their huge advertising budgets .
Plenty of Fish grew slowly at first as Frind focused on learning the programming language and trolling internet forums for clues on how to increase traffic .
There are a handful of half - literate posts from early 2003 in which Frind asks basic questions , like " I am interested in know how much money sites generate off advertising . "
Reading these comments in retrospect paints a picture of determination and naiveté .
Frind knew little about search - engine optimization or online advertising , but he was a quick study .
From March to November 2003 , his site expanded from 40 members to 10,000 .
Frind used his home computer as a Web server -- an unusual but cost - effective choice -- and spent his time trying to game Google with the tricks he picked up on the forums .
In July , Google introduced a free tool called AdSense , which allowed small companies to automatically sell advertisements and display them on their websites .
Frind made just $ 5 in his first month , but by the end of the year , he was making more than $ 3,300 a month , largely by selling ads to paid dating sites that were interested in getting his unpaid members to trade up .
He quit his job .
" Have you ever met anyone like me ? "
This is both a boast and a genuine question : Frind has few friends in business , no mentors , and no investors .
Moreover , he has taken a path that seems at odds with the conventional wisdom about internet companies .
Most websites with as much traffic as Plenty of Fish would have by this point raised millions of dollars from venture capitalists , hired dozens of engineers and business - development types , and figured out a way to keep someone as unconventional as Markus Frind from making any major decisions .
But if Frind 's methods make him unusual , he is also a man of his times .
In the past few years , a new technological ecosystem built around Google 's dominance in Web search and its decision to offer powerful software tools at no charge , has changed the economics of doing business on the internet .
Web analytic services that used to cost thousands of dollars a year are now free .
Competitive data , once available to only the largest companies , can be had with only a few clicks on Compete.com and Quantcast.com .
And advertising networks , especially AdSense , have made it possible , even preferable , for internet entrepreneurs to bootstrap their businesses without hiring a sales force and raising lots of money .
Websites that venture capitalists would have spent tens of millions of dollars building in 1998 can now be started with tens of dollars .
No one has used this ecosystem as effectively as Markus Frind , who has stayed simple , cheap , and lean even as his revenue and profits have grown well beyond those of a typical one - person company .
Plenty of Fish is a designer 's nightmare ; at once minimalist and inelegant , it looks like something your nephew could have made in an afternoon .
There 's the color scheme that seems cribbed from a high school yearbook and the curious fondness for bold text and CAPITAL LETTERS .
When searching for a prospective mate , one is inundated with pictures that are not cropped or properly resized .
Instead , headshots are either comically squished or creepily elongated , a carnivalesque effect that makes it difficult to quickly size up potential mates .
Frind is aware of his site 's flaws but is n't eager to fix them .
" There 's no point in making trivial adjustments , " he says .
Frind 's approach -- and the reason he spends so little time actually working -- is to do no harm .
This has two virtues : First , you can't waste money if you are not doing anything .
And second , on a site this big and this complex , it is impossible to predict how even the smallest changes might affect the bottom line .
Fixing the wonky images , for instance , might actually hurt Plenty of Fish .
Right now , users are compelled to click on people 's profiles in order to get to the next screen and view proper headshots .
That causes people to view more profiles and allows Frind , who gets paid by the page view , to serve more ads .
" The site works , " he says .
" Why should I change what works ? "
Frind has resisted adding other commonly requested features , such as chatrooms and video profiles , on the same grounds .
" I do n't listen to the users , " he says .
" The people who suggest things are the vocal minority who have stupid ideas that only apply to their little niches . "
Instead , Frind has focused his energy on making the site better at matching people .
When a member starts browsing through profiles , the site records his or her preferences and then narrows down its 10 million users to a more manageable group of potential mates .
" Users never see the whole database , " Frind says .
" It gets smaller and more focused on what you 're actually looking for . "
In other words , if you tell Plenty of Fish you want to date blond nonsmokers but spend all your time gawking at nicotine - addled brunettes , the program will adjust .
" People think they know who the perfect person is , but that 's not always who they really want , " he says .
Frind estimates , based on exit surveys , that the site creates 800,000 successful relationships a year .
But the brilliance of Plenty of Fish is not its strength as a matching engine ; it is the site 's low overhead .
Not only has Frind managed to run his company with almost no staff , but he has also been able to run a massive database with almost no computer hardware .
To get a sense of how efficient the operation is , consider that the social news site Digg generates about 250 million page views each month , or roughly one - sixth of Plenty of Fish 's monthly traffic , and employs 80 people .
Most websites as busy as Frind 's use hundreds of servers .
Frind has just eight .
He is not eager to explain how he manages this , but he says that it mostly comes from writing efficient code , a necessity when you are the only code writer and are extremely averse to spending money on additional hardware and features .
" At other sites , when one thing goes slightly wrong , the reaction is to buy more servers or hire a PhD , " he says .
" It 's almost unbelievable -- it 's like people are trying to justify their jobs by spending money .
This is n't rocket science . "
Often , at the end of a long workday , which is to say around noon , Frind plays war games .
His apartment is outfitted with five computers for group play of Age of Empires and Command & Conquer -- and he has a substantial collection of board games .
He is good , too :
When I joined him for a game of Risk in October , he sat silently for almost the entire game before clearing the board in a single , virtuosic turn .
He was still gloating the next morning .
Frind approaches business in much the same way .
" It 's a strategy game , " he says .
" You 're trying to take over the world , one country at a time . "
Frind 's account of his own exploits , published on his blog in 2006 under the title " How I Started a Dating Empire , " says a lot about his worldview : " I spent every waking minute when I was n't at my day job reading , studying , and learning .
I picked out ' enemies ' and did everything I could to defeat them , which meant being bigger than them .
I refused to accept defeat of any kind . "
Around the same time , he returned to one of his old internet hangouts , a forum called WebmasterWorld , and posted a brief how - to guide entitled " How I Made a Million in Three Months . "
It contained a blueprint for the success of Plenty of Fish : Pick a market in which the competition charges money for its service , build a lean operation with a " dead simple " free website , and pay for it using Google AdSense .
By 2006 , Plenty of Fish was serving 200 million pages each month , putting it in fifth place in the United States and first in Canada among dating sites .
Frind was making amazingly good money , too : $ 10,000 a day through AdSense .
In March of that year , Frind mentioned these facts to Robert Scoble , a popular tech blogger whom he met at a conference in Vancouver .
When Scoble wrote about the solo entrepreneur with the ugly website making millions of dollars a year , his readers were in disbelief .
At the time , AdSense was seen as a tool for amateurs .
It might cover your blogging expenses , but it would n't make you rich .
Frind 's website was also downright ugly .
A search - engine - optimization blogger , Jeremy Schoemaker , wrote that Frind was a liar .
" Give me a break , dudes , " he wrote .
" You look so stupid when you buy into his crap . "
Frind embraced the controversy .
He posted a picture of a check from Google for nearly a million Canadian dollars ( or about $ 800,000 ) made out to Plenty of Fish .
It represented two months ' worth of revenue and implied that his site was making $ 4.8 million a year .
But some thought the check was a fake , while others felt that posting it was a crude promotional stunt .
" He came out of nowhere , and he did n't seem to give a shit , " says David Evans , who writes the blog Online Dating Insider .
But the stunt worked .
Frind 's site was the talk of the blogosphere , driving gobs of new users to the site .
Plenty of Fish 's growth accelerated dramatically , hitting one billion page views a month by 2007 .
By summer of 2008 , with his site moving into first place among dating sites in the U.S. and U.K. , Frind began to wonder about his next step .
He rented a 3,700 - square - foot suite in Vancouver 's Harbour Center , announced he was going to hire 30 employees , and bought a BlackBerry .
But the plans were not exactly concrete .
By October , Frind 's own office was still empty : no furniture , nothing on the walls .
He still had n't figured out how to get email on his cell phone .
He had hired three people , not 30 .
Frind seems untroubled by this disconnect .
He says he leased an office because he was tired of working at home .
He assumes he will one day need more employees , but he has n't figured out what he would do with them .
And he is in no hurry .
He has n't even bothered to offer a French language site for the six million French speakers living in Quebec .
" I 'll get around to doing that eventually , " he says .
With all the free time on his hands , why does n't Frind just start a second company ?
He says he thinks about that sometimes and has even toyed with creating a free job - listings site but finds the idea stultifying .
" Sure , I could do it , but it'd be like watching grass grow compared to this , " he says , gesturing at a traffic chart that shows Plenty of Fish 's growth over the past few months .
" It 'd be like " -- he adopts a high - pitched , mocking tone -- ' Whoop - de - doo , we got 100 visitors today . '
Whereas with my site , every day there 's another 1,000 or 10,000 . "
It 's hard to know what to make of a guy who works an hour a day , who does n't travel much , and who does n't have any hobbies beyond war games and somehow fretting about boredom .
How is he not bored already ?
But if Frind is guilty of a kind of sloth , there is also a wisdom to his passivity .
Being ever careful takes serious self - discipline , and an aversion to doing harm can be more valuable than an overeagerness for self - improvement .
If nothing else , it 's impossible to argue with his success .
Frind created his own game and wrote his own rules .
As growing legions of lovesick people around the globe search for their perfect mates and advertisers fall over one another to write him ever larger checks , he just kicks back and smiles .
And the money rolls in .

As it ’s the start of a new year I thought it would be an ideal time to look back over the year just gone .
I have used Google Trends to compare the number of searches during 2008 of various open source and proprietary network management tools .
Whilst search volume is an interesting metric for network management tools , it is not intended to be in any way indicative of the usefulness of a particular tool .
If you want to choose a tool , start from your own requirements first and select a tool from that .
Open Source Network Management System Trends
First up is a comparison of the major open source network management systems .
Nagios , as one of the oldest open source projects in network management , still has a huge community of users and , in spite of a number of very good competitors , appears to be holding its own .
MRTG during 2008 does show signs of continued decline .
Hardly surprising given that a number of very capable competitors exist that are much easier to install and configure .
Zenoss , Hyperic and OpenNMS are all doing well , retaining substantial levels of searches with Zenoss retaining its early lead .
A Comparison of the Nagios Ecosystem
Nagios is a significant open source project in and of itself .
In addition , it also has an ecosystem of tools built on top of it as well .
There are three main nagios core tools : GroundWork Open Source , Centreon and OpsView .
I have n’t been able to use Groundwork Open Source because a comparison would n’t be valid given how many words it is made up of .
Many people may well type in Groundwork instead of Groundwork Open Source even though you will get a lot of civil engineering related results .
Configuration is one area Nagios is not very user friendly to new users , relying upon editing configuration files for changes .
Both Centreon and OpsView provide an improved configuration experience , reducing or completely removing the need to directly edit configuration files .
Surprisingly both Centreon and OpsView receive substantially fewer searches than Nagios .
Open vs Closed Network Management Systems
A comparison between a representative sample of both open source and proprietary tools shows an interesting trend .
Both NetIQ and OpenView are losing searches whilst the open tools are holding up well .
Perhaps , money was tighter in 2008 due to the economic woes befalling many economies .
OpenView has been particularly badly hit , being well down over the year as a whole .
Conclusion
The open source network management tools search volume has held up very well throughout 2008 .
The same cannot be said for either proprietary tools , OpenView and NetIQ .
Both of the proprietary tools have seen their search volume fall .
A recession started during 2008 in many countries worldwide .
So , that people are searching less for expensive software tools , maybe is n’t that surprising .
I doubt the Google Trends data could evidence a shift from proprietary to open source tools though , given the absence of an upshift in searches for open source tools .
HOUSTON , Dec. 11 ( UPI ) --
A rare snow fall in eastern Texas Wednesday night sent children scurrying outside to make snowmen and motorists sliding off roadways .
KHOU - TV in Houston said the National Weather Service had issued a winter weather advisory for a wide swath off the region until 4 a.m. with up to 2 inches of snow forecast by morning .
It was the first snow the area has seen in three or four years .

" It 's a perfect night to get a Christmas tree , " Gina Nall told Houston TV station KTRK .
" How often does it snow when you get to go pick one out ? "
Native Houstonian J.T. Thomas also looked at the bright side of the wintry weather .
" I can't build a snowman , but I can go around tell people how it snowed in Houston , Texas , " Thomas said .
It was n't so perfect for others .
Ice covered parts of Houston - area bridges , bringing traffic to a standstill in some locations and to a 5 - mph crawl in others , the TV station said .
A few minor accidents were reported , including one involving a Houston police officer , who hit a slick spot and crashed into a wall .
The officer was n't hurt , KHOU said .
State road crews were out sanding some highways trying to provide a little traction .
While the adults were trying to drive from Point A to Point B , Texas children were out making snow angels , throwing snowballs and even building snowmen , the TV station said .
The misery and fun are not expected to last long , however .
The forecast is for temperatures in the 50s Thursday afternoon .
Tech Media Discovers FCC Staffed With Dunces , Lobbyists
Opinion : gutting consumer protections fine , but do n't pick on WOW
We 've talked extensively of the FCC 's dysfunction the last few years , be it Kevin Martin 's well , Kevin - Martin - ness , Robert McDowell 's fear mongering and disdain for reality , or Michael Copps tendency to rant extensively against an idiotic idea right before he votes for it .
Techmeme 's top pundits are usually absent from most of these unsexy stories , eager to generate more hits by reviewing iPhone apps or promoting their own startups than say -- exploring how the FCC 's effort to gut the video franchise system resulted in a laundry list of problems for rural American communities , or digging past the surface of FCC decisions that seem pro-consumer but are really just stage shows .
Only now that Commissioners are preparing to depart for jobs at telecom think tanks or lobbying firms , are some people noticing that we have n't exactly been stocking the FCC pond with the best and brightest .
This week saw countless news outlets discover for the first time that FCC Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate is , like many of her FCC colleagues , almost completely detached from reality .
The discovery was prompted by two speeches
Tate gave this week aimed at pandering to her biggest constituents .
In both speeches , Tate uses her platform to placate and lobby for industry -- regurgitating false broadband stats , praising Internet filters , declaring that video games are a leading cause of college dropouts , and cheerleading for digital rights management .
Tate 's first speech was absolutely nothing more than an entertainment industry sales pitch , from her promotion of the industry 's preferred digital fingerprinting and filtering technology from Audible Magic ( which often does n't work ) , to her use of over - inflated ( and proven fabricated ) statistics on piracy 's economic impact .
She tops off her inaccuracy trifecta by loyally praising DRM as " very effective " ( Tate 's clearly not a Spore player ) .
Tate 's second speech was a combination of self - promotion and telecom lobbying , the Commissioner again using inaccurate data -- this time to paint a rosy broadband industry picture in order to shill for industry deregulation , promote AT&T - backed Connected Nation , and rant against net - neutrality .
But it was one sentence on World Of Warcraft that garnered more news coverage than anything Tate 's done while on staff at the FCC :
quote :
You might find it alarming that one of the top reasons for college drop-outs in the U.S. is online gaming addiction — such as World of Warcraft — which is played by 11 million individuals worldwide .
best not malign everybody 's favorite MMORPG
The backlash was immediate , creating a firestorm of indignation among bloggers .
Be warned FCC commissioners : you can wage war against consumer protections until you 're blue in the face , you can distort statistics until the very fabric of the universe begins to bend , and you can shill for your favorite corporations until you collapse from the weight of their contributions and free trips to Vegas -- but you
Of course , like any good FCC Commissioner , Tate does n't offer a source for her WOW statistics , highlighting how sourcing , science and data have n't recently been the FCC 's strong suit .
That 's because positions are no longer based on technical specifics or science , but are forged out of partisan loyalty and a desire to please Commissioners ' true constituents -- the companies they 'll be lobbying for after they leave the FCC .
This dysfunction is bi-partisan in nature , and Tate 's speeches this week highlight once again that maybe -- just maybe -- it 's time to stock the FCC with technologists , network geniuses and experts in the field -- instead of partisan lawyers , lobbyists and yes - men and women .
Not only might they objectively explore technical issues based on real science , they 'd update the FCC website more than just once every half - decade

UXBRIDGE , Canada , Nov 20 ( Tierramérica ) – Climate change will dramatically increase the number of hot , dry days in Mexico in the coming decades , while coastal regions like the Yucatán , in the southeast , will be swamped by sea levels that are half a metre higher than today , a new study has found .
By 2030 , Mexico ’s average daily temperature is likely to climb 1.4 degrees Celsius above what has been the average for the past 30 years .
By 2090 , this increase could rocket upwards by 4.1 degrees , virtually guaranteeing hot days and nights for 80 to 90 percent of the year , says the Oxford University study financed by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) .
Cold weather will become very rare in Mexico according to data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , an umbrella organisation of scientists from around the world and the preeminent authority on climate change .
“ Mexico is one area of the world where all the computer climate models agree , ” says Carol McSweeney of the School of Geography and Environment at Oxford .
Computer climate models incorporate the physics of the atmosphere and , often , the ocean , sea ice and land surface as well , to project what the future climate may be as carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels continue to rise , trapping more heat in the atmosphere .
The IPCC , co-winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize , used the data from two dozen different climate models powered by the world ’s fastest supercomputers to issue its landmark Fourth Assessment Report last year .
That report warned the world that carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are causing the current rise in global temperatures that could hike the global average temperature 4.5 degrees C by 2100 .
But McSweeney and her Oxford colleagues wondered : what does that mean for individual countries ?
With UNDP funding , they have used the IPCC climate model data to determine the potential changes in the climate of 52 developing nations .

In a trailer for He 's Just Not That Into You , the camera cuts to two black women .
One says : " Girl , you better get yourself some ribs and some ice cream because you 've been dumped ! "

Writes LaToya Peterson from Racialicious :
We 're [ black people ] always the punchline , never the bride .
( Or the girl who goes on a date .
Or anything but the sassy friend who shows up to give the real characters a dose of real - world truisms before disappearing back into the shadows of the script . )

Of course , watching the online trailer ( in which the two black women mysteriously do not appear ) , Drew Barrymore does have two " sassy " friends of color :
An Asian guy and a Latin guy , who school her about MySpace .
We 've written about the trend of the black best friend before ; a " consolation prize " for actors of color in TV shows and movies for decades .
( And in this all - star cast , Scarlett Johansson , Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Connelly appear alongside women like Tokyo Girl # 2 and African Woman # 3 . )

Plus , in an attempt to convince guys that this movie is not your typical chick flick , Justin Long , Kevin Connolly and Bradley Cooper made a marketing video in which they count 10 " chick flick clichés " that are not in HJNTIY .
The video , unlike the trailer for the film , is actually pretty funny …
Click to view
… At first .
But then you realize that , well , shit .
The reason these guys can mock chick flick clichés is because Hollywood keeps churning out clichéd chick flicks .
What 's more , the assumption is that women want to see a film in which a a guy gets a makeover , where a woman slides down a wall crying , or where there 's a quirky / sassy / sardonic best friend .
( And this movie does seem to have those , actually . )

But as we 've mentioned before , what is ultimately the worst part about this movie ( based on a book , based on a line from a TV show ) is this :
It makes women look like losers .
Like pathetic , desperate idiots who are hopeless when it comes to relationships and can't seem to understand why sitting by the phone waiting for him to call is a bad idea .
Judging from the trailer , none of the guys are assholes ; all of the women are emotional imbeciles .
But it 's a comedy , because annihilation and mockery of the female psyche is hilarious , right ?

The subject of torture has been a sore spot for me , and because of personal embarrassment , I have written little on the subject except for an article written in 2005 that has remained buried in the archives .
The time for avoiding this subject has come to its end , and to start - off the commentary , I am raising from the dead an article that was written before I became fairly well known - and I 've kept it buried on purpose .
One out of nine adults in the United States has been incarcerated or on parole or probation , and 35 years ago , I was not the person I am today , and like millions of other Americans , I have attempted to forget what happened over thirty ( 30 ) years ago .
My decision to " come clean " is based on the government 's propensity to violate the Geneva Convention and the social value it can provide for those that have little or no knowledge of the Criminal ( in ) Justice System that is claiming innocent lives on American Soil .
My experiences with the CJS began when I was 14 or 15 years old .
I grew - up in a sleepy little town , Kingman , Arizona , and because my Grandmother was ill as well as my step - father , we moved into Hanford , California , located in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley .
Moving from a town that did n't have gangs and violence in the schools was a shock , and I found myself in an environment I did n't understand - and after being mugged and beaten - up numerous times , I started hanging around with someone who had several serious encounters with the law - and from that point forward , I made all of the wrong decisions .
I was small for my age , had n't reached puberty yet , and was exasperated by my inability to adjust to gangs and violence that I had never been accustomed to ; prior to leaving Kingman , I had never been in a fight , and suddenly , my world turned upside down .
The mistakes were mine , however , many teens make mistakes - and mine altered the rest of my life .
The article I wrote in 2005 begins below :
Does The United States Condone Torture ?
I was reading CNN this morning , and I came across one of Condoleezza Rice 's statements that literally made my blood boil :
Rice repeated on Thursday that no U.S. personnel are allowed to commit abuses , whether on U.S. soil or overseas .
" The United States does n't engage in torture , does n't condone it , does n't expect its employees to engage in it , " she said .
Link
Why did it make me angry ?
As usual , when Rice is speaking for the administration , it is the " party line " , and truth - which Condi is better at than most in the White House , is how you interpret the statement and then you have to factor in variables that most people do n't even know exist .
As an example , I 'm going to print the draft of Chapter Two in a biography which I attempted to publish 20 years ago , but found out that publishers ( at that time ) refused to accept manuscripts from people that were unknown or represented by an agent .
It 's condensed and lacks many facts that should and will be included in the final copy , but are relevant to Condi 's statement - which I will get into further on in this article .
If we torture American prisoners on our own soil - why should anyone believe that we wo n't do the same to our enemies ?

FRED C. NELLES SCHOOL FOR BOYS
California Youth Authority The Good Life I remember the bus pulling into Fred C. Nelles School for Boys and how beautiful the entire facility appeared .
The lawns were vividly green , each cottage was well manicured and it had the look of a very high - priced vacation spot .
All the individual units had basketball courts and I could see children playing everywhere .
Some appeared to be 16 or 17 years old while others seemed to be small like me .
I do n't remember my exact age , but however old I was , at that time I was extremely small for my age .
I believe that I was 14 years old and had n't even reached puberty .
The racial mix was mostly White and Mexican , although there were some Blacks and even an Oriental or two ;
This was to be home for at least the next eight months .
After processing in a special induction Unit , I was placed in Adams Cottage , based on my age and grade level .
This was supposed to be the unit that would be ideal for my " rehabilitation " .
When I was brought to the Unit carrying my bundle of new clothes everyone stopped to look at me and I was very self - conscious and terrified when I saw the gang tattoos and other signs that this was another world I had never experienced .
At that point I 'm not sure what I was afraid of , albeit my fears proved to well founded .
My Dad had already visited me while I was in the processing Unit and I had a candy bar in my bag .
After getting my bunk assignment , a black kid named Holloway was watching me put away my things .
He saw that I had a candy bar and stated that he wanted it .
I said no , remembering immediately that I did not know how to fight .
Holloway punched me in the face so fast and so many times that I was a bloody mess by the time that Mr. Cantino arrived on the scene .
Without any explanation at all , he unceremoniously kicked the Holloway kid and me in the shins several times as hard as he could .
The Holloway kid just stuck his tongue out at the Counselor , but no , not me .
I had about all that I could take .
Some brat had just beat me up , my candy bar was gone , my face was a bloody mess ,
my shins hurt like hell and I did n't understand why I was punished for not giving in to a bully .
I did n't know how to fight but considered this an excellent time to learn .
But , not being the brightest kid on the block , I went after the Counselor , mainly because he had injured my feelings the most for not standing up for me .
I went at him with arms and legs flailing , screaming at the top of my lungs , intent on making him experience the same pain I was feeling .
That was my first mistake ...
It seems that Mr. Cantino was used to this type of behavior and very quickly turned me around , placed a choke hold on me , and promptly choked me into unconsciousness .
I awoke on the concrete floor shaking with my hands handcuffed behind my back and several of the kids on the unit laughing at me .
My Nickname from that day forward at Nelles was " Outer Limits . "
Nelles was n't too bad at first .
It was weird not to be able to talk going from place to place , and also having to march everywhere we went , but such was the way of the California Youth Authority .
The food was pretty good , school was school , boring , but worse than at home , because it seemed that everyone was already classified as illiterate and incorrigible - in other words , school for me was terribly boring , I was sharp anyway and I loved to learn , only these idiots wanted to teach me what I had already been taught .
Guess how that went over !
It was agony to sit through what I had already learned , especially when the rest of the class seemed completely out - of - touch with the teachers and simply refused to participate other than sitting through the class .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
OP -ED :
In the wake of Israel ’s invasion of Gaza , Israel ’s Defense Minister Ehud Barak made this analogy : “ Think about what would happen if for seven years rockets had been fired at San Diego , California from Tijuana , Mexico . ”
Within hours scores of American pundits and politicians had mimicked Barak ’s comparisons almost verbatim .
In fact , in this very paper on January 9 House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ended an opinion piece by saying “ America would never sit still if terrorists were lobbing missiles across our border into Texas or Montana . ”
But let ’s see if our political and pundit class can parrot this analogy .
Think about what would happen if San Diego expelled most of its Hispanic , African American , Asian American , and Native American population , about 48 percent of the total , and forcibly relocated them to Tijuana ?
Not just immigrants , but even those who have lived in this country for many generations .
Not just the unemployed or the criminals or the America haters , but the school teachers , the small business owners , the soldiers , even the baseball players .
What if we established government and faith - based agencies to help move white people into their former homes ?
And what if we razed hundreds of their homes in rural areas and , with the aid of charitable donations from people in the United States and abroad , planted forests on their former towns , creating nature preserves for whites to enjoy ?
Sounds pretty awful , huh ?
I may be called anti-Semitic for speaking this truth .
Well , I ’m Jewish and the scenario above is what many prominent Israeli scholars say happened when Israel expelled Palestinians from southern Israel and forced them into Gaza .
But this analogy is just getting started .
What if the United Nations kept San Diego ’s discarded minorities in crowded , festering camps in Tijuana for 19 years ?
Then , the United States invaded Mexico , occupied Tijuana and began to build large housing developments in Tijuana where only whites could live .
And what if the United States built a network of highways connecting American citizens of Tijuana to the United States ?
And checkpoints , not just between Mexico and the United States but also around every neighborhood of Tijuana ?
What if we required every Tijuana resident , refugee or native , to show an ID card to the U.S. military on demand ?
What if thousands of Tijuana residents lost their homes , their jobs , their businesses , their children , their sense of self worth to this occupation ?
Would you be surprised to hear of a protest movement in Tijuana that sometimes became violent and hateful ?
Okay , now for the unbelievable part .
Think about what would happen if , after expelling all of the minorities from San Diego to Tijuana and subjecting them to 40 years of brutal military occupation , we just left Tijuana , removing all the white settlers and the soldiers ?
Only instead of giving them their freedom , we built a 20 - foot tall electrified wall around Tijuana ?
Not just on the sides bordering San Diego , but on all the Mexico crossings as well .
What if we set up 50 - foot high watchtowers with machine gun batteries , and told them that if they stood within 100 yards of this wall we would shoot them dead on sight ?
And four out of every five days we kept every single one of those border crossings closed , not even allowing food , clothing , or medicine to arrive .
And we patrolled their air space with our state - of - the - art fighter jets but did n’t allow them so much as a crop duster .
And we patrolled their waters with destroyers and submarines , but did n’t even allow them to fish .
Would you be at all surprised to hear that these resistance groups in Tijuana , even after having been “ freed ” from their occupation but starved half to death , kept on firing rockets at the United States ?
Probably not .
But you may be surprised to learn that the majority of people in Tijuana never picked up a rocket , or a gun , or a weapon of any kind .
The majority , instead , supported against all hope negotiations toward a peaceful solution that would provide security , freedom and equal rights to both people in two independent states living side by side as neighbors .
This is the sound analogy to Israel ’s military onslaught in Gaza today .
Maybe some day soon , common sense will prevail and no corpus of misleading analogies abut Tijuana or the crazy guy across the hall who wants to murder your daughter will be able to obscure the truth .
And at that moment , in a country whose people shouted We Shall Overcome , Ich bin ein Berliner , End Apartheid , Free Tibet and Save Darfur , we will all join together and shout “ Free Gaza .
Free Palestine . ”
And because we are Americans , the world will take notice and they will be free , and perhaps peace will prevail for all the residents of the Holy Land .

Romanesco broccoli displays its fractal - esque nature .
Fractals show self - similarity , or comparable structure regardless of scale .
In other words , a small piece of broccoli , when viewed up close , looks the same as a larger chunk .
( The broccoli is n't a true fractal , because at a certain magnification it loses its self - similar shape , revealing instead regular old molecules . )

Updated | Barack Obama will be sworn into office with the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used for his first inauguration in 1861 .
The move further extends the parallels that Mr. Obama has drawn with Lincoln since he announced his candidacy for president in February 2007 in Springfield , Ill .
This will be the first time an incoming president has used Lincoln ’s Bible , which is part of the collection at the Library of Congress .
( New presidents are not required to swear in on a Bible , but most have done so , and most use their own family Bible . )
Mr. Obama has identified with Lincoln throughout his campaign and quotes him often .
He also plans to follow Lincoln and take the train to Washington for his inauguration , following Lincoln ’s route from Philadelphia to Washington .
The Bible that Lincoln was sworn in on was not the family Bible , which was packed away with his family ’s belongings and still en route from Springfield .
So William Thomas Carroll , Clerk of the Supreme Court , bought this Bible specifically for Lincoln ’s swearing - in ceremony on March 4 , 1861 .
The 1,280 - page Bible was published in 1853 by the Oxford University Press .
The Bible is bound in burgundy velvet with a gold - washed white metal rim around the three outside edges of both covers , according to the official description .
All its edges are heavily gilded .
In the center of the top cover is a shield of gold wash over white metal with the words “ Holy Bible ” chased into it .
Annotated in the back of the volume , along with the Seal of the Supreme Court , is the following : “ I , William Thomas Carroll , clerk of the said court do hereby certify that the preceding copy of the Holy Bible is that upon which the Honble .
R. B. Taney , Chief Justice of the said Court , administered to His Excellency , Abraham Lincoln , the oath of office as President of the United States … ”
The Lincoln Bible will be on display at the Library of Congress
from Feb. 12 to May 9 , as part of an exhibition titled “ With Malice Toward None : The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Exhibition . ”
The exhibit will then travel to five other American cities .
Jennifer Gavin , a spokeswoman for the Library of Congress , tells us there is an elaborate protocol for bringing out such historic treasures as the Lincoln Bible .
The Bible is stored in a secure ( and undisclosed ! ) location in a small preservation box , made of acid - free paper , which fits around it perfectly .
A ribbon or sling runs underneath it to remove it from the box .
When it is taken off - premises , it will be accompanied by multiple library officers .
They are supposed to stay with it while it is “ in use ” and then bring it back .
The Capitol , where the swearing - in takes place , is only across the street from the library , so the journey should not be too arduous , although the area will be packed with visitors .
It is not clear exactly where the library officials will stand while Mr. Obama takes the oath .
There is n’t much room on the podium .
Nor is it clear when they will retrieve the Bible to bring it back to the library .
When the Bible was brought out to be photographed today , museum officials handled it with gloves .
It is unlikely that anyone will ask Mr. Obama to wear gloves when he takes the oath .
And although it will be exposed to daylight , Ms. Gavin said that the exposure would not be long enough to do any damage .
If it ’s raining or snowing , they have to re-think the whole exercise .
One recent case of a rare treasure being removed from the library occurred in January 2007 , when Keith Ellison , a Minnesota Democrat and the first Muslim in Congress , was sworn into office .
He asked to be sworn in with Thomas Jefferson ’s copy of the Koran .
Ms. Gavin said that three library officials took the Koran to the House of Representatives and stood “ close at hand ” during the swearing - in ceremony .
“ We take seriously that we have some priceless items here that belong to the people of the United States , ” Ms. Gavin said .
“ And we take the preservation of these items very seriously . ”
Oakland to fire 11 cops in search warrant case OAKLAND
The scandal has thrown into jeopardy dozens of prosecutions of drug suspects
Oakland intends to fire 11 police officers for allegedly lying to obtain search warrants in drug cases , officials said Thursday .
The two sergeants and nine officers face dismissal in a scandal that has thrown into jeopardy the prosecutions of dozens of suspects .
At least 12 have already had their cases dismissed because warrants that police used to obtain evidence were obtained on the basis of lies by officers , according to attorneys involved in the cases .
The officers told judges that substances seized from drug suspects had been identified by the Oakland police crime lab as narcotics when , in fact , they had not , authorities said .
Those false statements were used to persuade judges to issue warrants that police relied on to gather more evidence .
Some officers also lied to internal affairs investigators looking into the allegations , City Attorney John Russo said .
The officers " knew or should have known that information in their affidavits regarding the testing of drugs was false , " Russo said .
" These terminations are difficult for the city , but they show that honesty and integrity are non-negotiable for officers in the Oakland Police Department , " Russo said .
" The terminations demonstrate that the Oakland Police Department 's internal review systems and reform measures are operating soundly and in the interests of justice . "
Police spokesman Officer Jeff Thomason would not comment on the matter Thursday , saying state law barred police from discussing personnel matters .
However , Assistant Police Chief Howard Jordan has said that what the officers did amounted to procedural errors .
Police Chief Wayne Tucker stressed earlier that internal affairs investigators uncovered the problem and that officers were being retrained .
" We discovered it ; we 're fixing it , " Tucker said in October .
The city is facing two federal civil rights lawsuits over the warrants issue .
One complaint was filed on behalf of two men whose East Oakland homes were searched last year .
Jason Hodge , a spokesman for the men's attorney , said Thursday that Russo 's announcement " strengthens and validates our case .
The city does not have a leg to stand on .
They had a number of rogue officers who are basically trampling on the rights of Oakland residents , and now they 're going to have to pay . "
The other civil complaint is a class - action lawsuit filed by a group of plaintiffs , including Reginald Oliver , 39 .
Prosecutors were forced to drop a charge of illegally possessing ammunition against Oliver after discovering that the search warrant for his home had been obtained by an officer who made intentionally false and / or misleading statements on an affidavit to a judge , the suit said .
Both suits name Officer Karla Rush , an eight - year officer who sources said is among those the city wants to fire .
The names of the other officers were not made public .
Mary Sansen , an attorney for the officers , blasted the city Thursday , saying the blame rests with police commanders who she said failed to train officers on how to write search - warrant affidavits properly .
" The fact that I have anybody who 's being terminated over this case is just simply outrageous , " Sansen said .
" Some of my officers have routinely been denied any form of training .
I have clients who are writing search warrants who have never been to search - writing school , who have been expected to pick up as they go . "
The search - warrant issue was discussed Thursday at a court hearing in San Francisco before U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson .
The judge is overseeing department reforms in the wake of the Riders scandal , which involved a group of officers accused of planting evidence and beating suspects in West Oakland .
Two criminal trials of three former officers ended in mistrials .
The case led to a $ 10.5 million civil settlement with citizens who said they were abused by the officers , along with a court order mandating the reforms that Henderson is overseeing .
An independent monitoring team created as part of the effort said in a report last week on the warrants issue that , " Although the detection and investigation of this alleged misconduct reflects well on the department , the underlying misconduct , if true , is clear indication that the organizational and community values that have been integrated into some parts of the department have not yet taken root throughout OPD . "

Rules which force internet providers to retain information of all emails sent in the UK have been damned as a waste of money and an attack on civil liberties .
Liberty , the human rights group , said the government cannot be trusted to retain this amount of sensitive information and keep it safe .
Its director Shami Chakrabarti told the BBC : " The thing we have to worry about is what happens next because the government is already mooting plans not just to leave this stuff with the providers but to create a central government database where they hold all the information .
" I 'm afraid we just do n't trust any government or any organisation to keep that much very sensitive about us all and to keep it safe . "
The move has also been accused of being a waste of public money that could be better spent by policing the internet more effectively .
Sifting through the amount of emails that are sent in the UK , with a high proportion being spam , will cost a lot of manhours and money to run effectively , it is claimed .
Dr Richard Clayton , security researcher at Cambridge University , said : " I 'd have liked to see more bobbies on an electronic beat investigating internet crimes .
" There are much better things to do to spend our billions on than snooping on everybody in the country just on the off chance that they 're a criminal . "
The new rules , part of the European Commission directive , will start on March 15th , and will require all internet companies to store every email sent in the UK and make the data available to public bodies .
It is believed the government may have to shell out £ 25 to £ 70 million to help ISPs set up the system .
The Home Office believes that this data will become a vital tool in the fight against terrorism and for information gathering .
A spokesperson said : " It will allow investigators to identify suspects , examine their contacts , establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time .
" Implementing the EC directive will enable UK law enforcement to benefit fully from historical communications data in increasingly complex investigations and will enhance our national security . "
The industry is also concerned about the practical implications that this move will have , especially the effect on the smaller companies .
Malcolm Hutty , from Linx , told politics.co.uk : " The larger companies that already retain this information voluntarily will not see any adverse affects .
" The smaller companies , which will be excluded from this , are worried about what happens when the company grows to a size that the Home Office takes notice of .
Will they be expected to implement the rules immediately and how much will this extra expense be , which did not figure in their business plans ? "
The Home Office has said the contents of the emails will not be stored as part of the directive .
This has been edited from a previously published version .
T he dinner had excitedly been planned weeks in advance .
Five fiftysomething women , who , four decades earlier , had marched against the Vietnam War together , protested nuclear testing together and tripped the psychedelic , free - loving fantastic together were going to break bread together for the first time since Woodstock .
I fretted a bit earlier that day because the news from Gaza was growing ever more terrible .
Israeli ground forces were poised to strike , women and children were being killed , and both the media and Canada 's government had turned their backs on this humanitarian disaster .
Even now , the usual opinionators at The New York Times are strangely silent .
The newsnets , as Jon Stewart pointed out on Monday , have trotted out pundit after pontificator to one - sidedly proclaim that " Israel has a right to defend itself " and to blame Hamas for the deaths of civilians .
As I type this , the latest news is that the United Nations has ceased its aid to Gaza , where there is no food , no water , no medical supplies , nowhere to run .
Israeli attacks on UN staff and installations have made the mission too risky .
This after the shelling of a UN school earlier this week killed nearly 40 civilians seeking shelter .
Israel claims that Hamas was using the school as a base .
But , as Time magazine reported on Wednesday , UN investigators say they have uncovered no evidence to support that claim .
Either way , as the great rabbi and Torah scholar Maimonides wrote some 800 years ago , a siege of a city should not surround the city on all four sides , but only on three , so that civilians might escape .
Israeli planes may be dropping leaflets on Gaza warning people to take cover , but there is no cover to take .
Homes , schools , hospitals and civic buildings are under attack .
Which brings me back to my dinner with the girls , all of who are Jewish , three of whom are the daughters of Holocaust survivors .
We 'd had our differences over Israel even back in our " Hey , hey , LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? " days .
Perfectly understandable , given their backgrounds .
One girl has devoted an entire room of her house to Holocaust memorabilia to which , back in my TV critic years , I would contribute preview videos on the subject .
The parents of two others both had spouses and children , all lost in the Nazi camps and ghettos , before they remarried after the war .
Growing up as I did in a Jewish community , where the gentile kids in high school could not fill a single classroom on Yom Kippur , I was steeped in the culture and the history .
I sang Purim songs .
I wanted to pick oranges on a kibbutz .
I even called my diary " Anne " after Anne Frank , who called her diary " Kitty . "
In 1967 , when Israel won the Six - Day War against its hostile Arab neighbours , my father held up a transistor radio to his delicatessen 's intercom system so all his customers could hear the news .
There was dancing in the booths .
It was shortly after that that I began wondering about the Palestinian people and how they had become refugees in their own milk - and - honey land .
I found it hard to reconcile how so many Jews , who had suffered the most heinous persecutions imaginable , could treat another people , their Semitic cousins , so callously , despite how they had nothing to do with the Holocaust .
But I learned to keep my thoughts to myself because the strain on my friendships was too great .
Not all of them , mind you .
There are some friends , including some Israeli - born , who see the situation as I do .
They are courageous , risking the wrath and scorn of their families .
One of them even hosts a Passover seder in the name of the Exodus , the Holocaust and Al Nakba , the Palestinian " catastrophe . "
There we mix secular protest songs with traditional prayers , and the dishes include olives and oranges -- to symbolize hoped for peace between Palestinians and Israelis -- along with the usual matzoh , greens and beets .
Like Judy Rebick and the other women who occupied the Israeli consulate on Wednesday , and the other prominent Jews who spoke out on Thursday both in Toronto and Montreal , and the tens of thousands who marched in Tel Aviv last week , these friends do not want the slaughter to continue in the name of the Jewish people .
I wish more friends would protest , as they protested against other cruel wars long ago .
I wish we could even discuss this , just as we do our former boyfriends and those long - lost days of peace and love .
But we do not mention it .
Even the agreement not to speak of it is unspoken .
The silence is deafening .

Apple Inc CEO
Steve Jobs displays a redesigned iPod Nano at Apple 's " Let 's Rock " media event in San Francisco , California , September 9 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Robert Galbraith
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Shares of Apple Inc fell as much as 2 percent on Tuesday after technology website Gizmodo reported a “ rumor ” that Chief Executive Steve Jobs ’s health was declining .
A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the rumor .
When asked about Jobs ’s health , the spokesman said “ if ever Steve or the board of directors decided that he was no longer capable of doing his job as CEO of Apple , I ’m sure they will let you know . ”
Gizmodo quoted a “ solid source , ” which it did not identify , as saying that Jobs ’s “ rapidly declining ” health was the real reason behind his decision to cancel a keynote speech at next week ’s MacWorld conference .
It titled the report “ rumor . ”
Apple shares had been trading up 1.5 percent at $ 87.92 before moving sharply lower .
The stock then recovered to trade down about half a percent at $ 86.15 by mid-afternoon .
“ The main reason why Apple shares have sold off midday is that a website reported that Steve Jobs health is getting worse , citing an unidentified source , ” said William Lefkowitz , an options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments .
“ However , this is not the first time Steve Jobs health has come into question .
In the past , this has created large fluctuations in Apple stock , ” he said .

I was introduced to " Petals Around the Rose " by Dr. Richard Duke at the University of Michigan .
Dr. Duke used to begin each of his gaming / simulation courses with this exercise .
While some students would solve the problem right away , others would struggle all semester .
It had taken Dr. Duke well over a year himself , and he would always explain that the smarter you were , the longer it took to figure it out .
The game is quite simple .
Only a basic understanding of math is required and an open and creative mind .
The game can be used as an example of how different people look at the world differently , and how these different ways of looking can yield different answers .
In " Petals Around the Rose " there is always one correct answer .
The problem is how we define the problem .
" Petals Around the Rose " is traditionally played with 5 six - sided dice .
I developed this version using Macromedia Flash as both an exercise for me to learn Flash and as a way to share the game with the world .

Successful Alert !!!
It looks like someone is just putting in the motions this week , biding her time for her next chance in the spotlight .
I 'm sure the McCain campaign appreciates the hell out of this .
BLITZER : And this just coming into the " Situation Room , " the Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin now speaking out openly about her intentions in 2012 if , if she and John McCain were to lose this contest next Tuesday .
In an interview with ABC News , Sarah Palin is now saying , she would be interested in remaining a serious national political figure , going ahead to 2012 .
She was asked what happens in 2012 if you lose on Tuesday , would you simply go back to Alaska ?
Elizabeth Vargas of ABC
News asked her and Palin said this , and I will read it to you verbatim according to an ABC News transcript : " Absolutely not , " Sarah Palin says .
" I think that , if I were to give up and wave a white flag of surrender against some of the political shots that we 've taken , that ... that would ... bring this whole ... I 'm not doin ' this for naught , " and that is a direct quote from Sarah Palin .
Clearly , leaving open the possibility that she would be interested in leading the Republican Party in 2012 if she and John McCain were to lose this presidential contest right now .
Let 's go to Dana Bash .
She has been covering the McCain campaign reaction from the rather blunt statement from Sarah Palin that she would in fact be interested in leading the Republican Party going forward after Tuesday if they lose ?
BASH : I just got off of the phone , Wolf , with a senior McCain adviser and I read this person the quote and I think it is fair to say that this person was speechless .
There was a long pause and I just heard a " huh " on the other end of the phone .
This is certainly not a surprise to anybody who has watched Sarah Palin that she is interested in potentially future national runs , and she is being urged to by a lot of people inside of the Republican Party if they do lose , but it is an " if " and people inside of the McCain campaign do not want any discussion that has an " if " in front of it six days before the election , they do n't want any discussion at all , any kind of hypothetical talk about running for the next time around .
So certainly , this is not at least initially being received well inside of the McCain campaign .
BLITZER : I am not surprised , not surprised at all .
It is one of those " wow , she is talking about 2012 if we lose , " that is not supposed to be something that you say .
You are supposed to say , " well , I 'm not looking ahead , I 'm not looking ahead only to Tuesday , " and those are the talking points she 's supposed to be saying , but she is obviously blunt and she is looking ahead if something were to happen on Tuesday that she would n't be happy with .
The ocean may soon begin to sound more like New York City to dolphins and whales .
As carbon dioxide levels rise and make the world 's oceans warmer and more acidic , the increasing amounts of the gas could also make the seas noisier , especially in the soprano range , a new study suggests .
The increased burning of fossils fuels such as coal and oil in the last few decades has injected more and more carbon dioxide into the Earth 's atmosphere .
The oceans absorb a large chunk of this extra carbon dioxide ( about 40 percent ) .
The more carbon dioxide that water absorbs , the more acidic it becomes ; this is why sodas , with their carbon dioxide bubbles , are acidic .
This change in seawater chemistry alters the way sound moves through the ocean , allowing it to propagate farther , particularly for sounds two and a half octaves above " middle C , " said researcher Keith Hester of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California .
Ocean acidity
Here is a sketch of how it works :
The slow absorption of carbon dioxide by the ocean changes the water 's pH .
The pH of a liquid is gauged on a scale of about - 1 to 14 , where 7 is neutral .
Anything above that is basic ( for example , household bleach has a pH of about 13 ) , anything below is acidic ( lemon juice has a pH of about 2 ) .
The standard pH of ocean water is about 8.3 , or slightly basic / alkaline .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) estimates that the pH of ocean waters has decreased by about 0.02 units per decade over the last 20 years .
The most conservative projections of the IPCC suggest that the pH of seawater could drop by a total of 0.3 units by 2050 .
Not only does this increasing acidity threaten the ocean food chain by hampering the formation of shells and corals , it could also affect the communication of marine mammals by changing the way sound travels through the seawater .
Essentially , the more acidic seawater gets , the farther sound travels in it .
Sending sound farther
While the interactions causing this phenomenon are n't completely understood , chemists do know that seawater of different pHs absorbs specific frequencies differently .
The more acidic that seawater is , the less low - and mid-frequency sound that it absorbs , letting those frequencies travel farther .
With sounds traveling farther , the level of noise in the ocean will increase , Hester and his colleagues found in their study , detailed in the Oct. 1 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
Hester 's calculations predict that the change in chemistry will have the greatest effect on sounds below about 3,000 cycles per second ( or about two and a half octaves above " middle C " on the piano ) .
This range includes most of the frequencies that marine mammals , such as whales , use to communicate to find food and mates , as well as many of the underwater sounds generated by industrial activity and ships .
( This human - generated noise has also increased in recent years , with evidence that it is affecting marine mammal communication . )
Hester and his team found that sound may already be traveling 10 percent farther than it did a few hundred years ago because of the carbon dioxide the ocean has already absorbed since the beginning of the industrial revolution .
By 2050 , they predict that sound could travel as much as 70 percent farther in some ocean areas ( particularly the Atlantic Ocean ) .
The study was supported by grants from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation .

President Obama has pledged that three - quarters of the fund will be spent out in the first 18 months , Mr. Summers said in defense of the plan .

“ We believe that this is a properly sized approach to move the economy forward , ” he said .
He also said that there might be additional assistance to banks beyond the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program already approved by Congress .
Of Mr. Obama ’s plans for how the next $ 350 billion of TARP funding will be spent , he said , “ It ’s going to be very different than what you ’ve seen so far , ” with an emphasis on transparency , accountability , and “ getting credit flowing again . ”
“ The next few months are , no question , going to be very , very difficult and it may be longer than that , ” Mr. Summers said .
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Sunday that he believed that the stimulus package would ultimately pass with “ fairly strong vote across the board . ”
“ If you notice , roughly 40 percent of this entire package is tax cuts , ” the vice president said on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation . ”
“ That ’s not what the Democrats wanted .
And 60 percent of it is spending , economic stimulus .
That ’s not what the Republicans wanted .
But we ’ve come a pretty long way already .
So there will be , I ’m sure , more compromise . ”
Mr. Boehner and other Republicans have taken issue with the large chunk of funding in the stimulus package  some $ 300 billion all told  that will go to shore up the budgets of states .
That figure includes billions in state aid to education and such controversial pieces as millions in spending for family - planning initiatives .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , speaking on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” said that the assistance to states was necessary , including the family - planning funds .
“ The family - planning services reduce cost , ” she said .
“ The states are in terrible fiscal budget crisis now , and part of it , what we do for children ’s health , education , and some of those elements , are to help the states meet their financial needs . ”

Summer means preparing yourself for hiking in hot weather .
Dealing with heat is a fact of life and not just on desert trails .
High humidity can send the heat index ( how hot the combination of air temperature and relative humidity feels to your body ) well above 100 degrees , even in northern parts of the country .
So no matter where you live , it ’s critical that you pay attention to weather conditions before you head out for a day of summer hiking .
Other than simply not hiking , there ’s no way to completely eliminate the risks .
But you can greatly reduce the dangers by taking basic precautions .
Planning Ahead

You ’ll want a hat that you ’re willing to soak with water from a creek or lake .

Use ( and pack ) sunscreen .
Exposed , sunburned skin will only make it more difficult for your body to stay cool .
Hydration
On hot days , your body can lose large amounts of water through perspiration .
The general rule is that you can sweat roughly a quart of water every hour — and even more when hiking uphill or in direct sunlight .
Hiking at higher altitudes will also accelerate the loss of body fluids .
In arid climates , you may not even notice how much you ’re sweating because of rapid rates of evaporation .
And as you perspire , you also lose vital minerals from your system .
Proper hydration is essential to the health of the body ’s organs , including the brain .
Dehydration can lead to impaired brain functioning , which then results in confusion and impaired judgment .
Blood can also thicken , forcing the heart to work harder .
Start the hydration process before you go out .
Begin to hydrate a couple of hours before you hit the trail .

Pay attention to your body .
Do n't ration water .
If you are thirsty , drink .
When you 're halfway through your water supply , it 's time to turn around .
Drink frequently .
Instead of guzzling a bunch of water all at once , take smaller and more frequent drinks of water .

Check your urine .
If you ’re properly hydrated , you should be able to produce a large amount of light - colored , clear urine .
If the urine appears dark and concentrated , you may be dehydrated .
Preventing Hyponatremia
Yes , you can drink too much water .
A condition called hyponatremia can occur when hikers drink large amounts of water without replenishing electrolytes .
That can cause blood sodium levels to plunge because too much salt ends up getting sweated out of the body .
Hyponatremia is a potentially serious condition that can lead to seizures .
Replenish With Electrolytes .
In addition to restoring fluids , you need to maintain your body ’s proper levels of sodium , magnesium , and potassium .
Salt residue on your clothing or the inside of your hat is a possible warning sign of hyponatremia .
So as you rehydrate , alternate water intake with consumption of fluids with electrolytes , such as sports drinks .

Eat snacks with salt .
Salt in foods can help restore sodium levels in the bloodstream .
So in addition to drinking plenty of fluids on hot days , be sure to snack frequently on foods with salt , such as nuts , pretzels , and trail mix .
Preventing Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke
Hot conditions can overwhelm the body ’s cooling mechanisms .
Heat exhaustion results from a combination of high body temperature and dehydration .
It can lead to heat stroke , which is potentially fatal .
In the event of heat stroke , it ’s critical that you lower the victim ’s body temperature by immersing or keeping the person wet to increase evaporative cooling .
The victim needs hospital treatment as soon as possible but should n’t be allowed to try and hike out on his or her own .
The Commons culture committee yesterday heard claims that lapdancing is " not sexually stimulating " during a hearing into the Licensing Act which is pondering reclassifying lapdancing clubs as " sex encounter establishments " - something which would make it easier for local councils to refuse them licences .
According to the Guardian , the statement by chairman of the Lap Dancing Association , Simon Warr , was " greeted with scepticism " by MPs .
Warr insisted the clubs were providing hospitality , rather than sex , and " astonished " the committee by explaining : " One of the biggest problems we face is that not enough people understand the business blueprint of our clubs .
Actually , our premises are not sexually stimulating .
It would be contrary to our business plan if they were . "
A suitably astonished Philip Davies , the Tory MP for Shipley , interjected : " You are saying that the purpose of a lap dancing club is not to be sexually stimulating ?
Most people would find that a rather incredible claim . "
Warr defended : " Then you need to go to a club , because the purpose of a club is to provide entertainment .
It 's to provide alcohol , it 's a place of leisure .
All right , the entertainment may be in the form of nude or semi-nude performers , but it 's not sexually stimulating . "
Davies , by now pretty well incredulous , the Guardian notes , persisted : " So if I did a straw poll of all the customers who came out a lap dancing club and said ' Did you find that in any way sexually stimulating ? '
I would find a big resounding fat zero ?
On that basis you would have a lot of dissatisfied customers . "
Warr offered : " How do you measure sexual stimulation .
What is the definition of sexual stimulation ? "
Veteran club entrepreneur Peter Stringfellow then weighed into the fray , explaining , that : " Of course it 's sexually stimulating .
So is a disco .
So is a young girl flashing away with her knickers showing .
Of course it 's sexually stimulating .
So is David Beckham laid out in his Calvin Klein [ underwear ] .
So are the Chippendales .
Of course it does have some form of sex .
" But what my colleague was trying to explain was that it 's not sex , 100 per cent .
It 's not ' I 'm going to go and get divorced . '
It does not go on like that .
Our environment lasts three minutes .
Their clothes are on and off before you can blink .
It 's a lot more to do with personality .
It 's a lot more to do with the ambience of the club . "
Stringfellow further argued that a change of the law was not required because council could stipulate a " no nudity " requirement on licences and use this to close down " badly - run " establishments .
Kate Nicholls , the secretary of the Lap Dancing Association , agreed that councils " already had enough power to stop clubs opening under the existing legislation " , which " allows them to consider issues such as public safety , public order , public nuisance and the protection of children " .
Those of you who'd like to know who's to blame for this debate on a matter of national importance can finger backbench Labour MP Roberta Blackman - Woods , who apparently proposed the reclassification .
Earlier this month , her action prompted Spearmint Rhino to dispatch a couple of lapdancers to Downing Street to impress on the PM that the offending clubs were not dens of iniquity .
Spokeswoman Elaine Reed said : “ The workers within our industry are absolutely horrified that the Government are trying to rebrand us as part of the sex industry .
It ’s quite clear we are not part of the sex industry , we never have been and we do n’t intend to be .
Our clubs are controlled , there ’s no sexual activity going on . ”
Davies , however , yesterday pressed the Lap Dancing Association to answer allegations " that at some clubs dancers do offer sexual services , contrary to the rules " .
The association 's vice chairman , Chris Knight , responded : " We are not saying there are not bad clubs .
There are bad drivers .
But you do not change the way that you licence drivers . " ®

America is overspending and under - serving women and families .
The problem is not access to care ; it is the care itself .
Some healthcare trivia :
In the United States , what is the No. 1 reason
people are admitted to the hospital ?
Not diabetes , not heart attack ,
not stroke .
The answer is something that is n’t even a disease :
childbirth .
Not only is childbirth the most common reason for a hospital stay —
more than 4 million American women give birth each year — it costs the
country far more than any other health condition .
Six of the 15 most
frequent hospital procedures billed to private insurers and Medicaid
are maternity - related .
The nation ’s maternity bill totaled $ 86 billion
in 2006 , nearly half of which was picked up by taxpayers .
But cost has n’t translated into quality .
We spend more than double per
capita on childbirth than other industrialized countries , yet our rates
of pre-term birth , newborn death and maternal death rank us dismally in
comparison .
Last month , the March of Dimes gave the country a " D " on
its prematurity report card ; California got a " C , " but 18 other states
and the District of Columbia , where 15.9 % of babies are born too early ,
failed entirely .
The U.S. ranks 41st among industrialized nations in maternal mortality .
And there are unconscionable racial disparities : African American
mothers are three times more likely to die in childbirth than white
mothers .

In short , we are overspending and under - serving women and families .
If
the United States is serious about health reform , we need to begin ,
well , at the beginning .
The problem is not access to care ; it is the care itself .
As a new
joint report by the Milbank Memorial Fund , the Reforming States Group
and Childbirth Connection makes clear , American maternity wards are not
following evidence - based best practices .
They are inducing and speeding
up far too many labors and reaching too quickly for the scalpel : Nearly
one - third of births are now by caesarean section , more than twice what
the World Health Organization has documented is a safe rate .
In fact ,
the report found that the most common billable maternity procedures —
continuous electronic fetal monitoring , for instance — have no clear
benefit when used routinely .
The most cost - effective , health - promoting maternity care for
normal , healthy women is midwife led and out of hospital .
Hospitals
charge from $ 7,000 to $ 16,000 , depending on the type and complexity of
the birth .
The average birth - center fee is only $ 1,600 because
high - tech medical intervention is rarely applied and stays are shorter .
This model of care is not just cheaper ; decades of medical research
show that it ’s better .
Mother and baby are more likely to have a
normal , vaginal birth ; less likely to experience trauma , such as a bad
vaginal tear or a surgical delivery ; and more likely to breast feed .
In
other words , less is actually more .
The Obama administration could save the country billions by overhauling the American way of birth .
Consider Washington , where a state review of licensed midwives ( just
100 in practice ) found that they saved the state an estimated $ 2.7
million over two years .
One reason for the savings is that midwives
prevent costly caesarean surgeries : 11.9 % of midwifery patients in
Wash - ington ended up with C- sections , compared with 24 % of low - risk
women in traditional obstetric care .
Currently , just 1 % of women nationwide get midwife - led care outside a
hospital setting .
Imagine the savings if that number jumped to 10 % or
even 30 % .
Imagine if hospitals started promoting best practices : giving
women one - on - one , continuous support , promoting movement and water
immersion for pain relief , and reducing the use of labor stimulants and
labor induction .
The C- section rate would plummet , as would related
infections , hemorrhages , neonatal intensive care admissions and deaths .
And the country could save some serious cash .
The joint Milbank report
conservatively estimates savings of $ 2.5 billion a year if the
caesarean rate were brought down to 15 % .
To be frank , the U.S. maternity care system needs to be turned upside
down .
Midwives should be caring for the majority of pregnant women , and
physicians should continue to handle high - risk cases , complications and
emergencies .
This is the division of labor , so to speak , that you find
in the countries that spend less but get more .
In those countries , a persistent public health concern is a
midwife shortage .
In the U.S. , we do n’t have similar regard for
midwives or their model of care .
Hospitals frequently shut down
nurse - midwifery practices because they do n’t bring in enough revenue .
And although certified nurse midwives are eligible providers under
federal Medicaid law and mandated for reimbursement , certified
professional midwives — who are trained in out - of - hospital birth care
— are not .
In several state legislatures , they are fighting simply to
be licensed , legal healthcare providers .
( Californians are lucky —
certified professional midwives are licensed , and Medi-Cal covers
out - of - hospital birth . )
Barack Obama could be , among so many other firsts , the first
birth - friendly president .
How about a Midwife Corps to recruit and
train the thousands of new midwives we ’ll need ?
How about federal
funding to create hundreds of new birth centers ?
How about an ad
campaign to educate women about optimal birth ?
America needs better birth care , and midwives can deliver it .
This is it fans .

They include 2 hard - luck women , one Super Bowl hero , one average Joe , and 2 political dolts .
Vote now for who think think deserves this most unfortunate honor !
May your worst person win .
President George W. Bush :
The final year of his presidency was his worst .
Wall Street collapsed as did his dismal approval ratings .
Hillary Clinton : Democrat presidential front runner nose dived against Obama .
She played dirty and that did n't work .
She lost , sucked it up and accepted the job of Secretary of State .
That means taking orders from Obama for the next 4 years .
Joe " the plumber " Wurzelbacher : Election 2008 turned him into a punching bag .
He meant well but every time he opened his mouth the wrong words came out .
Gov. Sarah Palin :
She burst onto the national stage but seemed over - matched to handle the pressure .
Now that the dust has settled even McCain 's people admit she was a disaster .
She 'll be back in 2012 , you betcha !
Plaxico Burress :
Every year one sports star does something so monumentally stupid that he transcends the sport and opens himself up for national ridicule .
If he 's not loser of the year , he 's certainly Sports Loser of they year .
Gov. Rod Blagojevich :
This dude showed a ton of stupidity in trying to openly sell the Illinois Senate seat .
His actions continue to defy logic as well as his democratic foes .
His saga will certainly continue into 2009 .

What happens when science fiction becomes battlefield reality ?
An amazing revolution is taking place on the battlefield , starting to change not just how wars are fought , but also the politics , economics , laws , and ethics that surround war itself .
This upheaval is already afoot — remote - controlled drones take out terrorists in Afghanistan , while the number of unmanned systems on the ground in Iraq has gone from zero to 12,000 over the last five years .
But it is only the start .
Military officers quietly acknowledge that new prototypes will soon make human fighter pilots obsolete , while the Pentagon researches tiny robots the size of flies to carry out reconnaissance work now handled by elite Special Forces troops .
Wired for
War takes the reader on a journey to meet all the various players in this strange new world of war : odd - ball roboticists working in latter - day “ skunk works ” in the midst of suburbia ; military pilots flying combat mission from their office cubicles outside Las Vegas ; the Iraqi insurgents who are their targets ; journalists trying to figure out just how to cover robots at war ; and human rights activists wrestling with what is right and wrong in a world where our wars are increasingly being handed over to machines .
If issues like these sound like science fiction , that ’s because many of the new technologies were actually inspired by some of the great sci-fi of our time ­ from Terminator and Star Trek to the works of Asimov and Heinlein .
In fact , Singer reveals how the people who develop new technologies consciously draw on such sci-fiction when pitching them to the Pentagon , and he even introduces the sci - fi authors who quietly consult for the military .
But , whatever its origins , our new machines will profoundly alter warfare , from the frontlines to the home front .
When planes can be flown into battle from an office 10,000 miles away ( or even fly themselves , like the newest models ) , the experiences of war and the very profile of a warrior change dramatically .
Singer draws from historical precedent and the latest Pentagon research to argue that wars will become easier to start , that the traditional moral and psychological barriers to killing will fall , and that the “ warrior ethos ” ­ the code of honor and loyalty which unites soldiers ­ will erode .
Paradoxically , these new unmanned technologies will also seemingly bring war closer to our doorsteps , including even with videos of battles downloaded for entertainment .
But Singer also proves that our enemies will not settle for fighting our high - tech proxies on their own turf .
He documents , for instance , how Hezbollah deployed unmanned aircraft in the Lebanese war of 2006 , and how America may even fall behind in this revolution , as its adversaries gain knockoffs of our own technology , or even develop better tech of their own invention .
While his predictions are unnerving , there ’s an irresistible gee - whiz quality to what Singer uncovers and the people he meets along the way .
It is packed with cutting edge research and hard to get interviews of everyone from four star Army generals and Middle East leaders to reclusive science fiction authors .
Yet it also seamlessly weaves in pop culture and illuminating anecdotes to create a book that is both highly readable and accessible .
In laying out where our technologies are taking us to next , WIRED FOR WAR is as fascinating as it is frightening .

Dos viejas creencias de la biología han sido cuestionadas recientemente .
La primera que el plumaje del Pavo Real esté ‘ diseñado ’ para atraer al sexo opuesto y la otra que los camaleones cambien de color para mimetizarse con el medio .
Aparentemente ninguna de las dos sería cierta .
Una nueva investigación que ha durado 7 años reporta que las hembras de una población salvaje de Pavo de la India ( Pavo cristatus ) no muestran preferencia por los machos con exuberante plumaje .
El controvertido documento contradice premiados estudios anteriores que son parte del canon de la biología evolutiva .
De un artículo de la revista Science .
En la mayoría de las especies , las hembras escogen al macho , aparentemente , evaluando rasgos que dan pistas de salud genética .
Por ejemplo , el plumaje del pavo real es más largo que su cuerpo y decorado con círculos similares a ojos de color chillón .
El número de círculos puede estar relacionado con la calidad de los genes del macho , por lo que una hembra debería escoger al pavo con el mayor número .
En el estudio más citado de plumaje del pavo real , el biólogo evolutivo Marion Petrie de la Universidad de Newcastle en el Reino Unido cortó la parte con los círculos de las plumas de los pavos macho , y las hembras ignoraron a estos ejemplares .
Además , los polluelos engendrados por los macho con mayor número de adornos tuvieron a largo plazo mayor supervivencia que el resto de polluelos .
El equipo de Mariko Takahashi tenía previsto confirmar estos resultados .
Sin embargo , a pesar de observación de 268 emparejamientos , el equipo no pudo identificar ningún rasgo masculino preferido que las hembras , según informaron en el número de abril de Animal Behaviour .
El plumaje podría haber servido inicialmente como una señal a las mujeres , supone Takahashi , un conductista animal en la Universidad de Tokio en Japón .
Pero , al igual que la moda del año pasado , ahora ha pasado de moda .
Si las hembras ignoran las plumas , ¿por qué los machos gastan energía para que crezcan y mantenerlas ?
Michael Ryan , un etólogo de la Universidad de Texas , Austin , dice que los pavos macho pueden mantener este plumaje porque después de que una hembra muestra interés , el pavo sacude las plumas para hacer un ruido que es necesario para el apareamiento .
“ Sin el plumaje , no podría hacer esa música ” , dice .
En otro artículo de Science .
Todo el mundo sabe lo que hace especial al camaleón , su capacidad para cambiar de color .
Según una reciente publicación en PLoS Biology , su flexibilidad de pigmentación podría tratarse de una forma sexy y peligrosa de destacar y no de mimetizarse .
Los macho de Camaleón son generalmente de color marrón o verde apagados .
Pero gracias a un revestimiento especial de las células de la piel conectadas directamente a sus cerebros , los lagartos pueden rápidamente cambiar a una variedad de otros colores , incluyendo verde brillante , amarillo , e incluso rosa .
Anteriores investigaciones mostraban que el uso de colores para intimidar a otros machos en la lucha contra él o para impresionar a las hembras cuando coquetean .
Pero persiste la creencia , incluso entre los biólogos , que el cambio de color también evolucionó para ayudar a los camaleones ocultarse de las aves de caza .
Para refutar esta idea de una vez por todas , el zoólogo Devi Stuart - Fox , de la Universidad de Melbourne , Australia , y Adnan Moussalli biólogo de la Universidad de KwaZulu Natal en Pietermaritzburg , Sudáfrica , estudiaron 21 especies de Sudáfrica de camaleones enanos .
Algunas de estas especies tienen una mayor paleta de colores que otros , utilizando rosa , amarillo , e incluso los colores ultravioleta invisibles para el ojo humano .
Los investigadores enfrentaron camaleones macho y utilizaron un espectrómetro para medir la gama de patrones de colores que cada una de las especies producía .
A continuación , comparó esta gama de colores a los colores encontrados en cada tipo de hábitat del camaleón .
Los colores brillantes de la realidad destacan los lagartos , según informes de los equipos .
Para averiguar cómo ven estos colores otros camaleones – y depredadores – los investigadores usaron modelos de computadora que semejan los ojos de diversas especies .
Encontraron una correlación clara entre la visión de un camaleón y su capacidad de producir un conjunto determinado de colores , indirecta pero fuerte evidencia de que el cambio de color que está ‘ diseñado ’ para ser visto por un camaleón , dice Stuart - Fox .
Pero el equipo también encontró que las aves también pueden ver el contraste de color bastante bien , de modo que enseñar sus colores brillantes es un riesgo para los camaleones .
El estudio proporciona fuerte evidencia de que el cambio de color del camaleón ha evolucionado principalmente para la comunicación , dice el etólogo Roger Hanlon del Laboratorio de Biología Marina en Woods Hole , Massachusetts .
Nadie ha demostrado que la habilidad especial del camaleón le proporcione camuflaje , dice Hanlon , quien estudió 100 años de literatura científica sobre el tema .
Eso , combinado con los resultados de esta investigación , dice , debe desenmascarar definitivamente el mito popular – hasta que alguien encuentre una nueva especie que justifique la creencia .

I am 24 years - old and have been reading your blog since I was a freshman in college .
I majored in Finance , was in the College Republican group , campaigned for George Bush , my dad owns a successful small business , I am evangelical , and I live in Colorado , a swing state .
All of this would seem to bode well for the Republican Party easily capturing my vote this year , especially in a year where it may be more necessary than others .
However , last night while I watched the debate I decided to not vote in the presidential election this year .
I know this may sound like a ridiculous forfeit of a hard - earned American right , but I honestly cannot bring myself to vote for either candidate .
There has been such a pattern of disappointment coming out of the Republican Party in the last several years that has all recently come to a head for me , and become consuming enough that I can no longer ignore it and simply check the correct box .

China Planning World 's Largest Solar Farm
January 2nd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
2008 was an exciting year for solar energy , and 2009 is shaping up to be even better .
Earlier this week , the China Technology Development Group Corp. and Qinghai New Energy Co. announced plans to build a 1 GW solar farm in China — the largest in the world .
Construction will begin this year on the first part of the project — a $ 150 million , 30 MW crystalline silicon and thin film solar power station in the Qaidam Basin .
The full timeline for the project is not currently available .
If the solar farm is completed , it will be nearly twice as large as the largest solar installation to be announced thus far .
Optisolar ’s planned 550 MW thin film solar plant in San Luis Obispo , CA would supply energy to Pacific Gas and Electric Co .

Hydrogen Could Be Produced from Sewage and Dough
January 5th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Hydrogen fuel cells have long been hailed as the next big thing to replace petroleum in cars , but there is one major problem : hydrogen is usually produced from fossil fuels .
Fortunately , a multitude of companies are looking at alternative hydrogen sources — including sewage and dough .
A Japanese company called Kajima has been looking into the sewage idea in conjunction with Tokyo University .
The company ’s research shows that microbes can create hydrogen from human waste and run-off water from rice fields .
Kajima ’s prototype fuel cell can generate 130W from a cubic meter of waste .
While this is n’t efficient enough to take to market quite yet , the company expects a commercial product by 2020 .
Sapporo Breweries , on the other hand , has a product much closer to commercial launch .
The popular beer maker has been working on a plan to decompose waste dough at factory bakeries for hydrogen production since 2005 .
As of right now , the company is able to produce 25,000 liters of hydrogen from 125 kg of waste food — a big enough number that Sapporo ’s technology will be on the market for food - processing plants starting next year .
Who knows — if this technology takes off , maybe the often - ridiculed hydrogen economy will become a reality .

The amount of free , interesting , and useful data is growing explosively .
Luckily , computer are getting cheaper as we speak , they are all connected with a robust communication infrastructure , and software for analyzing data is better than ever .
That ’s why everyone is interested in easy to use frameworks like MapReduce for every - day programmers to run their data crunching in parallel .
octo.py is a very simple MapReduce like system inspired by Ruby ’s Starfish .
“ Octo . py does n’t aim to meet all your distributed computing needs , but its simple approach is amendable to a large proportion of parallelizable tasks .
If your code has a for - loop , there ’s a good chance that you can make it distributed with just a few small changes .
If you ’re already using Python ’s map ( ) and reduce ( ) functions , the changes needed are trivial ! ”
triangular.py is the simple example given in the documentation that is used with octo.py to compute the first 100 triangular numbers .
# triangular .py compute first 100 triangular numbers .
Do # ' octo.py server triangular.py ' on server with address IP # and ' octo.py client IP ' on each client .
Server uses source # & final , sends tasks to clients , integrates results .
Clients # get tasks from server , use mapfn & reducefn , return results .
source = dict ( zip ( range ( 100 ) , range ( 100 ) ) ) def final ( key , value ) : print key , value def mapfn ( key , value ) : for i in range ( value + 1 ) : yield key , i def reducefn ( key , value ) : return sum( value )
Put octo.py on all of the machines you want to use .
On the machine you will use as a server ( with ip address < ip > ) , also install triangular.py , and then execute :
python octo.py server triangular.py &
On each of your clients , run
python octo.py client < ip > &
You can try this out using the same machine to run the server process and one or more client processes , of course .
When the clients register with the server , they will get a copy of triangular .py and wait for tasks from the server .
The server access the data from source and distributed tasks to the clients .
These in turn use mapfn and reducefn to complete the tasks , returning the results .
The server integrates these and , when all have completed , invokes final , which in this case just prints the answers , and halts .
The clients continue to run , waiting for more tasks to do .
Octo.py is not a replacement for more sophisticated frameworks like Hadoop or Disco but if you are working in Python , its KISS approach is a good way to get started with the MapReduce paradigm and might be all you need for a small projects .
( Note : The package has not been updated since April 2008 , so it ’s status is not clear .
But further development would run the risk of making it more complex and would be self - defeating . )
President Barack Obama , left , and Vice President Joe Biden , listen to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner speak after Biden swore him in as Treasury Secretary at the Treasury Department on Monday in Washington .
WASHINGTON  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner picked a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist as a top aide Tuesday , the same day he announced rules aimed at reducing the role of lobbyists in agency decisions .
Mark Patterson will serve as Geithner 's chief of staff at Treasury , which oversees the government 's $ 700 billion financial bailout program .
Goldman Sachs received $ 10 billion of that money .
PERSONAL WEALTH : Geithner 's assets significantly lower than Paulson 's Treasury spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said Patterson " brings significant expertise to the job . "
Patterson , who left the investment bank in April , signed the administration 's ethics pledge , which requires him to recuse himself from issues " directly and substantially related to my former employer . "
Melanie Sloan , executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , said President Obama was retreating from his own ethics rules barring lobbyists from working on the issues they lobbied about during the previous two years .
" It makes it appear that they are saying one thing and doing another , " she said .
The White House waived the rules Friday for William Lynn , who lobbied for a defense contractor last year , to serve as deputy Defense secretary .
Geithner issued rules Tuesday to restrict lobbyists from contacting Treasury about bailout issues .
A USA TODAY review of Obama hires shows that 21 have registered as federal lobbyists , although most have not done so within the past two years .
They include White House aide Cecilia Muñoz , who lobbied last year for the National Council of La Raza , and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , who lobbied in 2007 for a national teachers union .
White House spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said Obama is following through on his commitment to operate under strict ethical standards .
Dave Wenhold , of the American League of Lobbyists , said lobbyists bring expertise to the job .
" Just because you are registered to lobby does n't mean that you are evil , " he said .

Israel and Hamas responded to a UN peace demand by hammering away at each other with bombs , shells and rockets today .
Ignoring international pleas for the fighting in Gaza to cease , Israel continued its air attacks and the Palestinian militants kept up their missile barrages .
The Palestinian death toll for the two - week conflict rose to 777 , many of them children .
Thirteen Israelis have also been killed .

Overnight the UN Security Council had approved a resolution calling urgently for an immediate , durable and fully respected ceasefire , leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza .
The US , Israel 's closest ally , abstained from the vote .
In Israel 's first official response to the resolution , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's office said the Hamas rockets fired at Israel today " only prove that the UN 's decision is not practical and will not be kept in practice by the Palestinian murder organisations . "
A Hamas spokesman said the Islamic militant group " is not interested " in the ceasefire because it was not consulted and the resolution did not meet its minimum demands .
He said the UN failed to consider the interests of the Palestinian people .
" This resolution does n't mean that the war is over , " he said .
Israel 's government says any ceasefire must guarantee an end to rocket fire and arms smuggling into Gaza .
Hamas has said it will not accept any agreement that does not include the full opening of Gaza 's blockaded border crossings .
Israel is unlikely to agree to that demand , as it would allow Hamas to strengthen its hold on the territory which it violently seized in June 2007 .
Unable to ensure the safety of its workers , the United Nations continued to withhold its aid deliveries today and the World Food Programme and Unicef said they were not moving any supplies into or around Gaza .
The Red Cross restricted its activity to Gaza City , where a surgical team assisted medics at the main hospital , Shifa .

Despite harsh criticism from international aid groups , Israel has said it is doing everything it can to help humanitarian work , citing the three - hour pauses in fighting it agreed to during the last three days .
In Geneva , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an independent war crimes investigation in Gaza after reports that Israeli forces shelled a house full of Palestinian civilians , killing 30 people .
The UN said Israeli troops evacuated Palestinian civilians to a house in the Zeitoun district on January 4 , then shelled the building 24 hours later .
The UN said 110 people were in the house , according to evidence from four witnesses .
An Israeli military spokeswoman cited alleged inaccuracies in the report on the house shelling and said it had not been confirmed .
" We do n't warn people to go to other buildings , this is not something we do , " she said .
" We do n't know this case , we do n't know that we attacked it . "
Tens of thousands of people condemned Israel 's offensive in protests in Alexandria , Egypt , the Jordanian capital of Amman and Baghdad .
The Libyan state news agency reported that President Mummar Gaddafi called on Arabs to allow volunteers to fight the Israelis in Gaza .
The one - sentence call was posted on Libya 's JANA news agency .
Why has Alistair Darling been so quick to deny that he has any plans to print money ?
This puzzles me because , in principle , the mere announcement that the government is considering doing so might stimulate the economy .
One of the alleged dangers of deflation is that if people expect prices to fall , they stop spending in anticipation of lower prices later .
One way to boost demand , then , is to increase inflation expectations - by merely threatening to consider printing money .
This will encourage people to spend in anticipation of rising prices .
Why then , did Darling go out of his way to rule out quantitative easing ?
Lots of possible answers seem inadequate : “ Higher inflation expectations will raise gilt yields and hence borrowing costs . ”
But this is only a problem because the gilt funding remit ( pdf ) is so restrictive , committing the government to issuing conventionals .
A more flexible remit would allow it to issue more linkers , whose costs are unaffected by inflation .
“ To consider quantitative easing could worsen the downturn , by signalling to people that the economic outlook is even worse than thought . ”
But Darling has already done this , admitting that the recovery might not come as soon as thought .
“ The threat of deflation is exaggerated . ”
This , though , is inconsistent with the government ’s hyperactive efforts to avoid it , by fiscal stimulus and other ad hoc policies .
“ Darling does not want to openly admit to hurting savers . ”
But this wo n’t do .
To any Keynesian , savers are a threat to an economy in recession .
They should therefore be hurt .
This makes me suspect there is another reason for Darling ’s swift denial that he ’s considering quantitative easing .
To say “ we ’re thinking about it ” might make sense as economic policy .
But it ’s inconsistent with the image politicians must project in a - yes - managerialist system .
Within managerialism , to admit to thinking about possible policies is to confess to uncertainty .
But “ strong leadership ” requires decisiveness , and the elimination of uncertainty .
To a managerialist , policies are impossible until they become inevitable ; there can be no doubt .
Yet again , good economics and managerialist ideology are in conflict .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's office told labor unions Friday that it will order two - day - a - month unpaid furloughs for some state employees .
Schwarzenegger Discusses State Budget ( MP3 )
The unpaid furloughs , which will begin in February , are an attempt to save cash during the budget crisis .
Executive director of the Professional Engineers in California Government Bruce Blanning told the Sacramento Bee that he learned of the executive order Friday morning during a call from Department of Personnel Administration officials .
Blanning told the newspaper that the furloughs would apply to all general fund and special fund employees .
" We 're in a time when we 're trying to get federal money to build infrastructure and create jobs , " Blanning told the Bee .
" Telling people to stay home two days a month does not seem to be a productive way to do that . "
sacbee.com : " Schwarzenegger to order furloughs , layoffs "
Back to the Drawing Board
Schwarzenegger said that he would call lawmakers back to the Capitol for a third special session in two months to try to close the state 's growing budget deficit .
" As we free fall into a fiscal Armageddon , the Legislature still can't cross the special interests and do what 's right for the state of California , " Schwarzenegger said at a press conference in Fresno .
" The only thing they did really well was to increase taxes . "
Schwarzenegger wants lawmakers to return to the Capitol and work until they reach a compromise on the state 's mammoth $ 42 billion shortfall .
Lawmakers adjourned for the holidays Thursday after Democrats pushed through a package of spending cuts and tax increases using a creative maneuver to bypass Republican support .
The governor 's office had sought what he said was assistance for homeowners facing foreclosure , broad authority to relax environmental regulation on public work projects and more toll roads .
Additionally , he requested deeper cuts than Democrats were willing to offer , such as reductions in welfare and senior assistance programs , greater flexibility to reduce school spending , and the elimination of two of 14 state employee holidays .
Democratic leaders and environmental advocates questioned why the governor would toss aside the only deficit - cutting legislation to reach his desk since he declared a fiscal emergency on Nov. 5 .
Paul Mason , deputy director of the Sierra Club in California , suggested that by demanding environmental exemptions , the governor was betraying his public image as a crusader against global warming .
" It 's inconsistent with the media image he likes to present with how green he is , " Mason said .
" They really should be focused on how we deal with the fiscal crisis in California .
Weakening environmental protections is not the answer . "
Democrats sent the Republican governor a package of bills Thursday that would make more than $ 7 billion in cuts to education , health care and prisons , and increased taxes and fees by $ 9.3 billion .
It proposed about $ 1.5 billion in other budget changes .
Their plan would raise the levies Californians pay on gasoline by about 13 cents , replacing an 18 - cent - a - gallon excise tax and a fluctuating sales tax with a 39 - cent - per - gallon fee .
It also would raise the state sales tax by 3 / 4 of a percent , boost personal income taxes by 2.5 percent , tax oil produced in California and collect taxes from independent contractors upfront .
DAVOS , Switzerland ( Fortune ) --
Ever since Vladimir Putin rose to power in 2000 , his political opponents and entire countries have learned to their cost that he has a tough , demeaning streak .
Wednesday it was Michael Dell 's turn .
At the official opening ceremony of the World Economic Forum in Davos , Putin , now Russian Prime Minister , delivered a 40 - minute speech touching on everything from why the dollar should not be the sole reserve currency to how the world needed to enter into a smart energy partnership with Russia .
Then it was time for questions .
First up : Dell .
He praised Russia 's technical and scientific prowess , and then asked : " How can we help " you to expand IT in Russia .
Big mistake .
Russia has been allergic to offers of aid from the West ever since hundreds of overpaid consultants arrived in Moscow after the collapse of Communism , in 1991 , and proceeded to hand out an array of advice that proved , at times , useless or dangerous .
Putin's withering reply to Dell : " We do n't need help .
We are not invalids .
We do n't have limited mental capacity . "
The slapdown took many of the people in the audience by surprise .
Putin then went on to outline some of the steps the Russian government has taken to wire up the country , including remote villages in Siberia .
And , in a final dig at Dell , he talked about how Russian scientists were rightly respected not for their hardware , but for their software .
The implication :
Any old fool can build a PC outfit .

( CNN ) --
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Tuesday aimed at combating piracy along the Horn of Africa by allowing military forces to chase pirates onto land in cases of " hot pursuit . "
French troops on the lookout for pirates in the Gulf of Aden on November 25 .
Military forces from various countries , including the United States , are patrolling pirate - infested waters off Somalia , where attacks have surged this year .
Nearly 100 vessels have come under fire , according to the International Maritime Bureau , and almost 40 vessels have been hijacked .
The Security Council resolution , which passed unanimously , expands upon existing counter - piracy tools , including a stipulation that would allow for national and regional military forces to chase pirates onto land -- specifically into Somalia where many of the pirates are based .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was at the U.N. on Tuesday for a discussion of the piracy problem and the Security Council vote .
" I would n't be here seeking authorization to go ashore if the U.S. government -- perhaps most importantly the president of the United States -- were not behind this resolution , " Rice said after the vote .
Asked if she thought U.S. troops would soon be on land chasing pirates , Rice would not speculate .
" The United States is part of an international effort , " she said .
" We do have naval forces that have been involved in this effort .
What this ( resolution ) does is to authorize that the boundary of the maritime cannot become a safe haven boundary for pirates .
What we do -- or do not do -- in issues like hot pursuit , we 'll have to see ... case by case . "
Earlier , in remarks to the Security Council , Rice described the growing problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia as " a symptom . "
" It 's a symptom of the instability , the poverty , the lawlessness that have plagued Somalia for the past two decades , " she said , adding that the Bush administration " does believe that the time has come for the United Nations to consider and authorize a peacekeeping operation . "
Asked about reports that two more ships were attacked by pirates this week , Rice said those show " the increasing problem that this is .
The pirates are a threat to commerce , they are a threat to security and perhaps most importantly they are a threat to the principle of freedom of navigation on the seas . "
With increased patrols in the area by several countries , reports of exchanges of fire have become more frequent .
In one of the most recent piracy attacks , Indian officials said Saturday they had captured 23 people suspected of trying to take over a merchant vessel in the Gulf of Aden .
In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects , Indian navy officials also seized two small boats and " a substantial cache of arms and equipment , " the Indian military said in a statement .

What was the true cause of the worst financial crisis the world has seen since the Great Depression ?
Was it excessive greed on Wall Street ?
Was it mark - to - market accounting ?
The answer is none of the above , says Jeremy Siegel , a professor of finance at Wharton .
While these factors contributed to the crisis , they do not represent its most significant cause .
Here is the real reason , according to Siegel : Financial firms bought , held and insured large quantities of risky , mortgage - related assets on borrowed money .
The irony is that these financial giants had little need to hold these securities ; they were already making enormous profits simply from creating , bundling and selling them .
“ During dot - com IPOs of the early 1990s , the firms that underwrote the stock offerings did not hold on to those stocks , ” Siegel says .
“ They flipped them .
But in the case of mortgage - backed securities , the financial firms decided these were good assets to hold .
That was their fatal flaw . ”
Speaking in Philadelphia on January 20 , Siegel , author of Stocks for the Long Run and The Future for Investors , provided a detailed analysis of the factors that fueled the worldwide financial meltdown .
His talk was the inaugural lecture of a 15 - session course on the financial crisis that Wharton is offering MBA and undergraduate students .
Siegel ’s mission was to detail the factors that sparked the crisis that has caused the U.S. stock market to lose more than a third of its value in a year , while sending unemployment to its highest level since the 1980s .
Siegel ’s lecture was on the same day that millions of Americans expressed optimism over the inauguration of President Barack Obama , even as the Dow plunged another 300 points .
Explaining his theory further , Siegel pointed out that many troubled banks and insurers continued to prosper in almost every other aspect of their businesses right up to the 2008 meltdown .
The exception was the billions of dollars in mortgage - backed securities that they bought and held on to or insured even after U.S. home prices went into a free - fall more than two years ago .
American International Group ( AIG ) , the insurer that received an $ 85 billion federal rescue package last September , is a prime example .
Some 95 % of its business units were profitable when the company collapsed .
“ AIG has 125,000 employees , ” Siegel noted .
“ Basically , 80 of them tanked the firm .
It was the New Products Division , which had an office in London and a small branch office in Connecticut .
They came up with the idea of insuring mortgage - backed assets , and nobody at the top decided it was n’t a good idea .
So they bet the house — and the company went under . ”
Lapse over Lehman
According to Siegel , federal officials — particularly outgoing Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ­– mishandled initial efforts to intervene in the crisis .
For example , Paulson was concerned about the political backlash that might be unleashed by bailing out Lehman Brothers .
He allowed the firm to collapse last September but underestimated the impact of Lehman ’s demise on financial markets .
Despite a $ 700 billion bailout , banks are still unwilling to extend credit , Siegel said .
Siegel told his student audience that in many important measures , the economy is not nearly as battered as it was during the early 1980s , when unemployment , inflation , and interest rates were all considerably higher than they are today .
Stocks — as evaluated by their price - to - earnings ratios — are undervalued to the point where they could draw enough investors to spark a recovery before the end of 2009 .
“ I ’m actually an optimist , ” said Siegel .
“ I think by the second half of this year , things might turn around faster than people are now predicting . ”
While angry investors and taxpayers are anxiously looking to assign blame for the current state of the economy , it ’s important to know not only which factors led to the meltdown , but which ones did not .
He said that government programs encouraging home - buying by low - and middle - income families and short - selling of financial stocks — which was halted for a time last fall — have little to do with the crisis on Wall Street .
Instead , Siegel pointed to two interlocking issues :
One is a massive failure , not only by traders , but by CEOs of financial firms , their risk management specialists and the major rating agencies to recognize that an unprecedented housing - price bubble began building after 2000 .
Their faulty reasoning was that the inability of homeowners to pay their mortgages — and the consequent foreclosures — would not pose a threat to their mortgage - backed securities .
They believed that as long as home prices kept rising , the underlying value of the real estate would provide a hedge against the risk of such defaults .
They failed to realize that this reasoning was based on the assumption that home prices would go in just one direction — up .
In fact , these assets became enormously risky once the housing bubble burst and home prices began their inevitable decline .
Siegel also argued that ultimately , the buck stops with corporate CEOs who did n’t ask hard enough questions about the risks posed by mortgage - backed assets .
He said he and others have wondered why firms like Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley — which survived the much more severe Great Depression of the 1930s — collapsed during 2008 .
One reason , he suggested , might be that , back then , these firms were organized as partnerships .
In such an organizational structure , the partners would have to risk their own capital .
When the partnerships were reorganized as widely held public companies , however , they no longer had such constraints .
“ Back when it was a partnership , you had your life invested in that company , ” said Siegel , noting that banks also began making higher - return but higher - risk investments in recent years as public ownership increased .
Greenspan ’s Role
One other key player that Siegel criticized for not heading off the collapse of the mortgage - backed securities is former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , who oversaw the government ’s central bank until 2006 .
Greenspan was so influential while he oversaw the Fed that he could have easily blown the whistle on the over - accumulation of mortgage - backed assets by the U.S. - based financial giants .
He , however , failed to discover that firms were taking such large , risky individual stakes without protecting themselves against a housing market collapse .
“ [ Greenspan was ] the greatest central banker in history — he had access to every piece of data , ” Siegel said .
“ He could have looked at the balance sheets of Morgan Stanley or Citigroup and said , ‘ Oh my God — they did n’t neutralize their risk . ' ”
Another reason why federal officials and economists failed to detect the perilous economic risks of the 2000s , Siegel said , is the so - called “ Great Moderation . ”
This term refers to the fact that since the 1980s , the volatility of the business cycle has declined , thanks to more aggressive fiscal policy and the rise of a service - based economy , among other factors .
Siegel noted that a similar flattening of the economic cycles had occurred during the 1920s after the 1913 establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank , a factor that caused stock investors to ignore risks , which eventually led to the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression .
“ People asked , ‘ Are we ever going to have a big recession again ? ' ”
Siegel said of today ’s policy makers .
“ Everybody thought we were in a new stage and risk premiums did n’t need to be so high . ”
But those risks hit home last year .
While it would have been difficult for federal regulators to save Lehman Brothers — which had invested billions of dollars in assets related to subprime mortgages — even if they had acted six months sooner , the fall of the 158 - year - old financial house had a disastrous impact on the wider financial market .
Lehman Brothers was connected to 950,000 or so transactions .
As a result , bankers became gun-shy about making any type of loan , even to companies with a flawless credit history .
Trouble with TARP
For that reason , Siegel said , the initial phase of the Bush administration ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) was seriously flawed .
Paulson ’s Treasury Department decided to buy equity stakes in troubled banks , assuming they would make more loans with more capital on hand .
The amount of capital , though , has little to do with the reluctance of banks to make loans , even as the rate on federal funds is slashed to near zero .
John Maynard Keynes , the British economist , called this situation a “ liquidity trap , ” Siegel noted .
“ The big failure of TARP was that it misunderstood why banks were n’t lending .
Officials thought it was because they did n’t have enough capital .
In reality , they were worried about the solvency of all the borrowing that was out there . ”
Siegel suggested that the government rescue plan could be improved with guarantees that recipients demonstrate they are using the federal dollars to extend credit .
According to Siegel , monetary policy has failed to stimulate the U.S. economy .
The U.S. faces a situation similar to what happened in Japan during the 1990s when interest rates of zero could not revive the country ’s moribund financial markets .
The only viable solution now open to American policy makers is Keynesian fiscal policy , a stimulus program that lowers taxes or increases government spending or both .
Indeed , this is exactly the type of program — costing at least $ 825 billion — that the Obama administration and Senate Democrats are considering .
Siegel said that policymakers should not worry about the impact on deficits ; it is large , he added , but not dangerously so .
Towards the end of his 90 - minute talk , Siegel offered some tongue - in - cheek advice to would - be entrepreneurs .
“ Start a new bank , ” he said .
“ You wo n’t have the problems of existing banks , and the federal loans interest rate is near zero .
Demand for loans is high , and you will face no competition from the private market .
You could become very profitable . ”
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Ukraine and Russia said the supply of natural gas to Europe was completely shut off Wednesday , but each side blamed the other for the cut - off , which comes as Europe faces a wave of freezing temperatures .
A spokesman for the Ukrainian state - run gas company , Naftogaz Ukrainy , told CNN that Russian gas giant Gazprom had turned off all gas flowing into Ukraine for transit into Europe .
That forced Naftogaz to halt gas supplies meant for Europe , spokesman Ilya Savin said , because Naftogaz does not have the technical capability to pump the gas remaining in the pipelines on toward Europe .
Gazprom responded by saying it was not to blame .
" It 's absolutely vice - versa , " Gazprom 's deputy chief executive Alexander Medvedev told CNN by phone from Berlin , Germany .
" We did n't shut off gas supply to Europe .
We have lost physical possibility to deliver gas to Europe through Ukraine because ( the ) Ukrainians shut down all export pipelines . "
Both companies plan to meet Thursday for talks on the ongoing gas dispute .
Countries affected
At least 10 countries have reported their natural gas supply from Russia has been cut or reduced as a result of the row .
Amid sub - zero temperatures in some places , European gas customers are n't freezing in their homes just yet .
Some countries reporting a drop in supply , like Romania and Italy , import most of their natural gas from countries besides Russia .
Those countries have said that until the Russian gas supply resumes , they will increase their gas imports from other suppliers or rely on other energy sources .
The countries facing the most serious problems are those that import a majority of their gas from Russia .
Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria depend on Russia for a respective 85 % , 100 % and 90 % of their gas supplies , according to figures compiled in 2006 by the European Council on Foreign Relations .
" We have enough reserves for the time being , but under the conditions of limited consumption , " Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev told CNN .
Bulgaria is relying on alternative sources for its heating plants in the meantime , Stanishev said .
Arctic air
Temperatures across Europe have been lower than average in recent days , with cold Arctic air pushing over the continent from the north .
Forecasters predict the temperatures are likely to stay chilly through the weekend .
Analysts say the dispute is creating an " urgent " situation for European countries , but it 's not easy to figure out who is responsible for shutting the Russian gas supply .
" I think it would be a fairly difficult forensic accounting process to really pinpoint the blame for this , " said Julian Lee , a senior energy analyst at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London .
Pipelines vulnerable
Gazprom 's Medvedev said Russia and Europe have become " hostage " to the actions of Ukraine .
He also warned that pipelines could freeze if left shut down for much longer , potentially requiring repairs , thus taking even longer to restore .
" In such cold weather , it 's a high risk that water freezing problems could deter the activity of the gas pipeline system , which ( might ) not be restored in a quick time , " Medvedev told CNN .
The apparent interruption in supply is the latest twist in a dispute between Gazprom and Naftogaz that began at the end of 2007 .
Gazprom accused Naftogaz of unpaid bills and shut off Ukraine 's supply ; Naftogaz denies owing the money and complained that a new natural gas contract was too expensive .
The problem is complicated by Ukraine 's role as a transit country for Russian gas to Europe .
Gazprom had promised its European customers that gas would continue to flow via Europe .
Gazprom has also accused Ukraine of siphoning off gas from the export pipelines to Europe .
Finding alternatives
Greece 's natural gas company , DEPA , issued an urgent statement Wednesday saying it faced no immediate shortages but was considering other supply routes amid the crisis .
DEPA chief executive Assimakis Papageorgiou said Greece was increasing its imports from Algeria , France and Britain .
He said Turkey rejected a request for help Tuesday , saying it was " unable to meet Greece 's request because it was facing a severe crisis of its own . "
Italy reported a " substantial interruption " in its Russian gas supply Wednesday .
" What needs to be addressed with this issue is the wider implication that it 's having for the rest of Europe , and the fact that both sides are damaging their international credibility , " Lee said .
" Standing around , pointing the finger at each other , is not in anybody 's interest .
It 's not ultimately either in the interest of Ukraine or Russia and it's certainly not in the interest of the European gas consumers . "
CNN 's Mike Sefanov in Moscow , Anthee Carassava in Athens and Jenny Harrison in Atlanta contributed to this report .

Michigan bank operates by Islamic law

Big financial institutions have been battered by mortgages gone bad .
But a tiny Michigan bank is getting attention in the industry by turning a profit on loans without even charging interest .
Its specialty : financial products that comply with Islamic law .
That means no collecting interest , no short selling and no contracts that are considered exceedingly risky .
It also rules out some of the activity that got Western finance in trouble - subprime mortgages , credit default swaps and the like .
" When you look at the economic crisis we 're in , if you were to follow Islamic or Sharia financing , you could n't have this crisis , " said John Sickler , corporate director for the bank , University Islamic Financial Corp. in Ann Arbor .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Islamic finance operations are n't prohibited from making a profit .
Far from it .
Instead , banks that comply with Islamic law , or Sharia , earn money from fees that are part of the cost of the loan , some paid up front and some over time .
University Islamic Financial has two types of financing : one called a marked - up installment sale , the other a lease - to - purchase sale .
Fees in both cases are comparable to interest payments in traditional loans , bank officials say .
For example : A seller who bought a house for $ 100,000 could sell it for $ 120,000 or even $ 300,000 , provided that the buyer agrees it 's a fair deal .
The home could be sold on an installment plan negotiated by buyer and seller .
The bank is a subsidiary of Michigan - based University Bank , and its leaders say they have talked recently with executives from two national banks hoping to learn more about the business .
Islamic law says money cannot grow by itself , the way it does with compounding interest .
Trade is acceptable as long as the equal amounts of money are traded or two different things are swapped with a fairly negotiated price .
So a dime for an apple would be considered halal , or religiously acceptable , while one apple for two apples would be harem , or unacceptable .
Even at University , not everyone is on board .
Some customers have closed their accounts when they learned that it was engaging in Islamic finance .
Some employees who objected to the move quit .
The bank also stopped having a Christmas party and no longer serves alcohol at after - hours events .
The Michigan bank focuses on contracts that clearly spell out the risk and reward between lender and borrower .
University Islamic Financial says it 's the nation 's first to offer Sharia - compliant , federally insured deposits .
Islamic banking is more common overseas , but some U.S. banks and credit card companies are exploring the idea of branching out into Sharia products to reach out to the growing Muslim population .
So Islamic banking is only expected to increase in coming years .
Already , Citigroup offers Sharia products and services to clients overseas , and Visa says it has worked with banks around the world to offer Islam - compliant products .
The conventional banking system could learn a lot from the idea , said Jawad Ali , a finance lawyer based in Dubai and London who specializes in structuring Sharia - compliant deals .
" We have n't made as much money as the conventional banks because we can't , for example , sell what we do n't own , " he said .
" We have to own it before we sell it .
We may have missed out on gains in good times ... but we have n't suffered any losses . "
Of course , there 's no guarantee that banks will find immunity in Islamic finance from a severe global downturn .
" I am not doing banking on Mars , " said Afaq Khan , the head of Saadiq , the Islamic banking arm of Standard Chartered Bank , in London .
" If real economic activity slows down significantly , the Islamic banking industry will also be affected . "
A Sharia - compliant mortgage is like rent - to - own :
There is no note , or mortgage , but typically part of each month 's payment is held toward the ultimate purchase .
The property is titled to an individual trust , or limited liability corporation .
Deutsche Bank estimates total assets in the Islamic finance market at $ 1 trillion - a tiny fraction of global financial assets , but the bank said in a recent report that the sector has been growing at a clip of 15 to 20 percent per year .
Most big international banks already have Islamic banking arms , and a November report by Moody 's Investors Service shows that Islamic banks have been fairly resilient to the global economic downturn .
The U.S. banking industry has not embraced Sharia banking .
Wachovia , Wells Fargo and JPMorgan
Chase said they have not adopted Sharia practices and declined to comment about what they may do in the future .
" As far as the future , we are always looking for opportunities to better serve our customers , but our specific strategy is proprietary , " Wells Fargo spokeswoman Lisa Westermann said .
WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Michael Mukasey raised concerns that government agents and national security lawyers may be at risk for criminal prosecution after his likely successor , Eric Holder , declared that waterboarding of terror detainees is torture .
The 67 - year - old former federal judge in New York , who took office 14 months ago , said in an interview that the incoming administration of President - elect Barack Obama faces a " conundrum " as it tries to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .

As far as environmental ethics issues go , this one takes the cake .
But research done in New Zealand by the Pastoral Greenhouse Gas Research Consortium suggest that eating meat from animals that produce significant amounts of gases that harm the environment simply will not do .
Instead , eat a kangaroo !
Before , I make this sound too much like a Dr. Seuss book , this was reported by The New Scientist , and there is good science behind the claim .
Ruminants ( animals that emit through their chewing of cud ) carbon dioxide contribute a significant amount of greenhouse gas .
As the article puts it , quite eloquently :
Worldwide , livestock burps are responsible for 18 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions – more than produced from all forms of transport combined .
Now , is the solution to eat roos ?
I ’m not so sure .
There are chickens after all , sea creatures , and other things that do not burp .
But the point is well made , the more of these livestock we humans consume the more we contribute to the greenhouse gas problem and climate change .
That ’s something to think about before you order your next lamb chop .

Roderick T. Long ’s “ Toward a Libertarian Theory of Class , ” which first appeared in ( Summer 1998 ) , is finally available for download as a two - part PDF — here and here
I think this is a seminal work in the ongoing struggle to build a hardcore radical Libertarian Left movement from three disparate strands — libertarian capitalism , libertarian socialism , and what Long calls “ libertarian populism . ”
If you consider yourself a Libertarian Leftist , you should really read this .
If you consider yourself a serious Libertarian Left activist , you should really study this thoroughly and add it to your intellectual arsenal .
Labels : anarchism , class war , corporate capitalism , leftlibertarian , movement history
Current Mood : helpful
You guys , we need to talk .
Believe me : what I am about to say , I say out of love , a kind of all - encompassing , gentle , Kwan - Yin - type of love , out of wanting the best for you , wanting you to succeed in life .
I 'm not trying to be condescending , but when I see a problem played out over and over again , I feel compelled to try to help , I feel like I have a piece of information you do n't , and I 'm not a selfish girl ; I want to share .
I 'm talking to all my single male friends , especially if you are single , male , in your late twenties or early thirties , and a programmer , as that seems to be the direst demographic , the one most in need of a buxom , non-threatening , Kwan - Yin - type of love - intervention .
Please do not assume this is about you personally : every example I am about to give I have personally witnessed over a wide variety of circumstances and years .
It 's been bugging me forever , and I can no longer just stand by and do nothing .
So , you know , um ... huddle up .
It 's about your apartments .
Most of the single men I know want to have sex .
I feel I have worded that as generally as I possibly can .
Most of you would like to get laid sometime in this decade , by a real live human , no less .
And you 're hamstringing yourselves , and you do n't even know it .
If you go on a date with a girl -- and I 'm gonna be heteronormative here , in part because it 's not as much of an issue with young single gay men or young single women , and in part because I am rarely asked back to young single gay men's apartments at night .
If you go on a date with a girl - - a date you both know is a date , with a clear romantic goal -- with a girl and she agrees to come back to your apartment , it 's pretty safe to say that she has at least thought about some sort of sexual contact with you and decided that it's not a completely revolting concept .
That does not mean you deserve or have a right to sex if she does agree to go back to your place .
But it means you 're doing well enough -- congratulations !-- that she has decided that not only are you not a horrendous , asexual gap - toothed troll , but someone with whom she feels safe enough to be alone .
That ai n't nothing , kids .
But this is a delicate moment for you , Single Male Programmer Type !
It could turn into something wonderful , if you handle it right .
And yet , so many of you stab yourselves in the head long before she can kindly turn you down and send you into a downward self - esteem spiral for days .
Imagine : a girl decides that this boy seems nice and funny and he definitely wo n't accost her , and maybe , just maybe ... so she goes back to your apartment with you .
And what does she see ?
A lonely futon , a computer , clothes on the floor , empty walls , a console system with cords tangled all over the floor , a forlorn Settlers of Cataan box sitting on an otherwise empty bookshelf .
A bathroom covered in little bits of hair left behind by an electric shaver , an unscrubbed bathtub , and no towel to dry her hands on .
Oh god , it 's so sad .
It 's like he's not even alive , just treading water until ... what ?
His mother visits ?
A girl shows up who looks a lot like his mother ?
Is Settlers of Cataan the sole thing he cares enough about to own and display ?
SETTLERS of fucking CATAAN ?
I 'm not saying she 's going to run screaming .
Probably .
But if this sounds like your apartment ?
Your " game " is missing some vital pieces .
You 've undone all the work you did being charming and funny over dinner in one fell swoop , the minute you open your apartment door .
If you were very charming and funny the attack might not be fatal , ( think of it like a points system : you have just so many charisma points , and your +6 Apartment of Anti-Sex Funk is n't doing you any favors ) but that 's a big chance to take .
It 's like Mousetrap -- no matter how cool the game is when you play it , the fact is that once you 've lost the plastic diver - man , you 're not going to be playing any time soon , and maybe never again .
These apartments break my heart .
It 's not about materialism -- I do n't care where the apartment is or what it says about your financial situation .
I care about what it says about your soul .
There is no reason , by your late twenties , you should be living like a dorm - room prisoner .
You are a grown fucking man .
It 's not some kind of noble rejection of the material world to live in a cell with no indication of your personality or implication that you 've lived there for longer than five minutes , or plan to be living there for another five .
Your apartment speaks volumes about you , whether you like it or not , so stop hollering : I 'M JUST WAITING AROUND FOR A WOMAN TO TEACH ME HOW TO LIVE !
THAT'S HOT , RIGHT ?
RIGHT ?
No , it 's not .
We do not want to be your mothers , to pick up after you and teach you how to make things pretty , or even just other - than - empty .
It is not our jobs , and one of the sexiest things in the world is a guy who does n't need to be taught .
The two guys who were most successful with women in my college got together , rented an apartment , talked to all of their friends about what looks nice , and decorated their place impeccably .
It was like a freaking conveyor belt of girls going in and out of that house .
Girls looked around and thought : fucking in here is going to be awesome .
Because when a girl thinks about a hot one night stand , she does n't fantasize about clearing your socks off the bed before slapping your ass and calling you pony - boy .
She does n't get off to thinking about staring at your depressing , empty gray walls while you sweat on top of her to the dulcet tones of Rush .
It 's not hot , it 's just sad , and sad is the worst .
After college , girls are n't looking to randomly fuck in some dingy - ass sad - sack flat and slink home because it smells too bad to stay over and the bathroom makes her die a little inside .
You have got to do better than this , guys .
I see it way too much , and the sameness of these pitiful dwellings kind of scares me .
How do you do it ?
Is there a conference every year about how to furnish your apartment to repel all women ?
Living well does not have to be gendered .
Every guy I 've ever lived with has been substantially happier living with me than alone , because I make a pretty house that is comfortable and sexy , and they do n't know how to do that on their own .
Which sucks , because it means all the work falls in my lap .
But it does n't have to be so .
So let 's keep in mind a few simple rules , SMPTs .
1 . Your apartment is a metaphor for your sexual style .
I 'm reasonably sure that if a guy can't even manage to put up a comic strip or two on his walls and spends his days staring at the cottage - cheese ceiling surrounded by old tube socks , I 'm not going to have some kind of amazing sexual dynamo on my hands once he gets his clothes off .
It 's going to be vaguely sad and kind of uncomfortable , and afterward I 'm going to wish I had n't and need to wash my hands .
Outward envirnoment relfects inner states , and guys : empty is not hot .
I 'm not saying you have to be an interior design mastermind , but get some goddamn pictures up on your walls ( framed - - it 's easy and cheap and makes things look intentional ) , pick up the crap off the floor ( especially if you know there 's a good chance you 'll have a girl at your house that night -- who brings a girl home knowing there 's old coffee filters and random pants lying about ?
What kind of romantic strategy is this ? ) , get a nice bedspread in a neutral color if you can't get the whole color wheel thing down , organize your good quality books ( commensurate with the kind of girl you want to attract -- like geek girls ?
Make sure your SF novels are spine - out .
It 's always nice to have a few female writers in there .
Like athletes ?
Make sure your workout books are nicely organized .
I 'm not saying buy books to impress , but if you have them , showcase them - - for most thinking girls , books are like peacock feathers .
They 're a mating display . )
Buy all your towels in the same ( dark ) color -- that way you do n't have to worry about them matching anything , and they do n't stain as easily .
Being able to make a mean cup of coffee or tea for a girl is a vital survival trait .
The more you can show a girl that you would be a net positive in her world , the hotter you become .
Showing her that you were a complete person before she came along is nothing but glorious , and makes you look smooth and happy -- whether you 're looking for a girlfriend or a one night stand .
It is fully 300 % hotter to fuck a guy in a beautiful , urbane apartment and never see him again than to do it in a dreary post - collegiate hovel .
2 . The bathroom is a metaphor for your penis .
I avoid going into guys ' bathrooms .
It 's usually a horrorshow .
I want to believe they 're nice guys , and that is easier if I do n't see their bathrooms .
The fact is , if you can't practice basic personal hygiene in your living space , I will have no expectation that you can practice it with your person .
If there are shaving bits and clumps of hair all over the bathroom , a toilet that looks like it 's never been cleaned , and a moldy shower curtain , it is highly unlikely that once your jeans have leapt excitedly onto your filthy floor , you will reveal a beautiful , clean , muck - free cock with well - trimmed hair and a friendly countenance .
Not impossible , but unlikely .
Clean .
the fucking .
bathroom .
If you know you 're having a girl over , take an hour to give a crap how your place is going to look to her .
Run a sponge over the surfaces , dump some CLR into the toilet , wait 30 seconds and flush , and throw a .59 air freshener in there .
Total investment : 15 minutes .
Value of a girl not thinking you are a barely - domesticated breed of exotic pig : priceless .
Level 2 activities include a mat on the floor , an opaque shower curtain free of mold around the edges , even a picture or two on the walls of the bathroom ( I fully admit the pictures thing matters to me personally more than most : I find completely empty walls a shuddersome situation ) .
Level 3 , only for the advanced , includes all of the above plus a few items that indicate you do n't think taking care of your body is " girly . "
Lotion , a nice shampoo ( especially if these things are visible in your normal bathroom set up ) , even a dedicated face - wash , not just , you know , a sticky lump of old Dial .
My ex-husband let his feet get so dry they cracked to the muscle rather than use " girly " lotions .
This , my friends , is very diverse idiocy .
I do n't want this to be gendered .
I really do n't .
But I have never once seen a single woman 's apartment look like this .
Guys , we 're living in the 21st century .
You do not have to live in your high school bedroom until you 're 35 and some girl heaves a sigh and does it for you .
I cannot express how much that sucks , and how much it makes you look like an unnecessary second job for an already busy , productive girl .
You gotta ante-up .
Want girls ?
Making yourself attractive , inside and out , is a good start .
It does n't take the biggest penis , the best job , the best body .
It just takes a little thought about what the world you construct for yourself says about you .
And clean the fucking bathroom .
3 . It does n't have to be perfect , it just has to look like you 're not planning to kill yourself .
People planning suicide often give away all their belongings .
Every time I walk into an SMPT 's apartment , I worry for them .
This is not the path to a rich , sensual life full of willing women , fabulous dinners , and evenings you 'll tell friends about years down the line .
It 's a path to a life that looks a lot like that apartment .
Look around : are you satisfied with that ?
It 's a vicious circle : your apartment looks like Lonely Larry 's Despair Emporium , so every time a girl looks at it , a slow , cold wind blows through her mind -- she might sleep with you anyway , but the key word there is anyway .
And so you 're lonely , and so your apartment looks like an advertisement for a suicide hotline .
Inner and outer are related , they can not help but be .
I know a lot of men think they should n't have to do anything to get sex , especially geeks .
Women should accept you as you are , right ?
You were rejected in school , so you arrange your life to avoid rejection as an adult .
And women , no matter how personally revolting they find you , should see through , magically , to the gooey core of sweet , genteel adorableness inside .
Of course , you do n't go on dates naked or bite your toenails at the table , so you are willing to change a little to impress .
The question is how much .
Well , give her a hand , why do n't you ?
Let your apartment say something about that core of sweetness .
That 's what pictures on the walls and pillows on the couch are : outward expressions of internal passions .
I have antique calligraphy and paintings of sphinxes on my walls -- they indicate things about me , what I love , what I have experienced , they start conversations , they are a museum of me .
Do you want your museum to consist of a bucket and a " Please Excuse Our Mess " sign ?
Things do not have to match perfectly , your curtains do n't need to pick up the violet in your napkins or any of that nonsense .
Shop at Wal - Mart , I do n't give a shit .
Hardly anything really has to match these days , but if you want a quick studio - apartment color primer : buy a bedspread , does n't matter what color , but something at least vaguely not neon .
Pick other decor based around that color .
Make sure all your particle board is the same finish .
It 'll look put together and nice , no matter what that color is .
You may have to fake caring about this shit for awhile , but after awhile you 'll notice : you feel better when you operate from a place of power , and your apartment can be a place like that .
Batman does not live in an apartment with a broken futon and a dusty TV , guys .
None of the greats do .
This is your lair .
Treat it with respect .
And keep it clean .
That 's all .
You will get laid more , because you will appear to be a real , interesting human that dwells in the sensual world , lives his life beautifully , and thinks about things other than code and D & D .
How hot is that ?
Very .
I feel so strongly about this .
I 've seen too many friends go to the Dark Side , and then they complain to me that they have n't had a girlfriend in two years .
And I think : Jesus , I would n't fuck you in this Patented Programmer Pen either .
And I want better for the boys in my life .
I want women to swoon for you , guys , and for you to feel strong and lovely and powerful and competent .
As such , this has been a public service announcement , towards helping you towards a better life .
The More You Know .
Video ( 01:54 ) : 90 % of the recount is done and Star Tribune reporter , Curt Brown , gives an update .
An uproar Wednesday over 133 mystery ballots that may or may not have disappeared in Minneapolis became the newest controversy to roil the U.S. Senate recount .
At issue was a discrepancy between Election Day and recount totals in one of the city 's precincts .
DFLer Al Franken 's campaign lodged a protest over 133 votes that it said could not be accounted for during the recount , at a possible cost to him of as many as 46 net votes in his race against Republican Sen. Norm Coleman .
Franken officials sent a letter to the secretary of state 's office and Minneapolis elections director Cindy Reichert demanding that the votes from the northeast Minneapolis precinct not be officially reported until a search is conducted for the ballots .
Late Wednesday , Reichert said she had decided to keep the results in the precinct open until all of the discrepancies could be resolved , by reviewing all of the precinct 's election materials at City Hall today .
" Several mistakes were made in the precinct and we need to verify all of the numbers we looked at [ Wednesday ] , " she said .
The twist came a day after Franken made a net gain of 37 votes in Ramsey County , when the recount there found that 171 votes from a Maplewood precinct had n't been tallied on Election Day .
Wednesday evening , a Star Tribune tally showed Coleman with a 316 - vote lead , with 98 percent of the vote recounted .
At the start of the recount , Coleman had a 215 - vote lead .
Earlier in the day , the Franken campaign announced that it was withdrawing 633 of the roughly 3,000 ballot challenges it had made during the recount .
The campaign also said that its internal calculations showed it was now ahead of Coleman by 22 votes .
Franken campaign attorney Marc Elias said withdrawing the challenges will not affect the ultimate outcome of the count .
" The only practical impact of what we are doing today is to save the state Canvassing Board the trouble of looking through these challenged ballots and saving the taxpayers of Minnesota the cost of copying and scanning these challenged ballots , " Elias said .
Officials for the Coleman campaign , which has made more than 3,200 ballot challenges , said they would hold off on withdrawing any of them until recounting is completed , likely by the end of the week .
A spokesman for Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie called Franken 's move a " positive start " but urged both campaigns to be more aggressive in withdrawing frivolous challenges before the Canvassing Board meets on Dec. 16 .
The board is to make the final call on challenged ballots .
Minneapolis mix -up
The controversy in the first precinct of Minneapolis ' Third Ward began when the recount showed 133 votes fewer than the Election Day count .
Reichert said the disparity sent officials searching for the possibility of a missing ballot envelope .
When none could be found , she said , she originally thought that write - in ballots at the precinct , which were diverted on the side of the ballot box on Election Day , may have been fed through the ballot counter twice on Nov. 4 .
The city initially decided to pare the precinct vote totals by 133 , with Franken 's number dropping by 80 and Coleman 's by 34 , a 46 - vote swing in the senator 's favor .
" That was the theory [ about the discrepancy ] we developed in the afternoon , but the theory we came up with does n't jibe with the numbers we have , " Reichert said .
" We do n't know what happened .
...
It looks like that was n't valid speculation . "
Among other things , elections workers will examine voter rosters , signatures and voter registration rolls , she said .
The Franken campaign said numbers from the precinct had shown that 2,029 people voted on Election Day and that the recount recorded only 1,896 ballots .
Franken attorney David Lillihaug asked that the recount in Minneapolis be kept open until the ballots are found .
Citing 133 " disenfranchised voters in Minneapolis who are waiting for action , " he wrote , " the U.S. Senate race may hang in the balance . "
In a statement , Coleman campaign spokesman Mark Drake said , " The Minneapolis officials appeared to be quite thorough in their search today , and it is disappointing that the Franken campaign , once again , is attacking local election officials and blaming them for simply doing their jobs . "
The challenges Fritz Knaak , Coleman 's lead recount attorney , while acknowledging the Franken campaign 's challenge withdrawals , suggested the announcement may have been an attempt to " create news " and keep momentum to help with political fundraising .
Knaak said the announcement also may have been timed to deflect the effect of the reelection Tuesday of U.S. Sen .
Saxby Chambliss , a Georgia Republican , a result that prevents Democrats from gaining a 60 - vote , filibuster - proof Senate majority .
Chambliss ' victory , said Knaak , had dealt " a serious blow " to Franken 's attempt to show his race is critical to Democrats nationally .
Franken 's people said Chamblis ' reelection will have no effect on strategy for the Minnesota race .
" It 's nonsensical .
There was a Senate election in Georgia .
The results were what they were , " said Franken attorney Elias .
" We 're trying to figure out who won the election in Minnesota .
From my standpoint , there 's no obvious connection between the two . "
About the gap Regarding the gap between the candidates , Franken officials said Wednesday afternoon that , by their internal calculations , their campaign had gained 237 votes in the recount with 94.3 percent of the votes counted and claimed to be ahead by 22 votes .
Elias said the calculation is based on the working theory that none of either campaign 's challenges will be upheld and that Coleman has challenged more ballots than Franken .
Knaak dismissed the assertion Franken had pulled ahead .
In joking with reporters -- and taking a jab at the Franken campaign 's counting methodology -- Knaak said he thought Coleman was ahead by 2,200 votes .
" I have no evidence of this , " he said , smiling , " ... but I like the sound of it , so there it is . "
He said , however , that the Coleman campaign was confident .
" We believe we 're well ahead in this recount , " he said .
Meanwhile , election officials Wednesday also began grappling with a request by Ritchie 's office to examine and categorize rejected absentee ballots .

What began as a humble video production class quickly blossomed into a successful small business for a group of Stillwater High School students .
¶
Through their company , Cutaway Productions , they 've made scores of promotional and training videos for many local businesses and community groups .
¶
Not only are they learning new skills , they 're getting paid .
" Our client base is growing and we 're beginning to fund ourselves , " said their producer and teacher , Debbie Drew .
The Cutaway team has earned as little as $ 200 for a job and as much as $ 3,000 .
The money is used to pay for video equipment , Drew said .
Among the businesses that have hired them to make videos are : USA Karate , Camp St. Croix and Acapulco Restaurant .
One of their videos -- called Technology Today -- is regularly used by Apple Computer as a demonstration video at educational workshops .
As word has spread about the talented and cheap student - run production company , their customer base is expanding .
Recently , some coaches hired the kids to make " rules videos " explaining the rules of their particular sport .
One unusual request came from a teacher , who wanted to hire the Cutaway team to create a video showcasing his house .
He plans to use it as a real estate tool to help him sell it , Drew said .
The kids also have been asked to film a few weddings .
" We shoot anything and everything , " said Kirsten Peterson , 18 , a senior at Stillwater Area High School , a team member .
One of her favorite projects was making a public service announcement about hunger for a food drive sponsored by WCCO - TV .
It aired a couple of years ago on the station .
" It was cool to see all of our stuff appear on actual TV that people watch , " Peterson said .
She has learned the technical ins and outs of shooting and editing videos , and also much about business etiquette , something Peterson says Drew is a stickler about .
" She wants us to treat it like a business , " Peterson said .
" She treats it like a job . "
To develop a theory of deception requires parsing the subject into its most basic components so it can be studied one element at a time .
That 's what Daniel Langleben has been doing at the University of Pennsylvania .
Langleben , a psychiatrist , started an experiment on deception in 2000 with a simple design : a spontaneous yes - no lie using a deck of playing cards .
His research involved taking brain images with a functional - M.R.I. scanner , a contraption not much bigger than a kayak but weighing 10 tons .
Unlike a traditional M.R.I. , which provides a picture of the brain 's anatomy , the functional M.R.I. shows the brain in action .
It takes a reading , every two to three seconds , of how much oxygen is being used throughout the brain , and that information is superimposed on an anatomical brain map to determine which regions are most active while performing a particular task .
There 's very little about being in a functional - M.R.I. scanner that is natural : you are flat on your back , absolutely still , with your head immobilized by pillows and straps .
The scanner makes a dreadful din , which headphones barely muffle .
If you 're part of an experiment , you might be given a device with buttons to press for " yes " or " no " and another device with a single panic button .
Not only is the physical setup unnatural , but in most deception studies the experimental design is unnatural , too .
It is difficult to replicate the real - world conditions of lying -- the relationship between liar and target , the urgency not to get caught -- in a functional - M.R.I. lab , or in any other kind of lab .
But as an early step in mapping the lying brain , such artificiality has to suffice .
In Langleben 's first deception study at Penn , the subjects were told at the beginning of the experiment to lie about a particular playing card , the five of clubs .
To be sure the card carried no emotional weight , Langleben screened out compulsive gamblers from the group .
One at a time , the subjects lay motionless in the scanner , watched pictures of playing cards flash onto a screen and pressed a button indicating whether they had that card or not .
When an image of a card they did n't have came up , the subjects , as they had been instructed , told the truth and pressed " no . "
But when an image of the five of clubs came up , they also pressed " no , " even though the card was in their pockets .
That is , whenever they saw the five of clubs , they lied .
According to Langleben , certain regions of the brain were more active on average when his 18 subjects were lying than when they were telling the truth .
Lying was associated with increased activity in several areas of the cortex , including the anterior cingulate cortex and the superior frontal gyrus .
" We did n't have a map of deception in the brain -- we still do n't -- so we did n't know exactly what this meant , " Langleben said .
" But that was n't the question we were asking at the time in any case .
What we were asking with that first experiment was , ' Can the difference in brain activity between lie and truth be detected by functional M.R.I .?'
Our study showed that it can . "
He said that the prefrontal cortex -- the reasoning part of the brain -- was generally more aroused during lying than during truth - telling , an indication that it took more cognitive work to lie .
Brain mappers are just beginning to figure out how different parts of the brain function .
The function of one region found to be activated in the five - of - clubs experiment , the anterior cingulate cortex , is still the subject of some debate ; it is thought , among other things , to help a person choose between two conflicting responses , which makes it a logical place to look for a signature of deception .
This region is also activated during the Stroop task , in which a series of words are written in different colors and the subject must respond with what color the ink is , disregarding the word itself .
This is harder than it sounds , at least when the written word is a color word that is different from the ink it is written in .
If the word " red " is written in blue , for instance , a lot of people say " red " instead of " blue . "
Telling a spontaneous lie is similar to the Stroop task in that it involves holding two things in mind simultaneously -- in this case , the truth and the lie -- and making a choice about which one to apply .
Langleben performed his card experiment again in 2003 , with a few refinements , including giving his subjects the choice of two cards to lie about and whether to lie at all .
This second study found activation in some of the same regions as the first , establishing a pattern of deception - related activity in particular parts of the cortex : one in the front , two on the sides and two in the back .
The finding in the back , the parietal cortex , intrigued Langleben .
" At first I thought the parietal finding was a fluke , " he said .
The parietal cortex is usually activated during arousal of various kinds .
It is also involved in the manifestation of thoughts as physical changes , like goose bumps that erupt when you 're afraid , or sweating that increases when you lie .
The connection to sweating interested Langleben , since sweating is also one of the polygraph 's hallmark measurements .
He looked at existing studies of this response , and in all of them he found activity that could be traced back to the parietal lobe .
Until Langleben 's observation of its connection to brain changes , the sweat response ( which the polygraph measures with sensors on the palm or fingertips ) had been thought to be a purely " downstream " change , a secondary effect caused not by the lie itself but by the consequences of lying : guilt , anxiety , fear or the excess positive emotion one researcher calls " duping delight . "
But Langleben 's findings indicated that it might have a corollary " upstream , " in the central nervous system .
This meant that at least one polygraph measurement might have a signature right at the source of the lie , the brain itself .

Notes About a Few Ingredients
1 . Whenever milk is called for , the recipe was tested with reconstituted non -fat dry milk .
If you use whole milk instead your results will be a little richer , but will pretty much turn out the same way .
2 . Margarine is used almost exclusively in these recipes .
Only one or two recipes call for real butter , and then it 's expressly stated in the recipe .
Margarine is 50 ¢ a pound and butter is $ 3 a pound , so let your pocket book be your guide .
If you prefer , butter may be used instead of margarine in all of the recipes with good results .
In case you 're interested in the health benefits and risks of margarine , allow me to share some of my research with you .
It turns out that margarine is not only the least expensive spread , it 's also the healthiest .
" But what about trans fats ? " you may be asking .
The chart below should give you some reassurance .
Based on 1 level Tablespoon Trans Fat Saturated Fat Total of " Bad " Fats ( The ones that raise LDL cholesterol levels ) Margarine 0.5 to 2.5 grams 2.3 grams 2.8 to 4.8 grams Butter 0.3 grams 7.2 grams 7.5 grams
As you can see margarine is much lower in the types of fats that can raise LDL cholesterol levels .
Because of this the American Heart Association ( also here ) , the National Heart , Lung & Blood Institute , the American Dietetic Association , and the Mayo Clinic all recommend margarine over butter as part of a healthy diet .
Since it costs only a fraction of the price of butter , it is definitely the best choice for a challenged budget .
The FDA puts it this way : " Although some margarines contain more trans fat than butter , the total of trans and saturated fat ( the LDL - C raising fats ) is always less than the total for butter .
The total for butter is much higher because of all the saturated fat that it contains . " -- Quoted from the FDA .
Click here for the whole page .
If you are still fearful about using margarine , then I recommend you choose one of the trans - fat - free buttery spreads now on the market .
Promise and Smart Balance both make good products .
Both of these spreads are less expensive than butter and they are much better for your cholesterol too .
The debate that some people have between margarine and butter is one of a luxurious nature .
If you are wealthy enough have a choice between butter and margarine , then choose the one that is best for you .
Those of us with small budgets will continue to use margarine because it is economical , versatile , tasty , and as the links above prove , still the healthiest choice .
3 . Medium sized eggs are the least expensive in my area , so the recipes were all tested with medium sized eggs .
You may use large eggs instead with good results .
If you are using extra large or jumbo size eggs then use your best judgment .
Replace one medium egg with one jumbo , because it is hard to cut an egg in half .
Roughly speaking , every 2 jumbo eggs equal 3 medium eggs in volume .
For those trying to watch their cholesterol , replace each egg with 2 egg whites .
They are usually less expensive than commercially available egg substitutes .
4 . You will see Bacon Grease called for in a few of the recipes .
Hillbillies traditionally cook with it for economy 's sake .
Essentially , bacon grease is the fat left in the pan after frying bacon .
It is best stored in a clean tin can in the refrigerator .
Every time bacon is cooked , pour any leftover grease into the can .
It is used mostly for frying and seasoning .
Bacon
Fat lends a very special flavor to food that is hard to duplicate .
If you are avoiding bacon grease for health reasons , then you may replace it with an equal amount of oil or margarine .
The flavor will be slightly different , but otherwise , your results will be about the same .
5 . Nutritional information is created with MasterCook 7 .
It is as accurate as I can make it , but there are no guarantees .
Remember I am not a dietitian and I am fully mortal so there will be a few errors .
Use it at your own risk .
6 . I am not a professional , and this is not a professional website .
I have all of the distractions of any active mom and I will make mistakes .
I 've done my best to eliminate all typo's and broken links , and to make the recipes as reliable as possible .
For best results however , do not expect perfection .
Fair Use
He said Mr Clements ' case was by no means isolated , although it was one of the more extreme examples .
" There are thousands of other cases that are floating around the system where foreigners with often minor convictions have been coming in and out of the country thinking they are fine .
But they 're not and ICE is catching up with them .
It 's getting out of control . "

My Second Dog was ........ FREE .....
And I loved him beyond measure .
He traveled with me as I moved all over the U.S. I payed pet deposites on rental houses ...
I spent thousands of dollars on vets when he got a rare disease .
He went on dates with me .. he went to work with me ... he slept by my bed , ate the best of foods ... was the envy of many who stopped to say how cool he was ...
And I thought my heart would never ever mend when he died at age 14 .
My Third Dog was ....
NOT FREE .... I paid $ 20 for him and I loved him ... played with him ... fed him the best foods .. paid his vet bills ... he slept by the bed , kept me company on long walks ... and I cried till I could cry no more when he passed away at 13 .
My Fourth Dog was ..... FREE ... I picked him up lost and abandoned on the side of the freeway ...
I did n't need or particularly want a second dog at the time ....
But I loved him ... played with him .. fed him the best foods ..
Paid for veterinary care and later when he had severe arthitis , spent many hundreds on suppliments to keep him comfortable till I had to have him laid to rest at 14 .
And I cried ... and thanked God for the stranger that came to stay with us for so many years .
My Fifth Dog ... My CURRENT Dog ... was .....
NOT FREE ..... I paid $ 80 for him ...
And I love him .. and I play with him .. and I pay the vet when he needs it .. and he sleeps by my bed , and he gets the best of foods , and he follows me everywhere and I hope that we will get to love him for many more years until it 's time for him to pass on and we will cry and our hearts will break and we will miss him .
Somewhere in this short story of my life with dogs ...
And I could easily write another much longer story about my life with many , many horses ... some free .. some rescued .. some paid a small price for and some paid a high price for ...
Somewhere in the stories ... I hope is a lesson .
Every animal in my care ... for whatever reason it came and at whatever cost ....
Got the same kind of care .
They got the BEST care I could give ... and sometimes ... because of sacrifice .. they got better care than prudently affordable or necessary .
Did it matter the price I paid for them ?....
IT DID NOT !.....
Nor will it ever .
And I seriously doubt it matters in many other homes across the world ...
People either value their pets or they do n't ...
I have seen just as many neglected pets and livestock come from " rich " homes as I have poor .
It is not the money that takes care of an animal ...
It is the heart of the people or person they live with .
The poorest person will find a way if they love enough .
If you ask me ... charging a high fee to " ensure a good home " , is just a lazy persons way out of not feeling guilty for the fact that they do not want to take enough time to find out if the home they are selling their pet to is adequate .
It 's a lot easier to take someones money and tell yourself that you did the right thing , than it is to take the time to get to know someone , or to go look at their home .. or to draw up an agreement on their care with a return clause , to get references and to follow up with checks over the next days , weeks and months .
To take this argument to the ridiculous ....
One of my children was born when we had really great insurance and guess what ?...
She was ... FREE !.....
My Second child , we did n't have good insurance ....
She cost ...
ALOT !!!...
I wonder if we are less of a good home for the first one ?....
Maybe I should love the second one a bit more since she cost so much ?... This is long ... but hopefully the message is clear ....
Money can buy a lot of things ... and certainly you should ask prospective homes if they can afford the upkeep of a pet ... even go as far as to list out some of the expenses ....
But take the time to make sure you are finding a good home ... do n't use making money as a cop -out to get out of your responsibilities .
You may find ... that the most loving thing you can do for your pet is to place him in a home for ....
Free ... I will give you a flip side to the situation ... when you need to rehome your pet ... when you are " desperately seeking good home asap " ...
Letting someone " rescue " you from your situation ... can give them a sense of pride for doing something good for both animal and human ... that is a value that is much greater than money and may in the end go the farthest towards giving your pet a great life .
Thank you for reading this ..
I hope it is taken in good spirit and gives another point of view on the subject of " rehoming fees " ...
God Bless
Chris Dillow wants help :
Taleb vs economists , by Chris Dillow : Everyone seems to be hailing Nassim Nicholas Taleb as the man who saw the crisis coming .
I have a problem with this .
It ’s not that what Taleb says about risk is wrong .
Quite the opposite .
It just strikes me as trivially true .
We ’ve known for ages that returns are non-Gaussian , that extreme events are more common than a normal distribution predicts , and that risk ca n’t be quantified simply , if at all .
The Black Swan , then , was just an entertaining if a little egocentric way of telling us what we already knew .
So , when I read in it ( p43 ) that bankers “ are not conservative at all ; just phenomenally skilled at self - deception by burying the possibility of a large , devastating , loss under the rug ” I thought : “ But surely they ’ve learnt from statistics and experience by now .
Their risk management ca n’t be as terrible as Taleb claims .
I know bosses are stupid , but they can‘t be this gibberingly , imbecilically , carpet - chewingly , moronically cretinous , can they ? ” I suspect most economists thought my way .
It looks like we were wrong and Taleb right .
But this is n’t because Taleb had any great insights into the nature of risk .
It ‘s because he thought banks ‘ risk managers were idiots , whilst economists did n’t think so - not even me .
In doing this , however , we were just following economists ’ standard procedure - of assuming that agents were if not rational then at least not wholly stupid .
For me , all this is very troubling .
It suggests that what we economists have to learn from Taleb has nothing to do with the nature of risk - we‘ve all known that - but about others ’ rationality .
We should ditch the assumption - which in a sense is mere courtesy - not only that others are rational but even the weaker assumption that they are nearly so .
Perhaps we should indeed regard them merely as “ empty suits . ”
But this is a vastly greater departure from standard practice than anything Taleb has suggested about the nature of risk .
All of which leaves me genuinely puzzled .
Were banks risk managers really that bad ?
Are bosses an order of magnitude stupider than even I had thought ?
Or is something else happening ?
Help me .
After a UK government - led commission said that the current 50 - year term for musical copyrights was fine , and the government last year publicly agreed that there was no need to extend the term , culture minister Andy Burnham yesterday made the logical follow - up announcement that yes , the government would now push for a 20 - year extension on copyright .
Turns out , it 's the moral thing to do .
Actually , by framing the issue as a " moral case , " Burnham gets to sidestep the entire issue of logic .
Critics have already begun to charge that he is ignoring actual evidence and the well - regarded conclusions of the Gowers Report , not to mention previous government policy .
But when the issue becomes a moral one and the livelihood of aging performers is at stake , it 's suddenly easier to avoid cost / benefit analysis .
Doing the right thing is n't always logical or economical .
The rather bitter irony here is that the move has been pushed largely by fabulously wealthy musicians and the music industry .
In July 2007 , when the government said that 50 years of copyright on songs was plenty of time to cash in , the head of the international music trade group IFPI warned , " Some of the greatest works of British music will soon be taken away from the artists who performed them and the companies that invested in them .
Extending copyright term would promote vital investment in young talent and new music , all of which will help to secure the UK 's future as an exciting music market . "
The extension has been most vocally backed by musicians like Cliff Richard , whose 1958 hit " Move It ! " is just about to enter the public domain .
( We 're not sure it helps Cliff 's cause when the first picture you see on his official website is Sir Cliff standing before the gates of what is , presumably , his mansion ) .
Several arguments have been made for extension : creators have a moral right to compensation for their work throughout their lives , at least , and 50 years is no longer enough .
In addition , as seen above in the IFPI comments , it will encourage innovation going forward .
This second argument does n't quite jibe with the first ; if the issue is future innovation , why would the UK need retroactive extension when the creators have already done their creating under the regime in place at the time ?
Clearly , 50 years was n't so short that The Beatles said , " Screw it !
We 're going into law . "
In any event , a push for term extension is being made across Europe .
While the UK says it will work to extend musical copyright from 50 to 70 years , the European Union is considering a plan ( backed by Commissioner Charlie McCreevy ) to extend musical copyrights to 95 years .
The life - of - the - artist morality line ( probably the best argument for extension ) basically goes out the window at this point unless the law is meant to cover five - year - old singers who survive until 100 .
And though I 'd quite like to meet such a person and am sure that somewhere such a figure exists , it hardly seems worth crafting law around such extreme outliers .
European academics agree .
In what is becoming a bit of a trend , the EU is also ignoring the evidence - based studies that it commissioned on the subject , preferring instead to push its rulemaking with talk of old musicians — who apparently have never heard of savings accounts , retirement planning , or existing social assistance — sleeping in the streets .
The push for extension has enraged numerous prominent academics who study intellectual property , including the man who wrote a report on the issue of extension for the EU .
Dr. P. Bernt Hugenholtz of the University of Amsterdam has said that the entire process " seems to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the Parliament , as well as the citizens of the European Union .
In doing so the Commission reinforces the suspicion , already widely held by the public at large , that its policies are less the product of a rational decision - making process than of lobbying by stakeholders . "
In both the UK and EU cases , the worry is that most of the money will actually go to labels and to the richest artists like Sir Cliff .
The Open Rights Group , which is bitterly opposed to extension , claims that 80 percent of all artists would receive under € 30 / year from the EU plan , while music labels would share 90 percent of the cash coming in .
An interesting question from the forums :
Do you think you would be an atheist today if the Internet did not exist ?
I do n’t think I would be … when the doubt about my religion started to creep into my mind , I found my answers late at night online .
It was those crude websites and email newsletters which helped me answer my questions and formed new ones .
I sure as hell did n’t know any other atheists .
Anyone else owe their atheism to the Interwebs ?
Pushing for deficit spending as part of his own economic stimulus package in 1971 , President Richard Nixon famously told ABC News , “ I am now a Keynesian in economics . ”
Increasingly , it seems that everyone on Capitol Hill is adopting Nixon ’s economic views … but a thousand times worse .
Where Nixon wanted to deficit spend by mere billions , President Barack Obama wants to deficit spend in the trillions .
Keynesian theory , suddenly back in style , holds that government can stimulate economic growth by temporarily increasing government spending .
Problem is , there was nothing temporary about increases in government spending under Nixon — and there is nothing temporary about the trillion dollars in new spending being debated in Congress .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) yesterday told Politico : “ Yes , we wrote the bill .
Yes , we won the election . ”
The House bill perfectly demonstrates how the left is using the economic stimulus bill as cover to accomplish its long - held desire to permanently increase the size of the federal government , with little or no benefit to the American taxpayer .
Today ’s top six disastrous highlights are :
1. Medicaid Bailout : The House bill includes an $ 87 billion bailout for state Medicaid spending .
Supposedly , this federal spigot will expire in two years .
But there is simply no reason to believe states will be prepared to meet their Medicaid obligations any more in 2011 than they are today .
Medicaid is funded by a formula that matches state spending levels with federal dollars .
If we keep bailing states out , they will have every incentive to continue irresponsible spending .
For example , Gov. Rod Blagojevich ( D - IL ) significantly expanded health care spending in Illinois while Gov. Mitch Daniels ( R - IN ) prudently made “ hard choices ” to maintain adequate reserves .
When the bailout comes , Indiana taxpayers are going to have to pay for the Illinois governor ’s mistakes .
2. Medicaid Expansion : The House bill expands Medicaid eligibility to cover unemployed workers whose income does not exceed 200 % of the Federal Poverty Line .
This provision is supposed to expire in two years , but does anyone really expect political will at the state or federal levels to kick new populations off the Medicaid rolls once states put them on ?
No .
States will push for indefinte expansion of the program and neither the White House nor this congressional leadership is ideologically predisposed to say no .
Mark our words , this is a permanent expansion .
3. Family Planning Loophole : Section 5004 of the Medicaid expansion includes language that smuggles the left ’s social agenda into law under the guise of stimulus .
This section undercuts parental authority , increases control over taxpayer dollars by family planning clinics , and expands exactly who is eligible to receive the benefits .
Contrary to current law , the income of parents or even a spouse would not be counted in determining eligibility .
So a child in a family at any income level could be eligible for free family planning services .
And thanks to a “ presumptive eligibility period ” in the legislation , no parent ever needs to be notified that his or her child applied for Medicaid .
Finally , applicants would not have to prove citizenship before “ presumptive eligibility ” is determined .
4. Education Bailout : The House bill creates a $ 79 billion State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to help states pay for public services , 61 % of which must be spent on education .
Not only does this money encourage states not to make tough budgeting decisions , it also comes with new federal restrictions designed to please leftist constituencies .
For example , the bill forbids bailout funds to increase school choice by specifying that “ no recipient of funds under this title shall use funds to provide financial assistance to students to attend private elementary or secondary schools . ”
5. Education Shopping Spree : Besides that $ 79 billion , the House bill includes more spending for a slew of other programs , bringing the total price tag for education “ stimulus ” to $ 142 billion .
Winners of this round include $ 1 billion for Technology Education , $ 1.5 billion for Pell Grants , $ 6 billion for higher education institutions , $ 2.1 billion for Head Start , $ 2.5 billion for the National Science Foundation , and $ 2 billion in Child Care Development Block Grants .
Are any of these increases intended to be temporary ?
Can you imagine Democrats in Congress standing up to cut Head Start and Pell Grant funding in two years ?
Of course not .
This $ 142 billion increase in education spending would nearly double total outlays in 2007 for the Department of Education .
6. New Jobs ?
President Obama has said the stimulus could create as many as 3 million jobs , but Speaker Pelosi said yesterday that 4 million jobs will be created or saved .
Yet , when pressed by Rep. Dave Camp ( R - MI ) earlier this week , Tax Committee staffer Thomas Barthold could only shrug and admit to having no estimates that any jobs or economic growth would be created .
The video is priceless .
Some legislators are beginning to catch on to the left ’s game .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) says he opposes the Medicaid bailout “ because some governors would use the money to mask poor decisions in other portions of their budgets . ”
Rep. Heath Shuler ( D - TN ) says he is “ concerned about returning fiscal responsibility to Washington ” and adds that the stimulus bill “ ca n’t be the pet projects of the House and Senate . ”
It ’s time to wake up .
This stimulus bill is nothing but the permanent implementation of the pet projects of the House and Senate .
And that is exactly why Speaker Pelosi does n’t want you to know what ’s in it , and certainly does n’t want it to be debated .
“ We ’re on our timetable . ” she said unapologetically yesterday .
There is nothing temporary about any of the spending increases in this bill .
They are all designed to make the American people more dependent on the federal government .
And there is nothing stimulating about that .
Let ’s hope Congress gets on the timetable of the American people before it ’s too late .
Quick Hits :
It is a fair question , one worth debating , but it is unmoored from certain political and theological realities .
One irresistible reality grows from Hamas ’s complicated , competitive relationship with Hezbollah .
For Hamas , Hezbollah is not only a source of weapons and instruction , it is a mentor and role model .
Hamas ’s desire to best Hezbollah ’s achievements is natural , of course , but , more to the point , it is radicalizing .
One of the reasons , among many , that Hamas felt compelled to break its cease - fire with Israel last month was to prove its potency to Muslims impressed with Hezbollah .
Another reality worth considering concerns theology .
Hamas and Hezbollah emerged from very different streams of Islam : Hamas is the Palestinian branch of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood ; Hezbollah is an outright Iranian proxy that takes its inspiration from the radical Shiite politics of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
But the groups share a common belief that Jews are a cosmological evil , enemies of Islam since Muhammad sought refuge in Medina .
Periodically , advocates of negotiation suggest that the hostility toward Jews expressed by Hamas is somehow mutable .
But in years of listening , I have n’t heard much to suggest that its anti-Semitism is insincere .
Like Hezbollah , Hamas believes that God is opposed to a Jewish state in Palestine .
Both groups are rhetorically pitiless , though , again , Hamas sometimes appears to follow the lead of Hezbollah .
I once asked Abdel Aziz Rantisi where he learned what he called “ the truth ” of the Holocaust  that it did n’t happen  and he referred me to books published by Hezbollah .
Hamas and Hezbollah also share the view that the solution for Palestine lies in Europe .
A spokesman for Hezbollah , Hassan Izzedine , once told me that the Jews who survive the Muslim “ liberation ” of Palestine “ can go back to Germany , or wherever they came from . ”
He went on to argue that the Jews are a “ curse to anyone who lives near them . ”
Nizar Rayyan expressed much the same sentiment the night we spoke in 2006 .
We had been discussing a passage of the Koran that suggests that God turns a group of impious Jews into apes and pigs .
The Hezbollah leader , Hassan Nasrallah , among others , has deployed this passage in his speeches .
Once , at a rally in Beirut , he said : “ We shout in the face of the killers of prophets and the descendants of the apes and pigs :
We hope we will not see you next year .
The shout remains , ‘ Death to Israel ! ’ ”
Mr. Rayyan said that , technically , Mr. Nasrallah was mistaken .
“ Allah changed disobedient Jews into apes and pigs , it is true , but he specifically said these apes and pigs did not have the ability to reproduce , ” Mr. Rayyan said .
“ So it is not literally true that Jews today are descended from pigs and apes , but it is true that some of the ancestors of Jews were transformed into pigs and apes , and it is true that Allah continually makes the Jews pay for their crimes in many different ways .
They are a cursed people . ”
Barack Obama ended four wars during his first week as president .
With just a few words and strokes of his pen , the president ended the war on terror , the war on Islam , the war on science and the war on women .
In his first executive orders , Obama effectively dismantled the elaborate structures that supported the Bush administration ’s “ war on terror . ”
On Jan. 22 , he ordered the closure of the Guantanamo prison and a halt to the much - criticized military commission trials .
He closed secret CIA prisons , required that the Red Cross have access to detainees and mandated that interrogations of detainees -- whether by the military , the CIA or anyone else -- comply with the rules laid out in the Army Field Manual .
That means :
No more torture .
No waterboarding , beatings , sexual humiliations or deprivation of food or medical care .
And in case anyone ’s confused , the order makes it clear that those seeking guidance “ may not rely on any interpretation of the law governing interrogation ... issued by the Department of Justice between September 11 , 2001 , and January 20 , 2009 . ”
( That means you , John Yoo ) .
The war on Islam is also over .
Officially , of course , it never existed .
But that ’s how the “ war on terror ” looked to many around the world , a misunderstanding fueled by the war in Iraq and the irresponsible rhetoric of many Bush administration officials .
Advertisement
After 9/11 , the United States had widespread international support -- including within the Islamic world -- for military action in Afghanistan to destroy Al Qaeda and oust its Taliban hosts .
But when that morphed into an open- ended U.S. effort to go to war in more “ target - rich ” environments ( read : Iraq ) , regardless of the lack of connection to 9/11 , U.S. actions struck many Muslims as motivated by generic hostility to Islam .
The fact that U.S. officials from George W. Bush on down seemed fuzzy about the differences between Sunni and Shiite Muslims , and tended to ignore the very different ideologies that motivate different militant organizations , added to the sense that the U.S. considered Islam itself the problem .
But by giving his first televised interview to Al Arabiya , a channel watched throughout the Arab world , Obama made it clear that the U.S. is n’t at war with Islam itself .
“ The Muslim world is filled with extraordinary people who simply want to live their lives and see their children live better lives , ” he said .
“ There are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith ... that will use faith as a justification for violence .
We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith ’s name ....
Our administration [ will ] be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like Al Qaeda -- that ... espouse terror .... and people who may disagree with my administration ” in legitimate ways .
Obama also ended the undeclared Bush administration war on science .
In his inaugural speech , he promised to “ restore science to its rightful place . ”
Reversing years of Bush administration disregard of scientific evidence on global climate change , Obama ordered the Transportation Department to set new fuel - efficiency standards and ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to rethink its Bush - era refusal to allow states such as California to impose anti-pollution standards more stringent than federal ones .
The undeclared war on women ?
Also over .
On Jan. 23 , Obama reversed the “ Mexico City policy , ” which prohibited recipients of U.S. foreign - assistance funds from providing abortions or even providing information about abortions .
Family planning groups worldwide will no longer have to choose between providing honest information and receiving crucial funding .

Do n’t make the mistake of thinking that these assorted “ wars ” were only metaphors , incapable of producing real harm .
The “ war on terror ” was practically a gift to Osama bin Laden :
Our detention and interrogation policies probably fueled far more terrorism than they prevented .
Ditto for the Bush administration ’s undeclared war against Islam .
The Bush administration ’s replacement of science with ideology was equally devastating :
How many lives will be lost or blighted as we all pay the price for a decade of denial about the human causes of global warming ?
And some estimate that as many as 500,000 women worldwide have died since 2001 as a result of botched abortions , many of which might have been prevented if the Mexico City policy had n’t pushed abortions and abortion counseling underground in many countries .
Obama ’s job is just beginning .
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will be far harder to end .
Still , not bad for a week ’s work .

True believers and Golden Palace Casino take note : we have just received news that Our Lord has manifested himself in a four - gig Samsung Flash memory chip - complete with beard and ethereal " flower petal halo " effect .
Yay verily , as the Bible sayeth ( Luke 21:27 ) : " At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory . "
Bendeth thine ears also to the words of Matthew 24:27 : " For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of man . "
Well , four gigs is plenty of power by anyone 's reckoning , and as for " the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west " , that 's just too spooky to be coincidence .
Time to repent , and no mistake .
For the record , and before we all nip to the pub for one last pint before the final judgement , the Flash Messiah was revealed by Chipworks using transmission electron microscopy .
The company 's Dick James explained to El Reg : " We often get dark fringe lines in the silicon , and in this case it looks like there was some holy influence . " ®
Bootnote
Several hardened atheists here at Vulture Central have suggested this is in fact Gandalf - a heretical suggestion given that Gandalf is a fictional character without the power to manifest himself in silicon .
We have , accordingly , emailed their details to the Spanish Inquisition .
Today , while giving a presser at a turkey hatchery , Sarah Palin allowed herself to be interviewed with the backdrop of turkeys being beheaded – and bleeding out – as she spoke .
This was just after she had “ pardoned ” another foul feathered friend .
If you do not want to watch the sanitized version of this grisly backdrop , David Schuster notes that Palin approved the backdrop herself .
Sarah Palin .
The gift that keeps on giving .
: : : : : : : : : :
Slide 1 of 10 ,
Barbara Mensch is best known for her photographs of the old Fulton Fish Market , to which two books have been devoted .
She has also photographed the Brooklyn Bridge for nearly 30 years .
" Brooklyn Waterfront , " 2002
She ’s not the vice president–elect , but at least “ Sarah Palin did n’t come away from the 2008 campaign empty - handed , ” said Alex Koppelman in Salon .
The “ right - wing magazine ” Human Events named her their “ Conservative of the Year . ”
And as an “ extra special honor , ” the announcement was written by Ann Coulter , who praised her “ beauteous Sarah ” for livening up the 2008 race and giving the McCain ticket a dose of real conservatism .
And for “ annoying all the right people ” — mainly liberals and the Obama - loving media , said Ann Coulter in Human Events .
It ’s enough this year that “ Palin was a kick in the pants , she energized conservatives , and she made liberal heads explode . ”
Now she ought to spend the next eight years growing “ older and wiser , ” and preparing for 2016 .
If Palin ’s got a shot in 2012 , “ she takes the shot , ” said Robert Stacy McCain in The Other McCain .
As she notes in an accompanying interview in Human Events , John McCain messed up by not letting her do more interviews .
A “ former journalist ” herself , Palin “ knows more about media than most of the Republican ‘ media experts ’ , ” and she wo n’t make the same mistake when it ’s her turn .
“ As I recall , Palin seemed to run into trouble when she started doing media interviews , ” said Steve Benen in The Washington Monthly online .
Not everyone will agree on what went wrong for her in 2008 , but blaming it on a lack of interviews is an “ unusual idea ” by any standard .
Palin ’s many detractors miss that she ’s got “ the mark of a star , ” said John O’Sullivan in The Wall Street Journal .
In the four moments that counted — her rollout speech in Ohio , the GOP convention , the VP debate , and Saturday Night Live — she rose to the occasion .
With her “ obvious intelligence , ” drive , and “ Reaganesque likability , ” Palin has the makings of a Margaret Thatcher .
If liberals — and “ conservative snobs ” — “ ca n’t see it , then so much the worse for them . ”
Two hundred metres from the Arab League 's headquarters in the Egyptian capital , Cairo , there are two newspaper kiosks on the pavement .
Cairo bookstalls and shops sell anti-Semitic texts
Passing customers can also buy books - trashy romance novels , computer guidebooks , and children 's story books .
But on closer inspection , both kiosks openly stock the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , a notorious anti-Semitic text that purports to be an account of Jewish plans to rule the world , but was actually written by Tsarist secret police in 1905 .
They also sell Hitler 's autobiography , Mein Kampf .
West accused
With protests continuing throughout the world over cartoons satirising the Prophet Mohammed , Arab League Secretary General Amr Mousa weighed into the crisis recently , accusing the West of operating " double standards " when it came to freedom of expression .
When Islam is insulted , certain powers ... raise the issue of freedom of expression .
Freedom of expression should be one yardstick , not two or three
Amr Mousa
" What about freedom of expression when anti-Semitism is involved ? " asked Mr Mousa .
" Then it is not freedom of expression .
Then it is a crime .
" But when Islam is insulted , certain powers ... raise the issue of freedom of expression .
Freedom of expression should be one yardstick , not two or three , " he said .
But it 's clear that some publishers in Egypt do not practise the kind of respect for religious groups that Mr Mousa is calling for from the West .
As numerous commentators have pointed out , in many Arab and Muslim countries anti-Semitism is widespread .
' Nothing to hide '
One of the newspaper sellers , Mohammed Ahmed , insists he has nothing to hide .
" People want to buy the books , " says the 32 - year - old .
" Why should n't I sell them ? "
He argues that selling the book is " freedom of expression and that liberty is the best way " .
At the Sharouk bookstore along the road , Harry Potter fever has taken hold .
The shop 's windows are crowded with displays of the latest instalment of the series .
But as with the kiosks , the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is on sale inside .
Politics not faith
Shop manager Mustapha Said insists that he is respectful of all religions including Judaism .
Ahmad Radwan , says books offensive to Jews should be banned
While he insists he believes in freedom of speech , he is furious about the cartoons caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad .
He argues that slandering any religion should be punishable .
But when it comes to selling the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , he says : " The book is about politics not about religion .
I do n't have a problem with books criticising politics . "
At the American University of Cairo , many students agree with Mr Said 's comments .
But Ahmed Radwan , 20 , argues that if Jews are outraged by the book " then it should n't be sold . "
He adds that Jews should take to the streets in protest about the Protocols .

In the lecture room where I will be giving a talk later today at the Max - Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics , the audiovisual equipment is controlled by a small touch - screen unit .
Right now , the part of the display that controls the ceiling - mounted projector looks like this :
ON OFF PAUSE
That is almost exactly what it looks like .
Now , you tell me : would that mean that the projector is on , or that it is off ?
Is the blue button the operative one , showing the name of the current state ?
Or is it the white button beside it that we should pay attention to ?
( I should make it clear that the PAUSE across below them is not a button : only the ON and the OFF buttons change color when touched . )
And then once we have decided whether we should see this as saying " ON " or as saying " OFF " , do you think it means that the pausing function is on , which would mean that the projector is off ?
Or that the pausing function is off , which would mean that the projector is on ?
Do n't worry about me .
I 'll figure it out by trial and error .
I simply offer this to you as proof number 37 ( I have made mention of many such examples in the past : road sign psycholinguistics and so on ) of my claim that human / machine interface design today is in a state of total freaking disaster .
Devices are being designed , constructed , and marketed with interfaces so badly botched one can only guess what to do with them .
It 's a neglected crisis for the economy .
Human safety is at risk .
Millions of people every day turn on the wrong burner because of badly designed cooktops .
Some merely leave the vegetables sitting in cold water for a quarter of an hour beside a glowing burner , but some melt spatulas into pools of plastic , and some set light to dishcloths and die in the resultant apartment fires .
Yet nothing is being done .
Things are getting worse .
( Am I going red in the face and developing weird staring eyes ?
I do n't want to seem like those stringy - haired old guys you see in the street wearing sandwich boards that say the world is about to end ; I feel I would lose credibility .
Trust me .
I 'm not a loony .
Really I 'm not . )
In my own apartment in Edinburgh , neither of my parents ( they were visiting at Christmas ) could figure out how to get water to come out of the faucet in the bathroom .
Why are people redesigning washbasin taps in such a way that people cannot figure out how to make the water flow ?
Did any of us ask for common water faucets to be redesigned ?
And we did n't even give them a clock radio .
We have a cheap clock radio with a front panel so badly designed that it would take me hours to explain it to you .
The 15 buttons , each with several tiny words written under them ( they all have multiple functions ) are arranged like this :
A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5
And do you know how you switch from station number 1 to station number 2 using this array ?
I will tell you .
It is B1 , A4 , A3 .
That 's highly intuitive , is n't it ?
And never mind setting the time and date ; I 'm just not going to go through it .
You could n't bear it .
We 're going to have to throw it away and shell out for a Bose .
( Bose are a counterexample to any claim about superb design being too difficult to achieve or too much to ask .
With Bose clock radios , learning is fast and effortless ; you can control them without trouble even in pitch darkness . )
I appeal to young , talented people everywhere : get trained in a few relevant subjects — psycholinguistics , visual perception , writing systems , reading , electronics , industrial design , microsociology of human interaction , ergonomics — and go to work in the design of human - machine interface systems .
Get out there and make stuff that can be understood by the sort of mammals we happen to be .
Please .
We users are desperate .
We read the manuals , we look at the display panels , and we simply cannot understand what the hell we are supposed to do to make the thing go .

Complete Dossier of Terrorist Evidence Submitted to Pakistan
Mumbai , the commercial capital of India , came under a heinous terrorist attack on November 26 , 2008 .
The terrorist attacks took place at many locations , especially at CST Railway Station ; the Leopold Cafe ; Taj Hotel ; Oberoi Trident Hotel ; and Nariman House .
165 Persons ( civilians and security personnel ) lost their lives and 304 were injured .
Among the civilians killed were 26 foreigners belonging to many nationalities ( Annexure - I ) .
So starts the 46 - page dossier of evidence submitted to Pakistan by the Government of India .
The dossier of evidence was also presented to representatives of 14 countries whose citizens were killed by terrorists in Mumbai ( Nov 26 - 29 2008 ) .
You can download and read the entire dossier .
The entire dossier found at many Indian news sites is uploaded as four PDF files .
The facts are presented in a chillingly , sterile manner .
Like a doctor giving bad news to a patient , the Govt of India has provided damning evidence that the Pakistan will be forced to follow up and act on .
As I write this , there is news that the Pakistan has already rejected the evidence !
How does India respond ?
In the dossier , the evidence gathered at the site , telephone intercepts as well as information gathered from the surviving terrorist is well stitched together to provide striking details of the entire operation : how the terrorists arrived in Mumbai from pakistan , broke up into five groups and how they dispersed into the city initiating 60 hours of terror .
Interrogation of the surviving terrorist provides information on how and where the terrorists were trained and who their handlers were .
Clearly , pakistan could act on this information .
But it would rather be known as a coddler , promoter and exporter of terrorism .
Based on waypoints in the GPS device recovered from the fishing trawler MV Kuber , the Police have recreated the entire map of the journey from Karachi , Pakistan to Badhwar Park , Colaba , Mumbai .
These maps are provided as part of the evidence .
Early during the attack on the Taj Hotel , the police intercepted cell phone calls to and from the hotel .
The terrorist ’s handlers in pakistan were using VOIP virtual numbers for passing instructions to the terrorists .
Based on the numbers shared by the terrorists , the security forces intercepted all calls from the three VOIP numbers ( virtually based in Austria ) .
The virtual numbers based in Austria were setup with a US company named Callphonex through intermediaries and funding which came from Pakistan .
All the details are provided , including the pakistani passport no of one of the operatives .
From these intercepted calls , it became clear to the police that the handlers of the terrorists in pakistan were passing on information available in the media back to the terrorists .
Some of the transcripts of these intercepted calls are also provided .
In this transcript recorded at the Oberoi Trident , the terrorists receive instructions to spare muslims and kill the remaining three hostages , including women .
And chillingly , they applaud the sound of killing gunfire .
It is interesting these same cold bloodied , cowards would do this in the name of Allah and Islam .
Why are the mullahs not issuing fatwas against using the name of Allah and Islam during these murders .
If someone as much as draws a cartoon spoofing Islam or mohammed , would invite a barrage of fatwas and protests !
Why not now ?
Is it perhaps , Islam does condone cowardly acts of violence ?
What happened to all those Muslim leaders who were protesting the removal of a muslim family from an airplane ?
Is n’t this more important to protest ?
The terrorists at the Taj are updated on the death of the ATS officer and receive instructions on not to let the minister escape .
The handlers give instructions to the terrorist in the Jewish center at Nariman House on when to kill the hostages .
Their political calculation is to drive a wedge between India and Israel !
I think the opposite has happened and India will stand by Israel and vice - versa .
GPS devices recovered from the MV Kuber and the terrorists
Pictures of guns bearing markings of being manufactured in pakistan are presented .
So also many of the personal effects of Pakistani origin belonging to the terrorists .
Obviously , all terrorist related stuff is Made in Pakistan .

Chad Michael Morrisette , a professional window - display designer , and his partner , Mito Aviles , put the Palin mannequin up for auction on EBay last week , complete with red coat , beehive wig , glasses -- and with a noose still hanging around its neck .
For those who already have the Obama hope poster , the McCain maverick button and the Joe the Plumber T - shirt , there is one more kitsch - – though more controversial -– item for the comprehensive 2008 presidential campaign collection : the Sarah Palin effigy that caused a bit of an uproar outside one West Hollywood home and prompted Keith Olbermann to name the homeowner “ Worst Person in the World . ”
The auction was supposed to end Tuesday -– Inauguration Day .
But on Sunday night , EBay took down the posting .
The site did not give any specific reason but referred the couple to its policy on offensive material , which says , " Sellers may not list items that promote or glorify hatred , violence , racial or religious intolerance , or items that promote organizations with such views . "
" And I think they were putting it in that category because of the history of lynching , ” Morrisette said .
“ We think it was the noose in the picture that they deemed as glorified hatred , ” Aviles wrote in an e-mail .
The item was relisted with a new picture of the mannequin sans noose , though the hanging accessory will still be included with the purchase .
Morrisette worried that having to relist the auction , which will now end on Wednesday , might have lost some of the initial interest in the item .
Before it was removed Sunday , the auction page had more than 900 views , and 40 people were keeping track of it , he said .
The mannequin , which is listed for a starting price of $ 1,000 , already has one bid .
It comes with a cardboard John McCain that is about 4 feet tall .
Morrisette and Aviles are trying to capitalize on the controversy that surrounded the Palin effigy for several days in October .
The auction page reads : “ PLEASE NOTE : YOU ARE BIDDING ON THE FAMOUS SARAH PALIN HALLOWEEN DISPLAY MANNEQUIN .

Israel 's objectives from the war on Gaza were set long before its launch : to remove the Hamas movement and government , achieve the reinstallation of the Fatah leader , Mahmoud Abbas , in Gaza , and end the armed resistance .
Two other objectives were not announced .
First , restore the Israeli public 's wavering confidence in its armed forces after its defeat by Hezbollah in 2006 .
Second , boost the coalition government in the coming elections .
Accordingly , we declare that Israel lost , and lost decisively .
What did it achieve ?
The killing of large numbers of civilians , children and women , and the destruction of homes , ministry buildings and other infrastructure with the most advanced US weapons and other internationally banned chemical and phosphorous elements .
Almost 2,000 children were killed and injured in desperate pursuit of political goals .
Many international organisations called these attacks war crimes , yet barely a word of denunciation was uttered by any western leader .
What message does the EU mean to send Palestinians by its shameful silence on these crimes , when it speaks incessantly on human rights ?
If anything , the last three weeks , and previous 18 months , have proved that the Palestinians can never be broken by either starvation , economic strangulation or brutal attack .
European leaders have only one option : to recognise the outcome of a democratic process they had called for and supported .
The aggression failed to undermine or weaken the Hamas - led government , or turn Palestinians against Hamas .
If anything , public support is stronger than ever in Palestine and worldwide .
Hamas 's military capabilities have not been hurt , either .
This explains Israel scurrying to sign such a strange agreement with the US to stop arms reaching Hamas .
It is doomed to fail .
As the former Israeli chief of staff Moshe Ya'alon and Binyamin Netanyahu agreed , Israeli forces failed to achieve their objectives .
Why is Israel allowed a continuous flow of the most lethal arms , including banned weapons , while national resistance movements are denied the means of defence ?
International laws permit occupied nations to resist their occupiers , and that is a right we aim to utilise to the full .
Israel must accept the reality that it is incapable of breaking the Palestinian resistance .
Similarly , Europe must accept that bringing back Abbas on an Israeli tank is not an option .
Nor are attempts to win by " diplomacy " what the might of the Israeli military failed to secure by force .
To state that all aid for Gaza reconstruction must go through the illegal government of Salam Fayyad suggests there is no end to some parties ' exploitation of Palestinians .
We will never cease to pursue national unity , but we will never allow it to be attained by compromising Palestinian rights .
And to President Obama we say : the wave of hope that met your election was heavily dampened by your silence on the Gaza massacre .
This was compounded by your pre-election statement siding with the Israeli settlers of Sderot .
You would do well to know the history of the places of which you speak .
Sderot , which may be known to some as an Israeli town , lies on the ruins of Najd , a Palestinian village ransacked in May 1948 by Zionist terrorist gangs .
Villagers were forced from their beds and homes with nothing but the clothes they were wearing , rendering them refugees for the next 61 years .
That is the story of Sderot .
It is never a good start to get your tyrant and victims mixed up , but there is still room for a revival of passionate optimism .
Only if you decide to fairly address the issue of the 6 million Palestinian refugees and the ending of occupation of Palestinian lands , including Jerusalem , will you be able to start a new relationship with the Muslim world .

If possible , place your garden near the tap , because you will be watering a lot .
It will be very hard to keep vegetable plants evenly moist by carrying cans of water or even hand - watering with a hose .
Get a sprinkler or , better yet , a soaker hose to keep the water off leaves , and a timer so you can let water run for plenty of time until it turns off automatically .
“ Credit - default swaps written on companies that were presumed not to be in danger of collapse but that are now on the brink  that is the overhang on the financial markets , ” said Sylvain R. Raynes , a mathematics professor at Baruch College in New York and an expert in structured finance at R & R Consulting .
“ The financial system is frozen largely because of credit - default swaps . ”
C.D.S. ’s have introduced other economic burdens as well .
Christopher Whalen , managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics , argues that speculators who use credit protection to bet against financial institutions add instability to the system and cause the cost of taxpayer bailouts of the banks to escalate .
Normally , if a company goes bankrupt , a trustee steps in and helps it get back on its feet .
The process can be brutal for creditors , suppliers and employees .
But the ill effects of a bankruptcy are magnified if billions of dollars in insurance must also be paid out by companies that wrote protection on a beleaguered company ’s debt .
While the amount of credit insurance outstanding is around $ 30 trillion , Robert Arvanitis , chief executive of Risk Finance Advisors in Westport , Conn. , says he believes fully half that amount is n’t problematic because it consists of winning and losing stakes that offset each other .
But that still leaves $ 15 trillion worth of contracts that may be in need of triage .
What if a company that wrote insurance can’t produce the required payout when a default occurs ?
The buyer should take the hit , Mr. Arvanitis said .
“ If you live in a house and you do n’t buy reputable insurance and a fire burns it down , it ’s your fault , ” he said .
Yet as the huge A.I.G. rescue indicates , there ’s a risk that errant C.D.S. bets could end up being the taxpayers ’ problem anyway .

We do n't match italic , small caps Helvetica .
The advance sizes are incorrect for a few of the glyphs .
At some point we just have to decide that exactly matching Windows is n't worth the effort and this is that point .
If we have two systems S1 and S2 that do not interact with each other , we can put
S1 = φ 1( W1 ) ,
S2 = φ 2( W2 ) .
If these two systems are viewed as a single system of entropy S and probability W , we have
S = S1 + S2 = φ( W )
and
W = W1 ∙ W2 .
The last relation tells us that the states of the two systems are mutually independent events .
Einstein and Bohr –
No names loom larger in the history of twentieth - century physics , and rightly so , Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr being the figures most prominently associated with the relativity and quantum revolutions .
Their names dominate , likewise , the history of philosophical reactions to the new physics of the twentieth century , Bohr for having identified complementarity as the chief novelty in the quantum description of nature , Einstein for having found vindication in relativity theory for either positivism or realism , depending upon whom one asks .
Famous as is each in his own domain , they are famous also , together , for their decades - long disagreement over the future of fundamental physics , their respective embrace and rejection of quantum indeterminacy being only the most widely - known point of contention .
A well - entrenched narrative tells the story of the Einstein - Bohr debate as one in which Einstein ’s tries , from 1927 through 1930 , to prove the quantum theory incorrect via thought experiments exhibiting in - principle violations of the Heisenberg indeterminacy principle , only to have Bohr find the flaw in each , after which Einstein shifts his direction of attack , faulting the quantum theory now not as incorrect , but incomplete .
In 1935 , the Einstein , Podolsky , and Rosen ( EPR ) paper , “ Can Quantum - Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete ? ” ( Einstein , Podolsky , Rosen 1935 ) represents the high - water mark of this critique .
It is met by Bohr ’s deep and devastating reply ( Bohr 1935 ) , after which Bohr grows ever more in stature and influence as the sage of Copenhagen , while Einstein slips into senility in Princeton , meddling , perhaps commendably , in the politics of the atomic bomb , but no longer capable of constructive contributions to physics , itself .
That something is seriously wrong with this triumphalist narrative has been remarked upon by various authors for more than twenty years .
More than anyone else , however , it was Mara Beller , in her Quantum Dialogue ( Beller 1999 ) who forced a reassessment .
One need not agree with every detail in Beller ’s own account of the way in which the community around Bohr in Copenhagen achieved consensus on questions of interpretation in order to appreciate the point that the writing or rewriting of history is , itself , one of the many tools with which communities define themselves and construct consensus .
Reason enough always to be just a bit suspicious of any community ’s telling its own story .
Some aspects of Beller ’s new history I commend ; others I do not .
I commend Beller ’s stressing , like James Cushing before her ( Cushing 1994 ) , the role of contingent social and historical circumstance in the achievement of consensus .
More than Beller , I find cogency in Bohr ’s arguments , but there can be no doubt that the victory of a “ Copenhagen ” point of view on interpretation is explained , in no small measure , by such factors as Bohr ’s control over financial resources through his institute in Copenhagen , by his personal prestige , and even by a conversational manner that some regarded as persistent and others as bullying .
But Beller identifies Bohr as the chief enforcer of a Copenhagen orthodoxy , whereas I think that what later came to be regarded as Copenhagen orthodoxy owed more to Werner Heisenberg than to Bohr .
On my reading , Bohr was never a positivist , did not endorse wave - packet collapse , and did not demand ideological conformity among his followers .
It was not by compulsion , but by the example of his dogged pursuit of the deep philosophical lessons of the quantum that Bohr created and sustained not a unitary “ Copenhagen interpretation , ” but what Leon Rosenfeld called the “ Copenhagen spirit ” ( Rosenfeld 1957 ) .
That the standard , triumphalist Copenhagen narrative requires significant revision is , however , as noted , a point upon which I wholeheartedly agree with Beller .
It needs revision if only to redress the insult to Einstein .
The present paper is a contribution to that revision .
I argue that the standard history is wrong not only for the kinds of reasons cited by Beller , but also for the reason that it more or less completely misses the real point at issue between Einstein and Bohr .
Simply put , both Bohr and Einstein understood early and clearly that the chief novelty of the quantum theory was what we , today , call “ entanglement , ” the non-factorizability of the joint states of previously interacting quantum systems .
Bohr embraced entanglement , seeing in it the roots of complementarity .
Einstein rejected entanglement as incompatible with the principle of the spatial separability of systems , a principle that he thought not only a necessary feature of any field theory like general relativity but also a necessary condition for the very intelligibility of science .
Everything else is derivative , including Bohr ’s defense of complementarity and Einstein ’s charge of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics , a charge unsustainable without the assumption of what Einstein termed the “ separation principle .
”
On this way of revising the history , Bohr still emerges with the better arguments .
Here , too , Beller and I disagree .
But Einstein ’s legacy is rehabilitated , his dissent being seen for what it was : principled , well - motivated , based upon deep physical insight , and informed by a sophisticated philosophy of science .
Why later apologists for Copenhagen orthodoxy preferred the senile Einstein as Bohr ’s antagonist is hard to fathom , for Bohr ’s defense against Einstein ’s critique makes more sense and is more interesting when read as a reply to a good argument rather than a bad one .
Putting a debate about entanglement at center stage has the additional salubrious effect of highlighting a still more general failure of the received history of quantum mechanics in the early twentieth century .
It was not just Einstein and Bohr who were arguing about entanglement .
Everyone was .
That the joint states of previously interacting quantum systems do not factorize and that the quantum mechanical story about multi-particle systems differs , thus , in a fundamental way from the classical story were facts understood by all of the major players , well before Erwin Schrödinger baptized the phenomenon as “ entanglement ” in 1935 , and long before quantum information theory made entanglement the hot , new topic in the foundations literature in the 1990s .
Why the standard histories of quantum mechanics have not emphasized this is as puzzling as their penchant for letting caricature take the place of a sympathetic and accurate account of Einstein ’s critique of the quantum theory .
Standard histories of the Einstein - Bohr debate have it beginning in earnest during the personal encounter between Einstein and Bohr at the 1927 Solvay meeting .
This was an important confrontation , but to understand what Einstein and Bohr were arguing about then and later , one must understand first their prior confrontations with the issue of entanglement .
Einstein had been thinking about the problem for over twenty years , Bohr for nearly ten .
From the very beginning , that is , from his 1905 paper on the photon hypothesis , Einstein understood that the emerging quantum theory was likely to incorporate some compromise with the fundamentally classical idea of the mutual independence of interacting systems .
The reason was simple and obvious .
Recall that Einstein ’s route to the photon hypothesis was via a thermodynamic analogy .
Einstein showed that expression for the entropic behavior of radiation in the Wien ( highfrequency ) regime exhibited the same functional form as the entropy of a classical , Boltzmann gas .
That analogy sustained the inference that radiation in the Wien regime had a microstucture like that of a Boltzmann gas , in the sense that it consisted of discrete , distinguishable , mutually independent , corpuscle - like carriers of the field energy that Einstein dubbed light quanta .
In Einstein ’s own words : “ Monochromatic radiation of low density ( within the domain of validity of Wien 's radiation formula ) behaves from a thermodynamic point of view as if it consisted of mutually independent energy quanta of the magnitude Rßí /N ” ( Einstein 1905 , 143 ) .
What did it mean to say that light quanta were “ mutually independent ” ?
It meant precisely that the Boltzmann formula applied or that entropy is an extensive property of the radiation gas , for the additivity of the entropy of a composite system is equivalent to the factorizability of the joint probabilities for the differently spatially situated component subsystems occupying given cells of phase space , this latter being the normal way of expressing the probabilistic independence of two events .
Again , in Einstein ’s own words :
( Einstein 1905 , 140 - 141 )
But this argument works only in the Wien limit .
That such mutual independence is thus shown only to hold in the Wien limit and that it is likely to fail outside of the Wien regime is obvious , however much this obvious fact goes unremarked in much of the secondary literature on Einstein and the quantum .
I must have expressed myself unclearly in regard to the light quanta .
That is to say , I am not at all of the opinion that one should think of light as being composed of mutually independent quanta localized in relatively small spaces .
This would be the most convenient explanation of the Wien end of the radiation formula .
But already the division of a light ray at the surface of refractive media absolutely prohibits this view .
A light ray divides , but a light quantum indeed cannot divide without change of frequency .
As I already said , in my opinion one should not think about constructing light out of discrete , mutually independent points .
I imagine the situation somewhat as follows : . . .
I conceive of the light quantum as a point that is surrounded by a greatly extended vector field , that somehow diminishes with distance .
Whether or not when several light quanta are present with mutually overlapping fields one must imagine a simple superposition of the vector fields , that I can not say .
In any case , for the determination of events , one must have equations of motion for the singular points in addition to the differential equations for the vector field .
The simple fact is that , from the very beginning , Einstein understood the limitations of the argument and understood that , in general , the radiation field could not be modeled in simple corpuscular terms .
If there be any doubt that Einstein understood that mutual independence would not obtain outside of the Wien regime , consider what he wrote to Hendrik Lorentz four years later :
( Einstein to Lorentz , 23 May 1909 , Einstein 1993 , Doc. 163 )
In other words , the idea of wave - particle duality is born out of Einstein ’s effort to exploit the metaphor of interference for describing the manner in which light quanta outside of the Wien regime do not behave like mutually independent systems .
Over the next decade , many people in addition to Einstein struggled to understand what kind of statistics was appropriate for quantum systems behaving in such a non-classical manner .
An especially illuminating moment in that history is recorded in a series of papers by Mieczyslaw Wolfke , who was Einstein ’s colleague in Zurich for a short time in 1913 - 1914 .
Wolfke was seeking to understand exactly what kind of independence among light quanta was assumed in Einstein ’s 1905 argument , and his remarks are interesting in part because they are based on direct communications from Einstein , himself .
In the last of four papers , Wolfke wrote :
In fact the Einsteinian light quanta behave like the individual , mutually independent molecules of a gas . . . .
However , the spatial independence of the Einsteinian light quanta comes out even more clearly from Einstein ’s argument itself .
From the Wien radiation formula Einstein calculates the probability W that all n light quanta of the same frequency enclosed in a volume v0 find themselves at an arbitrary moment of time in the subvolume v of the volume v0 .
The expression for this probability reads :
W = ( v / v0 ) n .
This probability may be interpreted as the product of the individual probabilities v/v0 that an individual one of the light quanta under consideration lies in the subvolume v at an arbitrary moment of time .
From the fact that the total probability W is expressed as the product of the individual probabilities v/v0 , one recognizes that it is a matter of individual mutually independent events .
Thus we see that , according to Einstein ’s view , the fact that a light quantum lies in a specific subvolume is independent of the position of the other light quanta .
( Wolfke 1914 , 463-464 )
The special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny the aether .
We may assume the existence of an ether ; only we must give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it , i.e. , we must by abstraction take from it the last mechanical characteristic which Lorentz had still left it .
. . .
Think of waves on the surface of water .
Here we can describe two entirely different things .
Either we may follow how the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course of time ; or else –with the help of small floats , for instance–we can follow how the position of the individual particles of water alters in the course of time .
If the existence of such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental impossibility in physics–if , in fact , nothing else whatever were discernible than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in time , we should have no ground for the assumption that water consists of movable particles .
But all the same we could characterize it as a medium .
We have something like this in the electromagnetic field .
For we may picture the field to ourselves as consisting of lines of force .
If we wish to interpret these lines of force to ourselves as something material in the ordinary sense , we are tempted to interpret thedynamic processes as motions of these lines of force , such that each individual line of force is tracked through the course of time .
It is well known , however , that this way of regarding the electromagnetic field leads to contradictions .
Generalizing we must say this :
There may be supposed to be extended physical objects to which the idea of motion cannot be applied .
They may not be thought of as consisting of particles that allow themselves to be individually tracked through time .
In Minkowski ’s idiom this is expressed as follows :
Not every extended structure in the four - dimensional world can be regarded as composed of world - threads .
The special theory of relativity forbids us to assume the ether to consist of particles that can be tracked through time , but the hypothesis of the ether in itself is not in conflict with the special theory of relativity .
Only we must be on our guard against ascribing a state of motion to the ether .
Bose ’s theory of radiation and my analogous theory of ideal gases have been reproved by Mr. Ehrenfest and other colleagues because in these theories the quanta or molecules are not treated as structures statistically independent of one another , without this circumstance being especially pointed out in our papers .
This is entirely correct .
If one treats the quanta as being statistically independent of one another in their localization , then one obtains the Wien radiation law ; if one treats the gas molecules analogously , then one obtains the classical equation of state for ideal gases , even if one otherwise proceeds exactly as Bose and I have .
. . .
It is easy to see that , according to this way of calculating [ Bose - Einstein statistics ] , the distribution of molecules among the cells is not treated as a statistically independent one .
This is connected with the fact that the cases that are here called “ complexions ” would not be regarded as cases of equal probability according to the hypothesis of the independent distribution of the individual molecules among the cells Assigning different probability to these “ complexions ” would not then give the entropy correctly in the case of an actual statistical independence of the molecules .
Thus , the formula [ for the entropy ] indirectly expresses a certain hypothesis about a mutual influence of the molecules –for the time being of a quite mysterious kind –which determines precisely the equal statistical probability of the cases here defined as “ complexions . ”
In the Bose statistics employed by me , the quanta or molecules are not treated as being independent of one another .
. . .
A complexion is characterized through giving the number of molecules that are present in each individual cell .
The number of the complexions so defined should determine the entropy .
According to this procedure , the molecules do not appear as being localized independently of one another , but rather they have a preference to sit together with another molecule in the same cell .
One can easily picture this in the case of small numbers .
[ In particular ] 2 quanta , 2 cells :
According to Bose the molecules stack together relatively more often than according to the hypothesis of the statistical independence of the molecules .
But understanding the independence of photons in the Wien limit is not the same thing as understanding the manner in which that independence fails outside of the Wien regime .
It took another ten years for Einstein to solve the quantum statistics puzzle thanks to the fortuitous intervention of the Indian physicist , Satyendra Nath Bose ( 1924 ) .
How deeply the problem of quantum statistics weighed upon Einstein ’s soul before 1924 is clear from a far - too - little - known argument adduced by Einstein in 1920 for the purpose of opposing ( ! ) a field ontology of trackable , mutually independent carriers of field energy .
The setting is the lecture , “ Äther und Relativitätstheorie , ” delivered in May , 1920 as the inaugural address for Einstein ’s visiting professorship in Leiden , home to Lorentz , whom Einstein held in high esteem .
In what is partly a gesture of respect for Lorentz , Einstein evinces surprising sympathy for the concept of the ether , arguing that , in many respects , the space - time of general relativity has taken over the role of the electromagnetic ether , at least inasmuch as it is the abode of field energy .
To questions about the microstructure of fields , Einstein gives an interesting answer : ( Einstein 1920 , 9 - 10 ) Savor the irony .
Here is Einstein , the inventor of the photon hypothesis , arguing against modeling the electromagnetic field as being composed of distinguishable and , thus , trackable field quanta , and this because such a model is inherently non-relativistic .
One easily imagines the relief Einstein felt when , prodded by Bose , he realized in 1924 that he could rescue a quantum field ontology by denying the distinguishability of quanta .
Surely we see here another important reason for Einstein ’s prompt and warm embrace of Bose , along with the fact that Bose ’s new statistics yielded an elegant , first - principles derivation of the Planck formula for black body radiation .
Accepting Bose ’s new statistics , however , meant facing up to the fact that the failure of the mutual independence of quanta outside of the Wien limit , suspected by Einstein since at least 1909 , was going be a deep and pervasive feature of a still not yet established quantum mechanics .
Einstein explained this point in his second paper on the extension of bosonic statistics to material particles : ( Einstein 1925 , 5 - 6 ) Einstein made the same point with equal clarity in a letter to Schrödinger in February of 1925 : ( Einstein to Schrödinger , 28 February 1925 , EA 22 -002 ) That the Schrödinger who later coined the term “ entanglement ” was the recipient of this letter is noteworthy , for when one reads Schrödinger ’s work in developing wave mechanics over the next several months through the lens of his ongoing correspondence with Einstein , it is hard to avoid the conclusion that one of Schrödinger ’s principal motivations was to find a wave - mechanical formalism capable of expressing precisely the curious failure of the mutual independence of quantum mechanical systems revealed in the new quantum statistics , just as Einstein , in 1909 , deployed the metaphor of wave interference to model the failure of mutual independence outside of the Wien regime .
The key move of writing the n-particle wave function in 3n - dimensional configuration space , rather than 3 - space , is necessary because only thus does one have access to a state space rich enough to comprise non-factorizable joint state functions .
The price paid , famously , and much to Schrödinger ’s regret , was the loss of visualizability , but that was precisely the price required by entanglement , as both Bohr and Einstein would quickly realize .

Republicans to Filibuster Democrat Plans to Seat Al Franken
An interesting little game is playing out in Minnesota and with the Democrat party .
Republican Norm Coleman and Democrat Al Franken are locked in a disputed senate race that is in the midst of yet another recount .
Norm Coleman won the original vote as well as the first recount before Al Franken miraculously “ found ” some votes that were n’t counted and he is now in the lead .
Beacuse Norm Coleman ’s senate race is still undecided he will not be allowed to sit in on the senate proceedings when they resume on Tuesday .
He will have no input and no vote as well as no seat on the floor .
Makes sense to me .
How can a senator be seated when we do n’t know who that senator should be ?
Since he has not been certified a winner in the race , Coleman may have to give up his privileges as a senator , including his desk on the floor , his personal office and his right to vote on legislation , according to Democratic aides familiar with the rules .
On the other hand , Democrats are trying to seat Al Franken in the senate even though the race is still undecided .
Some have suggested that Franken could be seated provisionally
This has drawn the ire of minority leader John Cornyn who has promised to filibuster any attempt to seat the as of now unelected Al Franken .
This is a very , very serious matter , ” Cornyn said .
“ I can assure you that there will be no way that people on our side of the aisle will agree to seat any senator without a valid certificate
While the election still is n’t certified neither candidate should be allowed a seat on the floor .
It seems obvious to me .
Yet the Democrats are counting their chickens before they hatch , they assume that because Al Franken is winning this recount that he should be allowed a seat on the senate floor .
This battle for the senate seat could go on for quite a while and as long as it does neither man should be allowed to sit on the senate floor .
I am sure that Democrats will complain that this is the obstructionist politics as usual and they should know about obstructionist politics .
It is they who have obstructed over the last eight years .
But this is n’t about obstructionism it is about the rules of the senate , it is about what is right and wrong .
Al Franken is probably going to win the seat but until he does he should n’t be allowed to sit in it .
Climate Change
Gore to Senate : Pass Stimulus Bill
Former vice president Al Gore testifies at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on global warming .
( Jim Lo Scalzo / Bloomberg News )
Updated 12:41 p.m.
By Juliet Eilperin
Former vice president Al Gore urged lawmakers this morning to adopt a binding carbon cap and push for a new global climate pact by the end of this year in order to avert catastrophic global warming , calling the president 's economic stimulus package a " down payment " on a new energy future .
Appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Gore delivered a short slide - show that amounted to an update of his Oscar - winning documentary " An Inconvenient Truth , " lecturing some of his former colleagues that even if the world halted greenhouse gas emissions now the world could experience a temperature rise of between 2.5 to 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 .
" This would bring a screeching halt to human civilization and threaten life everywhere on earth , and this is by the end of this century , " Gore said .
He also called for the passage of the stimulus package , calling it " the first step " in regaining " control of our destiny . "
" I urge this Congress to quickly pass the entirety of President Obama 's Recovery package , " he said .
The high - tech display included a graphic illustration of how the Arctic 's permanent summer ice cover has melted in recent decades , a pulsating image the Nobel Peace Prize winner described as " thirty years in less than thirty seconds , " and a short video clip of a scientist who ignited the methane gas seeping out of the melting Arctic permafrost .
After the audience watched the flames leap up and the researcher scurry away , Gore remarked , " She 's O.K .
The question is , are we ? "
Gore received a largely - sympathetic hearing from the panel .
The committee 's chairman John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) chided some conservatives who seized on the recent snowstorm in D.C. to question whether climate change is real , saying , " To the naysayers and skeptics and deniers still out there , let me add : a little snow in Washington does nothing to diminish the reality of this crisis . "
Kerry delivered a lecture to developing nations as well from the dais , saying the U.S. would not make the mistake of leaving emerging economies out of any future climate agreement as it did during negotiations over the Kyoto Protocol in the early 1990s .
" In Kyoto people stiff - armed that discussion .
But the landscape has shifted over the past decade , and now China is the world 's largest emitter , " Kerry said .
" Developing countries will account for three - quarters of the increase in global energy use over the next two decades .
A global problem demands a global effort , and today we are working toward a solution with a role for developed and developing countries alike , which will be vital as we work to build consensus here at home in tough economic times . "
Gore did n't sugarcoat his message to senators today .
While politicians including President Obama have touted the importance of exploring " clean coal technology , " the former vice president said it was unlikely this technological advance " will occur in the short term , or even in the near term .
We must avoid becoming vulnerable to the illusion that this is near at hand .
It is not . "
" That 's a very direct and honest answer , " Kerry replied , " and I appreciate it . "
However Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar , the committee 's top Republican , asked Gore to draw on his experience as " a practicing politician " to explain how senators could muster a broad bipartisan majority for any international treaty that could come out of Copenhagen at the end of the year .
After distancing himself from his political past -- " I 'm a recovering politician .
I 'm on about Step Nine . " -- the former Democratic presidential nominee said developing countries ' willingness to embrace binding climate goals coupled with the new scientific evidence of recent warming should boost the chances of a treaty passing the Senate .
Alluding to Obama 's announcement this week that he would tighten U.S. auto emissions , Gore added , " President Obama 's leadership , as manifested just two days ago , can itself be an important new element in [ mobilizing ] support for what needs to be done . "
Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) , who supporters a carbon tax rather than a cap - and - trade system , said he thought the only way to construct a bipartisan coalition on climate change was to be honest about what it means to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" I think we can build consensus around transparency , " Corker said , adding that when it comes to addressing global warming , " We 're really talking about increasing the price of carbon . "
Corker , who suggested Congress would be better off passing a carbon dioxide tax that would be fully - refundable to taxpayers , said even lawmakers who have some reservations about a carbon cap 's economic impact need to acknowledge it will likely become reality .
" We 're now firing with real bullets , " he said .
" The stars are aligning , and my sense is this year something may actually occur . "
Gore 's opening remarks , as prepared for delivery , follow :
We are here today to talk about how we as Americans and how the United States of America as part of the global community should address the dangerous and growing threat of the climate crisis .
We have arrived at a moment of decision .
Our home - Earth - is in grave danger .
What is at risk of being destroyed is not the planet itself , of course , but the conditions that have made it hospitable for human beings .
Moreover , we must face up to this urgent and unprecedented threat to the existence of our civilization at a time when our country must simultaneously solve two other worsening crises .
Our economy is in its deepest recession since the 1930s .
And our national security is endangered by a vicious terrorist network and the complex challenge of ending the war in Iraq honorably while winning the military and political struggle in Afghanistan .
As we search for solutions to all three of these challenges , it is becoming clearer that they are linked by a common thread - our dangerous over - reliance on carbon - based fuels .
As long as we continue to send hundreds of billions of dollars for foreign oil -- year after year -- to the most dangerous and unstable regions of the world , our national security will continue to be at risk .
As long as we continue to allow our economy to remain shackled to the OPEC roller - coaster of rising and falling oil prices , our jobs and our way of life will remain at risk .
Moreover , as the demand for oil worldwide grows rapidly over the longer term , even as the rate of new discoveries is falling , it is increasingly obvious that the roller coaster is headed for a crash .
And we 're in the front car .
Most importantly , as long as we continue to depend on dirty fossil fuels like coal and oil to meet our energy needs , and dump 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet , we move closer and closer to several dangerous tipping points which scientists have repeatedly warned - again just yesterday - will threaten to make it impossible for us to avoid irretrievable destruction of the conditions that make human civilization possible on this planet .
We 're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet .
Every bit of that 's got to change .
For years our efforts to address the growing climate crisis have been undermined by the idea that we must choose between our planet and our way of life ; between our moral duty and our economic well being .
These are false choices .
In fact , the solutions to the climate crisis are the very same solutions that will address our economic and national security crises as well .
In order to repower our economy , restore American economic and moral leadership in the world and regain control of our destiny , we must take bold action now .
The first step is already before us .
I urge this Congress to quickly pass the entirety of President Obama 's Recovery package .
The plan 's unprecedented and critical investments in four key areas - energy efficiency , renewables , a unified national energy grid and the move to clean cars - represent an important down payment and are long overdue .
These crucial investments will create millions of new jobs and hasten our economic recovery - while strengthening our national security and beginning to solve the climate crisis .
Quickly building our capacity to generate clean electricity will lay the groundwork for the next major step needed : placing a price on carbon .
If Congress acts right away to pass President Obama 's Recovery package and then takes decisive action this year to institute a cap - and - trade system for CO 2 emissions - as many of our states and many other countries have already done - the United States will regain its credibility and enter the Copenhagen treaty talks with a renewed authority to lead the world in shaping a fair and effective treaty .
And this treaty must be negotiated this year .
Not next year .
This year .
A fair , effective and balanced treaty will put in place the global architecture that will place the world - at long last and in the nick of time - on a path toward solving the climate crisis and securing the future of human civilization .
I am hopeful that this can be achieved .
Let me outline for you the basis for the hope and optimism that I feel .
The Obama Administration has already signaled a strong willingness to regain U.S. leadership on the global stage in the treaty talks , reversing years of inaction .
This is critical to success in Copenhagen and is clearly a top priority of the administration .
Developing countries that were once reluctant to join in the first phases of a global response to the climate crisis have themselves now become leaders in demanding action and in taking bold steps on their own initiatives .
Brazil has proposed an impressive new plan to halt the destructive deforestation in that nation .
Indonesia has emerged as a new constructive force in the talks .
And China 's leaders have gained a strong understanding of the need for action and have already begun important new initiatives .
Heads of state from around the world have begun to personally engage on this issue and forward - thinking corporate leaders have made this a top priority .
More and more Americans are paying attention to the new evidence and fresh warnings from scientists .
There is a much broader consensus on the need for action than there was when President George H.W. Bush negotiated - and the Senate ratified - the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 and much stronger support for action than when we completed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 .
The elements that I believe are key to a successful agreement in Copenhagen include :
* Strong targets and timetables from industrialized countries and differentiated but binding commitments from developing countries that put the entire world under a system with one commitment : to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants that cause the climate crisis ;
* The inclusion of deforestation , which alone accounts for twenty percent of the emissions that cause global warming ;
* The addition of sinks including those from soils , principally from farmlands and grazing lands with appropriate methodologies and accounting .
Farmers and ranchers in the U.S. and around the world need to know that they can be part of the solution ;
* The assurance that developing countries will have access to mechanisms and resources that will help them adapt to the worst impacts of the climate crisis and technologies to solve the problem ; and ,
* A strong compliance and verification regime .
The road to Copenhagen is not easy , but we have traversed this ground before .
We have negotiated the Montreal Protocol , a treaty to protect the ozone layer , and strengthened it to the point where we have banned most of the major substances that create the ozone hole over Antarctica .
And we did it with bipartisan support .
President Ronald Reagan and Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill joined hands to lead the way .
Let me now briefly discuss in more detail why we must do all of this within the next year , and with your permission , Mr. Chairman , I would like to show a few new pictures that illustrate the unprecedented need for bold and speedy action this year .
Thank you , Mr. Chairman .
I am eager to respond to any questions that you and the members of the committee have .

I am a first year teacher in a high - need district , but I teach at a smaller school .
The students I have come from extremely diverse backgrounds , but all face an uphill battle to receive a quality education and to graduate from a district with 50 % drop - out rate .
I will do anything to get them there .
As a history teacher , I am always in search of ways to engage my students in the material they struggle to apply to their own lives .
I hear groans and see rolling eyes whenever I ask them to take out and open their history text books .
I do n't blame them .
The text books are too big , too opaque in their explanation of controversy and have become a symbol of ' boredom ' and busy work .
I recently started reading them excerpts from historian Howard Zinn 's " A People 's History of the U.S. " and students have loved it .
They get excited whenever I get it out and seem to enjoy the perspective and tone the book sets for history .
It 's as if I am a storyteller when using Zinn 's text , whereas before I was a salesman with the regular text .
The " People 's History " I have been using is a personal copy that is written for high - level readers .
It has no pictures and is hundreds of pages long .
Whenever I read it , I need to first read through and remove grandiose vocabulary in order for them to understand it .
Thankfully , Zinn 's text has been adapted for young people in two volumes .
I want to order class sets of these texts for my students to keep in the classroom and use in coordination with their regular texts .
This version has pictures , as well , and is full of primary sources to analyze and use in our application of history .
I can see my students now ... willingly opening these books to partake in a journey through history , telling the stories themselves and learning from it .
On a day to day basis , our current text books have proven to be less and less productive tools in the classroom .
Your donation of any amount will literally change my classroom dynamic .
If this project is fully funded , I will finally have my student 's attention and engagement .
They WILL respond to this text , and I want them to have that experience .
In addition , this is a long - term investment for my classroom .
These books will be laminated and tracked to prevent theft and vandalism and will be used for years to come .
Please consider funding this project to your ability .
Thank you !
A massive programme of regeneration has helped bring new self - confidence to Hull , transforming the city after decades of post - war decline .
But the Yorkshire port is the city hardest hit so far by Britain 's economic meltdown , suffering the fastest leap in unemployment .
Alongside Hull , Liverpool , Belfast and Wigan are the cities worst - equipped to recover from the recession , according to research .
A leading think - tank , the Centre for Cities , warns that every city in the country will be hit by the downturn , but that each one 's speed of recovery will vary dramatically depending on the skills of each workforce .
Tightened public spending is likely to put pressure on urban jobs .
More than 10,000 people in Hull now claim Jobseekers '
Allowance , a rise of 3,000 in just one year .
The city , long hampered by its relatively remote location and poor transport links , is rated Britain 's least prosperous and second most - socially - deprived city .
One - fifth of inhabitants have no formal qualifications .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Unemployment has also climbed sharply in two nearby towns , Barnsley and Doncaster , which are both heavily reliant on the construction industry .
But the centre uncovers a picture more complex than the traditional north - south divide often described in the UK economy .
Despite its rapid growth and high wages , Swindon , home to Honda 's UK plant , has the fourth - highest rise in unemployment .
Gloucester , a traditional centre of the aviation industry , has also experienced above - average increases in the length of its dole queues and growing deprivation .
Three towns and cities in the north - west of England are seeing sharp unemployment rises – Wigan , Warrington , and Liverpool , which is judged the country 's most deprived city .
Wigan has been hit particularly badly because its workforce is concentrated in the banking , finance , insurance and construction sectors .
Although Belfast boomed after the end of the Troubles , the report registers alarm over the prospects for Northern Ireland 's capital .
It says the city 's lack of skills – one - quarter of teenagers leave schools with no qualifications – will hamper its recovery .
Reading , Aberdeen , Oxford and Cambridge , with their highly - qualified residents and " knowledge intensive " industries , are rated among the best - placed to weather the storm , the Centre for Cities said .
Few jobs have been lost so far in Aberdeen , one of Britain 's most prosperous cities .
Its position as the hub of the North Sea oil industry should make it more resilient to the recession .
The less - glamorous Reading is expected to benefit from high - tech industries and fast links to London .
Bristol , Leeds , Edinburgh and London are put on " amber alert " .
They will " face significant employment losses " because of their vulnerability to the crisis in the financial sector , but can count on skilled populations and a range of industries to help them recover .
In Edinburgh , 44 per cent of working residents have degree - level qualifications – the highest proportion in the country .

Also exposed to the pressures on financial jobs are Aldershot , Newcastle , Nottingham , Crawley and Plymouth .
The lowest unemployment rise came in Cambridge , which has the second best - qualified residents .
Similarly well - placed is Oxford , although its property is rated the least affordable in the country .
Dermot Finch , the director of the Centre for Cities , said : " UK cities will be hit harder than they anticipate by this recession .
Nearly all say they are well - placed to weather the storm – but they can't all be right .
" Cities will lead us out of recession – but they can't just rely on action from Whitehall .
Each city needs to plan how to keep its jobs and retrain workers . "
Winner : Reading
* Reading is second only to London in the Centre for Cities economic prosperity index , and is rated as one of the best - placed to ride out the recession .
The town , with a population of 140,000 , has one of the slowest - rising unemployment rates ( the number of people claiming jobseeker 's allowance went up by only 0.5 per cent in the year to last November ) , partly because it has many " knowledge - based industries " such as computing , accountancy and insurance , which are less likely to suffer .
This sector employs nearly 30 per cent of Reading 's workforce .
The town also has good transport links , creating what the Centre for Cities calls as a " mutually supportive economic relationship " with London .
Loser : Gloucester
Gloucester is an unlikely candidate to suffer in the credit crunch as it has the third - highest rate of employment in the country at 82.8 per cent .
However , the city has seen a rapid hike in registered unemployment , with Jobseeker 's Allowance claimants up by 1 per cent – double the rise in Reading – during 2008 .
Deprivation is also a problem : Gloucester is among 10 places showing the sharpest decline in the rankings .
GE Aviation has announced the closure of its Tewkesbury plant , costing up to 200 jobs .
Motor parts supplier Takao will suffer 100 job losses .
Logistics firm Wincanton 's office is likely to close and Toyota is seeking volunteers for redundancy .
One of the town 's law firms , BPE Solicitors , is on a four - day week .

Get ready for ROTHBURY 2009
A U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee and AEG
Live have come to an agreement on the lease of Double JJ Resort next summer for the second year of the ROTHBURY Festival .
One possible glitch : Federal bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey R. Hughes must approve the camp - in , environmentally themed music festival at the Double JJ in a court ruling .
Financial problems led Double JJ to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization after last July 's first ROTHBURY , which was by all accounts a commercial success and a popular hit .
The resort is poised to be sold through the bankruptcy proceedings , but not in time for the 2009 version of ROTHBURY to be planned with a new owner .
Hughes has a motion approving the lease with the festival promoters before him Monday afternoon in federal bankruptcy court in Grand Rapids .
The judge 's go - ahead is needed for bankruptcy Trustee Thomas A. Bruinsma to sign the contract with AEG Live , which is a leading global entertainment company that co-produced the first - year festival with Madison House Productions of Boulder , Colo .
So far , a creditor and a land - contract holder have objected to the festival lease with the resort 's trustee .
" The festival was widely heralded as a success , and concert - goers are eagerly anticipating the 2009 event , " Bruinsma 's attorney Stephen Grow wrote the court over the Christmas holiday .
ROTHBURY drew approximately 40,000 fans and nearly 80 acts including The Dave Matthews Band .
" Organizing a mega - event like the festival typically begins a year in advance , " Grow wrote in court documents .
" The trustee believes that the wide acclaim of the festival enhances the value of the ( Double JJ ) assets .
The uncertainty concerning the timing of a sale of the resort has left the producer unable to commit resources and capital to produce the festival in 2009 without certain assurances from the debtors . "
Grow went on to tell the court that Bruinsma and AEG Live officials have been negotiating the 2009 festival lease for several weeks .
AEG Live Chief Operating Officer Thomas Miserendino of Los Angeles signed the agreement and Bruinsma needs Judge Hughes ' approval to execute the contract .
AEG would pay $ 285,000 to lease nine parcels of land in the 2,000 - acre resort in Oceana County 's Grant Township through Aug. 30 .
The only buildings the festival would use would be the Art Barn and the Rodeo Arena , according to the proposed lease .
The proposed 2009 lease does not include a $ 50,000 bonus and a payment based on 10 percent of all food and nonalcoholic beverage sales during the event , provisions that were in the 2008 contract signed by resort owners Bob and Joan Lipsitz .
The 2009 ROTHBURY is expected to be produced the weekend of July 3 - 5 .
Madison
House officials said recently they are planning for the second ROTHBURY this summer as if an agreement would be reached with the trustee or a new resort owner .
Megan McFann , director for Madison House Publicity , said although ROTHBURY 2009 is not yet definite , organizers are proceeding as if the event will happen .
" We 're very excited about returning -- based on the success ( in 2008 ) , " said McFann .
The inaugural four - day music festival featured such headliners as the Dave Matthews Band , Snoop Dogg , John Mayer and Widespread Panic .
Speculation about the 2009 lineup so far includes a reunited Phish -- three quarters of the group performed briefly together on stage at the 2008 ROTHBURY .
Other possible headliners might include Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers , AC / DC , the Foo Fighters and Coldplay which are among the many bands currently touring and promoting recent compact discs .
McFann would not confirm organizers were negotiating with Phish or Petty , but she also declined to deny it .
McFann promised several well - known groups and surprises would be part of a 2009 lineup .
Two possible snags in Bruinsma 's plan to lease the Double JJ to the festival promoters come in the form of two legal objections to the lease agreement Hughes will be asked to approve Monday .
Great Lakes Energy Cooperative has a $ 98,000 mortgage that has gone to a sheriff 's deed sale for foreclosure .
By Jan. 10 , the electrical cooperative could own a portion of the land that is being leased for the festival .
The festival contract says that if the bankruptcy trustee does not control the utility 's land by Jan. 9 , AEG has the ability to cancel its lease and the festival .
It is unknown what will happen to the sheriff 's deed sale redemption .
But Great Lakes objects to the AEG lease because it is on land that the trustee currently does n't control .
Terry , Mary and David Dykstra have a $ 114,000 land contract -- which is in arrears -- for another parcel that is subject of the AEG lease .
They also object to the festival contract unless their interests are protected , according to court records .
Other objections could arise prior to Monday 's hearing .
ISRAELI drug lords are increasingly targeting Australia for ecstasy smuggling .
Israeli police intelligence reveals that crime syndicates operating out of Israel view Australia as a booming market for the party drug .
Israeli crime syndicates control a significant share of the global ecstasy trade and have a long history of supplying the Australian market .
In March , 45 - year - old Israeli man Benjamin Rosenfeld was sentenced to 21 years ' jail for importing 112 kilograms of the drug MDMA , the main ingredient of ecstasy , with a street value estimated at $ 45 million .
Rosenfeld organised the drug shipment from the northern Israeli port of Haifa .
CNBC 's Mark Haines who is not noted for his left wing politics did what so many TV hosts and politicians are afraid to do .
He called out Rush Limbaugh on his spiteful statement ; that he hopes President Obama will fail and basically calls him a political hack .
Limbaugh really had no answer .
Haines : I 'm sorry a week after the inauguration you said you hope he fails .
Are you now admitting that it was a stupid and mean - spirited thing to say ?
Rush :
No , it was an accurate thing to say , it was an honest thing to say and it came ...
Haines :
Well then how is that bipartisan ?
Rush :
Well , if you 'll let me explain .
Haines :
Well so far you have n't .
Rush :
You 've been contentious for no reason .
It came after a thorough explanation and my belief that liberalism is what Obama represents destroys the free market , destroys capitalism and this stimulus plan is all about re-FDRing America , the New Deal and as a conservative I want liberalism to fail .
I want the country to succeed .
And that 's what I meant and that 's what I over and over again . ,
You 've got to stop reading these left wing media sites ...
Haines : I just listen to you Rush , I do n't read anybody , I listen to you .
And I what I hear is hypocrisy .
Rush :
You hear hypocrisy ?
Haines :
You 're saying in this piece , you say " in our economy the difference , this is about jobs now , leave politics aside , " and the first thing out of your mouth is politics .
Not liberal or conservative or democrat .

Another 200,000 could be found in the more left wing Independent Social Democrats ( USPD ) who initially participated in a coalition government with SPD .
Illusions
Throughout November and December , workers ' and soldiers ' councils were set up in many places in Germany .
These were organs of revolutionary power , very similar to their Russian counterparts - the soviets .
Yet , most workers did not understand the full significance of these councils .
Rosa Luxemburg argued in a speech to the founding congress of the Communist Party on New Year ’s Eve 1918 :
‘ We must make the masses understand that the workers ’ and soldiers council is in all senses the lever of the machinery of state , that it must take over all power and must unify the power in one stream – the socialist revolution .
The masses of workers who are already organized in workers ’ and soldiers ’ councils are still miles away from having adopted such an outlook , and only isolated proletarian minorities are clearly conscious of their tasks . ’
( ‘ Our programme and the political situation ’ , Luxemburg , 1919 )
The workers and soldiers were not yet conscious of the fact that they held power in their hands , and , like their Russian brothers and sisters in February 1917 , they supported the compromisers , the counter - revolutionaries who , in Ebert 's own words , ' hated revolution like sin ' and were determined to put an end to it .
In the same speech Luxemburg pointed out that the workers still had illusions in the Social Democrats :
‘ Comrades !
This first act [ of the revolution ] , between November 9 and the present , has been filled with illusions on all sides .
The first illusion of the workers and soldiers who made the revolution was : the illusion of unity under the banner of so - called socialism .
What could be more characteristic of the internal weakness of the Revolution of November 9th than the fact that at the head of the movement appeared persons who a few hours before the revolution broke out had regarded it as their chief duty to agitate against it '
( ‘ Our programme and the political situation ’ , Rosa Luxemburg , 1919 )
The workers had illusions in the leaders and the party ( SPD ) that had led them for many years .
As a result , when elections came for the workers ' councils , SPD triumphed over the Spartacists and also the USPD , who took up a position between the SPD and the Spartacus League .
The SPD managed to secure four fifths of the 489 delegates to the first national congress of the councils .
The government under pressure
Support for the SPD by no means meant that the workers were reformist .
The same SPD - dominated national congress voted through some remarkably radical policies .
The congress supported the abolition of the standing army and introduction of a workers ' militia , election , with the right of recall , of officers and nationalization of the key industries .
The problem was , however , that the people that were set to organize and carry out these policies were by no means committed to them .
Still , at times they were pushed into action by pressure from their supporters .
A short time after that Ebert had been appointed prime minister , an armed demonstration appeared outside the parliament , where Scheidemann was having coffee .
The angry crowds brought him to the balcony in a hurry , where he announced Ebert ’s appointment .
As in an afterthought he shouted ' long live the German Republic ' and with those words the republic became a fact .
Ebert was furious with his colleague , arguing that he had no right to proclaim the republic , but the deed was done .
Any attempt to restore the monarchy would only have further radicalised the German workers , and the German ruling class had to accept the situation .
A constituent assembly ?
Like in Russia , Social Democrats had for a long time been putting forward the slogan of a constituent assembly , as a democratic demand against the rule of the Kaiser and the Tsar .
Like in Russia , this demand was resurrected in November 1918 by the reformists , as a way of stalling for time .
Instead of recognising the fact that the working class had , in effect , taken power into its hands , the constituent assembly would provide an excuse to delay any attempt by the workers to use this power .
As a result , many impatient elements among the Spartacists were hostile to the assembly and instead argued for all power to be transferred to the soviets .
Karl Radek , emissary from the Bolsheviks , commented when he arrived in December that
' It was a very tempting idea to counterpose the slogan of the councils to that of a constituent assembly .
But the congress of councils itself was in favour of the constituent assembly .
You could hardly skip over that stage .
Rosa and Liebknecht recognised that ... But the Party youth were decidedly against it , " we will break it up with machine guns " '
The workers were , as was stated before , still not conscious of the significance of the workers ' councils , that they were a higher form of government , more democratic and appropriate for a real workers ' state .
The Spartacists thus in their propaganda started to separate off the most advanced layers of the working class from the more backward .
Lenin commented on this in his Left - Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder :
' In Western Europe and America , parliament has become most odious to the revolutionary vanguard of the working class .
That can not be denied .
It can readily be understood , for it is difficult to imagine anything more infamous , vile or treacherous than the behaviour of the vast majority of socialist and Social - Democratic parliamentary deputies during and after the war .
It would , however , be not only unreasonable but actually criminal to yield to this mood when deciding how this generally recognised evil should be fought . '
( Lenin , Left - Wing Communism : an Infantile Disorder )
Unlike the Bolsheviks under the leadership of Lenin in 1917 , the newly formed Communist Party proved unable to steer a course between the opportunism and reformism on the one hand and ultra-leftism on the other .
The Bolsheviks in 1917 supported the calling of the Constituent Assembly at the same time as they urged the reformist leaders of the Soviets to take power .
This they did in their propaganda right up to they were themselves the majority in the Soviets and could put both of the demands into practice .
The immaturity of the revolution was ruthlessly exploited by the SPD government .
Using the most backward elements of the peasantry and the petty - bourgeoisie , it launched a serious of provocations against the revolutionary workers in the cities .
Some of the soldiers came from these layers and were prepared to take up arms against the workers .
With the connivance of the government , right - wing soldiers were formed into armed groups of counter - revolutionaries , called the Freikorps .
They were trained in counter - revolutionary operations in the Baltic states where they operated against the Bolsheviks .
The success of these troops against the young workers ' state was such that the victorious allies made it part of the cease fire that they should continue to operate on occupied territory in the east - an extraordinary measure .
Gustav Noske was the Social Democrat who became responsible for the organization of these units and their deployment against the Spartacists , and he was henceforth known as the " bloodhound " of counter - revolution .
In early 1919 , he readied the Freikorps and organized a provocation .
The battle ground was to be the chief of police in Berlin , Emil Eichhorn , who was sympathetic to the revolution and member of USPD .
On 14 January , Rosa Luxemburg wrote :
' What triggered this week of combat ?
As in all previous cases , such as December 6 and December 24 , it was a brutal provocation by the government .
Like the bloodbath against defenseless demonstrators in Chausseestrasse , like the butchery of the sailors , this time the assault on the Berlin police headquarters was the cause of all the events that followed . '
( Luxemburg , ' Order Prevails in Berlin ' )
The government sacked Eichhorn and the workers mobilized to resist .
As part of the struggle , armed workers seized the headquarters of the bourgeois press and the SPD paper Vorwärts .
A particularly ferocious struggle took place over the latter , costing the lives of hundreds of workers .
Inevitably , the courageous but isolated Berlin workers were defeated and reaction followed .
The Communist party press was closed down and Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were arrested and murdered in this striking resemblance to the reaction in Russia after the July days of 1917 .
Events in Germany had moved quicker than they did in Russia .
After only two months , the revolution had suffered its first heavy blow with the defeat of the Berlin workers .
This defeat was by no means the final defeat of the working class that the counter - revolution had been looking for .
Subsequent event were to prove , however , that the ultra - left attitude that the Spartacists took in these months had serious repercussions for the future development of the German Revolution .
Despite the President 's decision to give the last of the TARP money to Chrysler and General Motors , the price of automaker stocks dropped yesterday .
Despite the hundreds of billions of dollars spent in the last couple months to prop up banks , the stock market is down one - third from it historic highs from this summer .
Despite record government deficit spending , the year - over - year consumer price index is no greater than 1.1 % !
( [ link edited for length ] )
Most of the deflation risk is acocunted for in dropping fuel prices .
The price of gasoline , which is the most visible fuel price I see everyday , has n't dropped because of breakthroughs in refining capacity , finding new oil wells , alternative fuels , or the sudden sales of electric cars .
It 's that people are driving less .
The Brookings Institute ( [ link edited for length ] ) found that Americans started making significant cuts in their driving habits in 2007 , for some of the same reasons not seen since 1980 .
Travel began to plateau in 2000 , began the decline in 2005 , fell sharply in 2007 when the price of gas spiked to over $ 3 a gallon and , continued to decline when gas got over $ 4 per gallon earlier this year .
The pain at the pump made an indelible imprint on the psyche of consumers .
If it could happen that fast once , it can happen again .
OPEC , despite recent announcements to cut production ( [ link edited for length ] ) , failed to keep the price of oil from sliding .
OPEC needs the price of oil between $ 60 and $ 80 per barrel to cover its costs of production and exploration .
At less than $ 40 currently , those activities will come to a halt .
All this leads me to think that current fuel prices are n't due to the sudden availability of resources ; it 's the continued lack of demand .
Consumer and business credit has come to a screeching halt .
Unlike the late 70s , when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to double digits to make borrowing too expensive , the marketplace did it itself .
The credit panic exemplified by the rise and crash of investment banking giants Bear - Stearns and Lehman Brothers , is now hitting everyday consumers .
The easy credit , fueled by adjustable rate mortgages , low - cost introductory rate credit cards , and home equity loans are gone .
Consumers are stuck with mortgage payments they can't afford .
Even those who try to refinance with modified terms are defaulting at a rate of 55 % within six months ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
The rest of us , who still have jobs and are able to make the minimum payments on our debts , are not going to spend a dime more than we have to .
We can 't. ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
Until consumers are confident in their jobs and their ability to pay their bills , this trend is going to continue .
In my situation , I 've taken a pay cut so I can keep working .
My employer last summer decided not to continue selling a software product that was my specialty and eliminated my department .
Luckily I had friends at a competitor .
The decision I had to make at the time was to take the lower paying job and keep looking , or hold out for something better .
Several months later , I 've found there is n't anything better .
Maybe in a year or two , a better position will open up , or I 'll see a need for a new product ?
Historically , those are the sorts of things that have helped my career along .
In the mean - time , I 'm watching every dollar like a hawk .
And so are millions of my fellow citizens .
As with all wiki documentation , this page continues to be updated .
The partitioning options require additional testing .
This information will not work for iMac ( 11,1 or newer ) users installing recent versions of Ubuntu ( e.g. , Maverick , Precise , Quantal ... ) , for this you may try this guide Ubuntu 12.10 on 2011 imac .
The presence of the bios - grub partition that the Ubuntu installer creates by default ( e.g. , sda3 ) causes a conflict that prevents syncing the GPT and MBR partition tables .
Deleting sda3 does not help since grub2 requires that bios - grub partition , nor will it use either sda or sda4 aborting with the error : " This GPT partition table has no BIOS boot partition ; embedding wo n't be possible ! " .
So installing Ubuntu with the bios - grub partition fails and installing without it fails .
See " Single - Boot " .
Introduction
Slightly adventurous Intel - based Mac ( " Mactel " ) owners seem to often be afraid or confused about installing Ubuntu alongside OS X , but it is not very difficult .
There are some oddities ( see NOTE ) that make installation on Mactel different from installation on a PC ( but if it were the same , it would n't be a Mac , now would it ? ) .
Guidelines for different configurations are detailed here .
If your computer does not have a CD - ROM drive , such as the Mac Book Air , this document may not have enough information .
See the " Install Ubuntu on MacBook from USB " guide .
In Ubuntu do not try COMPIZ , this will completely mess around Unity and make it necessary to reinstall Ubuntu .
Be aware that it keeps being tricky running Linux on a Macintosh
Note on encrypted disks / partitions
This guide does not mention how to use e.g. diskutility to resize an encrypted mac partition .
BACKUP YOUR DATA
You may laugh now , but when you make a mistake and wipe out your disk , you will be sorry !
Time Machine comes with Leopard , and it is so easy to use that it is n’t funny , so most people have no excuse for not backing up their data .
Better even , a backup to another system , external disk or cloud ( e.g. , Mozy ) are not subject to partition configuration errors .
When Bootcamp fails or you have strange faults maybe you want to clean up your harddrive .
When erasing the hard drive choose " Security Options ... " - " Zero Out Data " .
Single - Boot : Ubuntu Only
It is recommended that you keep an install of OS X , even if you do not plan to use it , so that you can install firmware updates in the future .
( Such updates may be required for your Mac to continue to operate properly . )
One way to avoid using space for OS X on your internal hard drive , is to install it to an external USB or Firewire hard drive ; if a firmware update is released , you can boot from the external drive to upgrade .
Many users would like to make Ubuntu their only operating system .
If this is what you plan to do , there are some changes that you can make to your system that will make its operation closer to that of a PC , avoiding some of the special partition considerations detailed in the other installation situations below .
Intel Macs have an EFI instead of a BIOS as in an ' IBM compatible ' system .
A different partition table scheme , GPT , is used on the hard drive .
You can convert your hard drive partition format with gparted on the Ubuntu LiveCD .
Insert the Ubuntu LiveCD into your Mac and Shutdown .
Restart the Mac and hold the Option Key .
When the boot selector screen comes up , choose to boot from the CD .
Choose you language and and select " Try Ubuntu " .
This wo n't make any changes to your Mac .
Once you get to the Ubuntu desktop , go to System > Administration > Partition Editor gParted will start .
From gParted 's menu , choose Device > Create Partition Table ...
In the Dialog Box that comes up , heed the large , bold warning at the top , and click the " Advanced " triangle to enable the option to create a new partition table format .
Make sure to choose " msdos " for the type of partition table and click " Create " .
Once your disk has been converted there should be no partitions in gParted .
You can create your custom partition layout here or exit gParted and start the Ubuntu Installer and use it 's partitioner to do the dirty work .
Proceed through the install as normal Proceed to the documentation for your specific mac version to configure additional drivers and fix any issues .
Avoid long EFI wait before GRUB
If your Macbook spends 30 seconds with " white screen " before GRUB shows , try booting from your Mac OS X install disc , select language , then click Utilities -> Terminal , and enter :
bless -- device /dev/disk0s1 --setBoot -- legacy
Assuming that the bootloader is on sda1 , otherwise / dev / disk0s2 if it's on sda2 , etc .

Dual - Boot : Mac OSX and Ubuntu
Quick Steps
Install rEFIt and make sure it is working ( you should get a boot chooser on startup ) Use Bootcamp or Disk Utility to create a partition at the end of the disc .
Do n’t worry about what format , just make it the size you want for Ubuntu and your swap partition .
If you you are using OS X Lion which comes with Bootcamp 4.0 you will need to use the Disk Utility .
Boot Camp 4.0 will only allow you to resize if you provide a Windows 7 installation disk .
Boot the Ubuntu desktop CD , and select " Try Ubuntu .
Start the partition editor ( gparted ) under System > Adminstration .
Use gparted to delete the partition you just made in OS X .
It should be the last partition on the disc and follows after the HFS + partition ( OS X ) .
Deleting it will leave an area called unallocated .
This is free space , and exactly what you want .
Use gparted to manually partition the space on your drive for Ubuntu .
First create a SWAP area of about 1GB .
Then the rest of the unallocated area format as EXT4 .
Apply changes and take note the label of the EXT4 partition such as / dev/sda3 .
Start the Ubuntu Installer from the desktop icon .
When prompted , choose to manually partition .
Select the EXT4 partition and click change .
Select to use the space as EXT4 and root ( / ) as the mount point .
You will also want to check the box to format the partition .
Reboot when done with the install , and in the rEFIt menu , choose the partition tool .
It will attempt to sync the partition tables on your disk .
Then SHUTDOWN the computer ( not reboot ) , and start it again .
You should be able to boot to Ubuntu now .
If it seems to freeze on the tux logo , completely shutdown again and try one more time .
Detailed How - To
Installing rEFIt
INSTALL rEFIt !
You do n’t HAVE to use it once you get Ubuntu up and running , but until then , INSTALL rEFIt !
You will need it after installing to sync partitions , once you have done that and Ubuntu works , then you can uninstall it .
You can even burn a rEFIt CD if you prefer .
If you do not see the rEFIt boot menu when starting your Mac on the second reboot ( It takes two reboots to apear after using the package installer ) , it is not installed properly !
Partitioning
The first thing we need to do is repartition your Mac ’s hard drive .
Of course , we would like to do this non-destructively ( without wiping out the partition you have already ) .
With Leopard , this is quite easy as Apple has provided a nifty little tool that will shrink your OSX partition and create a Windows partition in the freed space ( which we can convert to Linux partitions later ) .
BootCamp is probably the easiest way to accomplish what you need .
Leopard ’s DiskUtility can also shrink the OS X partition and add partitions in a single step .
It can not create Linux format partitions though , so if you choose this route , you should create “ free space ” or an “ msdos ” format partition , which can be modified later .
At this point , we are really just allocating the space you want for Ubuntu .
The actual Linux partitions will be created later during the installation .
For pre-Leopard OS X , there are no such tools .
BootCamp does not run , and Disk Utility will only allow you to create more partitions if you wipe out all the current partitions .
However , the underlying commandline utility still exists .
Here 's a usage example .
Let ’s say you want to resize your OS X partition to 200GB and leave the rest of the disk free ( for Ubuntu of course ) .
You would open a terminal and type the following , followed by the " Return " key .
sudo diskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 200G
You can read more on diskutil by typing ' diskutil help ' in your OS X terminal .
The Ubuntu LiveCD
You can download the Ubuntu Desktop Edition ISO from ubuntu.com .
( You can choose 32 - bit or 64 - bit , the choice is yours .
If you want to see the pros and cons , you can check out the sticky . )
NOTE : Core Duo machines ( early Mactels ) are 32 - bit only !
Core 2
Duo machines can use 32 - bit or 64 - bit ISOs .
An ISO is an “ image ” of a CD - ROM .
You do not burn an ISO onto a CD like you do with pictures or music .
Instead , you burn the image onto a disc .
It 's kind of like mixing Cool - Aid .
You do n't just drop the packet ( ISO ) into the water ( disc ) , you must open the packet and dump the contents into the water .
ISO images can be burned with Apple 's Disk Utility or other burning apps .
You should burn the CD as slow as you can to increase its “ bootableness ” .
Boot your Mac from the CD
Put the Ubuntu LiveCD in your Mac and reboot .
When the rEFIt menu comes up You should get the option to boot from the Ubuntu CD .
If you do not see this option , try pressing the Option key when your computer starts .
On a Mac , the " c " key will instruct the Mac to attempt booting off of a CD / DVD .
On the Ubuntu CD ’s boot menu , select your keyboard language , then choose to " Try Ubuntu " .
This will start a LiveCD Ubuntu session , which makes no changes to your Mac .
Booting into Ubuntu this way takes many minutes , including a minutes - long period where Ubuntu appears to have locked up on the boot menu .
Most likely it has not .
Just wait !
note I had to set the boot option to nomodeset .
If you press function f6 at the boot options screen you can choose that option .
Note 2 : I had to press function f6 when I saw a man and keyboard .
Once booted , you have a Ubuntu desktop .
Start gparted ( partitioning tool ) by navigating to System > Adminstration > Partition Editor .
If you previously created an “ msdos ” style partition used Boot Camp , you should use gparted to delete this partition .
It will be located after an EFI partition ( hidden in OSX ) and an HFS + partition ( HFS+ is OS X's filesystem ) .
Deleting the new partition leaves “ free space ” on the disk for the Ubuntu install .
Use gparted to manually partition the space on your drive for Ubuntu .
First create a SWAP area of about 1GB .
Then the rest of the unallocated area format as EXT4 .
Apply changes and take note the label of the EXT4 partition such as / dev/sda3 .
Start Installing
Back on the Ubuntu LiveCD desktop , start the Ubuntu Installer from the desktop icon .
When prompted , choose to manually partition .
Select the EXT4 partition and click change .
Select to use the space as the EXT4 filesystem and root ( / ) as the mount point .
You will also want to check the box to format the partition .
On the last dialog of the installer , be sure to click the “ Advanced ” button and choose to install the boot loader ( grub ) to your root Ubuntu partition , for example / dev/sda3 .
This will be the only partition with the EXT4 file system .
When the installer is finished , reboot .
Fix the Partition Tables
There is a bug in the installer that causes a problem on Macs .
FIXME : Describe problem ?
It can be fixed with rEFIt .
Reboot to the rEFIt menu and select the “ partition tool ” .
rEFIt will ask if you would like to sync your partition tables .
Say
Yes and let it do it ’s magic .
( If you do n't have an English keyboard , note that the keys " Z " and " Y " are swapped in the partition tool . )
If you see the error " GPT partition of type ' Unknown ' found , will not touch this disk " instead of the ' yes ' prompt , follow the instructions in comment # 6 of this thread and make sure to install gptsync_0.13 - 10 or higher .
rEFIt may not offer to sync your partition tables , but just show the error and leave no option but a return to the main menu .
For suggestions on other ways to fix the table , see the discussion at Ubuntu on MacBook Pro - difficulties w partition tables .
if you have errors such as " GPT partition of type ' Unknown ' found , will not touch this disk . " or " analysis inconclusive " as explained in this thread , then you have to use gdisk to rebuild the partition table .
This is best explained in this post - boot a live Ubuntu CD ( the instructions say this is also possible from an OS X terminal ) , install and run the gdisk tool as the instructions say .
After it is done , SHUTDOWN your Mac ( not reboot ) and startup again .
You should now be able to boot into Ubuntu .
If you select the Linux Icon in rEFIt , and it freezes on the grey Tux logo , shutdown again and try one more time .
Other Partitioning Options Multi-booting
Most Intel macs will use the Mac OS X default GPT partitioning scheme .
The MBR / PC - BIOS compatibility of Intel Macs is limited and cannot provide all the disk / BIOS management features found in a PC .
This is the reason why some extra attention is needed for partitioning layouts in Intel Macs to get what you want .
( The alternative msdos / MBR partitioning avoids many of these limitations , but Mac OSX support and utilities are lost , which is why it was recommended only for the single - boot section . )
Additional partitions can be created for installation of an additional OS ( Linux , Windows , BSD ) or shared storage .
Mac OSX can be installed on an external drive , and Linux on an external is possible with the installation of a small boot partition on the HD .
If Windows is installed , rules apply to choice of partition , and this depends on Windows version ( Vista or XP ) .
Some methods used for Vista will not work for XP .
It is not intended to detail all the possible combinations here , but some general rules and examples of multi-booting partition arrangements and tools required are shown to help you choose .
Some of these require extra enthusiasm , and the more complex , the more need for backup .
Triple Boot : Mac OSX , Windows , and Ubuntu
* Note , because this is likely the most popular scenario after dual - booting , it should be the first in the " multi- booting " section and deserves a full write up .

Manual partitioning using Disk Utility GUI
For a complete new installation with partitioning requirements known , it can be easier to set out the partitions initiallly using the Mac OSX installer DVD Disk Utility GUI , then using ubuntu gparted to finish off .
This screen shot shows an example ( OSX 10.4 ) , the OSX partition is p2 , initially unjournalled to allow write access for ubuntu .
The external drive was partitioned the same way .
( This method requires careful choice of partition formats if MS Windows is involved ) .
The following screen shot shows the same partitoning and resizing options as seen in ubuntu desktop gparted .
Mac OSX , Vista , and Ubuntu
This method wo n't work for XP because XP wants to be on the last MBR partition .
Assuming that OS X is installed , use bootcamp to install Windows Vista .
NOTE : MAKE ENOUGH SPACE FOR BOTH WINDOWS AND UBUNTU WITH BOOT CAMP !
Install windows normally .
Start your computer with the Ubuntu disk in the drive .
Install Ubuntu by partitioning the boot camp drive that Windows is located on , and install both Ubuntu and GRUB bootloader onto the new partition .
( There are programs that allow Mac OS X to write to ext2 , you 'll just have to mount your ext3 partition as ext2 in Mac OS X ) Start the computer and boot back into Mac and install rEFIt .
This will allow you to boot into every operating system on boot .

If XP is installed before its partition number changes , then its boot .ini will need editing to change the partition number .
The alternative is to install XP after the OSX partition is split and the XP partition number has changed .
This has not been tested .
Changing " boot.ini " afterwards has been tested though .
Back - up all data using " Time machine " and repair disk permissions .
Make sure you have the currently running OSX installation disk ready and your system is up to date .
Start Boot Camp and create a partition for Windows XP ( 15 Gb is enough but 30 Gb is recommended by MS apparently ) .
install Windows using Boot Camp .
Insert Windows CD and reboot holding C when you hear the beeping sound .
Windows installation should start , follow the usual installation process of Windows .

Choose to install the boot loader ( grub ) to your root Ubuntu partition , this is the EXT4 partition , here " / dev/sda3 " .
Let it install Ubuntu .
Get back to MacOS , install rEFIt , reboot and run the partition manager of rEFIt , which should take care of every detail of booting for each OS .
If XP was installed before the partition change , it will need boot .ini to be edited to change its partition from 3 to 4 .

Shared storage partitons
To share your home directory between OSX and ubuntu you need to use hfsplus with journaling turned off .
R/W of hfsplus is experimental on ubuntu as far as I know and ymmv I have been succesfully doing this on my G4 and now on an intel macbook pro , with some problems but no data loss so far .
problems
you cannot hibernate the system in e.g. ubuntu and then boot OSX , you will corrupt data this way .
If you have an unclean unmount , because suspend to ram fails on an empty battery or any other reason , ubuntu wo n't mount the disk in RW before a lengthy fsck .
hfsplus ( 30 minutes )
recently I noticed that bot OSX and ubuntu have to go through this filecheck everytime I boot the other system .
share that partition
disable journaling in OSX
boot ubuntu , do n't log in , open a terminal ( CTRL - ALT -F3 )
add an entry in /etc / fstab
/ dev/sda2 / media / Mac hfsplus user , force , rw , nodev 0 0
change uid to match that of OSX ( google it I forgot how to do it )
rename your old homedir
make a symlink in your / home to your Mac / Users :
sudo ln -s / media / Mac/Users/yourusername /home/yourusername

Other Info
Multiple Hard Drives ( Mac Pro )
The basic single and dual system partitioning , tools , and installation method have been described above for a single , internal hard disk .
Macs with multiple disks have the additional simple option of separate disk for each OS ( with some traps such as refit being limited to gptsync the first disk ) .
Some information on this can be found on the Mac Pro page
GRUB2 / GRUB_EFI
Some Intel macs can use the EFI version of the grub bootloader ( AKA GRUB2 or grub - efi ) which enables external booting similar to the Mac OSX EFI bootloader .
Example Ubuntu Installation after Mac OSX and Vista
You have already installed Mac OSX and Windows Vista , now to install Ubuntu .
Startup your laptop with Ubuntu Desktop CD inserted into the drive .
In rEFIt menu , choose to boot the Ubuntu CD .
Select English as the language to be used .
Select the 2nd option , the one that says : " Install Ubuntu " After the loading , on the install screen , select the O.S. Language ( English ) and hit " Forward " button , then select your country location .
On the Keyboard layout , choose your keyboard language , and on the other window select the variant Macintosh ( mine is Portugal - Macintosh ) , and test the typing if you want .
On the " Prepare Disk Space " menu , select the 1st option : " Guided - Resize SCSI3 ( 0,1,0 ) , Partition # 3 ( sda ) and use Free Space " , and with your mouse select the desired partition size ( I set mine to 80 % Windows Vista & 20 % Ubuntu ) , and hit " Forward " button .
On " Migrate Documents and Settings " menu , just hit " Forward " .
On " Ready to Install " menu , select " Advanced ... " and select to install Grub boot loader to the last partition " / dev/sda4 " and hit " OK " button , and then hit " Install " button to begin the installation process .
After the installation has finished , hit " Restart Now " button , it will exit the installer and eject your CDROM , then press " Enter " key to restart .
Use the refit Partitioning Tool to re sync the MBR , then restart again , select the Linux icon on rEFIt to boot into Ubuntu .
Troubleshooting
In case you are stuck with a " No bootable device " message or a blank screen , a bug prevents booting after a successful install ( a blank screen or blinking cursor )
See information on the forum here to fix it .
If you did not install rEFIt , hold down Alt / Option to choose whether to boot into OS X / Ubuntu .
The Boot Camp - installed boot menu will recognize the Ubuntu installation as " Windows , " but will boot Ubuntu normally regardless Grub can not be installed on an XFS partition .
If you want to use XFS for your root partition , create a separate boot partition with ext2 or ext3 and install grub on that partition .
If you are attempting to triple boot ( OSX , WIN7 using bootcamp and now adding Ubuntu ) you probebly installed rEFIT .
rEFIt version 0.14 has a built in limitation that messes up the Hybrid MBR that bootcamp set up , so now either booting into windows does n't work or choosing Ubuntu in GRUB always boots into windows ( depends on how you partitiond your HD ) .
So go here or here for detailed explenation , the solution on both is the same .

The train spotters who are being treated like terrorists
Police are using draconian anti-terrorism powers against trainspotters , it has emerged .
Enthusiasts innocently taking photographs of carriages and noting serial numbers have been accused of behaving like a reconnaissance unit for a terror cell .
The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2000 has been used to stop a staggering 62,584 people at railway stations .
Another 87,000 were questioned under separate ' stop and search ' and ' stop and account ' legislation .
This photograph from 1960 shows young trainspotters recording train details at St Pancras station .
But today they could find themselves on the wrong side of the Prevention of Terrorism Act
The figures were uncovered by Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Norman Baker , who warned that Britain was sliding towards a ' police state ' .
The revelation will increase concern that the controversial anti-terror powers are being used ' disproportionately ' .
Police have already employed them to suppress protests against the Government .
Mr Baker said : ' While it is important to be vigilant about the threat of terrorism to the transport network , the sheer scale of the number of people stopped by police on railway property is ridiculous .
' Law - abiding passengers get enough hassle on overcrowded trains as it is without the added inconvenience of over - zealous policing .
' The anti-terror laws allow officers to stop people for taking photographs and I know this has led to innocent trainspotters being stopped .
' This is an abuse of anti-terrorism powers and a worrying sign that we are sliding towards a police state .
' Trainspotting may be an activity of limited , and indeed questionable , appeal , but it is not a criminal offence and it is not a terrorist threat . '
Rail enthusiasts have been accused of behaving like reconnaissance agents for a terror cell
The ' Section 44 ' power has been used to stifle a number of protests against the Government .
In 2005 , it was deployed against 82 - year - old Walter Wolfgang when he made an anti-war protest during the Labour Party conference .
The legislation gives police the power to search any individual in any area designated by the Home Secretary to help protect against acts of terrorism .
There does not even need to be any reasonable grounds of suspicion that a crime is about to take place .
British Transport Police were unable to give specific figures for the numbers of railway enthusiasts stopped under these powers .
But in a letter to Mr Baker , the force 's Chief Constable , Ian Johnston , said : ' There is clear guidance available to officers ( and railway enthusiasts ) , and this has been reissued on a number of occasions over the last couple of months in response to the increased concern among some railway enthusiasts ' .
Last October , the Daily Mail reported how a schoolboy was held as a terror suspect for taking photographs of a railway station during a school geography field trip .
Fabian Sabbara , 15 , was dressed in the uniform of Rutlish High School in Merton , South London , when he was stopped at nearby Wimbledon station by three police community support officers .
PCSO Barry Reeve told Fabian , from nearby Cheam , to sign forms under Section 44 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act .
The teenager was forced to comply or face arrest .

A powerful digital certificate that can be used to forge the identity of any website on the internet is in the hands of in international band of security researchers , thanks to a sophisticated attack on the ailing MD5 hash algorithm , a slip - up by Verisign , and about 200 PlayStation 3s .
" We can impersonate Amazon.com and you wo n't notice , " says David Molnar , a computer science PhD candidate at UC Berkeley .
" The padlock will be there and everything will look like it's a perfectly ordinary certificate . "
The security researchers from the U.S. , Switzerland and the Netherlands planned to detail their technique Tuesday , at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin .
At issue is the crypto technology used to ensure visitors to Amazon.com , for example , are actually connected to the online retailer and not to a fake site erected by a fraudster .
That assurance comes from a digital certificate that 's vouched for and digitally signed by a trusted authority like Verisign .
The certificate is transmitted to a user 's browser and automatically verified during SSL connections – the high - security web links heralded by a locked - padlock icon in the browser .
Key to the signing process is a so - called hash function – an algorithm that turns a digital file into a small fingerprint of a fixed size .
To prevent forgery , the hash function must make it practically impossible for anyone to create two files that will boil down to the same hash .
In 2004 and 2007 , cryptographers published research showing that the once - common MD5 hash function suffers weaknesses that could allow attackers to create these " collisions . "
Since then , most certificate authorities have moved to more secure hashes .
But in an automated survey earlier this year , the researchers presenting in Berlin say they discovered a weak link at Verisign - owned RapidSSL , which was still signing certificates using MD5 .
Out of 38,000 website certificates the team collected , 9,485 were signed using MD5 , and 97 % of those were issued by RapidSSL .
That 's when they hit the company with the first real - world version of the attack .
They say they submitted a certificate for their own website to RapidSSL for signing .
Then they successfully modified the resulting signed certificate to turn it into a vastly more powerful " CA certificate , " stealing RapidSSL 's authority to sign and verify certificates for any other site on the internet .
In theory , hackers could use such an attack in combination with a DNS attack to erect perfect counterfeit banking and e-commerce sites .
In practice , though , it 's unlikely real bad guys will ever use it .
The work required substantial brain and computing power , and the fix is simple : Verisign , and the handful of smaller certificate authorities found using MD5 , could simply upgrade to a more secure hash function , and instantly close the loophole .
" We do n't believe anybody will reproduce our attack before the certificate authority has fixed it , " says Molnar .
Tim Callan , vice president of product marketing for Verisign , defends the company 's use of MD5 .
He says Verisign has been in the process of phasing out the hoary hash function in a controlled manner , and already planned to stop using it for new certificates in January .
" The RapidSSL certificates are currently using the MD5 hash function today , " he concedes .
" And the reason for that is because when you 're dealing with widespread technology and [ public key infrastructure ] technology , you have phase - in and phase - out processes that can take significant periods of time to implement . "
" All the information that we have is that MD5 is not any kind of significant or meaningful risk today , " Callan adds .
But the new exploit seems to undermine that position .
The researchers say they implemented an attack laid out theoretically in a published paper last year .
To pull off their substitution , the researchers had to generate a CA certificate and a website certificate that would produce the same MD5 hash – otherwise the digital signature would n't match the modified certificate .
The effort was complicated by two variables in the signed certificate that they could n't control : the serial number and the validity period .
But those proved predicable in RapidSSL 's automated signing system .
To do the actual math of finding the MD5 collision , they used the " PlayStation Lab , " a research cluster of about 200 PlayStation 3s wired together at the EPFL in Lausanne , Switzerland .
Using the powerful processors , they were able to crunch out their forgery in about three days .
" We had to come up with some new math and some operational things that were not previously known , " says Molnar .
The other researchers were Alexander Sotirov ; Jacob Appelbaum ; Dag Arne Osvik ; as well as Benne de Weger , Arjen Lenstra and Marc Stevens , who wrote the 2007 paper ( . pdf ) that first described the precise mathematics of the attack .
Molnar says that the team pre-briefed browser makers , including Microsoft and the Mozilla Foundation , on their exploit .
But the researchers put them under NDA , for fear that if word got out about their efforts , legal pressure would be brought to bear to suppress their planned talk in Berlin .
Molnar says Microsoft warned Verisign that the company should stop using MD5 .
Callan confirms Versign was contacted by Microsoft , but he says the NDA prevented the software - maker from providing any meaningful details on the threat .
" We 're a little frustrated at Verisign that we seem to be the only people not briefed on this , " he says .
The researchers expect that their forged CA certificate will be revoked by Verisign following their talk , rendering it powerless .
As a precaution , they set the expiration date on the certificate to August 2004 , ensuring that any website validated through the bogus certificate would generate a warning message in a user 's browser .
The National Institute of Standards and Technology is currently holding a competition to replace the current standard family of cryptographic hash function , called SHA for Secure Hash Algorithm .
SHA replaced MD5 as the U.S. national standard in 1993 .
Update : December 30 , 2008 | 5:45:00 PM
Verisign says it 's stopped using MD5 , as of around noon Pacific time .
" We 're disappointed that these researchers did not share their results with us earlier , " writes Tim Callan , " but we 're happy to report that we have completely mitigated this attack . "

China has confirmed itself as the ' king of counterfeiters ' with the building of a new shopping centre dedicated to fake brands .
Some of the brand impostors at the mall in Nanjing , east of Shanghai , include a McDonalds look - a- like burger bar called McDnoald ’s , a Starbucks - style coffee shop called Bucksstar Coffee , and a wannabe Pizza Hut called Pizza Huh .
City bosses are under pressure to ban the soon - to - be opened mall after pictures of the fake stores were leaked , causing uproar amongst angry consumers who feared they'd be ripped off .
" Not every shopper is brand conscious so a lot of people will walk into these stores thinking they are getting the real thing , " said an angry shopper in a local newspaper .
" The whole idea of this mall is plain dishonest .
" Some fakes are done light - heartedly to be funny , but these stores look so much like the real thing people are going to feel cheated , " the shopper added .
This may be the first ‘ fakes only ’ mall but copycat brands are rife around the world :

Open Letter to Richard Stallman
Posted 4 Nov 2008 at 21:52 UTC by cdfrey
Dear Mr. Stallman , I am writing to express my disappointment with the Free Software Foundation regarding the recent release of the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3 .
The new version 1.3 adds a new clause , section 11 , which , according to the FAQ , allows wiki sites to relicense specific content from GFDL 1.3 to CC - BY - SA 3.0 , for content added before November 1 , 2008 .
They have this relicensing option until August 1 , 2009 .
This , in my view , is a serious moral mistake and breach of trust .
Even if this new clause does no harm , it is still the wrong thing to do .
Many years ago , I read criticisms about the recommended way of applying the GNU GPL license to software .
People criticized the common phrasing " version 2 of the License , or ( at your option ) any later version , " saying that this gave the FSF too much power , and was basically writing a blank cheque to possible future abuse of one 's work .
This criticism began to hold less weight for me when I witnessed the extreme care and meticulous and open process of writing the new GPL version 3 .
All comments were logged and processed in a website in an extremely open fashion .
The process was long and cautious , balancing the opinions of users of the license with the commitment to Free Software .
It was a thing of beauty .
I started to see the benefits of having an open ended license .
I saw the direction that the FSF took .
They did not loosen the grip on Free Software principles , they tightened it .
And since only the FSF could change the GPL , and given their trustworthy method used to update it , it seemed like a worthy place to put my trust .
Unfortunately , this seemingly hasty change to the GFDL undoes all that .
Not only does it violate the assumption that the author of the work decides what license to use , it adds another party to the equation .
Not only can the FSF now change the terms of the GFDL , the Creative Commons Corporation can now change the terms that some older GFDL work is licensed under .
Fortunately this only lasts until August 1 , 2009 .
But old GFDL wiki content is basically dual licensed now .
Perhaps I was living under a legal rock , but I also did n't see any announcement for public input to this revision .
If I did miss it , I regret not being able to give my feedback earlier in the process .
If the input cycle was shorter or non-existent , this is a flaw in the update process of the GFDL , which I hope the FSF will fix .
In practical terms , the relicensing is not that big a deal .
The restrictions on what can be relicensed are good , and it is basically swapping one set of legal boilerplate for another that does the same thing .
Some authors may have specifically chosen the GFDL over CC - BY - SA , for various reasons , one of them being the fact that the license had to be copied along with the work .
This part of the GFDL is both a feature and a bug .
But this specific choice , which was previously up to the author , is now gone .
In the greater scheme of things , very little harm is probably done .
Indeed , many have hailed this change as a great improvement .
I suspect that the most harm is simply done to the FSF 's reputation .
The problem is the message this sends to users of other FSF licenses .
Can we trust the FSF not to allow relicensing of our works , to non-FSF licenses , if we use the " future version " clause ?
In the past , I would have been confident that this was the case .
Now I 'm not so sure .
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this , and if you like , I will post your reply verbatim in the same places I post my letter .
Thank you for your time .
Sincerely , Chris Frey
missing the point , posted 5 Nov 2008 at 00:41 UTC by jbuck » ( Master )
The GFDL is widely considered a flawed license , and I doubt if you will be able to find actual copyright holders that used that license but that have a moral objection to CC - BY - SA .
In fact , many contributors to GFDL documents object to the GFDL , but are pretty much forced to use it because they contribute to GNU projects .
If anything , most of us were hoping for more changes , not fewer changes .
We still have the invariant sections issue and the flawed DRM language ( which would appear to be make " chmod 600 gfdl_doc.pdf " illegal on a multi-user system ) .
Copyright holders who care about the legal details can specify a specific version number ; those who care only that a work be free usually do n't care about those details and are unlikely to care about the distinctions between GFDL with no invariant sections , and CC - BY - SA .
practical vs. principle , posted 5 Nov 2008 at 07:39 UTC by cdfrey » ( Journeyer )
I agree that in a practical sense , little has changed , and in many cases CC - BY - SA is preferable .
My concern was that this sets a bad precedent by allowing licensing control to pass from FSF to some other organization .
I 'm not slamming the Creative Commons Corp here , but the trust that people put into the " any later version " clause is directed at the FSF .
I do n't think that trust should be taken lightly .
Lack of trust in the FSF regarding this clause causes things like the Linux kernel to be GPL v2 only .
The FSF and the GNU project have historically been very strict about these things , requiring transfer of copyright , etc .
This is why I 'm surprised and disappointed about the change .
I would think more people support this move , a surprise on RMS 's part because he is not a big egomaniac like some would think .
... which says that the license counts also as being cross-licensed with any later version , is to allow the FSF to deal with problems with earlier versions by changing the terms of the license .
To use a license with such a term means that you are placing trust in the FSF to do the right thing .
What obligations does the FSF have ?
Not to never surprise any user of the GFDL , but act in some particular concept of the best aggregate interest of all parties who use the license .
This is a tricky concept , but it is clear that it's not enough to complain about vague principles being violated , for the FSF to have fallen short of their responsibilities they must have failed to take into account actual harm to the interests of the license users .
As an author , through Wikipedia , of GFDL text , I 'd like to have heard of this change before reading this article , and , like cdfrey , it bothers me a little that I have n't .
But the reasons I wrote that content are definitely furthered by the change , and I do n't know of any concrete harm this does , so I 'm not really all that bothered .
If you do n't trust the FSF , but for some strange reason think version 1.2 is almost exactly the right license , it is possible to adjust the license by deleting section 10 .
trust , posted 10 Nov 2008 at 09:47 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
i raised this issue several years ago .
there is no clause in the GPL that says " future licenses will NOT EVER have the clause removed that makes future GPL licenses be truly free software " .
there was , at the time , some confusion about this , because , if such a clause is ever removed , it 's not _that_ license that you have to worry about , it 's the one AFTER it .
first remove the protection mechanism and _then_ you have carte - blanche .
it was the same thing with hitler 's 1936 " enabling act " , and it was nearly the same thing with the UK " legislative and reform bill " which got through to its second reading - unnoticed - before anyone realised the similarities to the nazis method of legally introducing dictatorship into germany .
Re : trust , posted 18 Nov 2008 at 15:31 UTC by abraham » ( Master )
Despite his comparison to Hitler , which usually helps improve the discussing , I 'm not quite sure what lkcl is talking about .
But if it the power granted the the FSF by the " any later option " choice , I 'd like to point out that this power is severely restricted by thousands of signed contracts with people who have donated software to the FSF .
Each contract stipulates restrictions in what FSF can do with the code , and since the code is usually covered by the GPL , is also means there are restrictions in what the FSF can do with the GPL .

This is copied from a thread on the KWLUG mailing list , by request , to provide any further clarification to those stumbling across this web document in the future .

I do n't understand the ramifications of this at all .
What has happened > with this license that cause the open letter ?
( I was not even aware > there was an gpl for documents , I assumed gpl was enough ) .
Hi Chris ,
As I understand the history of the GFDL , people came to the conclusion that the regular GPL was less than ideal for documentation .
( Things like software manuals , books , articles , creative works . )
And so a new license was written by the FSF to handle this .
The result was the GNU Free Documentation License .
I believe this was one of the first licenses of its kind .
If you read the license , you 'll find it is very complicated , and tries to deal with every possibility .
So , for example , say you 're writing a manual for your GPL software FooBarter .
You might write an introduction to your manual that explains your philosophy or reasons for writing the software , or the history behind it , perhaps including credits of people who inspired you or original research you did .
And then afterward would be the usual technical and user documentation on how to use the software .
The GFDL has language in it that supports breaking your document into sections .
You may want to keep your introduction intact , and while letting everyone freely distribute it , you do not want edits to it , because it is your creative and philosophical vision .
But the rest of the manual changes with your software , and should be free to change by the community , and should be open to patches just like the rest of the code .
So these features of the license are what make the GFDL so complicated and useful in certain contexts .
The GFDL was also written with the goal of allowing and promoting paper publications of such works .
The license requires that you include the license text with republication of the work .
From a GPL perspective , this makes sense , since GPL software nearly always comes with the text of the GPL license included .
A GFDL book might as well have the license in the back as well , to promote the knowledge of the freedom of the text .
Well , the world has changed and the Creative Commons school of thought has come into being .
These licenses are designed to be more plug - and - play .
They do a few things , and do them well , and while they do n't permit as much flexibility in the same way as the GFDL , they are simpler , easier to understand , and therefore have spread like wildfire .
This is a Good Thing ( TM ) .
Unfortunately , Wikipedia was created in that limbo time , around the time of the GFDL but before the time of the Creative Commons , and so all of Wikipedia 's work was licensed under the GFDL .
As time went on , the Wikipedia community started to lust after the free - wheeling nature of the Creative Commons community .
In fact , if you ever tried to contribute a photo to Wikipedia , you would run into much encouragement to licsense your work under a Creative Commons license , because it let people reuse your work without pinning a 3 page GFDL to the back of each photo .
But the main body of text in Wikipedia was stuck under the GFDL .
Normally when this happens in a Free Software project , and the current developers decide to relicense software that has multiple copyright holders , they go through the CVS / whatever history and try to contact every major contributor , and ask specificially whether it 's ok .
If they get enough affirmative answers , they can change the license of the code , rewrite any small parts that they did n't get permission for , and continue on with life .
If they do n't get permission , they can't relicense .
Also , the effort to do a proper relicensing job is rather substantial , so it is not done for trivial reasons .
This natural inertia against relicensing is also a Good Thing ( TM ) , in my opinion .
Well , the GFDL can be used in the usual recommended way that the Free Software Foundation recommends all their licenses be used : i.e. you can license your work under version X.Y of their license , or any later version .
This is commonly done in the GPL world , and was done in the Wikipedia case .
The choice of this style of licensing is of course up to the author of the software , manual , book , photo , etc .
Not all projects use this clause .
The linux kernel , for example , uses only version 2 of the GPL , and so cannot easily switch to the new version 3 .
The implicit promise is that if you trust the FSF , then you can trust that any future license that they release will remain true to the original principles that the current license you are now using espouses .
If you agree with the principles , and trust the FSF to stick to them for future details , you use the extra clause , which gives you added flexibility and possibly protection from future threats , such as new legal landscapes , bugs in old versions of the license , etc .
Generally , the " any later version " clause is also a Good Thing ( TM ) , although many people disagree .
The problem I had , was that the FSF chose to make use of the " any later version " clause to allow a change of licenses from the GFDL to one of the Creative Commons licenses .
In practical terms , this changes very little , except that it is much easier to reuse Wikipedia content ( or any Wiki content that matches this new GFDL license change ) .
In idealistic terms , it sets a bad precedent , in my opinion , where FSF has given control of future licenses away to another organization , the Creative Commons Corp , and now people who chose to accept the " any later version " clause for their works now have to trust both the FSF and the Creative Commons .
Again , practically , this is n't a big deal .
But you can imagine the uproar if version 4 of the GPL allowed a transfer of license from GPL to BSD .
This is highly unlikely to happen , but it is the sort of change that I believe should be left to the existing method ... the one with the extremely hard work , the one that needs the author 's approval .
Technically , the authors have already given their approval , by using the " any later version " clause .
The problem is that they thought they were allowing any later version of the GFDL , not any later version of the Creative Commons license .
In my opinion , it is a betrayal of trust , and hence warranted an open letter to Richard Stallman .
Unfortunately , I have n't heard back from him yet .
I hope he 's just been very busy , and will reply eventually .
I hope that clarifies things .

I can see your point .
Yes , pretty much .
I should point out that I 'm in the minority here .
Which would put Richard Stallman in the majority for once . :-)
The actual change is very little .
The new GFDL allows switching only for a limited time , and only documents that have no invariant sections , to be transferred to a Creative Commons license that has the Share - Alike clause .
So the " viral " ( for lack of a better word ) nature of the GPL family of licenses is still intact .
To give the FSF credit , they were fairly careful with the change , and I would have been happier if they would have specified a specific version of the Creative Commons license , instead of using the " any later version " there too .
That would have kept the FSF in the loop , and at least maintained that link of trust that I believe is implied by the " any later version " clause .
In any case , the Wikipedia folks are happy , as well as many others .
The GFDL seems to get a bad rap these days .
I have n't worked with it very much myself , so I do n't see its flaws first hand .
Even Debian considers it a poor license .
So I do see that there are numerous practical advantages , I just wish those advantages were achieved differently .

contract implications , posted 20 Nov 2008 at 11:14 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
Each contract stipulates restrictions in what FSF can do with the code , and since the code is usually covered by the GPL , is also means there are restrictions in what the FSF can do with the GPL .
are you _sure_ about that ?
what has each and every individual piece of code _explicitly_ got to do with the specific and completely separate issue of being responsible for writing up the GPL license ?
is it _explicitly_ written into the contracts that the FSF * must * keep the GPL " invoilate " and in accordance with the current ethics ( which we accept and believe in ) just because some code _happened_ to be released under that license ?
it's by a series of steps of " omission " , in subsequent generations of the license , that the GPL _could_ be eroded .
the comparison to the situation with _not only_ the " enabling act " of 1936 _but also_ a much more recent ( 2006 i think it was ) near - identical law in the United Kingdom ( the " legislative and reform bill " ) serves as a reminder that it 's perfectly possible to slip in " progressions " in undermining of the status quo .
Again , practically , this is n't a big deal .
But you can imagine the uproar if version 4 of the GPL allowed a transfer of license from GPL to BSD .
This is highly unlikely to happen , but it is the sort of change that I believe should be left to the existing method ... the one with the extremely hard work , the one that needs the author 's approval .
LOOK !!!
_look_ at what 's being said here .
" CAN YOU IMAGINE IF V4 GPL ALLOWED A TRANSFER OF LICENSE FROM GPL TO BSD " .
is _that_ explicitly disallowed in the * current * GPL ??? is there _anything_ in the GPL that says " future versions of the GPL will ALWAYS be similar in spirit _to_ the current GPL , and this statement - this very statement , this very clause , here being said RIGHT now - will NEVER be removed " .
this is the kind of language that NEEDS to go into the GPL to ensure that it never ever gets " taken over " .
" degraded " .
and , if it can be done to the GFDL , then , conceivably , it can be " considered reasonable " to be done to the GPL , as well .
GPL to BSD , posted 20 Nov 2008 at 16:49 UTC by cdfrey » ( Journeyer )
lkcl , Technically , there is nothing stopping FSF from making such a change , even though I consider it highly unlikely .
The thing that lets people think that the " any later version " clause is appropriate is their trust in the FSF , and let me be clear , it is only this trust that has taken any hit , in my opinion , and _not_ the practical effects of the licenses .
and , if it can be done to the GFDL , then , conceivably , it can be " considered reasonable " to be done to the GPL , as well .
The recent change in the GFDL is not nearly as wild as a GPL -> BSD license would be .
( I used that as an explanatory " shock and awe " example . )
The core principles are indeed being preserved in the GFDL case , it 's just the details around those principles that are changing .
And while you and I agree that those details are important , the sky has n't fallen .
Yet . :-)
I just wanted to clarify that .
Copyright assignment contracts , posted 20 Nov 2008 at 16:52 UTC by cdfrey » ( Journeyer )
I 'd love to see the text of one of these contracts , but as far as I understood abraham 's post , it sounds like the FSF has their own self - interest locked up in these contracts , such that if they made core changes to the GPL , they may be ripping the rug out from under themselves , and losing access to the code they supposedly control .
And if so , this is a beautiful thing . :-)
For licensed files , instead of : " ... the Free Software Foundation , either version 2 of the License , or ( at your option ) any later version . "
A note more like : " the Free Software Foundation , or ( at your option ) the latest version currently published , provided that version includes all the same restrictions as this version and the latest version does not allow any change of license . "
In effect , giving the FSF the ability to revoke new versions of the license at any time ( other than the originally licensed version ) , since they will no longer be the latest version .
And the verbiage itself can never be changed , except with approval by all copyright owners .
does n't work , posted 22 Nov 2008 at 20:00 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
the point of the future - proofing is to allow the GPL to be updated to deal with unforseen circumstances .
the BSD licenses were created at a time when people were trusted to contribute code back .
corporate greed broke that trust .
standing out in particular : apple ( BSD kernel ) , microsoft ( BSD tcp / ip stack - _twice_ - once in winsock and when they screwed that up , the second time was in MSRPC using raw sockets ) .
the GPL licenses were believed to deal with that , but again , corporate greed found a way , using the DMCA as a * legally * required threat ( oh , our hands are tied : we have to _by law_ add DRM , sorry ) .
so the GPL had to be updated _again_ .
so - yes , the FSF must be given the freedom to make changes it sees fit , but also it should be restricted in its freedom to act _against_ the spirit of what the FSF stands for .
just in case .
Future proofing , posted 22 Nov 2008 at 22:13 UTC by Mysidia » ( Journeyer )
I think the real reason for allowing distribution under the terms of future versions is for compatibility ; so situations do n't begin to develop where you can't make a work derived from both a GPL v2 product and a GPLv3 product , because the licenses are incompatible and neither can be satisfied .
The author of the software still has to change " version 2 ( or at your option ) any later version " to actually read the " version 3 ( or at your option ) .
Until that happens , none of version 3's protections are imposed against new licensees .
And even the new licensee , who forks the project and distributes under GPLv3 , cannot necessarily change the option , since the license is always conferred from the original licensee with the option of version 2 , until _that_ party has actually changed the minimum applicable version for every single file in their software package .
So it makes sense that there should be some restrictions on what type of changes new versions can introduce and " automatically " be used .
lkcl : the FSF ... should be restricted in its freedom to act _against_ the spirit of what the FSF stands for .
How is this to work , exactly ?
To me it seems that the right thing is not to restrict the FSF 's legal rights over updating its licenses , but to improve the quality of its democratic processes .
The kind of thing that slef talks about from time to time .
A bit of diversity would n't hurt .
We could have several different GPLs , or whatever , backed by different free software bodies , who each have the right of updating for their branch of the GPL ...
Richard Stallman 's reply , posted 6 Feb 2009 at 02:15 UTC by cdfrey » ( Journeyer )
Richard Stallman responded back on Dec 3 2008 , and I only noticed now .
Thanks to mattl for posting the latest Free Software Supporter article where I found it .
Richard Stallman 's response can be found on the FSF blog here .
Some of you know I worked at Microsoft years ago ( ’94 - ’03 ) as what they call a program manager .
In any other company the job would be known as team lead or project manager , and it was an awesome job .
When I was hired 1994 there was a cult around the role .
Program Managers had a reputation for being people worthy of being afraid of for one reason : they knew how to get things done .
If you got in their way , they would smile .
And then eat you .
They drove , led , ran , persuaded , hunted , fought and stuck their necks out for their teams with an intensity most people could n’t match .
The sort of people who eliminated all bullshit within a 10 foot radius of their presence .
How to be this way , and do it without being an asshole , was one of the things I tried to capture in my book , Making things happen .
All teams need at least one leader who has this kind of passion and talent regardless of where you work or what you ’re working on .
But that cult has faded .
I have many friends and a few clients at Microsoft , and talk with more through email and on the pmclinic discussion list , and I ’m convinced true PMs are a dying breed .
I suspect they were a dying breed before I started at the company and I was just lucky to be hired into a pocket still running strong .
Group managers like Joe Belfiore , Hadi Partovi , Hillel Cooperman , and Chris Jones all created a landscape for PMs like me to drive and lead their teams , and made it possible for us to do a lot of good for our teams that no other role could do .
One change is the enormous growth of Microsoft since I was hired .
I started in ’ 94 as employee # 14,000 something , and now there are nearly 90,000 .
Bureaucracy , overhead and dead weight collect in big successful companies and Microsoft is no different .
This makes it much harder to consolidate the kind of power a PM needs to behave the way I described above .
The PM role has been stretched so thin there are PMs for everything , and if ever a position needs to be created that is n’t quite a marketing , programmer or tester position , but is n’t a leadership or management role , the PM label gets used anyway .
Somehow it ’s a crime for there to be more than 10 job titles at a company .
I ’m not sure why .
In many cases teams have so many PMs , and authority is so loosely distributed , than would should be simple decisions require a meeting of 8 or 10 or 15 people .
Cycles of meetings on the theme of “ are you ok with this ?
How about you ?
And you ? ”
As if everyone deserves a vote on every decision .
This kills momentum and wastes the value of what PMs can do .
And as this goes on for years , with larger and larger staffs , no one knows what it ’s like to have a clear , fast process for making basic decisions .
Few remember what it feels like to be on team that has synergy , clarity , trust and focus , eliminating the need for hand - holding , triple level reconfirmations , and spending hours every week un-reversing decisions that should never have been reversed in the first place .
I hear from PMs who I suspect no longer recognize 3 hour meetings that are 100 % guaranteed to be a complete waste of time , because many of their meetings are complete wastes of time .
By the same token , I know PMs who work on teams that are entirely out of control , and failing in the marketplace , who think it ’s normal for a team to be entirely out of control and failing in the marketplace .
They ’ve never seen anything else .
And sadly in some cases , neither have their bosses , or ( gulp ) their VPs .
They believe a PM is supposed to feel , much of the time , useless , ignored , and in the way .
Instead of realizing that those feelings come from their failure , and the group managers failure to enable them , to do what the role was designed for .
I gave a lecture at Microsoft before I left in ’03 titled
The problem with program managers that outlined many of these problems and what can be done to avoid them .
All management roles run the risk of being wastes of space , and project management roles are no different .
And if there ’s interest I ’ll pull some of those nuggets out into future blog posts .
But are there still surviving pockets of old school PMs ?
If so , I ’d love to hear from you , at Microsoft or elsewhere .
We thought it would be interesting to extend our Survival animation backwards in time .
With some help by the ONS Centre for Demography we 've been able to go back roughly to 1845 .
You can access the Early Life Tables online here .
There is a little difficulty in placing the very early tables on the time line , since they cover overlapping periods , but we 've done our best to make some sense of them .
You might find it interesting to enter your own age in the animation and see what your survival prospects were in 1845 !

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq will deny a license to Blackwater Worldwide , the private security firm accused of killing Iraqi civilians while protecting U.S. diplomats , U.S. and Iraqi officials said on Thursday .
“ The operating permission for the firm Blackwater will not be renewed .
Its chance is zero , ” said Alaa al - Taie , head of the press department at Iraq ’s Interior Ministry .
“ It is not acceptable to Iraqis and there are legal points against it , like killing Iraqis with their weapons . ”
Blackwater employs hundreds of heavily armed guards with a fleet of armored vehicles and helicopters to protect U.S. diplomats in Iraq under a State Department contract .
It boasts that no American has been killed while under its protection .
Iraqi officials have expressed anger with the firm since a September 2007 shooting in which Blackwater guards opened fire in traffic , killing at least 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians .
One Blackwater guard has pleaded guilty in U.S. court to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter over that incident .
Five others are awaiting trial next year on manslaughter charges .
The firm denies wrongdoing .
A U.S. embassy official confirmed that the embassy had been informed that the license would not be renewed , and said it was working on finding a new arrangement to cover its security .
“ We do n’t have specifics about dates .
We are working with the government of Iraq and our contractors to address the implications of this decision , ” the official said .
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said the firm had followed the proper procedures to apply for a license and had not been told by the Iraqi or U.S. governments of the outcome .
“ Blackwater has always said that we will continue the important work of protecting U.S. government officials in Iraq for as long as our customer asks us to do so , and in accordance with Iraqi law .
That has not changed , ” she said in an e-mail .
The presence of security contractors , often as heavily armed as the military itself , has been a signature feature of the war in Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion .
The U.S. occupation authorities granted contractors immunity from Iraqi law , an edict that remained in place until the beginning of this year .
Private security licenses must be renewed every six months .
Blackwater in particular was a target of Iraqi anger even before the 2007 shooting , because of its sheer size , high profile and aggressive posture on the streets .
Iraq ’s Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki branded the 2007 shooting incident a “ massacre ” and complained when the U.S. State Department subsequently renewed Blackwater ’s contract .
Lawrence Peter , director of the Private Security Company Association of Iraq , whose members include Blackwater , said any replacement would need time to gear up for such a big job .
“ With sufficient lead time , any capabilities can be replaced , ” he said .
“ If they want to switch the security provider to another company or the U.S. military , there will need to be a sufficient period for mobilization involved . ”

" Joe the Plumber " is going to war !
Some website is paying him to go to Israel and talk about things he knows nothing about , specifically everything .
We were so close to being rid of him !
Joe the Plumber , whose name is not Joe and who is not a plumber , is a dumb Clinton - era parody of an " angry white man " convinced of various falsehoods and given to repeating them loudly to whoever will listen .
For a time , last October , television cameras were the ones listening , and Joe happily shouted lies at these cameras , and then he followed John McCain around the country for a while , even though he ( Joe ) hated him ( John ) .
By the time the election put John McCain out of his misery , it was apparent to everyone that Joe was a fairly standard - issue asshole right - wing crank , like your uncle who has all those ancient Rush Limbaugh books .
And after his month of quasi - fame , Joe has valiantly tried to build his brand .
Joe the Plumber will help you convert your analog tv to digital , on the internet !
He designed an awesome MSPaint cover for his forthcoming book and it looks like at some point he actually got someone semi-professional to fix the weird website some other guy gave him .
( Oh man , did the book ever materialize ?
You can " buy it " online but it does n't appear to have been printed or shipped to anyone on Earth .
Here 's a pretty great Amazon review . )
In other words , Joe 's attempts at extending his fame have been tremendous failures , because he is not an interesting or intelligent person , at all .
So now he 's going to Israel to watch the war !
Joe will be sent courtesy PJTV , the video operation of blog network Pajamas Media , a network of conservative warbloggers .
From a presidential debate to prime time cable news interviews to local tv advertising to , now , internet video is obviously a downward spiral , but he seems to be getting paid to report on a war , overseas , which is astounding and absurd .
As Joe said himself , when Shepard Smith yelled at him for claiming Barack Obama would personally nuke Israel from space , " Listen , you do n't want my opinion on foreign policy . "
Joe told some TV station in Toledo that he will let Israel 's ' '' Average Joes ' share their story . ''
So we 'll soon be introduced to " Avi the Average Unemployed Tax Cheat Claiming to Be a Well - Off Middle Class Tradesman Who Also Happens to be a Staunch Likudnik . "
We thought the Israelis were America 's bestest allies !
Why would we send them this asshole ?
Do conservative bloggers secretly hate Israel ?
And now Ashley Todd will get a column in the Wall Street Journal .

The Icelandic Government has collapsed and some people talk about a revolution .
In a way it is true .
Simply ordinary people turned this government down by writing articles , holding speeches , noise demonstrations , bonfires , car horns , direct action , civil disobedience and sabotage .
A nation that before had no sign of life , only citizen obedience and servility , finally stood up and said : “ No thanks !
No more shit . ”
Article originally from Aftaka , an Icelandic anarchist website .
But what will follow ?
Have we reached the final goal ?
Is the minority government of the Left Greens ( Vinstri Grænir ) and the Social Democrats ( Samfylkingin ) enough ?
Are we just going to be happy with new elections this spring ?
—
From the beginning of the economic crisis , following the collapse and nationalization of the three major Icelandic business banks , loud voices have been heard , demanding that the government would resign and elections would take place as soon as possible .
The same voices have as well demanded that the boards of the financial institutions would be changed ; in the Central Bank , Financial Supervisory and the three recent state owned banks .
Hörður Torfason and his fellows from the organization Raddir Fólksins ( The People ’s Voices ) took the first step by organizing weekly demonstrations where sharp and variously good speeches have been held , followed by the public ’s jubilation .
At the same time more radical actions have taken place .
Anarchists and other radicals have used direct actions , tried to stop the government from having meetings , stopped formal parliament meetings , attacked the police station and stopped worked in the banks and the Financial Supervisory .
These two formations than came together on Tuesday last week , January 20th , when thousands of people gathered by the parliament with the aim to disrupt and hopefully cut the first parliamentary session of the new year – and did so .
During the next seven days bonfires , industrial samba - bands and noise demonstrations became daily events .
The pre-event of this collaboration of radicals and the “ ordinary ” citizens was by Hotel Borg on the last day of the year , where protesters cut a live broadcast of a annual party political TV show where the heads of the political parties discuss the recent political year over champagne and herring .
The original plan of the protest was to disrupt the broadcast with noise and torches , but soon it became clear that that it would not happen without people taking the next step .
So people climbed over gates , fought with “ innocent ” staff that tried to stop people from entering the hotel , pulled apart and burned TV cables and cut off the broadcast .
It was a good start .
—
There was an obvious common demand during the demonstrations over the last week and was highlighted in the slogan that resounded over the city for a whole week : “ Disqualified government ! ”
But this slogan says nothing about what is about to come , what people want else than just getting the government away .
On Wednesday night , January 21st , after the police had shot couple of teargas bombs on the protesters , the group moved to the Government ’s office .
Once again people lit a bonfire and protested against the government .
When the police turned up some people started throwing bricks at the cops like before that same evening .
At one point young angry man walked to the police , who has well armed with shields , helmets , clubs and pepper spray , and threw a stone at them and shouted : “ Just give us permit to vote ” he shouted and continued : “ then these protests will quit . ”
These words came as a surprise to a lot of people .
“ Just give us the permit to vote ! ”
Is that really the main demand ?
And does it make one so angry not to be allowed to vote , that throwing stones becomes the tactic to propel elections ?
Of course , there are different opinions and ideas about what the planned elections this spring will lead to .
Some people believe it is enough to vote for the Left Greens , that it will lead to positive changes .
Others believe that it is possible to change the system from inside , want to push forward new political parties in the upcoming elections , which will than hopefully draw the lines of changes in the constitution and the system .
Even others want the party - system away and encourage individuals ’ candidatures .
These ideas have one thing in common , they are all based on the idea that reforms inside the current system are steps in the right directions , step towards a more just society .
They do not demand radical changes – revolution .
An therefore it is strange to see people standing on Austurvöllur ( the square in front of the parliament ) shouting slogans like “ Long live the revolution ! ” – no revolution has taken place apart from the fact that the government has collapsed .
When we will get closer to the upcoming elections we can expect the same thing as usual .
The political parties will lounge their image campaigns , compete in advertising , which has the best designers and computer technique .
That ’s how it always is .
And then one there is one thing that matters : Money .
Those who have the most money or the political party that has the best access to money is going to be the most visible force in the election campaign .
And same story will continue if the elections will be between individuals instead of parties .
While we stay inside the system we have lived in until now , individuals ’ results will be based only on who has the most money .

The reasons for the collapse of the government and the discussion about it show very well what today ’s politics are about .
Sjálfstæðisflokkurin ( The Independence Party , right wing conservatives ) refused to fire Davíð Oddsson from the board of the Central Bank , because of his fearsome hold on the society .
Even though he is hidden in the Central Bank , he still sits on the top – or at least sat there before the collapse - of Icelandic authorities and no one is allowed to alter with him or his opinions .
Fearing the impact of firing Oddsson from the Central Bank , the Independence Party could do nothing .
Therefore it is going to be extremely interesting to see if a new government will dare to fire Oddsson and what impact it will have on the Icelandic society , since it is clear the Oddsson has a serious blackmailing force in Iceland .
And then the two parties – The Independence Party and the Social Democrats – argued about which of them should get the prime ministry .
And those arguments were enough take down the government .
The collapse is a result of endless power mongering .
That ’s what today ’s politics are about – to receive and remain powers .
It is not about creating a society based on justice and equality , freedom and co-operation .
It is not about trying to create a healthy society , but first and only about power .
These fights expose the politics and show even better what they are about :
A stupid game of power , competition about popularity and power ; untruth and treachery against those who have no power ; those who are oppressed from the beginning of their lives through the education system and other systems of the society .
Politics are a game of lies .
—
We have to resists this game and this corrupt system .
That particular resistance is the premise for changes .
If we want new changes we have to turn our backs to the time that used to be and use our imagination .
It does not mean we have to fundamentally forget history , but rather learn from it , both mistakes and victories .
We have to widen our imagination and not only demand the impossible but first of all do the impossible .
The changes we want to get through have to be built on ideas about international resistance and solidarity .
We are not alone on this island ; we are only a tiny bit of global struggle of those who have no power against those who have all power , struggle for a world without authority .
Everywhere in the world – in Mexico , Greece , Palestine , Iraq , Japan , Belarus , the USA – everywhere does this struggle exist .
Of course is it on different stages and the same can be said about authorities ’ reactions against it .
There is no reason to put together our struggle and the struggle of oppressed Palestinians , except up to the level where it really is common .
What unties us is the fact that we are powerless and we stand against those who have the powers , in a struggle against them and against the system which allows few individuals to receive this power .
We fight for people to take control of their own lives and the organization of the society , and destroy all power structures that oppress and kill .
And though the situation often looks bad and way too many people are blinded by authorities ’ propaganda about the necessity of the power to remain in their own hands , the fact is that our united struggle against them is real and the solidarity as well .
—
Last Saturday , fliers were distributed during the weekly demonstration by the parliament , encouraging people to concern more for each other , during radical actions as well as during people ’s daily life .
It also said that people should not even dare to think that it is more necessary to break down the government than to destroy the patriarchy and fight against all injustice towards those who have another skin color than most Icelanders and those who do not identify themselves straight .
The society is full of class division and injustice , based on ideas stating that some people are higher than other .
Muscularity , white color of skin and heterosexuality are the highest values of the society and all individuals that do not fall under them then become automatically lower and therefore become the targets of prejudices , irritation and violence .
These ideas have been completely got into the system and will not be broken inside it .
We need to destroy the whole system .
Let ’s not celebrate when a woman ( and even more : a homosexual woman ) will now become a prime minister for the first time here in Iceland .
Let ’s not celebrate when women get high and respected positions of power .
Let ’s not celebrate when a black man becomes the president of the USA for the first time .
Let ’s not celebrate these reforms that help the system remaining .
Let ’s not celebrate when women , homo - and bisexual and non-white individuals manage to work themselves up to the role of the average white straight man .
No !
Lets instead fight against this system , which rows people up in differently high positions and oppressess those how are situated in the lower positions .
Let ’s fight against the system that allows few individuals to oppress others .
Let ’s fight against all power pyramids and abuse of power .
Let ’s fight against unequal distribution of finance and natural resources .
Let ’s fight against all ideologies that have changed life necessities into to luxury products for the rich .
Then we can for the first time talk about justice and equality .
Then we can start talking about real changes .
Then we can finally talk about a revolution .

More detailed information about last weeks actions will be put up here on Aftaka in a few days .
Until then you can read more about protests and direct actions in Iceland since the economic collapse :
* Direct Action in Iceland
* Actions Continue in Iceland
* Protestors cut live transmission of annual party political TV show
This looks painful .
While we should n't laugh at the misfortune of others , there 's something about the Segway which brings out a joyous feeling when seeing them fail so spectacularly .

Doctors can’t tell Mandy Sellars why her legs keep expanding – all they say is that her only option is a drastic amputation .
She travelled to the US for a new TV show in search of an alternative ...
It ’s not easy being Mandy Sellars .
She has hugely outsized legs that make having a normal life nearly impossible .
People stare whenever she leaves the house , she needs a special car to get around and ca n’t work full time .
Click here for more amazing real life stories
What ’s more , her condition is getting worse and doctors say she needs an amputation so severe she wo n’t be able to sit up .
And she does n’t even know what ’s caused it .
But the cheerful 33 - year - old from Accrington , Lancs , just wo n’t be told .
She ’s challenged medics ’ verdict and has just got back from America where she went to find a new treatment .
And now she ’s on a mission to find out once and for all what ’s the matter with her .
“ As you can imagine the size of my legs and clubfoot make walking difficult and I need crutches just to get around my ground floor flat .
“ And people can be very cruel .
I was in a park a few months ago when a group of teens started pointing at me , they were saying to each other , ‘ Look at the size of her legs . ’
“ I wish they could experience how it feels to have strangers laugh at you .
“ I do n’t mind curiosity – it ’s the laughing and nudging that gets to me . ”
It ’s no wonder some people stare .
Mandy ’s legs are wider than the average man ’s waist and heavier than most women .
Her left leg is five inches longer than her right and has a clubfoot , which has turned 180 degrees backwards .
She says : “ I weigh about 20 stone – 15 of which are my legs . ”
She has never had a firm diagnosis , but it could be linked to Proteus syndrome , which causes abnormal skin and limb growth .
John Merrick , the Elephant Man , is believed to have had it .
“ I use an electric wheelchair when I go out , ” says Mandy .
“ I live alone and what takes the average person half an hour takes me an hour , if not longer .
Just getting dressed in the morning is a mammoth task .
“ By the time I go into the kitchen to get breakfast , I can be exhausted .
I ca n’t just pop to the shops , it all has to be planned . ”
Mandy has a specially adapted hand - controlled car so she can still get out to meet friends and go round for a coffee and a chat .
“ I try to lead a normal life but I do get frustrated , ” she says .
“ The worst thing about my condition is that my mobility is getting worse and I have no control over it . ”
When Mandy was born doctors gave her a week to live .
Her left leg was three inches longer than her right , and both were out of proportion .
No one knew what her condition was or how to treat it .
Despite the odds , Mandy proved everyone wrong and at 18 months she began walking .
“ I could never run as fast as my friends but I was still outside playing .
I also learned to ride a bike but I kept the stabilisers on until I was 16 .
“ It ’s embarrassing now when I think about it , but I did n’t care then , ” she says laughing .
“ My legs started to grow when I was really small .
I saw a lot of doctors , then when I was seven , one specialist told my mum I should have my legs amputated . ”
Mandy ’s mother June , 57 , was horrified by the doctor ’s suggestion and argued if her daughter could still run and play with friends there was no need to have her legs cut off .
“ Mum was brave to stand up to the consultant .
My parent ’s have always been supportive and told me that I can do whatever I want to do .
“ They realise that they wo n’t always be here and have encouraged me to be independent , so at 19 I left to live on my own .
“ I was a normal teenager – I went out drinking , clubbing and ended the night with a kebab . ”
After college Mandy went to the University of Central Lancashire where she gained a BSc in psychology .
“ I ’ve got a quick mind but a full - time job would exhaust me , ” she explains .
“ But I like to make the most of life . ”
She talks to friends over the internet every day and is in the middle of writing a book about her life .
She even finds the energy to head to the local RSCPA rescue centre once a week to clear out the rabbit hutches .
But her health keeps getting worse .
She has suffered arthritis , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and had a blood clot in her leg .
She was paralysed from the waist down for two months .
“ I had to learn to walk again which took three months , ” she says .
“ Three years later I bumped my leg and got a blood infection , then my kidneys then failed and I got MRSA .
“ In all this time and during all of my visits to hospitals , I ’ve never been given a definite diagnosis , except to be told it could be a form of this Proteus syndrome .
“ No doctor has been investigated to any degree .
I was beginning to believe I was the only woman in the world with it . ”
The situation is n’t going to get better .
She says : “ As my legs get heavier they ’ll put a strain on my heart and internal organs .
“ I know that amputation and prosthetic legs are my only option to save my life but I ’m unhappy with what the UK experts told me .
“ They said the only way to do the op would be to amputate my left leg from the hip and the right leg above the knee .
“ But I would n’t be able to sit up and would be even more disabled than now . ”
So when a TV production company contacted Mandy and said it wanted to make a documentary about her life , and take her to meet US specialists , she did n’t hesitate to say yes .
In the US she met renowned orthopaedic surgeon Dr William Ertl and prosthetic whizz Kevin Carroll .
The pair has worked together on many challenging cases and Carroll famously made a prosthetic tail for a dolphin .
“ What they told me gave me hope , ” Mandy says .
“ They said I could have a far less severe amputation .
Now I feel much better informed to make a decision about amputation .
The information I got in the US has been life - changing . ”
Mandy also now has a UK doctor who is willing to search for the elusive diagnosis .
Geneticist Dr Susan Huson , from St Mary ’s Hospital , Manchester , is determined to identify Mandy ’s condition .
While amputation is inevitable and Mandy still faces the biggest dilemma of her life , she ’s pleased that some day there may well be a condition in the medical books named after her .
“ It could be called Sellars syndrome , ” she smiles .
“ Then I ’d go down in history . ”

CBS : Did Wall Street speculators create oil price bubble ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday January 12 , 2009
Print This Email This
One of the most inexplicable economic events of the past year involved the doubling of the price of oil last spring and summer from $ 69 a barrel to nearly $ 150 -- driving gasoline and heating oil costs through the roof -- followed by its even more rapid collapse this fall to under $ 50
60 Minutes looked into various theories of what happened and concluded that " many people believe it was a speculative bubble .. and that it had more to do with traders and speculators on Wall Street than with oil company executives or sheiks in Saudi Arabia . "
Oil is traded on the commodities futures market , whose original purpose was to enable farmers and manufacturers to stabilize their expenses and receipts .
But in 2007 , those markets began to behave erratically .
Last summer , Dan Gilligan , the president of the Petroleum Marketers Association , told 60 Minutes that his members were being blamed for price gouging but that the real problem lay with speculators .
" Approximately 60 to 70 percent of the oil contracts in the futures markets are now held by speculative entities , " Gilligan explained .
" Not by companies that need oil , not by the airlines , not by the oil companies .
But by investors that are looking to make money from their speculative positions . "
Around the same time , hedge fund manager Michael Masters noticed that huge amounts of money were flowing out of stocks and into commodity futures .
According to CBS 's Steve Kroft , " In a five year period , Masters said the amount of money institutional investors , hedge funds , and the big Wall Street banks had placed in the commodities markets went from $ 13 billion to $ 300 billion .
Last year , 27 barrels of crude were being traded every day on the New York Mercantile Exchange for every one barrel of oil that was actually being consumed in the United States . "
Wall Street bankers insisted at hearings last summer that the rising oil prices were a result of supply and demand , not excessive speculation .
But prices continued to go up , even jumping by a record $ 25 on a single day when there were no supply disruptions to justify the increase and demand was actually going down .
Two investment firms , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs , may have set off the speculative bubble last March by their predictions of soaring oil prices .
However , both firms deny deliberately manipulating prices , and federal law does n't give regulators the jurisdiction to find out .
The bursting of the oil bubble comes as no surprise to some .
In March , Citigroup energy futures analyst Tim Evans told the libertarian Reason magazine that " the futures and options market has become more important than the physical supplies in driving the price .
We are seeing investment flows into the oil market that do n't have anything to do with the demand and supply of oil . "
However , other energy market experts argued that the many large institutional investors who were moving into commodity futures at that time were merely seeking " an investment vehicle that provided a hedge against volatility in stock markets while also promising excellent long - term returns . "
Nobel Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman even suggested that " all through the period of the alleged bubble , inventories have remained at more or less normal levels .
This tells us that the rise in oil prices is nt the result of runaway speculation ; its the result of fundamental factors , mainly the growing difficulty of finding oil and the rapid growth of emerging economies like China .
The rise in oil prices these past few years had to happen to keep demand growth from exceeding supply growth . "
Krugman also pointed out that the most insistent claims of an oil bubble were coming from conservatives with an interest in denying the reality of peak oil .
" Traditionally , denunciations of speculators come from the left of the political spectrum .
In the case of oil prices , however , the most vociferous proponents of the view that its all the speculators  fault have been conservatives  people whom you wouldnt normally expect to see warning about the nefarious activities of investment banks and hedge funds .
The explanation of this seeming paradox is that wishful thinking has trumped pro-market ideology . "
No matter what the facts of the matter may be , a lack of transparency will make them more difficult to determine .
According to CBS , " It 's impossible to tell exactly who was buying and selling all those oil contracts because most of the trading is now conducted in secret , with no public scrutiny or government oversight .
Over time , the big Wall Street banks were allowed to buy and sell as many oil contracts as they wanted for their clients , circumventing regulations intended to limit speculation .
And in 2000 , Congress effectively deregulated the futures market , granting exemptions for complicated derivative investments called oil swaps , as well as electronic trading on private exchanges . "
This deregulation of the futures market was originally enacted for the benefit of Enron and made it possible for that firm to manipulate the California electricity market , driving prices up by as much as 300 % .
It has since been exploited far more widely , and the incoming Obama administration has promised to address the regulatory loophole .

It was Seth 's first day on the job .
He had just completed the usual paperwork and orientation stuff , when his new boss Gabe said : " Why do n't you take care of Issue # 88743 ? "
Seth loaded up their issue tracker and eagerly navigated to # 88743 .
The ticket read as follows :
NETWORK OPS BUILT A NEW EMAIL SERVER FOR DEVELOPMENT .
PLEASE UPDATE THE TEST VERSION'S CONFIG FILE TO USE 10.1.8.22 AS THE SMTP SERVER .
Clearly , the purpose of the assignment was to get Seth acquainted with the codebase .
The application he was hired to maintain was used to manage commercial real estate properties , and was sold to management companies of all sizes .
And because it was built in .
NET , Seth figured he'd start by hunting for the app.config file .
The Spreadsheet Begins
When Seth opened up the codebase 's root folder , a file named config.xls immediately caught his attention .
The file had several different Excel worksheets , each named for a different module in the application .
The worksheets each contained two columns -- KEY and VALUE -- and each had a handful of rows .
The key he needed to change -- " SMTP Server " -- was staring right at him .
" Just type in the new IP address and hit save , " Gabe said with a big grin on his face .
" Pretty elegant , eh ? "
Seth was n't quite sure how to respond to all this , so he just smiled and figured he'd make the small configuration change .
When he saved config.xls , though , a custom dialog box popped up : " WARNING : About to Save Changes to Configuration !
Are you sure everything is OK ? "
Heeding the warning , he clicked " Cancel " and verified that he had , in fact , typed in 10.1.8.22 correctly .
Curious as to why that message had appeared , Seth hit ALT - F11 to bring up the VBA Macro Editor .
What came up was 1,000 - plus lines of Excel VBA code that seemed to validate and tidy up the variety of different configuration fields .
There was even a macro named " Upgrade ( ) " that , apparently , was responsible for loading the values out of an older version of the configuration spreadsheet into the current file .
The first line of code in that macro rendered the entire macro moot as it just popped up a dialog box that said " Not Supported Anymore . "
On the application side of things , the VB.NET configuration code was n't any prettier .
There were three distinct ways to read values from the configuration file , but only two seemed to work .
The " COM Interop " method was great if you wanted to find a value in a specific cell ( such as sheet 5 , column 2 , row 23 ) , while the ADO.
NET method was used to find a value by name ( such as " SMTP Server " ) .
Problem Update
Seth was n't alone in thinking there were much better solutions .
None of the developers , however , could convince Gabe .
Until that one day , when a customer needed to update the mailing address that the application used and followed the instructions provided by tech support : open config.xls , navigate to the " Company " workbook , and edit the appropriate address fields .
She was an experienced Excel user and had no problem updating the data .
By force of habit , she made sure to type in the apostrophe ( ' ) character before entering their new ZIP code so that Excel would recognize it as text instead of a number .
And therein lay the problem : the field was already defined as text and their data- validation routine never took into consideration the ZIP code apostrophe and allowed the file to save as normal .
A perfect storm of bugs allowed the apostrophe 'd ZIP code to be used in a SQL statement , which ended up wreaking quite a bit of havoc on their data .
And thanks to their " gotta - catch - ' em - all " error - handling philosophy , it took nearly 12 hours to figure all this out .
After Word
" This is completely unacceptable , " Gabe yelled in the developer meeting .
" Ca n't you guys write a simple Excel macro !?
Or at least test for stuff like this ? "
" Well , " one of the developers defended , " we did , but the customer never updated their macro code .
This is probably why no one uses Excel for configuration files . "
" Huh ? " Gabe frowned , " Excel is a proven technology !
Besides , easy - to - edit is a priority , people ! "
Another developer sarcastically remarked , " Then why not just use Microsoft Word ? "
At that moment , Gabe 's expression went from angry to intrigued .
" Actually , we could do that !
No apostrophes to worry about and it's even easier to use , " he said as his mind started to wander toward the technical implementation .
" It 'd be pretty elegant , eh ? "

Sanitize : A whitelist - based Ruby HTML sanitizer Wednesday December 24 , 2008
This is an ancient blog post that was written many years ago .
It ’s archived here as a historical curiosity , and is likely to contain bad writing , bad ideas , and broken links .
Please do n’t assume that anything here is still accurate or represents my current opinions .
Merry Christmas , Internets !
My gift to you this year is Sanitize , a whitelist - based HTML sanitizer written in Ruby .
Given a list of acceptable elements and attributes , Sanitize will remove all unacceptable HTML from a string .
Using a simple configuration syntax , you can tell Sanitize to allow certain elements , certain attributes within those elements , and even certain URL protocols within attributes that contain URLs .
Any HTML elements or attributes that you do n’t explicitly allow will be removed .
Because it ’s based on Nokogiri , a full - fledged HTML parser , rather than a bunch of fragile regular expressions , Sanitize has no trouble dealing with malformed or maliciously - formed HTML .
When in doubt , Sanitize always errs on the side of caution .
Using Sanitize is easy .
First , install it :
gem install sanitize
Then call it like so :
require ' rubygems ' require ' sanitize ' html = ' < b > < a href = " http://foo.com/ ">
foo</a></b><img src= " http://foo.com/bar.jpg " />' Sanitize.clean( html ) # => ' foo '
By default , Sanitize removes all HTML .
You can use one of the built - in configs to tell Sanitize to allow certain attributes and elements :
Sanitize.clean( html , Sanitize :: Config:: RESTRICTED ) # => '< b> foo</b>' Sanitize.clean( html , Sanitize :: Config :: BASIC ) # => '< b >< a href = " http://foo.com/ " rel= " nofollow " > foo </a></b>'
Sanitize.clean( html , Sanitize :: Config:: RELAXED ) # => '< b >< a href = " http://foo.com/ ">
foo</a></b><img src= " http://foo.com/bar.jpg " />'
Or , if you ’d like more control over what ’s allowed , you can provide your own custom configuration :
Sanitize.clean( html , :elements => [ 'a ' , ' span ' ] , :attributes => {'a ' => [ ' href ' , ' title ' ] , ' span ' => [ ' class ']} , : protocols => {'a ' => {' href ' => [ ' http ' , ' https ' , ' mailto ' ]
}} )

In what could be an important step toward stabilizing the world 's population of endangered Asian elephants , German researchers say they 've hit on a way to freeze elephant sperm without destroying its viability .
Elephants are notoriously tricky to breed in zoos , with high rates of miscarriages and infant mortality .
Artificial insemination ( AI ) is possible , but fresh sperm is delicate and can be damaged in transport .
And in addition to being costly and logistically tricky , bringing elephants from other zoos to do the job can be socially disruptive to the animals and risks spreading disease , particularly a lethal strain of herpesvirus .
A possible solution , experts say : frozen supplies of quality sperm .
Suzan Murray , the head veterinarian at the National Zoo in Washington , D.C. , says an effective cryopreservation technique " will revolutionize our ability to breed and maintain elephants in zoos . "
If zoos have a supply of frozen sperm on hand it will give them much more flexibility in terms of where and when they perform inseminations , upping the chances of success .
The latest research , reported in the journal Animal Reproduction Science , was conducted by a group at the Leibniz Institute of Zoo and Wildlife Research ( IWZ ) in Berlin , Germany .
In 1998 IWZ scientists performed the first successful artificial insemination in an African elephant at the Indianapolis Zoo .
They also took part in another zoological coup : the birth last fall of the first test - tube white rhinoceros at the Budapest Zoo in Hungary .
Although scientists have had success cryopreserving the sperm of African elephants , the reproductive cells of their Asian cousins are much harder to freeze .
That ’s because the African variety have a tougher shell composed of different fatty acids that better resists the ordeal of deep cold .
In the new study , the IWZ team led by Thomas Hidebrandt evaluated several methods of freezing Asian elephant sperm using various combinations of chemicals to protect the reproductive cells , along with centrifugal techniques to separate them from the semen .
Study co-author Robert Hermes , a veterinarian , says researchers found that elephant sperm remain most viable when they are spun in test tubes containing a chemical at the bottom called iodixanol that shields the cells from physical damage .
The sperm also do best in rapid , " directional " freezing , a method that employs a frigid metal block , instead of liquid nitrogen vapors used in the conventional freezing process — to encourage orderly formation of ice crystals in the frozen material .
With that protocol , slightly more than half of sperm tested appeared normal under a microscope , nearly 60 percent could swim forward after thawing and nearly 70 percent were considered viable , meaning their membranes were intact .
Prior to the latest work , " no one was really able to freeze Asian elephant sperm so that enough of the cells were alive and moving , " Hermes says .
But the real proof will be in the next test : whether the cells can bring a female elephant a visit from the stork .
Hermes says he and his colleagues are now planning to perform AI with sperm frozen and thawed through their technique , a test they do n't want to rush .
" An elephant AI takes a lot of effort and planning , " he says .
" You do n't play around with this if you 're not really sure that you have semen that can do the job . "
Behavioral ecologist Michael Hutchins , executive director and CEO of the Wildlife Society , says a better method of preserving elephant semen could potentially boost the genetic variability of both captive and wild populations .
" It 's important to be able to have access to a number of different males ' reproductive cells to maintain genetic diversity , " Hutchins says .
Because elephants are so large , individual zoos cannot handle more than a few of them .
As a result , the captive population tends to be geographically far - flung — making traditional mating options narrow .
The availability of viable frozen — and therefore shippable — semen could help to eliminate that problem , Hutchins says .
And , Hermes adds , because frozen sperm can be screened for their chromosomal makeup , the approach also could allow zoos to better balance their ratios of males to females through sex-selected fertilization .
President - elect Barack Obama is right : America needs a real and meaningful middle - class tax cut .
Unfortunately , despite the rhetoric , that is not what his proposals offer .
Mr. Obama 's tax plan includes creating or expanding nine or more federal income tax credits mostly focused on low - and moderate - income earners , with an estimated cost of $ 1.3 trillion over 10 years .
These tax credits are provided for certain social purposes , such as child care , health care , education , housing and retirement .
Buried amid these is Mr. Obama 's purported tax cut for the middle class .
For the bottom 40 % of income earners , who pay no federal income taxes on net today , these refundable income tax credits will not reduce tax liability but instead result in new checks from the federal government for the targeted social purposes .
That 's not a tax cut .
It 's welfare .
These tax credits will do little or nothing to promote economic growth because they do not reduce marginal tax rates -- the rate on the next dollar of income -- to provide powerful , meaningful incentives for productive activities such as investment , entrepreneurship and work .
A tax credit is effectively a cash grant that can only affect incentives up to the amount of the grant .
Indeed , such tax credits would likely reduce economic growth because the credits are phased out as income rises , and so effectively impose higher marginal tax rates over those income levels .
For a real middle - class tax cut , we should cut the 25 % income tax rate that now applies to single workers earning $ 32,550 to $ 78,850 , and married couples earning $ 65,100 to $ 131,450 .
We should reduce that rate down to the 15 % rate paid by workers below these income levels .
That would , in effect , establish a flat - rate tax of 15 % for close to 90 % of American workers .
A new robot called EATR or the Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot is being developed by RTI and being funded DARPA .
The goal of this project is to create a robot for long range missions without the need for conventional refueling .
The robot will be able to get ‘ food ’ on it ’s own .
RTI states the robot will be able to :
Identify suitable biomass sources of energy and distinguish those sources from unsuitable materials ( e.g. , wood , grass , or paper from rocks , metal , or glass )
Spatially locate and manipulate the sources of energy ( e.g. , cut or shred to size , grasp , lift , and ingest ) ; and
Convert the biomass to sufficient electrical energy to power power the EATR subsystems .

Enlarge Uncle Milton Industries Destiny with fun :
An aspiring Jedi concentrates on making the ball in the tube rise .
Could The Force be with you ?
A toy due in stores this fall will let you test and hone your Jedi - like abilities .
The Force Trainer ( expected to be priced at $ 90 to $ 100 ) comes with a headset that uses brain waves to allow players to manipulate a sphere within a clear 10 - inch - tall training tower , analogous to Yoda and Luke Skywalker 's abilities in the Star Wars films .
No , you 're not tapping into some " all - powerful force controlling everything , " as Han Solo said in the movies .
But you are reaching out with mind power via one of the first mass - market brain - to - computer products .
" It 's been a fantasy everyone has had , using The Force , " says Howard Roffman , president of Lucas Licensing .
Mind - control games may be the coming thing : Mattel plans to demonstrate a Mind Flex game ( also due this fall ) , which uses brain - wave activity to move a ball through a tabletop obstacle course , at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Thursday .
In the Force Trainer , a wireless headset reads your brain activity , in a simplified version of EEG medical tests , and the circuitry translates it to physical action .
If you focus well enough , the training sphere , which looks like a ping - pong ball , will rise in the tower .
A state of deep concentration is needed to achieve a Force - full effect .
" When you concentrate , it activates the training remote , " says Frank Adler of toymaker Uncle Milton Industries , which is creating the Trainer .
" There is a flow of air that will move the ( ball ) .
You can actually feel like you are in a zone . "
Star Wars sound effects and audio clips emitted from the base unit " cue you in to progress to the next level ( from Padawan to Jedi ) or when to move the sphere up or down to keep challenging yourself , " Adler says .
" Until today , EEG technology has been designed for rigorous medical and clinical applications with little regard to price ( and ) ease of use , " says Greg Hyver of NeuroSky , which developed the brain - wave technology for both games .
" We are putting this exciting technology into everyone 's living room . "

A strange disconnect tells the story of the last 20 years of Canadian politics .
It 's the disconnect between Canadian values ( those who object to this term have my permission to running screaming from the room ) and the governments they end up with .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
The old saw that people deserve the governments they get does not apply here .
Many in - depth surveys suggest that Canadians still hold firmly to their views that governments have an activist role to play in their lives and the lives of communities .
These are decidedly progressive values .
Yet we now have as prime minister one of the most reactionary and radically right - wing politicians ever to hold office .
This profound contradiction is between values and expectations .
Canadians still believe in the principle that government is a force for good .
It 's just that they no longer believe that it can be , or will be .
This is a huge victory for those like Stephen Harper who believe in the motto of his former employer , the National Citizens Coalition : " More freedom through less government . "
The right did not have to change people 's values .
They just had to change people 's expectations .
And they did it through a stunningly successful seizure of the language of public discourse .
In other words , they framed the issues .
And their opponents fought the battle of ideas on a field designed by and for their adversaries .
Teflon frames
There are many examples but some of the most powerful phrases will evoke memories of past battles : there is no alternative ; we are going to hit the debt wall ; government is inefficient ; public employees are " bureaucrats " -- privileged , over paid , under worked and lazy .
The art and science of strategic frame analysis -- issue framing -- is relatively new in Canada , though the concept of framing is not .
The right has been framing its issues carefully for years while the left has been oddly complacent about re-framing issues from their perspective .
That complacency has cost civil society groups dearly .
And it has cost Canadians even more in eroded social programs , and the growing gap between rich and poor .
Framing refers to the strategic construction of messages in order that they connect with people 's deeply held world views and assumptions .
It starts from the point we all know from experience - that people are rarely persuaded by just facts and numbers no matter how compelling they might be .
Framing theory suggests the construction of a message involves a complex combination of words , numbers , stories , metaphors and messengers that support the message , and take account of the particular context within which the message is delivered .
A strong frame will actually reject facts that do n't fit the frame .
The way that budget deficits have been framed is a good example .
There are many very sound arguments suggesting that deficits can play a very positive role in managing an economy and smoothing out ups and downs in economic growth .
But the notion that deficits are totally unacceptable with respect to government spending is so entrenched that it is the equivalent of the Teflon frame : all competing facts and arguments just bounce off it .
Elephant power
American linguist George Lakoff is the best - known framing expert on the left .
His now famous book Do n't Think of an Elephant coaches progressives on how to reframe issues captured by the right .
The title refers to what Lakoff suggests is the key to understanding framing : that you cannot negate an operating frame .
In fact , each time you negate the frame , you actually evoke it .
If you tell people not to think of an elephant it is virtually impossible for them NOT to think of one .
The classic example of failing to negate a frame was provided by Richard Nixon when he famously declared " I am not a crook . "
From that instant on , this is precisely how the vast majority of Americans viewed their president .
A short time later he resigned .
Issue framing has taken on such importance in American politics that the New York Times referred to its as " framing wars " between the Democrats and the Republicans .
Lakoff works closely with the Democrats , and the Republicans have their own brilliant language guru , Frank Luntz .
In 1997 he distributed a 160 - page report titled " The Language of the 21st Century , " which he said was his " most serious effort to put together an effective , comprehensive national communications strategy . "
It quickly became the Republican play - book bible .
Harper 's fave frames
Luntz 's ideas started showing up more obviously in Canada just weeks after Stephen Harper won the 2006 election -- and just after , Luntz came to Canada and visited the new prime minister .
That 's when we started hearing the key Harper ministers repetition of term " tax relief , " a staple of Luntz 's framing .
Why this phrase ?
Because it automatically evokes the image of an affliction that needs relief .
Those who offer to help with the affliction are the good guys , and those who deny that relief are cast as people who do n't care about ordinary folk .
You can't negate the " tax relief " frame any more than you can command people not to think of an elephant .
So , instead of trying to talk against tax relief , Lakoff would argue that you need to re-frame the issue with your values in mind -- and talk about " fair tax reform . "
That new frame evokes a whole different set of attitudes , and does n't reinforce the notion that taxes are a burden .
It implies that taxes are needed and also connects with people 's existing conviction that the wealthy do n't pay their fair share .
Other re-framing ideas include talking about taxes as the price we pay for a civilized society , taxes as an investment in our children 's future , or the price of admission to a desirable club -- one of the best countries in the world to live in .
" Sometimes , " says Frank Luntz , " it 's not what you say that matters but what you do n't say . "
His advice to Republicans : never say " government . "
Say " Washington . "
Why ?
Because people actually like their local government but they do n't trust Washington .
Never say " globalization . "
Say " the free market economy , " because globalization is scary , too big and beyond people 's control .
Never say " drilling for oil . "
Say " exploring for energy . "
Never say " undocumented workers . "
Say " illegal aliens . "
Re-framing to win
The right in Canada , Harper in particular , will be honing this communications methodology as we come up to the next election .
Indeed the Clean Air Act is just one example .
So , can we turn the tables on the right and begin to frame and re-frame issues so that they connect with Canadians ' values ?
Absolutely .
Here 's a start :
Never say " Medicare crisis . "
Say the " corporate threat to Medicare . "
Why ?
Because the privateers want people to think there 's a crisis so they will acquiesce to a radical solution : privatization .
Never say " private care . "
Instead say " for - profit care . "
Never say " defence spending . "
Say " war spending . "
Because the huge increases in that department are exclusively for making war .
Do n't say " child care . "
Instead say " early childhood learning . "
Because the right tries to frame daycare as undermining the family , and warehousing children .
Never refer to the Clean Air Act .
Call it what it is , the Dirty Oil Act .
Never , ever say " free trade agreement . "
Instead , say " investors ' rights agreement . "
Never say Tories .
Say " the Harper Conservatives . "
Because the former reminds people of the politically moderate Red Tories who are long gone .
Similarly , never say " the Conservative government . "
Say " the Harper government . "
Never say " decentralization . "
Instead , say " the erosion of universal social programs . "
Two can play the framing game .
It 's about time those who care about the country got serious about winning .

Functional Programming Unit Testing - Part 2 Thursday , December 11 , 2008
In the previous post , we talked about some of the basics of functional programming unit testing .
That post mostly focused around HUnit , which is a traditional xUnit testing framework .
This time , let 's focus on type - based property testing , which is to create specs which assert logical properties about a function , and then to generate data to test in an attempt to falsify these assertions , through the use of a tool called QuickCheck .
Much like the traditional xUnit frameworks , this tool helps us flush out the specifications of our software through the use of tests .
Unlike the xUnit frameworks , however , this framework allows us to create generators to help flush out our behaviors and capture our edge cases as we look for ways to falsify our tests .
These generators could use either random data or well structured data that you can craft .
Let 's dive a little deeper into what that means .
But , before we continue , let 's get caught up to where we are today :
Introducing QuickCheck
Testing in the functional programming world is important , especially when precision in algorithms leave little room for error .
With the use of QuickCheck , and property - based testing , we are able to write functions that should satisfy universally , with the actual test data to be generated by QuickCheck in such a way that we specify .
This way , we can literally run thousands of variations that would be pretty unreasonable to write by hand , or by using the RowTest from the MbUnit world .
Doing so , we are able to find subtle edge cases that we may not find otherwise .
Let 's first walk through a simple example of how QuickCheck works before we move onto some more interesting ones .
First , let 's do a simple check on a reverse statement .
We 'll use the standard prop_ notation to mark our property - based tests from here on out .
prop_RevRev :: [ Int ] ->
Bool
prop_RevRev xs = ( reverse . reverse ) xs == xs
What this code does is say that when calling reverse on a given list twice , it should equal the original list , in this case , an integer list .
We can then use a built - in integer generator to give us our input .
Once the property - based test has been written , we can use the GHCi to run our example :
We can then notice that it tried 100 values against our given function and found that there are no errors .
Had I made a mistake in my property - based test , it would have exited prematurely with the data that caused the particular error .
For example , I could be careless about my input and expect always to take 5 items from a list .
prop_TakeFive :: [ Int ] ->
Bool
prop_TakeFive xs = ( length . take 5 ) xs == 5
Now , what we did wrong is assume that our lists were always going to be greater than 5 in length , which could be an issue , and QuickCheck easily alerts us to that fact as shown below :
One thing to remember is that creating property - based tests can be hard and we need to be careful how we specify them .
It takes time to refine them and get them right , but luckily the Haskell community is great for learning either through IRC , Haskell - Cafe or other places .
Let 's walk through another example of a ROT13 implementation and perform property - based testing on it .
A ROT13 is a simple cipher which rotates a given letter by 13 places and when applied twice , will undo itself .
The input handles only alphabetic characters and case does matter .
The question is , how do we test something like this ?
Let 's look at the basic proof for this :
ROT 13 ( ROT 13 ( x ) ) = ROT 26 ( x ) = x where x is any given text .
How do I express that in property - based tests ?
Well , let 's lay out four basic cases with the given input of data from upper and lower case letters only , and then implement each one .
A ROT13 of a given string should equal a ROT13 of the same string A ROT13 of a given string should not equal the original string A ROT13 applied twice to the original string should equal the original string A ROT13 of a given string should have the same distribution shape as the original .
For example , " foo " when sorted and grouped should be [ " f " , " oo " ] and then mapped to [ 1,2 ] .
The shape of its translation to " sbb " should follow the same grouping as well of [ 1,2 ] .
Now that we 've deduced our criteria for success for this algorithm , let 's define the property tests .
module EncryptionTests where
import Data .
List
import Encryption ( rot13 )
-- Equal
prop_rot13_equals s =
not ( null s ) == > rot13 s == rot13 s
-- Single is inequal to original
prop_rot13_single_notEquals s =
not ( null s ) == > rot13 s /= s
-- Double is equal to original
prop_rot13_double_equals s =
not ( null s ) == > ( rot13 . rot13 ) s == s
-- Distribution shapes should be equal
prop_rot13_group_equals s =
not ( null s ) == > get Distro ( rot13 s ) == get Distro s
where getDistro = sort .
map length .
group .
sort
We need to define now what data we will be giving to the function in order to create the strings for our property tests .
In order to define the data , we need to create an instance of the Arbitrary typeclass .
Below , we 'll define the Char version which includes both upper and lower case letters .
instance Arbitrary Char where
arbitrary = elements ( [ ' A '..' Z ' ] ++ ['a '..'z ' ] )
coarbitrary n = variant ( ord n )
Now that the rules and data are defined , how might we implement the rot13 function ?
Remembering that case does matter , we 'll have to handle each one differently .
The implementation would look something like the following :
module Encryption ( rot13 ) where
import Data .
Char ( chr , ord )
rot13 :: String ->
String
rot13 =
map mapRot
where mapRot :: Char ->
Char
mapRot c | c >= ' A ' && c <= ' Z ' = rot ' A ' c
| c >= ' a ' && c <= 'z ' = rot ' a ' c
| otherwise = c
rot :: Char -> Char ->
Char
rot b c = chr $ ( ord c - ord b + 13 ) `mod` 26 + ord b
We can now run our property tests through QuickCheck through the GHCi console , such as the following :
quickCheck ( prop_rot13_group_equals :: String -> Property )
Then we 'll be able to see the results as shown below :
This seems great , but you may be wondering why you would use this .
The answer is simple , for functionally pure algorithmic work in a functional language , use QuickCheck to formulate the specs .
Else , if there are side effects , state or other behaviors that are n't easily captured using QuickCheck , then the traditional xUnit frameworks apply better .
Even still , if having IO in the code , it 's best to refactor the code to separate the pure function from the IO interaction .
As I mentioned in a previous post , there are other versions out there for us to use .
What about the F# world ?
QuickCheck in F# ?
Kurt Schelfthout has been working on a port of the Haskell QuickCheck library to F# called FsCheck , now available on CodePlex .
Today , Kurt released version 0.3 of the product which puts it on par with the QuickCheck 1.0 library , which is well short of the version 2.1.0.1 of Quick Check now available for Haskell .
But , how do I use it ?
Let 's look at some simple examples of some of the above code in F# this time to gain a better understanding of how it works in F#.
First , let 's do a translation of the simple reverse function as we did above .
# light
open FsCheck
let prop_RevRev ( xs : int list ) =
( List . rev >>
List . rev ) xs = xs
quickCheck prop_RevRev
After running this code , we see that 100 tests pass nicely .
Now , a quick example of doing the ROT13 implementation .
Just one test should suffice to show how it works .
# light
open FsCheck
open FsCheck .
Generator
let rec rot13 =
List . map mapRot
and mapRot = function
| c when c >= ' A ' && c <= ' Z ' -> rot ' A ' c
| c when c >= ' a ' && c <= 'z ' -> rot ' a ' c
| c -> c
and rot b c = char ( ( int c - int b + 13 ) % 26 + int b )
type CharGenerator ( ) =
static member Chars = elements ( [ ' A ' . . ' Z ' ] @ [ ' a ' . . ' z ' ] )
overwriteGenerators ( typeof < CharGenerator > )
let prop_rot13_equals s =
( rot13 >> rot13 ) s = s
quickCheck prop_rot13_equals
Once you run the code , you 'll find that it passes the 100 tests easily just as it did in the Haskell version .
I hope that the FsCheck project will continue , and I do n't see why not .
After all , it 's up to the community to pick it up and run with it .
I 'd like to see continued work on the test framework plugins such as xUnit.net , MbUnit and NUnit .
That would make a more integrated story , and that 's part of the next post to bring it all together .
There is a lot more to be covered as I 've just touched a very small portion of what QuickCheck can do .
There is a lot of good documentation to be read on the subject on the Haskell Wiki as always .
Conclusion
As always , it 's important to stress design and specification of your functional programming code .
With such toolsets as QuickCheck , we can use this to not only flush out our design , but test our code in many ways through generated data , to help ease the edge cases that might not have been found if coding straight by hand .
Learning these techniques are not always easy and careful consideration must be given when crafting these property tests .
There is still much to cover in this section , which includes extending HUnit , tying our tests together , and code coverage , so stay tuned .
As part of running my online store course , I ’ve seen more than my fair share of poorly designed websites .
But here ’s the thing .
Designing a high converting website is one of the hardest aspects of selling online .
Not only do you have to step inside your customer ’s brain and speak his or her language but you also have to guide them to the right product and close the sale .
After critiquing almost a hundred websites over the course of running my online store course , I ’ve discovered that most people make the same fundamental mistakes with their site design .
Here are the most common problems and how to fix them .

Mistake # 1 : No One Can Tell What You Sell
You should always design your website with the assumption that no one knows who you are or what you sell .
In fact , when someone lands on your site for the first time , you have about 5 seconds to educate them or they ’ll leave .
After all , if they do n’t know what your product does , then they are n’t going to buy .
Seems obvious right ?
But there are so many store owners that get it wrong .
For example based on this splash image , can you tell what this shop sells ?
Neither can I .
And even though this online store gets a good amount of traffic , you have to dig deep into their site to figure out how their product works .
Bottom line .
The imagery and verbiage you use on your site must be self explanatory .
If you use a single splash image with no words on your front page , the image better speak for itself .
Mistake # 2 : You Do n’t Have A Clear Value Proposition
In addition to telling customers what you sell , you also have to convey your unique value proposition .
Here are the questions you need to answer as soon as someone visits your site .
What makes your product special ?
What are your key benefits ?
Why should people shop in your store versus a competitor ?
First off , let ’s make this clear .
Describing your value proposition with words like “ high quality ” or “ best ” or “ great customer service ” is not going to cut it
After all , the term “ high quality ” is ambiguous .
Why is your product high quality ?
Why is it the best ?
The most powerful value propositions send a clear message and contain the following elements .
1 . A large , beautiful image that shows your item in use and clearly demonstrates value and desire .
After tearing my achilles , I knew I had to have this as soon as I saw it .
2 . A simple tag line that uses simple , clear language to communicate why your product is worth buying .
Saddleback Leather – Bags so tough , they ’ll fight for it when you ’re dead
3 . Bullet points that support the tag line and reinforce why your store is the best choice .
4. Social proof – Magazines , testimonials and media mentions add credibility to your business .
Mistake # 3 : You Have A Cluttered Design And / Or A Busy Background
Every page on your website should have a primary objective .
And the path to this objective should be straightforward .
The problem with busy backgrounds and clutter is that it obscures your main call to action .
Always be stingy with your design elements because every widget , graphic and button that you add could distract the user .
Remember , less is more and the goal of every webpage should be clear .
For example on my home page , my primary goal is to get a visitor to click on the big pink button which takes them to our highest margin products .
The primary objective on my category page is to get a visitor to view a product .
And the main goal of my product page is to get people to click on “ add to cart ”
Note : I purposely use hot pink for all of my main action buttons because the color pops out of the page .
When it comes to high converting websites , usability always trumps aesthetics .
According to a survey conducted by HubSpot , 76 % of customers prefer easy navigation over beauty .
Keep this statistic in mind as you shop for themes .
Because a beautiful site does n’t necessarily translate to sales .
In fact , most of the beautiful store themes out there are designed by artists and not optimized to make money !
Mistake # 4 : You ’re Using Poor Quality Photos And / Or Small Images
The main driver of sales for your online store will be your images .
So make sure that your photos are as large and clear as possible .
For example , this store could easily improve conversions by quadrupling the size of its images and making them all uniform in size .
Image quality is crucial as well .
Make sure that your photos are well lit and taken on a plain background for maximum pop .
For more information on taking great photos , consult this post
Mistake # 5 : Your Site Is Not Trustworthy
In order for someone to open up their wallet , they have to trust your site .
In fact , lack of trust is the # 1 conversion killer for ecommerce stores .
To increase buyer confidence , you should have your contact information front and center on every single page of your site .
Also , make sure you display both a physical address AND a phone number .
It does n’t matter if you do n’t plan on answering the phone .
Having a number will increase the credibility of your shop .
In addition , clearly marked store hours imply that you have a real business with a fixed schedule of operation .
If your store is brand new , make sure you do n’t accidentally drive away customers with negative social proof .
For example , if you have products with zero likes and zero reviews , do n’t show social counts !
However , if you have testimonials and press mentions for your business , display them prominently on every single page of your site .
In my last redesign , I implemented many additional trust factors for my shop which improved my conversion rate by 42 % .
Read my post on The Exact Steps I Took To Increase Conversion Rates 42 % For My Online Shop to learn more .
Mistake # 6 : You ’re Not Setup For SEO
If you want to have any chance at all of ranking in the search engines , you have to choose the right keywords for your products .
At a bare minimum , you should populate the title tags for your pages with relevant search terms that directly pertain to what you ’re selling .
Before you publish any product online , you should use a tool like Long Tail Pro to discover which keywords are most commonly being used to search for your products .
Go after the highest volume , lowest competition keywords to give yourself the best chance of ranking in search .
If you are not already doing this with your store , definitely check out Long Tail Pro or the Google Keyword Planner .
Then , go through every money making page on your site and optimize your title tags and meta descriptions .
Mistake # 7 : Your Onsite Search Does n’t Work
Most people focus so much on ranking on Google that they neglect to work on their own on site search engine .
Depending on the number of products you sell in your shop , up to 30 % of your customers will immediately jump to the search bar on your site .
And guess what ?
If they do n’t find what they are looking for , they will leave immediately .
I ’ve written about this topic extensively in the past already .
Read this post , if you want to learn exactly how to optimize your on site search .
Mistake # 8 : Your Site Is Not Mobile Optimized
Starting in late 2015 , my mobile traffic started overtaking my desktop traffic .
And chances are , your traffic patterns will be similar .
Mobile has become such an important factor for my business that I now design my website for smart phones first BEFORE considering desktops and laptops .
I ’ve written many articles in the past about mobile design , so rather than repeat myself , I ’ve linked all relevant posts below .
Mistake # 9 : You Are Careless With Your Site
Have you ever actually shopped on your own website ?
Most shop owners obsessively check their Google Analytics stats but rarely set foot in their own store .
In order to fully optimize your shopping experience , you have to be your own customer .
Routinely in my Create A Profitable Online Store Course , I pretend to be a shopper and conduct full website critiques for the students in my class .
And more often than not , I find careless mistakes littered all over the site .
Here are some common ones .
Grammatical Errors –
You should go through every critical page on your website with a fine tooth comb for spelling and grammatical mistakes .
– You should go through every critical page on your website with a fine tooth comb for spelling and grammatical mistakes .
Broken Images – Click through every single page on your site and make sure all images are populated .

Slow Loading Pages – I once critiqued a site that took 25 seconds to load !
And the reason was because the student inadvertently used full resolution photos ( 3MB each )
– I once critiqued a site that took 25 seconds to load !
And the reason was because the student inadvertently used full resolution photos ( 3MB each ) Too Many Popups – Make note of any major annoyances while shopping .
For example , if you are showing a popup on every single page , you should stop
– Make note of any major annoyances while shopping .
For example , if you are showing a popup on every single page , you should stop Auto Play Video – Do n’t force customers to listen to a sales pitch or a speech recording .
When I see an autoplay video , I usually leave the site immediately , especially if I can’t figure out how to turn it off .
Conclusion
When it comes website design , most people place too much emphasis on aesthetics .
Just because you ’ve purchased an attractive store theme and you ’re using a fully hosted shopping cart like Shopify and Big Commerce does n’t mean you ’ll make sales .
The best way to improve your conversion rate is to solicit third party feedback and get an unbiased opinion about your store .
Is your store trustworthy ?
Is the product appealing ?
Would you shop there ?
If you can convey your value proposition clearly , you ’ll be successful .

Conrad Black , the disgraced British peer serving a 6 ½ - year sentence in Florida for defrauding millions from his former media empire , has asked President Bush to grant him clemency before leaving the White House .
The US justice department has confirmed that it is considering the request .
An agreement by the president could involve either pardoning the offence , which would erase the criminal record , or commuting it .
Black , 64 , was chairman and chief executive officer of Hollinger International the third largest media empire of its day , for eight years .
It included titles such as the Daily Telegraph , the Jerusalem Post and the New York Sun .
He quit the company in 2003 after he was found to have received millions of dollars in unauthorised payments .
In 2007 he was convicted , with three other Hollinger executives , of four counts of fraud amounting to $ 6.1 m ( £ 4 m ) and of obstructing the course of justice .
He began his sentence in March at a prison in Coleman , Florida .
The Sun-Times Media Group , the company that emerged from Hollinger International , has been taken aback by the clemency application , because Black always insisted he would not make any such request .
The firm was even more surprised when lawyers acting on behalf of the jailed tycoon submitted legal bills to his former business asking for it to pay for costs incurred in the clemency plea .
One unnamed source at the company told the Toronto - based Globe and Mail newspaper : " We try to draw the line at outrageous things , and this is sort of one of them . "
More than 5,000 applications for pardon and commutation are waiting to be processed by the justice department .
Black told the Globe and Mail this month that he was " horrifyingly busy with one thing and another " in jail .
When the paper asked what was taking up all his time , he replied : " Writing and reviewing legal initiatives , as well as dealing with my students " - an apparent reference to the history seminars he is said to be running .
Dear Straight Dope :
What exactly causes ejaculation ?
Is the brain sent some sort of pleasure signal that it relays back to the muscles in the region ?
Is there a threshold after which ejaculation occurs in every male ?
Or does continuous rubbing cause a pressure buildup in some way ?
Peter , Delaware
Gfactor replies :
A reasonable set of questions , Peter .
We ’ll take them in order .
What exactly causes ejaculation ?
Perhaps surprisingly , that ’s a tough one – the “ exactly ” part being the major sticking point .
Scientists are pretty sure it has something to do with the spine and some muscles , but they ’re not sure how it all fits together .
Part of the problem is a lack of careful research .
Physiologist Roy Levin reviewed the literature in 2005 and discovered that , “ of the four “ e ’s ” of male sexual function , excitation , erection , emission , and ejaculation , the mechanism that has been studied the least is the last . ”
Standard Practice in Sexual Medicine ( 2006 ) says , “ A detailed , non-disputed physio-anatomic description of the mechanism of human ejaculation has still to be produced . ”
In other words , we do n’t know everything just yet – we ’re still scratching our heads a bit .
The fact that we do n’t know everything , of course , does n’t mean we know nothing .
Another part of the problem is one of definition .
Scientists can’t even agree how to define orgasm , let alone appreciate all of its nuances .
Is the brain sent some sort of pleasure signal that it relays back to the muscles in the region ?
This is a good start .
We actually know a lot about this .
The answer is no – sort of .
Ejaculation is a spinal reflex ; it can be completed without the brain being involved .
Men with spinal cord injuries can still ejaculate , even though their brains receive no “ pleasure signals . ”
And recent research has isolated an area of the spinal cord containing what are known as the lumbar spinothalamic neurons , electrical stimulation of which causes ejaculation , or at least it does for the rats they ’ve tried it on .
The tricky part is that there ’s also a cerebral component to male orgasm – men can , to some extent , voluntarily resist ejaculation .
This aspect of the process is not as well understood .
Brain imaging studies have n’t turned up a single area of the brain that seems to be at work during ejaculation – or , more to the point , right before ejaculation .
And even if we could locate an orgasm center in the brain , we ’d still need to determine the relationship between this area and what otherwise seems to be a reflex .
Is there a threshold after which ejaculation occurs in every male ?
Yes , but again it ’s difficult to identify what the trigger is .
It ’s important to understand that ejaculation has two separate phases : emission , in which semen is deposited in the urethra , and propulsatile ejaculation , or ejaculation proper , in which the semen leaves the urethra in a hurry .
What we ’re concerned with here is what makes propulsatile ejaculation bound to happen .
The working hypothesis , called the “ pressure chamber ” theory , is outlined in The Science of Orgasm ( 2005 ) by Barry Komisaruk and colleagues .
1. Ducts fill with seminal fluid .
2. Fluid pressure builds up behind a closed sphincter valve , creating a “ pressure chamber . ”
3. Sudden release of the valve causes fluid to shoot out of urethra .
4. Rinse and repeat .
Somewhere between steps 2 and 3 , probably , is the point of no return .
But little is known about how this all actually works .
For a while , the theory was that distension of the prostatic urethra triggered the feeling of inevitability .
Levin , however , presents four pieces of evidence arguing against this notion .
First , subjects can be induced to have dry ejaculations , in which their bodies go through the motions minus any fluid buildup .
Second , ultrasound studies showed no “ pressure chamber ” in subjects who ejaculated .
Third , a series of experiments with a balloon catheter suggest that the small volume of semen in the ordinary ejaculation would not be enough to trigger such a reflex .
Fourth , scientists found that while rats whose urethras had been numbed with a lidocaine lavage did not ejaculate when the urethra was artificially stimulated , but they did during ordinary coitus – if your definition of ordinary coitus includes copulating while hooked up to a bunch of electrodes and surrounded by leering grad students .
At any rate , the rats got off even though their urethras were insensate , meaning that in rats at least some other mechanism must be at work .
In fact , scientists are n’t even sure what role the urethra plays in the physical sensation of orgasm – the evidence is confusing .
Levin reports at least one case of a man rating his dry orgasm as a 9 out of 10 in terms of pleasure , but notes that another study described dry orgasm as “ a ghostly echo of a remembered orgasm . ”
Or does continuous rubbing cause a pressure buildup in some way ?
Probably not , as rubbing is n’t a prerequisite for male orgasm .
Adolescent boys have nocturnal emissions , after all , and men without sensation in their genitals can still have orgasms .
Continuous rubbing does seem to stimulate mechanoreceptors in the glans penis , which triggers a reflex called the glans - cavernosovesicular reflex .
But this ca n’t be the only factor in play .
In addition to cases like those mentioned above , there is electroejaculation , which is accomplished via anal stimulation with an electric probe .
However , a recent study notes that this sort of ejaculation is less dramatic than orgasms achieved the usual way : “ Anterograde ejaculate is not produced in a projectile fashion , but rather as an intermittent release of semen during the course of the procedure .
Between 15 and 35 stimulations are usually needed to ensure emptying of the semen . ”
While research to date on ejaculation is inconclusive , we ’re finding out more all the time .
For example , a recent letter to the journal Medical Hypotheses suggests that ejaculation might relieve nasal congestion .
The people at Kleenex must be thinking : one way or another , they ’ll still need us .

Khaled Meshaal is exiled in the Syrian capital Damascus
The political leader of Hamas , Khaled Meshaal , says that the time has come for the West to lift its boycott on his Palestinian Islamist movement .
In a speech aired on Arab satellite TV , the exiled chief said it was " time to start talking to Hamas " .
Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip , declared a ceasefire after Israel called off its three - week offensive .
The group has claimed victory in the confrontation , saying it stopped Israel achieving its aims .
" I tell European nations ... three years of trying to eliminate Hamas is enough .
It is time for you to deal with Hamas , which has gained legitimacy through struggle , " Mr Meshaal said in a speech from the Syrian capital , Damascus .
" Now it is time to start to talk to Hamas , which is a legitimate force . "
Conditions for talks
The four main Middle East mediators - the EU , the US , the UN and Russia - have said there can be no dealing with Hamas until it recognises Israel , renounces violence and accepts interim peace deals signed by the Palestine Liberation Organisation .
Mr Meshaal said that Hamas had withstood Israel 's attacks , despite its military superiority .
" The Gaza Strip has scored a victory .
The enemy has failed and the resistance , together with our people and nation , has scored victory .
Hamas was dealt a blow it never imagined and will be quiet now for a long time
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak Gaza ruins beg questions of Hamas
" This is the first war we have won , the first real and large - scale war .
That is why the battle in Gaza is a real turning point in the struggle against the Zionist enemy , " he said .
" But we still have two important battles ahead of us .
The battle to break the siege and the battle to reopen the border crossings , particularly the Rafah crossing . "
Israel has blockaded the Palestinian enclave since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 .
It has refused to fully open border crossings to allow desperately needed aid , goods and construction materials into Gaza .
Mr Meshaal also said the " liberation of Palestine " was no longer " just a dream " .
" It is now a reality we can see , we are close to realising it , with God 's grace , " he said .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak also declared victory on Wednesday , as Israeli forces completed their withdrawal .
" We won in a big way , " Mr Barak told Israeli Channel 2 .
" Hamas was dealt a blow it never imagined and will be quiet now for a long time . "
Israel 's military chiefs have warned that they will respond swiftly to any " provocation " from Hamas .

The former first lady and New York State Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton hopes to close out the final note of her 2008 presidential campaign debt which is estimated to be $ 6.3 million dollars with at a fund raiser on Jan. 15 , 2008 .
The event will be held at Manhattan ’s Town Hall and is being billed as “ a final evening in support of Hillary Clinton for Presidential Debt Relief . ”
Performing at the event is Jon Bon Jovi .
Tickets range from $ 1000.00 and it is unclear if it has thus far been a sell out !
According to the Associated Press “ The former first lady and New York senator has been working to pay down her debt to clear the way for confirmation as President - elect : Barack Obama ’s secretary of state .
Federal ethics rules prohibit Cabinet officials from actively soliciting campaign contributions . ”
The former first lady wrote off $ 13.1 million in personal loans to the campaign .

As most people are no doubt aware , many of North America 's Christmas traditions have been imported from other countries , and many of them have pre-Christian , pagan sources .
In fact , the whole idea of having a winter celebration involving the exchange of gifts and the lighting of a festively decorated tree pre-dates the establishment of Christmas , dating back to festivals such as the Germanic Yule and the Roman Saturnalia .
Not all of those Old World traditions made it to modern North America , though .
For instance , when 's the last time you or your neighbours included a shaggy , horned demon in your holiday festivities ?
The demon in question ( pictured above ) is called Krampus , and in some Alpine countries he is considered a traditional companion of St. Nicholas .
While St. Nick rewards children for good behaviour , the job of Krampus is to keep them in line with the threat of a birching .
In the Austrian ski resort of Schladming , Krampus fans gather every December to dress in carved masks and goat - hair costumes , wearing cowbells to warn of their approach .
According to Wikipedia , " They are typically young men in their teens and early twenties and are generally intoxicated .
They roam the streets of this typically quiet town and hit people with their switches .
It is not considered wise for young women to go out on this night , as they are popular targets . "

Iranian banks illegally shifted billions of dollars through American financial institutions in recent years , and authorities suspect some of the money may have been used to finance Iran ’s nuclear and missile programs .
Some of the world ’s top banks helped Iran get around international sanctions even as the rogue nation was steering its blood money into the hands of terror groups , prosecutors charged Friday .
Ten international banks including British - based Lloyds laundered “ billions of dollars ” for Iran through New York banks , Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau announced Friday .
The scheme helped Iran turn its dirty money into greenbacks , which it could then use to buy goods prohibited by international sanctions .
Some of the money went to fund terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah , and to help Iran get materials , including tungsten , for long - range missiles , sources said .
“ This is one of the biggest investigations we ’ve ever conducted . ”
Lloyds admitted it laundered $ 300 million and agreed to pay a $ 350 million fine and open its books to investigators .
If records show that the bank knew it was helping Iran break international law or foster terrorism , Lloyds could face criminal prosecution , authorities said .
None of the other nine banks was identified because they are working out similar agreements with Morgenthau ’s investigators .
The CIA will also review the bank records .

In one internal document , Lloyds said transactions from the London branches of Iranian banks should be processed in “ the normal way , ” which meant removing information that would tie them to Iran , according to the agreement .
Lloyds eventually dedicated specific employees to scrubbing the Iranian transactions , the agreement said .
Over 12 years , “ about $ 350 million was allowed to move through the U.S. financial system that at a minimum should have been scrutinized , ” Matthew Friedrich , acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department ’s Criminal Division , told reporters yesterday in Washington .
Nine Months
Over the next nine months , Lloyds has agreed to provide financial information on the transactions , Friedrich said .
The vast majority of information already has been turned over , the Justice Department said .
“ We can look at where did this money go , where was it sent from and we can do the scrutiny that should have been performed in the first place , ” he said .
One of the main questions U.S. authorities will focus on is whether any of the money funded terrorism , Friedrich said .
“ The consensus view is that Iran is one of if not the most active state sponsors of terrorist groups , ” Weber said .
“ There ’s a lot of people [ in the U.S. government ] thinking about ways to make it much harder for Iran to move money around . ”
The laundering began more than 13 years ago and ran through 2007 , according to the DA ’s probe .
Lloyds also washed money for Sudanese banks , even though financial dealings with both governments are prohibited by international sanctions .
In the scheme , first disclosed last March by The News , Iran would deposit huge sums in the international banks , which then converted it into dollars and parceled it out under altered names and routing codes .
The money was moved through a series of smaller banks and ultimately drawn on for banned purposes .
“ You could n’t tell where the money was coming from or where it was going to . ”
Because the origin of the funds was disguised , the money slipped through computerized filters at New York banks designed to stop any transfers to and from Iranian interests , Morgenthau said .
Much of the money went to Iranian banks , which typically send money to terror groups in the West Bank , Gaza , Lebanon and Afghanistan through front organizations and so - called charities , according to the Treasury Department ’s Office of Foreign Assets Control .
U.S. laws bar the transfer of funds from Iran and other sanctioned countries without authorization by the U.S. Treasury Department .
Assistant District Attorney Adam Kaufman said the bank ’s conduct did n’t necessarily violate laws in the U.K. , where Lloyds is based .
Last month , federal prosecutors in the U.S. sued to gain control of a 36 - story Manhattan office tower they claim belongs to the Iranian government ’s Bank Melli .
Farhsid Jahedi , President of the Alavi Foundation that owns a 60 percent stake in the tower , also was arrested for destroying documents .

FYI ,
It looks like mod_wombat ( provides Lua scripting for Apache web server ) will be released as a core module ( i.e. if you download the web server , you will get mod_wombat --- no need to download it separately ) .
As part of this change , it is likely the module will get renamed .
Mod_lua is not really an option because there are several dead projects with that name and it is felt that changing the name of mod_wombat to mod_lua will be too confusing .
FWIW , the current lead contender is mod_luau .
Anyway I 've not had as much time to work with this module as I 'd like .
The Google Summer of Code project involving mod_wombat never got anywhere ( the student had to drop out ) .
But if you are looking to use Lua in a web context , I recommend checking it out .

You have a blank sheet of paper in front of you .
What do you do with it ?
While most people would write on it or fold it into some form of origami , artist Peter Callesen creates amazing sculptures and cut-outs from his paper .
Born in Denmark , Peter Callesen studied at Goldsmith ’s College in London .
His work explores the relationship between two and three dimensions and is incredibly imaginative .
He seems to use the theme of fairytales as many of his work deals with dreams and the impossible .
He explores the lost land of childhood , centering between dreams and reality .
Peter says this about his choice of paper : “ I find the A4 sheet of paper interesting to work with , because it is probably the most common and consumed media and format for carrying information today , and in that sense it is something very loaded .
This means that we rarely notice the actual materiality of the A4 paper .
By removing all the information and starting from scratch using the blank white 80gsm A4 paper as a base for my creations , I feel that I have found a material which we all are able to relate to , and at the same time is non-loaded and neutral and therefore easier to fill with different meanings .
The thin white paper also gives the paper sculptures a fragility which underlines the tragic and romantic theme of the works . ”
I love the detail in his artwork .
Some of these cut -outs just pop out at you and others make you wonder ‘ Wow , how did he do that ? ’
This kind of work makes me wonder one thing though :
How many papercuts do you think he gets from his art ?

Many thanks to Peter Callesen !

The time is now to start translating the hopes and expectations of change into action .
THE BUSH days are finally over -- dramatically put to an end by the first African American president of a country built on slavery .
With Barack Obama 's inauguration as president on January 20 , there will be another wave of the kind of celebration that could be found in cities across the country on Election Night - - not only marking the end of a hated regime , but of the history made by its successor .
Millions of people are counting on getting a hearing from the new White House .
And that has the new White House ... a little worried .
Members of the new administration have admitted to the press that they fear hopes in Obama may be running too high -- that the millions who celebrated his victory may expect too much , too soon .
In a recent interview , Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said , " You do n't need to have demonstrations in front of the White House to convince this president that there is a disparate impact in the African American community around issues such as health care and education .
He 's got that . "
An election - eve rally for Barack Obama in Lincoln , Neb. ( Alexandra Matzke )
Jarrett 's message appears to contradict the message that Obama carried throughout his campaign -- that organizing from the bottom up was the key to progress .
" We 're the change we 've been waiting for , " Obama often said .
But according to Jarrett 's logic , the incoming Obama administration itself will be the agent of change -- and because of that , activists do n't need to protest .
Yet a look at U.S. history shows the opposite .
Fundamental social change has always come as a result of struggle from below .
On the campaign trail , Obama paid homage to this history with his inspiring campaign rhetoric -- complete with references to the sit - down strikers of the 1930s and civil rights activists of the 1960s .
Nevertheless , Obama was the candidate of a party dominated by , and devoted to , the interests of big business .
In the White House , he will preside over a vast state machine that 's intertwined with capital in countless ways .
He 'll be commander in chief of armed forces that are occupying two countries -- Iraq and Afghanistan -- and supporting Israel 's war on the Palestinian people .
It is this reality that will shape Obama 's policies .
To be sure , Obama has made some important promises -- like closing down the U.S. torture center in Guantánamo .
He also says he 's willing to sign the Employee Free Choice Act , making it easier for workers to join unions .
If he makes good on these promises , it would certainly be a major shift from the Bush administration , which missed no opportunity to attack workers or trash civil liberties .
Nevertheless , Obama himself is warning that we can't expect all that campaign rhetoric to make it into action .
As Obama said in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos , " George , I want to be realistic here , not everything that we talked about during the campaign are we going to be able to do on the pace we had hoped . ''
Thus , in the coming weeks and months , activists will be told that they have to wait for things to improve -- to be patient and not expect change overnight .
BUT MANY people understand that our side has to get organized - - right now .
Protests of thousands around the country to protest Israel 's attack on Gaza are one example .
The vibrant new LGBT rights movement that arose in response to the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 is another .
To understand this dynamic , it 's useful to look back at the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932 .
With the country mired in a catastrophic economic crisis , FDR won because of the repudiation of the Republican Herbert Hoover who came before him .
Yet FDR came into office with the not - so - radical plan to balance the budget .
The first steps of the new Roosevelt administration were directed toward restoring U.S. businesses and banks .
But as workers became more organized , they successfully pressured FDR to put into effect reforms like the Works Progress Administration jobs program , the National Labor Relations
Act guaranteeing the right of workers to organize , and , of course , Social Security .
Similarly , Obama 's election has revealed a far - reaching hunger for change that had been largely unexpressed .
Now is the time to start translating this sentiment into activism -- because it is only through struggle that the widespread desire for change can become reality .
Historian Howard Zinn made this point in a speech at Binghamton University just after the election :
Why is all the political rhetoric limited ?
Why is the set of solutions given to social and economic issues so cramped and so short of what is needed ... And , yes , Obama , who obviously is more attuned to the needs of people than his opponent , you know , Obama , who is more far - sighted , more thoughtful , more imaginative -- why has he been limited in what he is saying ?
The key to broadening the political horizons , Zinn argues , is what we do next :
If you look at history , you see people felt powerless and felt powerless and felt powerless -- until they organized , and they got together , and they persisted , and they did n't give up , and they built social movements .
Whether it was the anti-slavery movement or the Black movement of the 1960s or the antiwar movement in Vietnam or the women 's movement , they started small and apparently helpless ; they became powerful enough to have an effect on the nation and on national policy .
Today 's struggles may seem modest by comparison .
But they , too , have the potential to mobilize millions of people to fight for the things they urgently need -- from health care reform and organizing unions , to ending discrimination based on race , gender and sexual orientation .
The time to fight is now .
People with Type 2 diabetes on a high - fiber diet kept their blood sugar under better control when they ate foods like beans and nuts instead of the recommended whole - grain diet , researchers have found .
Beans and nuts are among foods that only modestly increase blood glucose levels ; scientists describe these foods as having a low glycemic index .
The new study , which lasted six months , is one of the largest and longest to assess the impact of foods with a low - glycemic index , researchers said .
Participants on the low - glycemic diet also saw significant improvements in cholesterol after six months , with increases in HDL , the so - called “ good ” cholesterol associated with a reduced risk of heart disease , the study found .
“ That ’s an important issue today , because there ’s a double whammy for people who are diabetic , " said Dr. David J. A. Jenkins , lead author of the report and a professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto .
" If they ’re men , they have twice the risk of heart disease , and if they ’re women , they have four times the risk .
If you can hit the heart disease to which they ’re particularly vulnerable , you may have something useful . "
Educators and policy makers , including Secretary of Education Arne Duncan , have said in recent days that they hope President Obama ’s example as a model student could inspire millions of American students , especially blacks , to higher academic performance .
Now researchers have documented what they call an Obama effect , showing that a performance gap between African - Americans and whites on a 20 - question test administered before Mr. Obama ’s nomination all but disappeared when the exam was administered after his acceptance speech and again after the presidential election .
The inspiring role model that Mr. Obama projected helped blacks overcome anxieties about racial stereotypes that had been shown , in earlier research , to lower the test - taking proficiency of African - Americans , the researchers conclude in a report summarizing their results .
“ Obama is obviously inspirational , but we wondered whether he would contribute to an improvement in something as important as black test - taking , ” said Ray Friedman , a management professor at Vanderbilt University , one of the study ’s three authors .
“ We were skeptical that we would find any effect , but our results surprised us . ”
WASHINGTON , Jan 11 ( Reuters ) - The World Bank said on Sunday it plans to publish the names of all companies it bars from receiving Bank contracts , and named three Indian firms .
“ There are currently three companies that ( have ) been debarred along with their affiliates under the Bank group ’s corporate procurement program , ” the Bank said in a statement .
It said it had barred IT company Satyam Computer Services SATY .
BO for eight years and Wipro Technologies WIPR .
BO for four years for " improper benefits to bank staff " .
It said it also barred India ’s Mefasoft Consultants for four years in December 2007 for “ participating in a joint venture with Bank staff while conducting business with the Bank ” .

The immune system 's battle against invading bacteria reaches its peak activity at night and is lowest during the day .
Experiments with the laboratory model organism , Drosophila melanogaster , reveal that the specific immune response known as phagocytosis oscillates with the body 's circadian rhythm , according to Stanford researchers who presented their findings at the American Society for Cell Biology ( ASCB ) 48th Annual Meeting , Dec. 13 - 17 , 2008 in San Francisco .
" These results suggest that immunity is stronger at night , consistent with the hypothesis that circadian proteins upregulate restorative functions such as specific immune responses during sleep , when animals are not engaged in metabolically costly activities , " explains Mimi Shirasu - Hiza of Stanford University .
Shirasu - Hiza and her colleague David Schneider turned to the fruit fly , Drosophila melanogaster , as the model system to help them define the relationship between innate immunity and circadian rhythm , which is the oscillating protein clock or timing mechanism in cells .
Circadian rhythm paces the human body as well as the fruit fly through its days and nights , setting the rest / activity cycle that cues when to eat , sleep and mate over a 24 - hour cycle .
In phagocytosis , the innate immune response targeted by the Stanford researchers , specific immune cells engulf and destroy the bacteria invading the body .
In humans , immune responses such as phagocytosis not only are involved in clearing bacterial infection but also are implicated in a growing number of human diseases , including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders .
In previous experiments , the researchers noted that flies sick with bacterial infection lost their circadian rhythm and that flies lacking circadian rhythm were highly susceptible to infection .
The flies were infected with two different bacterial pathogens , Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae .
To determine whether circadian proteins regulate immunity , the scientists infected flies with these pathogens at different times of day or night .
The flies infected at night had a better chance of surviving than did the flies infected during the day .
In addition , the researchers also detected low phagocytic activity in some flies with a mutated circadian clock .

George H.W. Bush : FOX Interview VIDEO
Former Presidentwas interviewed by FOX News hoston Sunday morning .
The elder Bush weighed in on the political aspirations of his son Jeb Bush .
He went so far as to say he'd like to see him run for president .
He really emphasized how smart the former Florida governor is - almost a nod to the fact that ' W ' turned out to be a less than learned leader .
George H.W. Bush , who served from 1989 - 1993 , is affectionately known as ' 41 ' by his son George W. Bush , who is ending his 8 year stint as the 43rd President of the United States .
Check out photos and the FOX video exchange below .
Additional video discussion of George W's failures here .
A California congressman has proposed legislation that would require cigarette - like health warning labels be placed on video games made for mature audiences .
Exposure to this picture may cause aggression
As Reg Hardware reported earlier today , Democrat Congressman Joe Baca introduced " The Video Game Health Labeling Act of 2009 " to the US House of Representatives last week in an effort to force a warning onto all titles rated " Teen " ( 13 + ) or higher by the Electronics Software Ratings Board ( ESRB ) .
The label would read , " WARNING : Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior . "
Virginia Republican Frank
Wolf co-sponsored the bill , which has been referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
The label would be required both for video games sold retail and distributed electronically .
" The video game industry has a responsibility to parents , families and to consumers — to inform them of the potentially damaging content that is often found in their products , " said Baca in a statement .
" They have repeatedly failed to live up to this responsibility .
Meanwhile research continues to show a proven link between playing violent games and increased aggression in young people .
American families deserve to know the truth about these potentially dangerous products . "
The congressman , however , did n't specify exactly how the game industry has failed to inform customers about game content — or what it 's responsibilities are beyond prominently advertising ratings assigned by the ESRB .
Baca — who fancies himself an advocate on issues of sex and violence in the media — said recent studies point to a " neurological link " between playing violent video games and aggressive behavior in children and teenagers .
He cites research from the trade journal Pediatrics , the University of Indiana , University of Missouri , and Michigan State University .
We 've already touched on the Pediatrics study recently , so let 's go down the list from there .
The University of Indiana study fingered by Baca showed that brain scans of kids who played violent video games displayed an increase in " emotional arousal . "
The principal investigator , however , fell short of claiming a link between video games and real - life violence , but encouraged parents to be aware of the types of games their kids play .
The 2005 University of Missouri study showed that when exposed to real - life violent images , subjects who frequently played violent games showed a diminished reaction to the pictures in brain scans .
When the same participants were given an opportunity to " punish " a nonexistent opponent in the form of a loud blast of sound in a competitive game , avid gamers dealt out the most severe ( loudest ) punishment .
Finally , the Michigan State University research found that 13 male participants displayed brain activity patterns that are " considered as characteristic for aggressive cognitions and affects , " when scanned while playing a violent first person shooter .
On the other side of the argument , a study by the University of Essex last year showed aggressive games may actually help lower the number of violent youth crimes .
“ I am proud to introduce the Video Game Health Labeling Act of 2009 , and am hopeful my legislation can work to stop the growing influence of violent media on America ’s children and youth , ” stated Baca .
Whether video games are actually the cause of real - life violence or simply the subject of overblown controversy and fears like Rock and Roll or D&D was to previous generations — few would argue that young children should be readily exposed to violent material .
But health warning label solving the problem of kids getting ahold of violent games is certainly rather questionable .
Frankly , the bill smacks of easy political grandstanding .
And most of this type of legislation tends to get struck down .
The type of parent who would buy their 8 - year - old Grand Theft Auto is also probably not someone who 's going to catch the additional warning — given they 've already ignored the ESRB warning , the title , the guns on the cover , and the description on the back of the box . ®
Back in October 2007 , I walked a silent picket line in front of a concert venue in Columbia , South Carolina .
Donnie McClurkin – a so - called “ former homosexual ” – was performing at a fundraising event for then Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
McClurkin ’s inclusion in the event had enraged gay and lesbian activists who felt betrayed by Obama – who had then claimed , and continues to claim to be a “ fervent advocate for gay and lesbian rights . ”
The Obama campaign extended a fig leaf by inviting a gay pastor to give the invocation at the event .
That pastor was Rev. Andy Sidden , my boss – the senior pastor at Garden of Grace United Church of Christ in Columbia , South Carolina .
Rev. Sidden was politely received by the crowd – but still drew the ire of some within the gay and lesbian community for “ selling out ” and serving as Obama ’s cover for this travesty being perpetrated against us .
Rev. Sidden , who is a big fan of Obama , was thrilled at the invitation and did n’t see his invitation a lame attempt to rectify and obvious slight , but instead used his prayer time to try to heal the situation and reach out to those who may want to vilify our community .
The Right Reverend V. Gene Robinson , the first openly gay Episcopal Bishop of New Hampshire , finds himself in a similar situation today .
The bishop , whose election has stirred controversy and schism within the wider Anglican Church , has been asked by Obama ’s inauguration team to pray at the opening event of the Inaugural Week activities .
The “ We are One ” celebration will be held Sunday , January 18 at the Lincoln Memorial .
Robinson is positive about his invitation saying “ an indication of the new president ’s commitment to being the President of ALL the people .
I am humbled and overjoyed at this invitation , and it will be my great honor to be there representing the Episcopal Church , the people of New Hampshire , and all of us in the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender community . ”
Robinson ’s selection comes on the heels of the announcement that Rev. Sharon Watkins , the General Minister and President of the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) , will be the first woman preacher for the January 21st National Prayer Service .
Skeptics in our community will again accuse Obama of wanting to have it both ways – coddling and exalting homophobes while offering only symbolic gestures to faith leaders in our community .
It certainly seems that way when Rick Warren ’s honor comes before Bishop Robinson and Rev. Watkins .
However , Obama has offered a very large platform and a very large opportunity to both Bishop Robinson and Rev. Watkins .
Like Rev.
Sidden before them – they have a chance to show America what it ’s like to be a faithful Christian in a pluralistic society .
Robinson , 61 , said both Obama and Vice President - elect Joe Biden will attend the event , and Obama is expected to speak .
As for himself , Robinson said he does n’t yet know what he ’ll say , but he knows he wo n’t use a Bible .
“ While that is a holy and sacred text to me , it is not for many Americans , ” Robinson said .
“ I will be careful not to be especially Christian in my prayer .
This is a prayer for the whole nation . ”
Robinson said his prayer will be reflective of the times .
“ I think these are sober and difficult times that we are facing , ” he said .
“ It wo n’t be a happy , clappy prayer . ”
It will be interesting to see the contrast between Warren and Bishop Robinson and the witness it creates for our nation .
While Warren ’s followers wring their hands over whether or not his prayer will be “ Christian enough ” and invoke the name of Jesus – Robinson is looking toward healing for a hurting and suffering nation .
That is the mark of a good pastor .

It would be nice if the “ saver ” part referred to : you could look at photos of mountain vistas or cute kittens and feel good about the habitats and animals you ’re helping out .
Sadly , screensavers were designed to extend the life of monochrome CRT monitors .
No one uses those any more , and no one should use screensavers .
Screensavers can actually boost electricity use by preventing computers from entering energy - saving sleep modes .
Plus , active monitors generate more heat , making air conditioners work harder .
Get rid of your screensavers , no matter how cute the kittens are .
Many devices sip power even when they ’re not really on .
TVs , for example , are always watching for you to click the remote and so constantly draw some electricity .
This , also called vampire power or phantom load , is used by any device with a clock , timer or touchpad .
And chargers draw power even when their phones or computers are n’t connected to them .
According tofor five to 10 per cent of all electricity used in Canadian homes .
At the office or home office , plug all your equipment ( PCs , monitors , speakers , scanners and printers ) into a power bar and flick the bar ’s switch when you ’re not working .
It ’s a persistent myth that repeated on / off cycles damage computers .
However , a study at theconcluded hard drives , for example , are not harmed by frequent shutdowns , and a sustainability paper from thefoundare actually harmed most by the heat stress created when a PC is on .
The only component worn out by on / off cycles is the actual power switch and “ they are typically rated for 40,000 on / off cycles .
Over a 10 year period , you would have to turn your computer on and off 11 times a day , 365 days per year to hit 40,000 . ”
If you ’re not using your computer , turn it off .
Not true either .
According to the Green Campus Initiative , whether idling or crunching big spreadsheet numbers , computers use about 45 watts for the CPU and 80 watts for a CRT monitor .
Enabling the energy - saving features on newer PCs , however , drops consumption to about 15 watts total .
Also from Harvard comes this eye - opening number : oneleft on all day is responsible for more than 1,500 pounds of atmospheric CO2 over a year .
All of which means , as a minimum , turn off office PCs and peripherals when they ’re not in use , and get rid of screensavers .
To save even more electricity , slay those vampires with power bars .
A power bar at every workstation may cost some money up - front but that investment will come back as long - term savings and the positive feeling that you ’ve actually done some good .

One of the many penalties of watching movies on TV is the prevalence of bugs .
This is the nickname adopted by media makers for those little channel logos and watermarks that hop onto your screen .
Sometimes these translucent signatures surface at intervals , to minimally satisfy FCC channel identification demands .
Others let you know the movie you ’re watching , or will be later .
But just as often the bugs just squat in a corner forever , teasing your eye away from the movie .
Bugs are to the 2000s what editing and time - compressing were to earlier eras .
“ Movies , uncut , ” boasts the IFC bug .
But not unspoiled .
Bugs are bad enough when they are hovering in a black vacuum , made forlorn by letterboxing .
But they really jump into competition when they take up part of the image .
How can you watch what actors are doing when there ’s something faintly readable floating up from below ?
I find it impossible not to look at a bug occasionally .
In dark shots , sometimes it ’s the most visible thing on the screen .
Even in bright shots I stare at it .
Maybe I ’m hoping that it will be different this time .
Yet when it changes , as it does on the Lifetime channel , I watch it more attentively , which only makes me more annoyed .
It ’s like the mesmeric spell of Time Code , ticking away the movie ’s life , and yours .
I ’m not the first to complain .
An eloquent manifesto , originally called Squash the Bugs , dates back to 2000 , when the infestation was starting .
Several other souls participated in the movement .
We know why bugs are swarming all over TV .
Somebody better dressed than you or me is worried that we will be recording A Christmas Story or Smokey and the Bandit or Stranger in My Bed .
We might even try to sell copies , or post a clip online .
In principle , the bug is a badge of ownership , warning that we could be prosecuted .
In practice , nobody expects to sue every user , so bugs help spread the brand .
It ’s like putting a designer logo on a shirt , making you a walking ad .
Who would n’t want their bug , microscopic as it is , all over YouTube ( which of course tacks on its own bug ) ?
But like everything else that we take for granted , bugs are n’t new .
In their earlier form , they ’re rather likable .
Silent but deadly
Movie bugs go back to the first years of cinema , when producers were no less worried about media piracy than they are today .
Between 1895 and 1915 , films circulated very freely around the world , and enterprising crooks happily duped originals and passed them off as their own productions .
To block this , filmmakers tried to find ways to keep their trademarks on the film .
The obvious step was to put the trademark in the intertitles , and many companies did .
Here is one for For His Son , a 1912 Griffith film from American Biograph .
( What did the protagonist do for his son ?
He created a soft drink called Dopocoke , which turns the college boy into a hopeless addict . )
Note the handsome AB insignia .
But of course a pirate could simply replace such original titles with ones of his own .
The next logical step was to incorporate the trademark into the images , which could n’t be replaced .
Without the technology to create near - invisible superimpositions , the filmmakers took the obvious course .
They put the company logo into the set .
The AB circle typically appeared as a wall decoration .
Biograph characters loved to furnish their surroundings to highlight this motif , preferring to put it at eye level and frame center .
The logo could be found in unexpected places , like movie theatres ( Those Awful Hats , 1908 ) , and it could brighten the dreariest hovel ( What Shall We Do with Our Old ? , 1911 ) .
The plaque ’s popularity stretched back to Civil War days ( In the Border States , 1910 ) , and even in medieval times a king might mount the stylish AB on a brick wall ( The Sealed Room , 1909 ) .
Not to be outdone , Biograph ’s competitor , the Vitagraph company , had a beautiful soaring eagle logo , which conveniently furnished a striking V graphic .
Judging from the evidence of this 1908 film , however , Vitagraph had a sideline in manufacturing safes .
The practice of building the trademark into the mise - en - scene seems to have begun in France .
Georges Méliès , whose fantasy films were popular around the world , took measures to counter piracy early .
You can see his Star - Film logo on the building stone in the left corner of this frame from La Danseuse microscopique ( 1902 ) .
Shift it to the right corner and we ’d have a modern - day bug .
At the very top of this entry is a frame from Le Voyage de Gulliver à Lilliput et chez les géants ( 1902 ) .
There Méliès attached the Star - Film seal to the barrel sitting just left of center .
But Méliès did n’t always shove his imprimatur to the edge of the frame .
In Le Tonnerre de Jupiter ( 1903 ) it sits just below the eagle that Zeus bestrides .
In the earlier Diable au convent ( 1899 ) , Méliès exercised another option , simply signing his image as if it were a painting .
To a large extent , it was .
Léon Gaumont had two marques , each enclosed in a chrysanthemum ring .
The most famous one is a majestic Gaumont , but an alternative , ELGE ( that is , LG ) , haunts Alice Guy ’s Billet de banque ( 1907 ) .
First , in a café , the logo is attached to a table , and later it ’s a decorative baseboard in a police station .
In Guy ’s Le Frotteur ( 1907 ) , Gaumont simiply stuck its logo to a chair leg .
Then there ’s the Pathé Frères rooster .
Easy enough to embed that , you ’d think .
Just have a rooster stroll through a shot now and then — not only barnyard scenes , but ones set in a courtroom or a factory .
Still , roosters are pretty accessible to any film pirate , so Pathé went the more ordinary route of weaving its logo into the set .
An insistent example comes in The Physician of the Castle ( 1907 ) , possibly the source for Griffith ’s The Lonely Villa ( 1908 ) and Lois Weber / Phillips Smalley ’s Suspense ( 1913 ) .
The plot is sort of a 1907 Panic Room .
The logo is initially a plaque in the parlor of the castle , visible just behind the kneeling doctor .
An identical plaque is perched in nearly the same spot on the wall of the doctor ’s own parlor , as we can tell when his family is besieged by the invading tramps .
The tramps pass through another room , where the trademark stands proudly on another wall , on screen right .
And when the wife tries to phone the husband for help , we get an insert that shows the Pathé cock nearly perched on her shoulder .
Why do I find the old bugs charming and the new ones annoying ?
I suppose it ’s partly because the old ones were hand - crafted , not the result of keyboard twiddling .
They are tangible .
They are part of the scene ’s space .
Hard to see on DVD , the embedded marques are striking in 35 mm projection , and spotting them is part of the pleasure of early film .
Moreover , the filmmakers intended them to be there , or at least they accepted the need for them .
But what director today is happy when the Sundance bug creeps into her compositions ?
The old bugs seem to have gone extinct around 1912 , but they will cling to their films .
They bear witness to filmmaking of a specific time , and they anticipate problems that persist today .
In tackling the threat of piracy , the old bugs seem at once naïve and intelligent .
I see them as a rational solution to a hard problem , narrative consistency be damned .
Today ’s bugs , floating on top of the story world , seem more like corporate tattoos or graffiti .
They do n’t exist within the action , so you could argue that they are less disruptive .
But they become a different sort of distraction , hovering halfway between the story world and the space of viewing .
Bugs are spectres haunting the film .
On rare occasions , a modern add - on can be appropriate .
In a Méliès film on the recent Flicker Alley set , L’Oracle de Delphes ( 1903 ) , some TV agency has clapped its own digital bug into the lower right corner .
It really is about beetle - size , and it dares to be a single eye looking back at you .
That icon adds a touch of peculiarity not out of keeping with the Méliès aesthetic .
You can argue that this smirch on the image is a minor sacrilege .
But I suspect that the Master of Montreuil would have grinned in approval .

Thanks to Jason Mittell for helping me name these pests .
And all hail Turner Classic Movies for keeping its bugs to a minimum .

PS 19 January 2009 : “ Subliminal ” bugs : I had hoped to include a frame illustrating the anti-piracy stamp used on current 35 mm releases , but could n’t find one quickly .
This mark consists of a tight pattern of dots resembling a character in Braille .
The stamp would presumably be copied if someone shot off the screen or ran the film through a telecine .
How effective these bugs are at tracing pirate copies I can’t say , but you can detect them , especially in bright scenes ; I usually notice one every third reel or so , just left of the center of the frame .
I ’ll keep looking for a frame and try to add one to this entry .
John Powers alerted me to the fact that even Michael Snow ’s Région Centrale got the bug treatment when it was telecast on Italy ’s RAI 3 TV .
Thanks to John for this scary example .

Yes !
There are artists who work with paint and clay , and then there are artists who create bizarre and thought - provoking art from slightly less conventional materials to prove a point .
This collection features sculptures made from guns and bullets , high - speed bullet photography , illustrations of what happens when bullets pierce flesh and even drawings made by shooting at metal and paper with a sub- machine gun .
Reliquaries Made of Guns and Ammunition
Artist Al Farrow combined religious imagery with guns and bullets to startling effect in his 2001 series , ‘ Reliquaries ’ .
The sculptures are an ironic play on the medieval cult of the relic as well as a statement about continued ties between war and religion .
Farrow says that in the making of these pieces , he was absolutely astonished at the ease with which one can procure huge amounts of gun related paraphernalia .
High - Speed Bullet Photography
Photographer David Neff keeps his techniques top secret , declining to divulge any details as to how he captures such amazing images .
In this series of high - speed bullet photography , he fires .22 bullets at various objects like pears , crayons and cigarettes and takes the photo just as the bullet is grazing or passing through them .
The result is a visually stunning reminder of just how destructive bullets can be .
Furniture and Sculpture Made from Discarded Cambodian Weapons
Sculptor Sasha Constable saw opportunity in the 125,000 weapons that were discarded by the Cambodian government after 30 years of war .
Constable , along with a small arms specialist with the European Union , used the guns to create furniture and sculptures in The Peace Art Project Cambodia ( PAPC ) in November 2003 .
Among the items created were a coffee table , dining chair , settee , rocking chair and elephant sculpture .
Life Size Wax Figures with Cannon Wounds
Two life size male and female wax statues give us an idea of just how damaging a 20 mm cannon wound really is in “ A Memory of Matter ” by Petroc Dragon Sesti .
In these works , Sesti sought to explore “ the stillness of terminal violence ” .
The figures were made in collaboration with the British Army , created from hard wax heated to human body temperature to reveal a moment of mutilation frozen in time .
Art Made with Submachine Guns , Rocket Fuel and Pyrotechnics
Matt Stromberg is not your typical art professor .
The Savannah College of Art and Design professor of sculpture uses anything but typical materials and methods in his work .
Stromberg began wondering if he could carve with a submachine gun after watching a colleague work with a pneumatic chisel , which makes similar sounds while in use .
That led to his current projects , in which he ‘ sculpts ’ metal panels with rocket fuel , explosives , pyrotechnics , propellants and , yes , bullets .
Stromberg had to go through special training and get licensed to use these materials .
“ I think it ’s really a fancy way of doing what every artist does , ” Stromberg says .
“ The result is the same as if I grabbed a chunk of charcoal and drew on paper I was going to detonate . ”
Bullet Hole as Abstract Montage
If you did n’t know what you were looking at , this piece by Mat Collishaw might look like some kind of abstract painting .
Then you realize it ’s hair , skin and the gore left behind by a speeding bullet .
It ’s one large photo made up of 15 frames , mounted on light boxes for extra in - your - face effect .
Of the image , taken from a pathology textbook , Collishaw says , “ There ’s a religious beauty and animal sexuality in something so abhorrent . ”
Not all would agree , but it ’s a powerful image nonetheless .
“ Bullet Proof Vest ” Created from Bullets
Artist Ross Rodriquez made this ‘ bulletproof vest ’ with 30 caliber rifle shells .
The artist , who usually works in printmaking and film , often explores the theme of gun violence in urban America .
Bullet Elephant
Spotted by Derek Farr at the Detroit Zoo , this elephant is a little … different than the ones roaming around outside .
It ’s a sculpture created by Mary Engel , who says of her creation , ” Elephants have become endangered due to the “ gold ” of the elephant , its ivory tusks .
The bullets which make this sculpture are beautiful but menacing , as they remind us of humans ’ destruction of exotic creatures ” .
There are few areas where skepticism is more important than how one invests one 's life savings .
Yet intelligent and educated people , some of them naïve about finance and others quite knowledgeable , have been ruined by schemes that turned out to be highly dubious and quite often fraudulent .
The most dramatic example of this in American history is the recent announcement that Bernard Madoff , a highly regarded money manager and a former chairman of Nasdaq , has for years been running a very sophisticated Ponzi scheme , which by his own admission has defrauded wealthy investors , charities and other funds of at least $ 50 ...

3 EX - GOVERNORS SERVED TIME 3 EX - GOVERNORS SERVED TIME
Three former Illinois governors have gone to prison in the past 35 years : • Otto Kerner , a Democrat who was governor from 1961 to 1968 , served less than a year of a three year prison sentence after his conviction in 1973 on bribery , tax evasion and other counts .
He was convicted of arranging favorable horse racing dates as governor in return for getting horse racing association stock at reduced prices .
He died in 1976 .
• Dan Walker , a Democrat in office from 1973 to 1977 , served 1 ½ years of a seven - year prison sentence after pleading guilty in 1987 to bank fraud , misapplication of funds and perjury .
The charges were unrelated to service as governor .
• George Ryan , a Republican who was governor from 1999 to 2003 , was convicted of corruption in 2006 for steering state contracts and leases to political insiders while he was Illinois secretary of State and then governor .
He is serving a 6 ½ - year prison term .
Source : The Associated Press CHICAGO  Corruption has tainted politics here since Al Capone 's heyday , but the arrest Tuesday of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich revealed alleged conspiracy and bribery schemes so brazen that veteran investigators and prosecutors could barely contain their revulsion .
" The conduct would make Lincoln roll over in his grave , " said U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald .
In breathtaking detail , the criminal complaint describes the efforts of the Democratic governor and his chief of staff John Harris , who also was arrested , to " sell the U.S. Senate seat " once held by President - elect Barack Obama for a high - paying job , promises of campaign funds , a Cabinet post or ambassadorship or corporate - board seats for Blagojevich 's wife , Patricia .
POLITICS BLOG :
What scandal might mean for Obama Senate seat READ :
The formal complaint JUSTICE DEPARTMENT : Official press release FBI agents were " disgusted and revolted " by the evidence they heard on wiretaps of Blagojevich 's phones , said Robert Grant , special agent in charge of the FBI 's Chicago office .
The 76 - page complaint describes efforts by Blagojevich ( pronounced bluh - GOY - uh - vich ) to manipulate state government to enrich himself and his family , use his authority to withhold funding for a children 's hospital until one of its executives would write a $ 50,000 check and intimidate the Chicago Tribune into firing editorial writers who had criticized him .
The allegations turned the city 's pride over Obama 's election into shock and could be a distraction to the Obama team as it prepares its transition to the White House , an effort that has been mostly free of controversy .
Obama served in the Illinois Senate for seven years and top officials in his administration , including former Illinois representative Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod , a Chicago political consultant , also are products of an Illinois political system that has long been plagued by corruption .
" I had no contact with the governor or his office , and so I was not aware of what was happening , " Obama told reporters Tuesday .
" It is a sad day for Illinois .
Beyond that , I do n't think it 's appropriate to comment . "
Fitzgerald said there 's no indication that Obama was aware of Blagojevich 's alleged attempts to use the governor 's power to appoint Obama 's replacement for financial gain .
The complaint by prosecutors makes no allegation against Obama or any of his aides and advisers .
In fact , in taped remarks included in the complaint — which , like many of Blagojevich 's conversations gleaned from federal wiretaps or bugs in his office , are laced with profanities — the governor complains that Obama 's staff " is not willing to give me anything but appreciation .
… ( Expletive ) them . "
Blagojevich 's taped complaints that he would n't get anything for appointing Obama 's top choice to the Senate seat likely allows the president - elect to come out " smelling like a rose while all these other folks are swimming in a sewer , " said American University political historian Allan Lichtman .
Obama has so far " survived this state basically unscathed by corruption , which demonstrates his ability to sail above it , " said Paul Green , a political science professor at Chicago 's Roosevelt University .
Even so , questions about the Blagojevich case will be a " huge distraction , and they need to address it as soon as possible , " said Emory University political scientist Merle Black .
For Obama , " this is like a case of the hives — it emerges suddenly and is very annoying but is not fatal , " Lichtman said .
" It 's not something he wanted and not something he needs , but he can still do his job . "
Tuesday 's revelations also leave unanswered questions .
Among them :
Who will appoint Obama 's successor to the U.S. Senate ?
The state constitution says only the governor may do so unless he or she has been convicted or impeached , said Dan White , executive director of the Illinois Board of Elections .
On Tuesday , U.S. Sen .
Dick Durbin urged the state Legislature , which is n't scheduled to resume work until Jan. 12 , to authorize a special election to fill Obama 's old seat — a move that would require passage of new legislation .
" The alternative is a tainted appointment , " Durbin said .
Illinois state Rep. Jack Franks , a Democrat who sought Blagojevich 's impeachment or recall , introduced a bill Tuesday that would bar indicted governors from filling U.S. Senate vacancies .
Blagojevich has n't been indicted but several state lawmakers were calling on him to step down .
He would be succeeded by Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn , a Democrat .
The governor " should resign , " said Republican state Sen. Dan Cronin .
" It taints all of us who are in this business of public service .
I feel sick about it . "
Sheldon Sorosky , Blagojevich 's attorney , said he did n't know of any immediate plans for Blagojevich to resign .
The governor believes he did n't do anything wrong and asks Illinoisans to have faith in him , Sorosky said .
The feds step in Fitzgerald said federal agents who have been investigating alleged corruption in Blagojevich 's office for more than five years moved suddenly to arrest the governor early Tuesday morning because he was engaged in " a political corruption crime spree " that had to be stopped .
The prosecutor said $ 8 million in state funding for a children 's hospital was held up while Blagojevich waited for a $ 50,000 personal campaign donation from the hospital 's CEO , and said the governor delayed signing pending legislation that would divert funds to horse racing tracks while awaiting $ 100,000 in donations .
Dick Simpson , political science professor at the University of Illinois - Chicago and a former Chicago alderman , said he believes the quick arrest was meant to " prevent Blagojevich from making the Senate appointment " to the highest bidder .
" We 're talking about tainting the selection of a U.S. senator , " said Kent Redfield , a political science professor at the University of Illinois - Springfield .
That makes the stakes in the case much higher than " a continuation of the let 's - make - a - deal , where 's - mine part of Illinois politics . "
Blagojevich also is accused of seeking campaign donations in exchange for official actions and threatening to withhold state assistance from the Tribune Co. , owner of the Chicago Tribune , to force firings of editorial board members who had criticized the governor .
Fitzgerald thanked the Tribune for honoring a request about eight weeks ago not to report on certain aspects of the probe .
Tribune Editor Gerould Kern said in a statement the newspaper delayed publishing some stories , but refused other requests to do so .
The editorial writers Blagojevich wanted fired remain with the paper and Kern said he was not pressured by the governor 's staff .
Blagojevich , who turns 52 today , was elected in 2002 and re-elected two years ago , was arrested before dawn at his Chicago home and released after an appearance before U.S. District Judge Nan Nolan .
He forfeited his passport and firearm owner 's ID card and will lose $ 4,500 if he does n't show up for court dates .
A ' profane wheeler - dealer ' Roscoe Howard , former chief federal prosecutor in Washington , D.C. , said the " remarkable " allegations against the Illinois governor conjure an image of a " profane wheeler - dealer . "
Howard said the governor 's attorneys likely will challenge the government 's arguments for seeking wiretaps .
" You try to make the government 's actions look as bad as the governor 's , " he said .
But it 's " going to be very hard for the governor .
His raw words on the tapes are just killers . "
Houston attorney Ron Woods , a former FBI agent and federal prosecutor , said the complaint reveals " an unrelenting pursuit " of money and power .
" I 've never seen somebody so blatant , " Woods said .
One possible avenue for defense lawyers , Woods said , is to attack the government 's reasoning for tapping the governor 's phone calls .
" Tapping phones is so obtrusive that you have to show that there is no other way to get the information , " Woods said .
" In this case , the tapes are so damaging .
The government has a lot to use against him . "
Fitzgerald said Blagojevich continued to talk on wiretapped phones even after the Tribune reported on its front page Friday that agents were making covert tape recordings of Blagojevich .
The complaint includes excerpts of Blagojevich 's conversations : • On Nov. 3 , Blagojevich 's wife , Patricia , could be heard in the background of a conversation between the governor and an aide , urging them to delay financial help for the Tribune Co. 's effort to sell the Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field .
She told her husband to tell his aide to " hold up that ( expletive ) Cubs ( expletive ) . … ( Expletive ) them . " • On Nov. 5 , Blagojevich and an aide discussed whether he could be named Health and Human Services or Energy secretary in exchange for making a Senate appointment that Obama approved of .
He also discussed with Harris whether Obama could get him a good job in the private sector , such as head of a foundation .
" I 've got this thing and it's ( expletive ) golden , " Blagojevich said of the Senate appointment , " and … I 'm not just giving it up for ( expletive ) nothing . "
• On Nov. 7 , Blagojevich told Harris and a consultant , " I want to make money . "
Harris said the governor would be interested in a position with a group called Change to Win , which is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) .
SEIU spokeswoman Ramona Oliver said Tuesday the group has " no reason to believe that SEIU or any SEIU official was involved in any wrongdoing . "
•
On , Nov. 10 , Blagojevich , his wife , Harris and other advisers were on a conference call to discuss the open Senate seat .
Blagojevich said he would not simply name an Obama associate to the seat without getting something in return .
He complained his advisers were telling him to " suck it up " and give this " ( expletive ) ( the president - elect ) his senator .
( Expletive ) him .
For nothing ?
( Expletive ) him . " • On Nov. 11 , Blagojevich wondered whether Obama supporter and billionaire Warren Buffett could give up to $ 15 million to a charitable organization that Blagojevich could head .
Veterans of Illinois politics are less surprised , but some worry that the Blagojevich scandal will make it harder for the state to shake its reputation for tolerating corruption , jeopardize Chicago 's chances of hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics and complicate efforts to deal with a state budget crisis .
" I thought I 'd be happier , but I 'm not , " said Franks , who has pushed to remove Blagojevich from office .
" We need to demand change to clean up our government . "

You see what the Republican non-enforcement policy did to the FDA ?
Their reliance on inspiring ideals like voluntary self - reporting of problems with the food and drug industries ?
Things like this :
The Georgia food plant that federal investigators say knowingly shipped contaminated peanut butter also had mold growing on its ceiling and walls , and it has foot - long gaps in its roof , according to results of a federal inspection .
More than 500 people in 43 states have been sickened , and eight have died , after eating crackers and other products made with peanut butter from the plant , which is owned by the Peanut Corporation of America .
More than 100 children under the age of 5 are among those who have been sickened .
The plant sells its peanut paste to some of the nation ’s largest food manufacturers , including Kellogg and McKee Foods .
As a result of the contamination , more than 100 products have been recalled , mostly cookies and crackers .
Officials from the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traced the outbreak to the Peanut Corporation of America plant in Blakely , Ga. On Jan. 9 , investigators descended on the plant for a thorough inspection , which was completed Tuesday .
The report from the inspection , first posted on the Internet by Bill Marler , a lawyer , cites 12 instances in 2007 and 2008 in which the company ’s own tests of its product found contamination by salmonella .
In each case , the report states , “ after the firm retested the product and received a negative status , the product was shipped in interstate commerce . ”
It is illegal for a company to continue testing a product until it gets a clean test , said Michael Taylor , a food safety expert at George Washington University .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Some things never change .
Scientists said on Friday they had replicated an experiment in which people obediently delivered painful shocks to others if encouraged to do so by authority figures .
A U.S. soldeir walks between cells at Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad in a 2004 photo .
REUTERS / Damir Sagolj
Seventy percent of volunteers continued to administer electrical shocks -- or at least they believed they were doing so -- even after an actor claimed they were painful , Jerry Burger of Santa Clara University in California found .
“ What we found is validation of the same argument -- if you put people into certain situations , they will act in surprising , and maybe often even disturbing , ways , ” Burger said in a telephone interview .
“ This research is still relevant . ”
Burger was replicating an experiment published in 1961 by Yale University professor Stanley Milgram , in which volunteers were asked to deliver electric “ shocks ” to other people if they answered certain questions incorrectly .
Milgram found that , after hearing an actor cry out in pain at 150 volts , 82.5 percent of participants continued administering shocks , most to the maximum 450 volts .
The experiment surprised psychologists and no one has tried to replicate it because of the distress suffered by many of the volunteers who believed they were shocking another person .
“ When you hear the man scream and say , ‘ let me out , I ca n’t stand it , ’ that is the point when the real stress that people criticized Milgram for kicked in , ” Burger said .
“ It was a very , very , very stressful experience for many of the participants .
That is the reason no one can ethically replicate the experiment today . ”
‘ SURPRISING AND DISAPPOINTING ’
Burger modified the experiment , by stopping at the 150 volt point for the 29 men and 41 women in his experiment .
He measured how many of his volunteers began to deliver another shock when prompted by the experiment ’s leader -- but instead of letting them do so , stopped them .
In Milgram ’s original experiment , 150 volts seemed to be the turning point .
In Burger ’s modified experiment , 70 percent of the volunteers were willing to give shocks greater than 150 volts .
At one point , researchers brought in a volunteer who knew what was going on and refused to administer shocks beyond 150 volts .
Despite the example , 63 percent of the participants continued administering shocks past 150 volts .
“ That was surprising and disappointing , ” Burger said .
Burger found no differences among his volunteers , aged 20 to 81 , and carefully screened them to be average representatives of the U.S. public .
Burger said the experiment , published in the American Psychologist , can only partly explain the widely reported prisoner abuse at the U.S. - run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq or events during World War Two .
“ Although one must be cautious when making the leap from laboratory studies to complex social behaviors such as genocide , understanding the social psychological factors that contribute to people acting in unexpected and unsettling ways is important , ” he wrote .
“ It is not that there is something wrong with the people , ” Burger said .
“ The idea has been somehow there was this characteristic that people had back in the early 1960s that they were somehow more prone to obedience . ”

Senator Lindsey Graham , warming up a North Carolina audience for McCain , assured them that McCain would win : “ He fits North Carolina like a glove … I ’ll beat Michael Phelps in swimming before Barack Obama wins North Carolina . ”
Whoops !
Graham continued , “ Do n’t let me down , because I ca n’t swim . ”
But rather than eating his words , we hope Graham will take the opportunity to learn to swim .
Swimming is an important skill , especially for a man who could himself get washed away by a blue wave .
We ’ve done him the favor of inquiring about beginner lessons in South Carolina .

One of the things that first attracted me to economics is that its logic leads us sometimes to counterintuitive conclusions .
A perfect example of this is the regulated workplace .
The minimum wage raises incomes for some workers and lowers incomes for others .
Workplace safety regulations advantage those who are very risk averse at the expense of those who are willing to accept higher risks in exchange for higher incomes .
Laws against " child labor " benefit the relatively well off at the expense of the needy .
The tragic irony of the regulated workplace is that it most adversely affects those on the margins of society .
Beyond their disemployment effects on those whose labor is rendered submarginal by regulations on wages and working conditions , regulations in the workplace also exacerbate and perpetuate inequities that would otherwise be mitigated by the market process .
Racism and sexism have been ugly facts about the human social environment since time immemorial .
Commentators and critics hypothesize that members of the dominant cultural and ethnic group have advantages stemming from their membership in the dominant ethnic group or socioeconomic class .
I 'll use myself as an example .
As much as I would like to pride myself on having worked hard to get where I am , my skin color , cultural / religious background , and relatively stable upbringing made for a much less bumpy road to travel than that traveled by those who are less fortunate than I .
It does not follow from this that well - intentioned government intervention that aims to raise wages by legislative fiat is an appropriate corrective .
Tragically , a higher minimum wage and workplace - safety regulations are likely to exacerbate rather than mitigate social inequalities by removing the penalties that discriminatory employers would have to pay in a competitive market and by eliminating an important margin on which disadvantaged groups could compete .
When people are n't allowed to compete on the basis of price , quantity , and quality , firms can discriminate on the basis of something other than productivity .
A racist employer would suffer a penalty ( lower profits than his competitors ) if he insisted on indulging a " taste for discrimination " in a competitive market .
When prices are fixed , and labor conditions are set by law , that same employer can indulge his racist preferences without receiving his capitalist comeuppance .
Further , the higher minimum wage takes away a possible advantage for historically disadvantaged groups , and we can illustrate this with a thought experiment that I use in economics 101 .
Imagine that two people apply for a job at a fast - food restaurant .
The first is Crackhead Carl , a middle - aged African - American male who was just released from jail , where he had spent the last few years after stealing from a former employer .
Carl has seen the light , or so he claims .
He has gotten off the drugs , has seen the error of his ways , and sincerely wishes to better his position in spite of having made a gigantic mess of things .
" Many valuable skills that are learned in the workplace cannot be learned in a classroom . "
The second applicant is Tad Vanderbilt Rockefeller , a flaxen - haired white teenager from an affluent suburb who parks his BMW , breezes through the door in an Armani suit , and flashes a perfect smile as he fills out a job application with his monogrammed fountain pen .
His references are impeccable .
So who gets the job ?
The answer is , " it depends . "
Carl knows that he needs some way to convey his sincerity and fidelity to a prospective employer , and having shredded his credibility through a life of riotous living , people who want to give him the benefit of the doubt nonetheless remain skeptical even though he promises that this time , things will be different .
In an unregulated market , Carl could accept lower wages or relatively riskier working conditions in order to compete with Tad .
When wages and working conditions are heavily regulated , however , the law cuts off Carl 's ability to compete .
In all likelihood , Tad would get the job and Carl would again be shoved out onto society 's fringes .
One of the unintended consequences of the minimum wage and workplace regulations is that they perpetuate inequality .
One might respond that what Carl needs is education , not a dead - end job mopping floors at McDonald's .
This may be true , but many valuable skills that are learned in the workplace cannot be learned in a classroom .
It is the development of this tacit knowledge and these valuable skills that Carl misses out on by being regulated out of the workplace .
In this case , the choice was pretty clear .
Tad appears to have been a less risky choice than Carl whether the employer is a racist or not .
But racism is an entrepreneurial error , and one that should be quickly punished in the marketplace .
With restrictions on the way the labor market functions , the entrepreneurial error ( and moral abomination ) that is racism can go uncorrected .
$ 58 $ 39 When prices are fixed , and labor conditions are set by law , an employer can indulge his racist preferences without receiving his capitalist comeuppance .
Milton Friedman openly argued that minimum - wage laws are racist in effect if not intent ; in the early 1960s , he pointed out that , as a result of higher minimum wages , black teenage unemployment was much higher than it would otherwise be .
Denied the opportunity to earn incomes and to acquire valuable skills , those adversely affected by the minimum wage were not allowed to share in the general prosperity that a market economy produces .
Empirical evidence reported by economists David Neumark and William Wascher suggests that among the long - run effects of minimum wages are lower degrees of educational attainment , less on - the - job training , and lower lifetime earnings .
In The Fatal Conceit , F.A. Hayek said that " [t ] he curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design . "
In an imperfect world , we suffer from a " fatal conceit " when we imagine that we can make justice roll down like waters and make righteousness like an ever - flowing stream just by passing laws that say " make it so . "
Indeed , laws like this will more often than not make justice and righteousness roll more slowly by perpetuating the inequalities that have historically worked against disadvantaged groups .
Amusements in Hyperspace
[ Michael Lugo 's post on n-spheres today reminded me that I 've been wanting for some time to repost this item that I wrote back in 1999 . ]
This evening I tried to imagine life in a 1000 - dimensional universe .
I did n't get too far , but what I did get seemed pretty interesting .
What 's it like ?
Well , it 's very dark .
Lamps would n't work very well , because if the illumination one foot from the source is I , then the illumination two feet from the source is I · 9.3·10 -302 .
Actually it 's even worse than that ; there 's a double whammy .
Suppose you had a cubical room ten feet across .
If you thought it was hard to light up the dark corners of a big room in Boston in February , imagine how much worse it is in hyperspace where the corners are 158 feet away .
There are some upsides , however .
Rooms wo n't have to be ten feet on a side because everything will be smaller .
You take up about 70,000 cubic centimeters of space ; in hyperspace that is just not a lot of room , because a box barely more than a centimeter on a side takes up 70,000 hypercentimeters .
In fact , a box barely more than a centimeter on a side can hold as much as you want ; an 11 millimeter box already contains 2.5·1041 hypercentimeters .
It 's hard to put people in prison in hyperspace , because there are so many directions that you can go to get out .
Flatland prison cells have four walls ; ours have six , if you count the ceiling and the floor .
Hyperspace prison cells have 2000 walls , and each one is very expensive to build .
So that 's hyperspace : Big , dark , and easy to get around .

A legal fight erupted Tuesday over the ability of consumers to copy DVDs onto their computers , setting the stage for a new battle between Hollywood and a purveyor of technology that could alter how consumers watch movies at home .
The six major Hollywood movie studios sued Seattle - based RealNetworks , asking a federal court in Los Angeles to bar the digital media company from distributing new software that they say lets consumers copy movies illegally .
RealNetworks also took legal action , asking a court to declare that the company ’s new RealDVD software program , which went on sale Tuesday , was legal and complied with the DVD Copy Control Assn .'s license agreement .
Whether consumers are clamoring for a technology that gives them the ability to copy movies they might otherwise rent is unclear .
But the man behind the push , RealNetworks Chief Executive Rob Glaser , is no stranger to rattling the cages of behemoths .
Advertisement
The volatile Glaser took on software nemesis Microsoft Corp. and won a $ 760 - million settlement ; he later invited the ire of Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs with a technical work - around that evaded the iTunes copy protection .
Indeed , Glaser ’s company has engaged in at least half a dozen high - profile legal battles over the last decade .
So it ’s no surprise that Glaser was willing to take on all of Hollywood over a new software product that -- if it survives the legal challenge from the studios -- would make it legal for consumers to rip their DVD movies .
It ’s a gamble he ’s eager to take , say industry observers , because it would position RealNetworks to capitalize on what it hopes will be a popular consumer product .
“ Great products should not be bullied out of the market by people trying to misuse the law to suppress legitimate innovation , ” Glaser wrote in an online statement outlining his reasons for launching the RealDVD software Tuesday despite the legal challenges .
In a separate interview , Glaser said he had been in negotiations “ into the wee hours of the night ” and hoped to eventually reach an agreement with the studios .
“ I would n’t want it be characterized that we look for trouble , ” Glaser said .

Knowing the studio suit was imminent , RealNetworks preemptively filed a complaint in federal district court in San Jose on Tuesday , asking that its right to make and sell the RealDVD software be affirmed .
Its legal argument leans heavily on the 2007 outcome of a case involving Kaleidescape , a maker of home media servers , which had been sued by the DVD Copy Control Assn. because DVDs could be copied onto the device ’s hard drive .
Kaleidescape won the case on a technicality , and it is now under appeal .
Glaser nonetheless seized on that ruling and the “ poor - man ’s Kaleidescape ” was born -- RealNetworks RealDVD .
The software , sold for $ 29.99 , lets consumers copy a DVD movie onto their computer ’s hard drive much as they have ripped music off CDs for more than a decade .
RealNetworks says the copies are encrypted so files ca n’t be “ shared . ”
The studios ’ suit seeks a temporary restraining order to block distribution of RealDVD .
Studio attorneys argue that the software illegally bypasses the copy protection built into DVDs to protect movies against theft , in violation of federal copyright laws .
Advertisement
The studios warned that the software would enable a practice of “ rent , rip and return , ” in which consumers build a digital movie library on films they ’ve rented at Blockbuster or Netflix , at a fraction of the price of buying the DVDs .
Moreover , it threatens to deal “ a potentially fatal blow ” to efforts by the studios and their technology partners -- Apple ’s iTunes , Amazon.com and others -- to offer legitimate ways for consumers to get digital copies of movies onto their computers or portable players .
Twentieth Century Fox and other studios have even begun offering digital copies of films in the same package as its DVD and Blu-ray movies .
“ RealNetworks ’ RealDVD should be called StealDVD , ” said Greg Goeckner , general counsel for the Motion Picture Assn. of America , the industry trade group .
Stanford law professor Mark A. Lemley , who worked on the Kaleidescape case , said the dispute may ultimately hinge on the language of the license RealNetworks obtained from the DVD Copy Control Assn .
Advertisement
“ If Real has a legitimate license to do this under the contract , the circumvention claim goes away , because they ’re not cracking the encryption system , ” Lemley said .
“ They ’ve been given the keys and authorized to do it . ”
RealNetworks , an early innovator in Internet streaming technology , is in search of something to give its digital entertainment business some spark after reporting a loss in its most recent quarter .
Josh Martin , a digital media analyst with researcher Yankee Group , said RealNetworks has become marginalized in other facets of online entertainment .
Its music subscription service , Rhapsody , ranks third behind Apple ’s dominant iTunes store and the even the struggling Napster service .
And the fast - growing online movie distribution market is already crowded , with offerings from Apple , Netflix , Amazon and others .
The introduction of DVD copying software , previously the province of the underground pirate community , is one way to capture consumers ’ attention .

“ Rather than launch a ‘ me too ’ this or ‘ me too ’ that , we thought there was an interesting opportunity that goes beyond what any mainstream product does today , in a way that we believe is fully legitimate , ” Glaser said .

With the defense in the Tenenbaum case getting their request to broadcast the trial online , it seemed that some light of exposure was to be brought to the RIAA 's method of litigation .
Yet the RIAA does n't want their court practices exposed for all to see , and have now appealed the judges decision .
RIAA court cases are few and far between .
The cost of attorneys usually makes hiring one a costly alternative in comparison to the settlement money that they ask from alleged infringers .
Thus far , only one case has actually gone to trial , resulting in a heavy judgment against the defendant , Jammie Thomas .
While that case has been declared a mistrial , it has not stopped other cases from going ahead .
One of the cases vying to be the first to go all the way for a standing decision , is the case involving Boston University student Joel Tenenbaum .
After initially offering to settle for $ 500 , and having it rejected back in 2003 , he decided to fight .
His case has proved quite a headache for the RIAA by all accounts .
Starting with a counterclaim asserting abuse of federal power , and that the damages demanded were unconstitutional , it has eventually gone to court after several settlement attempts .
In court Joel is assisted by Professor Charles Nesson , and his law students .
In the Thomas case , the lawyer involved was n’t particularly enthusiastic nor experienced in this area , and it showed .
The same ca n’t be said of Prof.
Nesson , who is a Harvard law professor as well as Founder and Co-Director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
In what might be considered a coup , he convinced the judge to allow the trial to be webcast on the Internet .
This will allow others to see just how the lawyers act in a case .
Yet , in the last few hours , it has been revealed that the RIAA has appealed the motion , clearly upset that it might harm their public image further .
It ’s hard to see how it can though , when the RIAA makes statements on the case that do nothing to generate goodwill .
RIAA ’s Cara Duckworth said in a statement , “ While this might be an interesting academic exercise for the professor and his class , there ’s been real world consequences for those who create music . ”
Clearly little things like following the law are second place to their revenue steam , and how DARE the defense bother to fight the case against them .
In the meantime , we ’re looking forward to the webcast .
あなたは自分のペニスの固さに自信はありますか？
この前居酒屋で、隣の席の女子グループがいてこんな話を小耳に挟みました。
「 勃ってるんだけど、ガチガチじゃないから全然気持ちよくない！」
それは、同じ男性としてはとても痛い言葉でした。
実は、僕もアソコの固さに自信がない男の1人。
完全に勃たないのがEDだと思っていたのですが「満足な性交が行えない」こともEDに含まれるらしいのです。
ワンナイトで女の子とセックスをしても次に繋がらないのはもしかしてそのせいだったのか！？とED治療薬を検索しました。
その中で僕の悩みにピッタリな1品を発見。

カマグラ通販 のQ＆A。海外通販が不安な方必見
医薬品の通販は、商品の安全性や取引の違法性など不安要素が多いですよね。
このページでは周りに聞けないカマグラ通販のよくある質問をまとめてみました。
カマグラの通販を試してみても大丈夫？と心配な方は要チェック。
カマグラが病院で処方できない理由はなぜ？
カマグラは正規のバイアグラジェネリックではありません。
インド製のコピー版といった位置づけで、日本では未認可のお薬です。
インドは、特許制度がありません。
新薬と同じ成分を使っても製造の手順を一部変更することで、法律上違う薬として扱われます。
そのため、バイアグラの製薬会社に申請や手続きを行なわずとも、コピー版の医薬品を造ることができるのです。
この法律が生まれた理由にはインド、また近隣の発展途上国の貧困問題があります。
インド製のカマグラは安全な薬？
インドは世界的にも有名なジェネリック大国。
非営利団 体 「国境なき医師団」も治療薬としてインド製のジェネリックを採用しています。
世界シェア率も高く、効果、効能、安全性には問題はありません。
カマグラの製薬会社はアジャンタファーマ社。
インド国内でもトップレベルの製薬会社です。
医薬品の個人輸入は違法じゃない？
医薬品の個人輸入は、個人で使用する目的で、ルールを守れば厚生労働省からも認められており合法です。
個人輸入代行サイトと普通の通販サイトの違いは？
楽天、amazonなどの大手通販サイトでは、カマグラは販売していません。
その理由は、薬機法という法律で規制があるためです。
薬機法では、一般医薬品は購入が可能ですが、医療用医薬品（医師の処方が必要な医薬品）は販売ができません。
個人輸入代行サイトは、通販サイトのように商品をストックしているわけではありません。
注文を受けてから、製薬販売会社に発注。
その後海外から直接発送を行ないます。
つまり、個人輸入の面倒な部分をサポートしてくれるサイトということなのです。
持病があってもカマグラは飲める？
医師から処方されていないカマグラの服用における健康被害は、すべて自己責任になってしまいます。
服用方法、併用禁忌薬、使用禁忌については自分で調べる必要があります。
身体に合うか不安があるという方は一度病院でバイアグラが処方可能であるか相談してみると良いでしょう。

The recession and tax havens : the banks must come clean
29 Jan 2009 , by Adam Lent Guest in Economics
It used to be the case that those who engaged in debate about tax havens fell into three categories : those who thought they were morally indefensible and should be closed down , those who thought they were morally indefensible but did n’t think anything could be done about it , and those who thought tax havens provided a useful service to the wealthy and to the global economy .
It is a measure of how much has changed since the financial crisis in September that this debate has been transformed .
Tax havens are recognised now not just as a moral outrage but also as a key cause of the crisis itself .
The vast bubble in debt trading that has been central to the crisis was fundamentally linked to tax havens with the ‘ special purpose vehicles ’ which were set up to hold the proceeds of securitisation initiatives being based as a matter of course in locations such as the Cayman Islands .
The important point being that this not only took such trading out of tax liabilities but also removed it from regulatory oversight due to the secrecy that deliberately shrouds financial activity in havens .
So the TUC report today which reveals that four of the five big banks have 1,207 subsidiaries incorporated in tax havens will ring alarm bells across the world .
The report could not analyse HBOS because the bank failed to list its subsidiaries or their location in either its annual return or company accounts .
This may be a breach of company law .
The Chief Executive of the British Bankers Association , Dame Angela Knight , has been doing the rounds of the studios today claiming that the TUC has failed to understand the global nature of banking and it is inevitable that banks will have subsidiaries all over the place .
As proof of this she quotes the fact that the Spanish bank Santander has companies incorporated in the UK .
This is ineffably lame .
Of course , many of those 1,207 subsidiaries will be genuine companies providing normal banking services to the population of a particular territory .
But why exactly should the Cayman Islands , with a population of around 50,000 , need 262 banking subsidiaries to service their population ?
I ’ve been to the Cayman Islands , I ca n’t remember seeing a branch of Barclays on every single street corner despite the fact it has 143 subsidiaries there .
Why , for example , are over a quarter of all HSBC ’s subsidiary companies incorporated in tax havens – all of which have small populations and small real economies ?
Sadly for Dame Angela this issue is not about to go away for three simple reasons .
Firstly , it makes no sense for the taxpayer to be bailing out organisations which may at the same time be avoiding contributing to public funds .
Secondly , there is now enormous global political momentum behind much tighter regulation of banking and financial services – this ca n’t be done effectively while that sector makes such wide use of tax havens .
Thirdly , taxpayers need to know their level of exposure to banks ’ liabilities and this ca n’t be known if banks are holding a fair proportion of their assets in secret accounts .
These arguments have an irresistible force and logic which could not have existed before the globe was plunged into this economic crisis .
In the end the banks ( and the havens themselves ) will have to co-operate .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said earlier today he wants the Conservatives to provide periodic economic status reports to Parliament , as a condition for his party 's support of the budget – and the minority government .
" We are putting this government on probation , " Ignatieff said .
" This budget does not include one word about accountability . "
The Liberals are demanding reports on the budget 's implementation and its cost , starting in March with others in June and December .
" We will vigilantly monitor its effect on our economy , " he said .
" We will be watching like hawks to make sure the investments Canadians need actually reach them , " he said .
Each of those reports will present an opportunity for the Liberals to withdraw their support , he said .
The NDP and the Bloc Quebecois have already declared their opposition to the budget .
While Tuesday 's budget proposed billions of dollars in economic stimulus , there have been concerns raised about how fast the money will be spent .
Speaking today from a Tim Horton 's in his riding in Whitby , Ont. , Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said his spending plan reflects what Canadians want and need now .

In the days after the Littleton , Colorado massacre , the country went on a panicked hunt the oddballs in High School , a profoundly ignorant and unthinking response to a tragedy that left geeks , nerds , non-conformists and the alienated in an even worse situation than before .
Stories all over the country embarked on witchunts that amounted to little more than Geek Profiling .
All weekend , after Friday 's column here , these voiceless kids -- invisible in media and on TV talk shows and powerless in their own schools -- have been e-mailing me with stories of what has happened to them in the past few days .
Here are some of those stories in their own words , with gratitude and admiration for their courage in sending them .
The big story out of Littleton is n't about violence on the Internet , or whether or not video games are turning out kids into killers .
It 's about the fact that for some of the best , brightest and most interesting kids , high school is a nightmare of exclusion , cruelty , warped values and anger .
The big story never seemed to quite make it to the front pages or the TV talk shows .
It was n't whether the Net is a place for hate - mongers and bomb - makers , or whether video games are turning your kids into killers .
It was the spotlight the Littleton , Colorado killings has put on the fact that for so many individualistic , intelligent , and vulnerable kids , high school is a Hellmouth of exclusion , cruelty , loneliness , inverted values and rage .
From Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Todd Solondz 's " Welcome To The Dollhouse , " and a string of comically - bitter teen movies from Hollywood , pop culture has been trying to get this message out for years .
For many kids - often the best and brightest -- school is a nightmare .
People who are different are reviled as geeks , nerds , dorks .
The lucky ones are excluded , the unfortunates are harassed , humiliated , sometimes assaulted literally as well as socially .
Odd values - unthinking school spirit , proms , jocks - are exalted , while the best values - free thinking , non-conformity , curiousity - are ridiculed .
Maybe the one positive legacy the Trenchcoat Mafia left was to ensure that this message got heard , by a society that seems desperate not to hear it .
Minutes after the " Kids That Kill " column was posted on Slashdot Friday , and all through the weekend , I got a steady stream of e-mail from middle and high school kids all over the country -- especially from self - described oddballs .
They were in trouble , or saw themselves that way to one degree or another in the hysteria sweeping the country after the shootings in Colorado .
Many of these kids saw themselves as targets of a new hunt for oddballs -- suspects in a bizarre , systematic search for the strange and the alienated .
Suddenly , in this tyranny of the normal , to be different was n't just to feel unhappy , it was to be dangerous .
Schools all over the country openly embraced Geek Profiling .
One group calling itself the National School Safety Center issued a checklist of " dangerous signs " to watch for in kids : it included mood swings , a fondness for violent TV or video games , cursing , depression , anti-social behavior and attitudes .
( I do n't know about you , but I bat a thousand ) .
The panic was fueled by a ceaseless bombardment of powerful , televised images of mourning and grief in Colorado , images that stir the emotions and demand some sort of response , even when it is n't clear what the problem is .
The reliably blockheaded media response did n't help either .
" Sixty Minutes " devoted a whole hour to a broadcast on screen violence and its impact on the young , heavily promoted by this tease : " Are video games turning your kids into killers ? "
The already embattled loners were besieged .
" This is not a rational world .
Can anybody help ? " asked Jamie , head of an intense Dungeons and Dragons club in Minnesota , whose private school guidance counselor gave him a choice : give up the game or face counseling , possibly suspension .
Suzanne Angelica ( her online handle ) was told to go home and leave her black , ankle - length raincoat there .
On the Web , kids did flock to talk to each other .
On Star Wars and X - Files mailing lists and websites and on AOL chat rooms and ICQ message boards , teenagers traded countless countless stories of being harassed , beaten , ostracized and ridiculed by teachers , students and administrators for dressing and thinking differently from the mainstream .
Many said they had some understanding of why the killers in Littleton went over the edge .
" We want to be different , " wrote one of the Colorado killers in a diary found by the police .
" We want to be strange and we do n't want jocks or other people putting us down . "
The sentiment , if not the response to it , was echoed by kids all over the country .
The Littleton killings have made their lives much worse .
" It was horrible , definitely , " e-mailed Bandy from New York City .
" I 'm a Quake freak , I play it day and night .
I 'm really into it .
I play Doom a lot too , though not so much anymore .
I 'm up till 3 a.m. every night .
I really love it .
But after Colorado , things got horrible .
People were actually talking to me like I could come in and kill them .
It was n't like they were really afraid of me - they just seemed to think it was okay to hate me even more ?
People asked me if I had guns at home .
This is a whole new level of exclusion , another excuse for the preppies of the universe to put down and isolate people like me . "
It was n't just the popular who were suspicious of the odd and the alienated , though .
The e-mailed stories ranged from suspensions and expulsions for " anti- social behavior " to censorship of student publications to school and parental restrictions on computing , Web browsing , and especially gaming .
There were unconfirmed reports that the sale of blocking software had skyrocketed .
Everywhere , school administrators pandered and panicked , rushing to show they were highly sensitive to parents fears , even if they were oblivious to the needs and problems of many of their students .
In a New Jersey private school , a girl was expelled for showing classmates a pocket - knife .
School administrators sent a letter home :
" In light of the recent tragedy in Littleton , Colorado , we all share a heightened sensitivity to potential threats to our children .
I urge you to take this time to discuss with your children the importance of turning to adults when they have concerns about the behavior of others . "
This solution was straight out of " 1984 . "
In fact , this was one of the things it 's protagonist Winston was jailed for : refusing to report his friends for behavior that Big Brother deemed abnormal and disturbing .
Few of the weeks ?
media reports - in fact , none that I saw - pointed out that the FBI Uniform Crime reports , issued bi-annually , along with the Justice Departments reports ( statistical abstracts on violence are available on the Department 's website and in printed form ) academic studies and some news reports have reporters for years now .
Violence among the young is dropping across the country , even as computing , gaming , cable TV and other media use rises .
Unhappy , alienated , isolated kids are legion in schools , voiceless in media , education and politics .
But theirs are the most important voices of all in understanding what happened and perhaps even how to keep it from happening again .
I referred some of my e-mailers to peacefire.org , a children 's rights website , for help in dealing with blocking and filtering software .
I sent others to freedomforum.org ( the website Free ! ) for help with censorship and free speech issues , and to geek websites , especially some on ICQ.com where kids can talk freely .
I 've chosen some e-mailers to partially reprint here .
Although almost all of these correspondents were willing to be publicly identified - some demanded it - I 'm only using their online names , since some of their stories would put them in peril from parents , peers or school administrators .
From Jay in the Southeast :
" I stood up in a social studies class - the teacher wanted a discussion -- and said I could never kill anyone or condone anyone who did kill anyone .
But that I could , on some level , understand these kids in Colorado , the killers .
Because day after day , slight after slight , exclusion after exclusion , you can learn how to hate , and that hatred grows and takes you over sometimes , especially when you come to see that you 're hated only because you 're smart and different , or sometimes even because you are online a lot , which is still so uncool to many kids ?
After the class , I was called to the principal 's office and told that I had to agree to undergo five sessions of counseling or be expelled from school , as I had expressed ? sympathy ?
with the killers in Colorado , and the school had to be able to explain itself if I ?acted out ?.
In other words , for speaking freely , and to cover their ass , I was not only branded a weird geek , but a potential killer .
That will sure help deal with violence in America . "
From Jason in Pennsylvania : " The hate just eats you up , like the molten metal moving up Keanu Reeve 's arm in the ?
The Matrix .?
That 's what I thought of when I saw it .
You lose track of what is real and what is n't .
The worst people are the happiest and do the best , the best and smartest people are the most miserable and picked upon .
The cruelty is unimaginable .
If Dan Rather wants to know why those guys killed those people in Littleton , Colorado , tell him for me that the kids who run the school probably drove them crazy , bit by bit ?.
That does n't mean all those kids deserved to die .
But a lot of kids in America know why it happened , even if the people running schools do n't . "
From Andrew in Alaska : " To be honest , I sympathized much more with the shooters than the shootees .
I am them .
They are me .
This is not to say I will end the lives of my classmates in a hail of bullets , but that their former situation bears a striking resemblance to my own .
For the most part , the media are clueless .
They 're never experienced social rejection , or chosen non-conformity '
Also , I would like to postulate that the kind of measures taken by school administration have a direct effect on school violence .
School is generally an oppressive place ; the parallels to fascist society are tantalizing .
Following a school shooting , a week or two - week crackdown ensues , where students ?
constitutional rights are violated with impunity , at a greater rate than previous . "
From Anika78 in suburban Chicago :
" I was stopped at the door of my high school because I was wearing a trenchcoat .
I do n't game , but I 'm a geekchick , and I 'm on the Web a lot .
( I love geek guys , and there are n't many of us . )
I was given a choice - go home and ditch the coat , or go to the principal .
I refused to go home .
I have never been a member of any group or trenchcoat mob or any hate thing , online or any other , so why should they tell me what coat to wear ?
Two security guards took me into an office , called the school nurse , who was a female , and they ordered me to take my coat off .
The nurse asked me to undress ( privately ) while the guards outside the door went through every inch of my coat .
I would n't undress , and she did n't make me ( I think she felt creepy about the whole thing ) .
Then I was called into the principal 's office and he asked me if I was a member of any hate group , or any online group , or if I had ever played Doom or Quake .
He mentioned some other games , but I do n't remember them .
I 'm not a gamer , though my boyfriends have been .
I lost it then .
I thought I was going to be brave and defiant , but I just fell apart .
I cried and cried .
I think I hated that worse than anything . "
FromZBird in New Jersey :
" Yeah , I 've had some fantasies about taking out some of these jerks who run the school , have parties , get on teams , are adored by teachers , have all these friends .
Sure .
They hate me .
Day by day , it 's like they take pieces out of you , like a torture , one at a time .
My school has 1,500 kids .
I could never make a sports team .
I have never been to a party .
I sit with my friends at our own corner of the cafeteria .
If we tried to join the other kids , they 'd throw up or leave .
And by now , I 'd rather die .
Sometimes , I do feel a lot of real pure rage .
And I feel better when I go online .
Sometimes I think the games keep me from shooting anybody , not the other way around .
Cause I can get even there , and I 'm pretty powerful there .
But I 'd never do it .
Something much deeper was wrong with these kids in Colorado .
To shoot all those people ?
Make bombs ?
You have to be sick , and the question they should be asking is n't what games do they play , but how come all these high - paid administrators , parents , teachers and so - called professional people , how come none of them noticed how wacked they were ?
I mean , in the news it said they had guns all over their houses !
They were planning this for a year .
Maybe the reporters ought to ask how come nobody noticed this , instead of writing all these stupid stories about video games ? "
From ES in New York :
High school favors people with a certain look and attitude - the adolescent equivalent of Aryans .
They are the chosen ones , and they want to get rid of anyone who does n't look and think the way they do .
One of the things which makes this so infuriating is that the system favors shallow people .
Anyone who took the time to think about things would realize that things like the prom , school spirit and who won the football game are utterly insignificant in the larger scheme of things .
So anyone with depth of thought is almost automatically excluded from the main high school social structure .
It 's like some horribly twisted form of Social Darwinism .
I would never , ever do anything at all like what was done in Colorado .
I can't understand how anyone could .
But I do understand the hatred of high school life which , I guess , prompted it .
From Dan in Boise , Idaho :
" Be careful !
I wrote an article for my school paper .
The advisor suggested we write about ? our feelings ?
about Colorado .
My feelings - what I wrote -- were that society is blaming the wrong things .
You can't blame screwed - up kids or the Net .
These people do n't know what they were talking about .
How bout blaming a system that takes smart or weird kids and drives them crazy ?
How about understanding why these kids did what they did , cause in some crazy way , I feel something for them .
For their victims , too , but for them .
I thought it was a different point - of - view , but important .
I was making a point .
I mean , I 'm not going to the prom .
You know what ?
The article was killed , and I got sent home with a letter to my parents .
It was n't an official suspension , but I can't go back until Tuesday .
And it was made pretty clear to me that if I made any noise about it , it would be a suspension or worse .
So this is how they are trying to figure out what happened in Colorado , I guess .
By blaming a sub-culture and not thinking about their own roles , about how fucked - up school is .
Now , I think the whole thing was a set - up , cause a couple of other kids are being questioned too , about what they wrote .
They pretend to want to have a ' dialogue ' but kids should be warned that what they really want to know is who 's dangerous to them . "
From a Slashdot reader : " Your column Friday was okay , but you and a lot of the Slashdot readers do n't get it .
You do n't have the guts to stand up and say these games are not only not evil , they are great .
They are good .
They are challenging and stimulating .
They help millions of kids who have nowhere else to go , because the whole world is set up to take care of different kinds of kids , kids who fit in , who do what they 're told , who are popular .
I 've made more friends online on Gamespot.com than I have in three years of high school .
I think about my characters and my competitions and battles all day .
Nothing I 've been taught in school interests me as much .
And believe me , the gamers who ( try to ) kill me online all day are a lot closer to me than the kids I go to high school with .
I 'm in my own world , for sure , but it 's my choice and it's a world I love .
Without it , I would n't have one ...
Last week , my father told me he had cancelled my ISP because he had asked me not to game so much and I still was .
And when he saw the Colorado thing online , he said , he told my Mom that he felt one of these kids could be me 'I am a resourceful geek , and I was back online before he got to bed that night .
But I have to go underground now .
My guidance counselor , who would n't know a computer game from Playboy Bunny poster , told me was Dad was being a good parent , and here was a chance for me to re-invent myself , be more popular , to ? mainstream .?
This whole Colorado thing , it 's given them an excuse to do more of what started this trouble in the first place - to make individuals and different people feel like even bigger freaks . "
From Jip in New England :
" Dear Mr. Katz .
I am 10 .
My parents took my computer away today , because of what they saw on television .
They told me they just could n't be around enough to make sure that I 'm doing the right things on the Internet .
My Mom and Dad told me they did n't want to be standing at my funeral some day because of things I was doing that they did n't know about .
I am at my best friend 's house , and am pretty bummed , because things are boring now .
I hope I 'll get it back . "
Hiba Qassir dreams of making movies .
She ’s ambitious and precocious enough .
At 18 , she ’s taught herself how to edit video and sound on a computer , and has her sights set on directing gripping social and psychological dramas .
But if the movie business does n’t work out , that ’s OK .
She has other dreams : perhaps to become a cop or a pilot .
Or maybe a suicide bomber .
“ Martyrdom is the shortest way to heaven , and the history of martyrdom is not like any history , ” Hiba says .
“ It made victory .
We would n’t have achieved victory without these martyrdoms . ”

Hiba wears a colorful head scarf and faded bluejeans and running shoes under a black cloak as she gives a tour of Hezbollah ’s annual “ martyrdom ” exhibit here in this southern port city .
Cheery and rosy - cheeked , she helpfully guides visitors past mannequins of guerrilla fighters armed with rocket - propelled grenades and automatic weapons , and placards chronicling suicide operations against Israeli troops during the Jewish state ’s two - decade occupation of southern Lebanon .
Recorded sounds of machine - gun fire , helicopters and walkie - talkie chatter fill the halls of a drab brick community center on the outskirts of Tyre .
“ Here is some information about each martyrdom operation , ” she informs a small tour group .
She points to a hall lined with posters adorned with artificial flowers .
“ The first one was in 1982 here in Tyre , ” she says .
“ You can see that [ late Israeli leader ] Yitzhak Rabin said that this operation took the lives of many people , especially those with special qualities and skills . ”
Advertisement
That suicide bomber was 18 , just like her , when he drove an explosives - filled Peugeot sedan into the Israeli command post here on Nov. 11 , 1982 , and killed 75 Israeli soldiers , border guards and intelligence officers , according to Lebanese accounts .
Israel has long maintained that the blast was an accident , caused by a gas leak .
His name was Ahmad Qassir , and Hiba is particularly proud of her uncle , martyr No. 1 in the official history of Hezbollah ’s long war against Israel .
“ Israel usually says that these people are hopeless people and lovers of death , ” Hiba says .
“ But we always say that martyrdom is our way to heaven . ”
Hiba says she feels bored with kids her own age .
All they want to do is shop at Beirut Mall , gossip and chitchat about clothes and makeup .
She ’d rather spend a free afternoon at the swimming pool or visiting the Internet cafe to surf the Web for news of the world .

She ’s a dutiful daughter , baby - sitting her three younger sisters without complaint .
Her mother , Samar Qassir , 38 , who stopped attending school when she was married at 14 , is immensely proud .
Her parents let Hiba do mostly as she pleases , shuttling from the bustle of the capital , Beirut , where they live , to the farmlands of the south , to visit relatives .
But that ’s not enough for her .
She wants to learn about the world , to travel .
That ’s why she eagerly took up the temporary job of playing English - speaking tour guide for the three - week martyrdom exhibit , a chance to interact with foreigners and dignitaries , as well as make a little cash before she begins college next month .
She spends all the extra money she makes as a docent on movies , books and software to help her prepare for her filmmaking career .
The martyrdom exhibit and similar shows are part of an occasional series of public multimedia installations organized by Hezbollah , the powerful Shiite political organization and militia that is a state unto itself within Lebanon .
Like recent exhibits about the late Hezbollah commander Imad Mughniyah in Nabatiyeh and another in Beirut last year about the summer 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah , this one is filled with captured Israeli weaponry and giant posters of Israeli leaders in anguish .
Grim - faced portraits of the father of Iran ’s revolution , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , and current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Hezbollah ’s spiritual and political guideposts , stare out at visitors .

Parents bring children to walk through the exhibit , past the posters of martyrs and works of art commemorating their deeds , which usually involved ramming vehicles packed with explosives into Israeli positions .
A preteen boy with a messy mop of brown hair takes photographs of mannequins of bearded Hezbollah fighters praying in the battlefield .
“ This operation was done by Ibrahim Jamil Daher , ” Hiba says , pointing toward one of the displays .
“ It was first a battle against a team of 22 Israelis .
It was n’t supposed to be a martyrdom operation .
But when he found it was a good opportunity to make such an operation , he took advantage of the situation and did it . ”
She adds with satisfaction : “ It took the lives of so many Israelis . ”
Hiba loves Arab and Iranian movies -- not the highbrow films shown at festivals but corny action capers , and romantic comedies such as the Egyptian film “ I ’m Content , ” about a set of triplets played by the same actor who fall for the same girl .
She says she ’s watched it repeatedly , looking for clues as to how the film editors manage to so deftly juxtapose the actor three times in the same scene and make it look so real .

As soon as she finishes up her classes at a Hezbollah - sponsored high school , she ’d like to go to Tehran to study directing , and make movies about the south of Lebanon .
“ I like the idea of directing films , because you meet many people and learn more about them , ” she says .
Despite her love for the movies , fantasies of martyrdom also tug at her .
Hiba grew up hearing the stories of martyrs , their lives and their sacrifices .
In addition to the uncle in Tyre , another uncle was killed in a 1996 operation and a third during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah .
She talks about their deaths with the same pride another teen might display describing an older sibling ’s feats on a football field .
“ We have many martyrs in the family , and we like this thing , ” she says .
“ As ordinary people , we have to work and say prayers , and despite all of that we might not go to heaven .
But the martyrs go directly to heaven . ”
Advertisement
Hiba insists that she ’s not just repeating political slogans .
She says if given the chance , she would sacrifice herself and her dreams to become a martyr .
“ Let ’s speak logically , ” she says .
“ The path of each person is not decided by us , and our years are limited by God ’s wants , so if it was offered to me to die as a martyr , it ’s better than to live life with all its sins . ”
At the end of the Hezbollah exhibits , visitors are typically guided into a darkened theater filled with a big screen , dioramas and colored lights .
They ’re a bit like the “ Chicago Experience ” or “ New York Experience ” multimedia shows popular during the 1970s and ‘ 80s , with movies , music and robots telling visitors the history of a city .
The “ experience ” at the martyrdom exhibit begins with blaring action - movie music and shots of black - and - white footage from the Arab - Israeli wars of the 1940s and ‘ 50s .
They are spliced with shots of a young boy on a rocky beach , watching with sadness as Israeli soldiers pat down Arab men and old women cry over corpses .
Advertisement
“ That ’s supposed to be a young Ahmad Qassir , ” Hiba explains .
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shake hands as Jimmy Carter smiles .
Khomeini descends from his airplane in Tehran .
The actor playing Qassir continues to stare out at the sea , thinking .
“ Qassir is watching , ” she says , over the music .
Israeli fighter jets and tanks roll into Lebanon .
Artillery barrages pummel cities .
Lebanese guerrillas begin to train .
A black - turbaned cleric speaks .

A Peugeot races down a street .
“ This is Ahmad Qassir ’s car , ” Hiba says .
The car makes a sharp turn , and crashes into a building .
Explosions erupt .
On the soundtrack , the voices of the choir sing like angels , and cymbals clatter .
The spotlights shine brightly on a plaster model of a building next to the movie screen , its facade ripped off to reveal the structure ’s innards , orange lights flickering on and off .
The fire dances in Hiba ’s big brown eyes .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Army will report Thursday the highest level of suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 years ago , CNN has learned .
The Army is expected to announce a new effort to study soldier suicides and links to post - combat stress .
Statistics obtained by CNN show that the Army will report 128 confirmed suicides last year and an additional 15 suspected suicides in cases under investigation among active - duty soldiers and activated National Guard and reserves .
The confirmed rate of suicides was 20.2 per 100,000 .
Army officials were reviewing the suspected suicides Wednesday .
If any of them are confirmed , the rate will rise .
In 2007 , the Army reported 115 confirmed suicides , the highest level since 1980 , when it began tracking suicides .
The Army is expected to announce a new effort to study the problem and determine why its suicide - prevention programs appear not to be working , and the extent to which post - combat stress may be a contributing factor .
Many of the suicides occur after troops return home .
The Army has long cited personal stress -- including financial , relationship and substance - abuse problems -- as the major reason for suicides , but it is also studying the extent to which deployments to a war zone may play a role .
Last month , Army officials said the nation 's suicide rate was 19.5 people per 100,000 , a 2005 figure considered the most recent .
Military officials have long said it is difficult to compare the military suicide rate with that of the private sector because of demographic differences and overall human stress factors .
Another factor is that military suicides tend to be young men with access to weapons .
Suicides for Marines were also up in 2008 .
Marines had 41 suicides in 2008 , up from 33 in 2007 and 25 in 2006 , according to a Marines report
The numbers did not surprise Kevin Lucey , whose 23 - year - old son , Jeffrey M. Lucey -- a former Marine -- hanged himself on June 22 , 2004 -- 11 months after returning from Iraq .
The night before , " Jeffrey asked if he could sit in my lap and if we could rock , " Lucey said .
" It was about 11:30 at night .
And I rocked him for about 45 minutes .
Now here you have a 23 - year - old , 150 - pound Marine that I 'm just rocking and his therapist said it was his last gasp .
It was his last place for refuge , and then the next time I held him in my lap was when I was taking him down from the rafters .
He had put the hose around his neck double - looped and he was dead . "
He said his son had not been able to get the treatment he needed from the Veterans Administration .
" What is disappointing is that the intervention does n't appear to be there at the present time , " he told CNN in a telephone interview from his home in western Massachusetts .
The government settled with the family for $ 350,000 .
" The foolish part of all this is we just wanted someone to say they did wrong , " he said .
" But no one would until recently . "
Lucey said the U.S. attorney , acting on behalf of the Veterans Administration , told him his son's case had led the VA mental system to be changed .
Fear of stigma also may have played a role in making his son reluctant to seek professional help .
His son , Lucey said , was afraid that getting mental help would affect his chances of getting a job as a state trooper .
Apparently it did not .
" A year after he died , they accepted him , " the father said .
CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr contributed to this story .
All About Iraq • U.S. Army • Suicide
In May , Amazon [ AMZN ] decided to sue the State of New York , which passed a law requiring the site to collect sales tax on items bought online by New Yorkers — even if Amazon has no physical presence inside the state .
According to the AP , other fiscally - troubled states are now ganging up to pass the same kind of laws .
Is one of the biggest benefits of online shopping about to end ?
States miss out on about $ 3 billion of tax revenue annually because of online shopping , which accounts for about 8 % of all the sales made in the US in a given year — and that number is rising .
An online sales tax would mean everything from iTunes songs to online storage would be taxable according to various state and local tax codes .
The issue is n’t whether consumers should have to pay the state for items purchased from out - of - state retailers ; they are already supposed to self - report those purchases and pay a “ use tax , ” but few people do .
The states ’ new efforts aim to make online retailers collect those taxes on behalf of the state , the way brick - and - mortar stores do .
As of today , there is a ban on states collecting tax revenue from business transactions that occur between a citizen and an out - of - state retailer , going back to a Supreme Court case in 1992 .
But with every government entity reeling from the 2008 economic meltdown , Congress could easily overturn that ban and make online taxation a reality .
Twenty - two states and 1100 brick - and - mortar retailers have responded to the fight by backing an organization called the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board , which will lobby for simplified tax codes for retailers .
Online taxation has been put on the table by the retailers of the group as a bargaining chip for simpler laws .
New York has not joined the SSTGB , because doing so would mean extensive revision of its own tax code .
Critics say that enforcing tax laws online forces online retailers to comply with a byzantine network of codes that vary from area to area , and Amazon has said that New York ’s lawsuit violates their equal protection under the Constitution by targeting their business model specifically .
The State of New York has argued that because sites like Amazon have affiliates in New York that direct traffic to their site , New Yorkers should be paying sales tax there .
Amazon has complied with the law despite their lawsuit , but other retailers like Overstock.com have simply elected to drop their New York affiliates instead of conforming to the regulation .
The AP reports the SSTGB is hoping that a cash - strapped Congress will address the idea of online sales tax in 2009 and draft legislation requiring it .
But that may mean a renewed burden on online retailers : how can they keep customers if they must charge extra for sales tax and shipping ?
At what point is the convenience of online shopping outweighed by potential savings at local retailers ?
Note to reader :
This is a nice little series with about five thousand followers .
But you have to read them in order to know what we are talking about .
If you are following these posts dig right in .
If not , the chain is listed at the bottom of this post .
Take them on , one by one and then come back to read this one .
The general thesis is that Ron Paul can best change the Republican Party by running for president again , that more people respond to a big vision than to a call to get involved at the precinct level , and that there is a way , however unlikely , that Ron Paul can put his activist army to work and set in motion events that could lead to his nomination .
Here we go… .
Ron Paul and Iowa 2011 :
If Ron Paul wins the Iowa Straw Poll ( ISP ) in 2011 , and that is a big “ IF ” which we will address later , he will be in a favorable position to win the Iowa Caucus the following January .
Because , Ron Paul , unlike Palin , Romney , Huckabee , Gingrich and others , will be awakening a movement .
The others will be debating how much the government ’s latest bailout should be .
Or whether there should be six more or three more .
They ca n’t very well say there should n’t have been any since they are already on record .
Only Ron Paul can be saying that the nationalization of the insurance industry or the banks or the car industry and all the others that will follow represented an abandonment of the free market system and the Swedenization of America at a time when even Sweden has backed away from socialism as a failed model .
People say , well Ron Paul was an aberration .
He only “ took ” with an activist ’s segment because of the unpopularity of the Iraq War .
But by 2012 the American economy could very well be in chaos over the decisions we are making now .
Take for example the supply of money .
Trillions of new dollars are being printed .
Eventually , as this continues , our own dollars will be watered down and diluted .
It is like a wave out there that is on its way and will someday soon hit the shore .
It has already been set in motion and it will come .
Every time they print more money it is like a tax on the money in your pocket because they are diminishing from its value .
So George W. Bush , the great conservative , who refused to raise taxes , spent so much money that we did n’t have that he was forced to just print more .
Ironically , we all got taxed by default , by losing the value of the money we had .
President Elect Obama has already said that we should use the new money we are printing to hire the unemployed to rebuild our roads and infrastructure .
Sounds like a good idea .
Anyone who had traveled around the world has seen how American highways and bridges and airports and train routes have deteriorated compared to other countries and regions , especially Western Europe , where the strain of distances is not so great .
But the newly printed money that we put in the pockets of these workers will compete for food and fuel , driving up prices and diluting the power of the money being earned by workers in the free marketplace .
Those American workers who are productive and doing business based on natural supply and demand and who are hiring out of need , not out of charity , will see their capital diminished setting in motion a further need for the government to nationalize and hire and tax or print more money to further prop up its artificially created market .
The American middle class , bearing the brunt of all of this , could very well be in an uproar in 2012 , ready to listen to someone who saw this coming for decades and warned against it .
And all the other candidates will be arguing over the details of the involvement in our latest war and who supports the troops the most and what strategies should have been employed .
And what we should do now .
Only Ron Paul will have warned against foreign intervention in the first place .
Romney won the 2008 ISP but lost in the Caucus because he failed to secure any understanding with Evangelical leaders .
Like Steve Forbes in 2000 , he gobbled up every Movement Conservative for sale in Washington D.C. , hiring them or giving them titles and bringing them onboard .
But like Forbes , they dominated the conservative talk radio and television for their candidate but had little or no impact in Iowa .
It is because almost all of these leaders are Catholic and while they have some impact in New Hampshire , and a lot as conservative opinion makers , they have little impact on the Southern Baptist South or the Pentecostal – Charismatic states like Iowa .
The key Iowa evangelical activists and political operatives that Romney brought onboard could deliver very little .
As a Mormon he should have understood that Iowa Evangelical activists and leaders are linked to their national leaders of influence .
If James Dobson would have given his “ okay , ” for example , it would have been far more powerful than to have some local , Iowa , Family Research Council director weigh in .
And even Dobson would n’t have been as important as a Pentecostal or Charismatic leader who could have awakened the locals .
Romney had the talented Mark DeMoss carrying his water as an Evangelical on the national scene but while that might have eventually helped him in some southern states it had little influence with the Pentecostal - Charismatic circles in Iowa .
It may have even hurt .
DeMoss was seen by the leadership as Jerry Falwell ’s sidekick , during the Baptist “ raid ” of PTL .
Ironically , Governor Mike Huckabee , a Baptist , understood this and courted the Pentecostal television preacher Kenneth Copeland , flying to Texas and appearing on his show .
Long before it aired , the news was out in Iowa .
Ron Paul will have the right socio-cultural plan in place because he has friends now who support him and can help him craft it .
And Ron Paul will be right on the issues because his views are immovable , based on principle .
His ship is guided by the stars and so it knows where it is on any issue and any time .
The formula that allows him to win the ISP , which we will visit in an upcoming post , will allow him to win the Caucus too .
Because if he wins the ISP , he will awaken the giant .
A new movement will be born .
A new purpose for the Republican Party will emerge and the political lines will be totally rescrambled .
And the same formula that wins the ISP , will work for the caucus as well .
So what ’s the next discussion , New Hampshire ?
No .
There are two other things we have to talk about first .
The debates , which were the key to his emergence last time and the fundraising power of the ISP win .
The debates will take another post but we can talk about the fundraising right now .
Immediately after a win in the ISP , Ron Paul must embark on a national victory fundraising tour .
Remember , the value of winning ISP is the time you have before the next big contest .
He must use that time to raise money .
He must have his picture taken at $ 1,000 a pop with every supporter in the nation .
He must autograph 20,000 copies of his TIME magazine cover story .
He will need all the money he can get to pour into Iowa for a caucus win the next January .
This will raise the ante ever further .
He must max the limits of advertising in Iowa and neighboring states with TV buys that have big cross boarder viewing audiences and have in place a national fundraising system to milk an Iowa Caucus win for that one precious week of fundraising before New Hampshire .
But again , all of this depends on an Iowa Straw Poll win in the summer of 2011 and that is highly unlikely but possible because it is a small universe where he meets the money threshold and where his activist advantage kicks in .
More in the next post on how he can actually pull that off and thus trigger the explosion of a national movement .

The name was never meant to stick .
When Doug Engelbart and his team at the Stanford Research Institute in California designed a computer controller encased in a carved - out wooden block , with wheels mounted on the underbelly , one researcher nicknamed it a ' mouse ' .
' We thought that when it had escaped out to the world it would have a more dignified name , ' Engelbart recalled later .
' But it did n't . '
Engelbart 's invention became the mouse that soared , an essential piece of computer hardware .
Its 40th birthday will be celebrated next week when Engelbart returns to Stanford ( now known as SRI International ) .
The mouse was first shown to the world when he gave a presentation of a working network computer system in San Francisco on 9 December , 1968 , which is still revered as ' the dawn of interactive computing ' .
Yet in one sense Engelbart , now 83 , was far ahead of his time .
He never received royalties , partly because his patent ran out just before the tech revolution that saw the computer and mouse supplant pen and paper .
Now the mouse faces growing competition from a new generation of touchscreens .
Engelbart first started making notes for the mouse in 1961 , after deciding that he could do better than the standard gadget , a light pen which had been used on radar systems during the Second World War .
' We had a big heavy tracking ball - it was like a cannonball , ' he said .
' We had several gadgets that ended up with pivots you could move around .
We had a light panel you had to hold up right next to the screen so the computer could see it .
And a joystick that you wiggle around to try to steer things . '
One of Engelbart 's collaborators , Bill English , built an 'x -y positioning device ' made from a wooden shell with wheels and a connecting cord , or ' tail ' , at the back .
The cord got in the way when it was used , however , and so it was moved to the front .
' We set up our experiments and the mouse won in every category , even though it had never been used before , ' Engelbart recalls on his website .
' It was faster , and with it people made fewer mistakes .
Five or six of us were involved in these tests , but no one can remember who started calling it a mouse .
I 'm surprised the name stuck . '
Xerox developed the mouse during the Seventies and launched the first commercial product with the Xerox Star computer system in 1981 .
It failed to take off , but when Apple bought the mouse patent for its Macintosh in 1984 success was assured , and it was eventually taken up by the mass PC market for use with Microsoft Windows .
By then Engelbart 's patent had expired , meaning that he missed out on a potential fortune , although later mice used different mechanisms which could have been claimed not to infringe the original patent if the matter had ever gone to court .
The Stanford Research Institute licensed the mouse to Apple for just $ 40,000 , according to the book Inventors and Inventions , published by Marshall Cavendish , which tells how in 1989 Engelbart lost both his laboratory and his house - the latter burnt down while he and his family stood outside helpless .
But together with his daughter , he set up the Bootstrap Institute to promote his ideas , and in 1998 he was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President Bill Clinton for ' creating the foundations of modern computing ' .
The mouse now faces unprecedented competition .
Laptops which make no use of a mouse are an increasingly popular alternative to desktop computers for workers on the move .
Apple 's popular iPhone and Nintendo's Wii have shown the potential for touchscreens and movement sensors .
HP is pushing a mouse - less TouchSmart PC .
Microsoft has invested millions of dollars in a coffee table - shaped ' Surface ' computer which responds to natural hand gestures , touch and physical objects .

The Growing War Between Modern Medicine and the Public

Everybody is talking about health - care reform , but true reform is clearly out of the question .
Like the banks and the automobile manufacturers , the health - care system should be allowed to collapse without a government bailout .
But the federal government has been bailing out the failed health - care industry all along .
Tom Daschle , the newly appointed health policy adviser to President - elect Barack Obama , and soon to be Health and Human Services secretary , says the U.S. health - care system is in need of a major overhaul , and most agree , but it appears the government will continue to expand insurance coverage for a broken health - care system , paying for more unproven and even disproven treatments .
Moreover , government intends to expand health insurance coverage for millions of Americans , which will surely increase demand for services at a time when there is a shortage of primary care doctors .
Wo n’t expanded coverage ( $ 2500 per uninsured American ) prompt many families to drop their existing insurance plans and attempt to qualify for the new government plan , thus causing the whole program to implode with burgeoning costs ?
Furthermore , the federal government estimates about 40 million Americans are uninsured , but this figure is likely to grow by millions in the current economic downturn .
How does government intend to rein in health - care costs and at the same time increase utilization ?
Job creation is now paramount in the incoming Administration .
Long term , planners are counting on the Baby Boomers getting older and sicker , thus creating new jobs in the health - care arena .
Americans had better get sick on time , and develop chronic diseases that require more and more health care , so more Americans can be employed as nurses , nurse ’s aides , home health aides , etc .
How does a nation significantly reduce health - care costs and yet plan on increased employment in the health - care industry ?
This is the moral crux for American medicine .
Should Americans become healthier and need less health care , there will be fewer jobs .
Maybe this is why modern medicine drags its feet when it comes to preventive medicine .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , among all occupations in the economy , health - care occupations are expected to make up 7 of the 20 fastest growing occupations , the largest proportion of any occupational group .
These health - care occupations , in addition to exhibiting high growth rates , will add nearly 750,000 new jobs between 2006 and 2016 , according to government projections .
More than 3 out of every 10 new jobs created in the U.S. economy are predicted to be in either the health - care and social assistance or public and private educational services sectors .
What if these jobs never materialize ?
The federal government will soon be unable to meet its obligations to provide health care for retirees .
The Medicare program will default on $ 62 trillion of care it promised to deliver to aging Baby Boomers , beginning in 2012 .
The only foreseeable way out of this problem is to reduce demand for care by prolonging the health span ( years of healthy , unimpaired , unmedicated life ) before age - related diseases set in .
A delay of 7 years before the onset of age - related disease would save the Medicare program from bankruptcy .
The increased life expectancy of Americans has largely been achieved over the past century by reductions in childhood mortality .
Now the focus is on reduction of mortality rates among senior Americans , adding more healthy years to the end of life .
The prospect for an anti-aging pill that can slow aging is not a pipe dream .
A few years ago the Rand Corporation think - tank , addressing future technologies that may impact Medicare , added an " anti-aging " pill to the future Medicare budget .
Health planners know such a technology may soon become a reality .
These pills could stave off the onset of disease , even quell infections without conventional antibiotics , and may actually prevent many diseases rather than a pill for every different disease .
Such a pill may not emanate from a pharmaceutical laboratory .
It may come from nature .
A growing body of scientific evidence which shows that dietary supplementation with vitamin D , fish oil , and molecules found in red wine ( resveratrol , quercetin , ferulic acid , etc. ) and bran ( whole grains ) , may reduce the need for medical care altogether .
Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley suggests the higher prevalence of disease among the poor emanates from undernutrition , a problem that could be remedied with an inexpensive multivitamin .
There is concern that with a poor economy and growing unemployment , more Americans will choose cheap , less nutrient - dense foods , which may increase the incidence of disease .
This would increase the need for food fortification and dietary supplementation .
Europeans visiting America are shocked to see so many overweight Americans .
Never do Americans realize , unlike other nations , they are being intentionally bred to overeat .
The medical profession does little to stop this , treating all dietary - related diseases as if they are drug deficiencies .
Processed foods are adulterated with taste stimulants and other ingredients that create more hunger by raising insulin resistance .
Insulin that ca n’t enter cells to produce energy , disengages satiation .
This is one way food producers increase their sales , by getting Americans to eat more food .
The government is complicit in spawning the diabesity epidemic by subsidizing the production of non-nutrient - dense foods and high - fructose corn syrup , and promoting a " food pyramid " that suggests Americans consume more food , not less ( 17 — 23 servings a day ) , and many servings of meat , processed gains and dairy products which foster obesity .
It is obvious that modern medicine is an industry that wants more , not less , disease to treat .
Patients are aware that doctors are n’t interested in disease prevention .
Conventional medicine is quick to dismiss any truly preventive therapies as unproven and requiring more study .
A current hidden agenda is to publish pseudo - science in medical journals so nutritional approaches to disease prevention can be dismissed as not being " evidence based . "
Yet , by comparison , there are very few treatments in modern medicine that are truly " evidence based . "
For example , statin anti-cholesterol drugs are approved by the FDA even though they do n’t reduce mortality rates and prevent a non-mortal heart attack in less than 1 in 100 healthy adults .
Add flu shots to the list of disproven therapies .
They have not been shown to reduce mortality from flu - related illness among high - risk groups ( young children and older adults . )
The cervical cancer vaccine has not saved one life , and may never do so , and may produce nothing more than side effects ( 9,749 adverse reactions and 21 reported deaths related to this vaccine in the last two years ) .
There are no proven cures for cancer , and radiation and chemotherapy cannot even penetrate solid tumors , which represent 70 — 90 % of cancers , but patients are never told this .
There is no way chemotherapy can work because tumor resistance is inevitable and it destroys the immune system .
A published study shows chemotherapy only contributes to the 5 - year survival of cancer patients 2.3 % of the time .
( Would you return to an automobile repair shop that only fixed your car less than 3 % of the time ? )
Chemotherapy is approved by the FDA if it temporarily shrinks a tumor by 50 % , not if it prolongs survival .
Who can blame cancer patients for searching for unproven alternatives ?
Chemo and radiation therapy have been disproven .
It has been said that the only technologies that have been validated in modern medicine are the repair of bone fractures , the repair of teeth , and the removal and replacement of cloudy cataracts with clear lens implants .
It ’s no wonder a whopping 38 % of American adults ( 12 % of children ) have opted for alternative medicine , says a newly released study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s National Center for Health Statistics .
Where else can the public turn ?
But this statistic is thrown out as if it is evidence of a mindless public that elects to choose unproven therapies over FDA - approved drugs and devices .
Yet studies show the most educated citizens utilize alternative medicine .
Americans elect to choose alternatives because conventional medicine is ineffective , even hazardous , and is simply beyond affordability .
Many patients are belittled when they tell their doctors they are taking dietary supplements in lieu of problematic prescription drugs .
Under the guise that dietary supplements may interfere with prescription drugs ( actually , it ’s the other way around ) , the National Institutes of Health has conjured up a program to encourage patients to " confess " to their doctors that they are taking dietary supplements .
The vitamin pill inquisition is underway .
Modern medicine realizes it has lost market share to alternative medicines .
Americans are increasingly distrustful of prescription medicines , reading daily news reports of people dying needlessly from side effects from FDA - approved drugs .
According to a Harris Poll ( 2005 ) , 35 % of Americans who were prescribed drugs did n’t take them because they wanted to save money and another 28 % left their drugs on the medicine shelf because of " frightening side effects . "
More Americans are going to have to find ways to stay healthy outside of running to the doctor for everything that ails them .
The health - care system , and the insurance system , wo n’t be there for them .
An unorganized self - care revolution is now in progress , which proceeds largely without doctor guidance or cooperation .
More Americans are shunning problematic and overpriced prescription medications for vitamin and herbal supplements .
The National Health Federation is leading that effort .

While builders have cut back drastically on the production of new homes ( see story ) , it ’s likely lenders will soon be putting pressure on inventories even if they succeed in efforts to keep more troubled borrowers in their homes rather than foreclosing on them .
Inventories of unsold homes are likely to swell in coming months as lenders begin to push a growing backlog of repossessed homes up for sale — often in communities already awash in distressed properties .
Editor ’s note :
This is the first installment in a two - part series that focuses on the waves of foreclosed , bank - owned properties ( also known as real estate - owned properties or REOs ) that will hit the for - sale market , and the plans and pitfalls for reducing this inventory .
Click here to read Part II .
Inventories of unsold homes are likely to swell in coming months as lenders begin to push a growing backlog of repossessed homes up for sale — often in communities already awash in distressed properties .
While builders have cut back drastically on the production of new homes ( see story ) , it ’s likely lenders will soon be putting pressure on inventories even if they succeed in efforts to keep more troubled borrowers in their homes rather than foreclosing on them .
Because it can take weeks or months for lenders to put repossessed homes on the market , the impact of real estate - owned ( REO ) properties on inventories lags behind foreclosures .
Government efforts to recapitalize banks through the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) and other bailout measures may also have taken some of the heat off of lenders to unload REO properties at fire - sale prices .
But with the emphasis of TARP and other government relief efforts now expected to shift to creating jobs , helping troubled borrowers avoid foreclosure and providing incentives for home buyers ( see story ) , lenders could soon unleash a torrent of real - estate owned , or " REO " properties — even in markets already flooded with an oversupply of homes for sale .
" It ’s almost like a tsunami — you can see it coming and you know it ’s going to hit but you cant get out of the way , " said Ann Stickel , vice president of affiliated services with Sarasota , Fla . - based brokerage Michael Saunders and Co .
The value of REO property on the books of FDIC - insured banks at the end of the third quarter surged 21 percent from the previous quarter , to $ 23 billion .
That total — which includes single - family to four - family homes valued at $ 11.5 billion and another $ 1.5 billion in property purchased with FHA - backed loans securitized by Ginnie Mae — represents a 134 percent increase from a year ago , according to the latest quarterly report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
Repossessions by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac grew by nearly 25 percent from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2008 , hitting 15,196 homes , according to a recent foreclosure prevention report by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) .
With Fannie and Freddie repossessing homes faster than they could sell them , the companies were left with 95,553 REO properties to dispose of at the end of September — a 25.5 percent increase in just three months .
Not all of those homes are in areas hard - hit by speculation and subprime lending , either .
About six out of 10 homes in Fannie and Freddie ’s REO inventory were purchased with prime loans available only to borrowers with good credit .
Fannie and Freddie both stopped foreclosing on loans they own over the holidays ( Fannie ’s moratorium is in effect throughout the end of January — see story ) and several states have passed legislation that ’s intended to slow down the foreclosure process .
Lenders are also stepping up their efforts to do workouts and loan modifications with troubled borrowers , rather than foreclosing on them .
But those measures may only be slowing down the foreclosure process for many borrower , and the downturn in the economy and rising job losses have many convinced that foreclosure filings will continue to rise .
President Obama is promising Congress that $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion of the next round of TARP money will be committed to foreclosure - relief programs aimed at reducing mortgage payments for troubled borrowers , and broadening the scope of FHA ’s little - used " Hope for Homeowners " refinance program .
With more than half of the loans modified by lenders in the first quarter of 2008 already in default again ( see story ) , it ’s clear that lenders will have to take the more drastic step of reducing the principal balance to make loan mods work , said Sean O’Toole , founder and CEO of ForeclosureRadar.com , a company that tracks California homes through the foreclosure process .
Forgiving loan principal is something lenders and loan servicers have n’t been very willing to do so far , O’Toole said — in part because of the potential for legal objections by investors who own the securities many mortgages were packaged into .
" We likely have $ 4 trillion in bad mortgage debt created created during a period of inflated home prices , " O’Toole said .
" Any program that does n’t directly deal with eliminating that debt only delays the inevitable and makes this problem worse .
Foreclosure remains the only working mechanism for clearing this bad debt at the moment . "
If lenders are n’t willing to do more meaningful loan modifications , Congress could give bankruptcy judges the power to " cram down " loan principal — a bad idea , lending industry critics say , because that ’s likely to raise the cost of borrowing for all home buyers .
Another idea is for the government to provide incentives to servicers or guarantee a portion of lender ’s losses when they agree to do loan modifications that involve principal write downs .
Some states have also attempted to address foreclosures , with limited success .
O’Toole has been monitoring the impact of a California law , SB 1137 , like similar statutes in other states including North Carolina , Maryland and New Jersey , is intended to slow down the pace of foreclosures by creating new hoops for lenders to jump through .
California ’s law , which requires lenders to reach out to homeowners and extends the waiting period before initiating foreclosure proceedings , put a significant dent in notice of default filings when it took effect in September .
But foreclosure filings rebounded in November and December as the new extended waiting period called for in the law expired .
Ominous statistics
Statistics compiled by data aggregator RealtyTrac hint at the magnitude of the problem nationwide .
RealtyTrac tracked foreclosure - related filings on 2.3 million U.S. properties in 2008 , an 87 percent jump from the year before , with 861,664 homes making it through the entire process to become REOs ( see story ) .
The Mortgage Bankers Association ’s surveys of members suggest one out of 10 mortgages was either delinquent or in the foreclosure process at the end of September , and Moody ’s Economy.com estimates 12 million homeowners are " upside down " — they owe more on their homes than their properties would fetch in today ’s market .
RealtyTrac senior vice president Rick Sharga told attendees at the Inman News Real Estate Connect conference in New York City this month that an analysis of 500,000 distressed properties in four states in the company ’s database found only about one in four were listed for sale in a multiple listing service , or MLS .
That suggests that as many as 75 percent of distressed properties have yet to hit the market , Sharga said , and that many of those homes will soon be putting pressure on inventory and prices as banks repossess them and put them up for sale .
Those are ominous numbers , given the 11 - month supply of new and existing homes available at the end of November — well above the six months generally considered to represent a healthy balance of supply and demand .
Joshua Olshin , president of New York , N.Y. - based Tranzon Integrated Property Group , said that the possibility that a wave of REO properties is about to enter the market creates uncertainty and puts downward pressure on prices .
" People see the foreclosure numbers , and that banks are not even selling what they have , and then we have a whole new load ( of REOs ) coming on , and that ’s causing people not to price things effectively and accurately , " Olshin said .
" It ’s kind of compounding the problem , I think . "
Tranzon helps institutional property owners like financial institutions , corporations , developers and investment groups market and sell property through auctions or a sealed bid process .
The government ’s TARP purchases of preferred shares gave some banks a thicker capital cushion — if only fleetingly — which regulators hoped they would use to make more loans .
Instead , some banks have moved to acquire weaker competitors .
" Last summer , we began seeing banks be much more aggressive in the way they priced things , " Olshin said .
But banks may also not want to recognize losses that accompany the sale of properties at deep discounts when they are having difficulty raising the capital they need to meet statutory minimums , Olshin said .
" To be frank , since the TARP money came in , they are still selling off ( properties at auction ) , but they kind of took a step back . "
In the process of acquiring troubled rivals , banks may write down the value of some of the bad loans on their books .
Once the loans are written down — often to as little as 20 cents on the dollar , Olshin said — some of the pressure to foreclose on properties and sell them is gone .
" The loans are being carried for what they are worth , and they think there ’s upside potential " to hold onto properties and sell them when prices rebound , Olshin said .
" We think there ’s not an upside potential — that we ’re going to be in this problem for awhile . "
Lenders are trying to stretch out some of their losses , and avoid the need for massive new reserve funding when possible , said Norm Miller , a professor at the Burnham - Moores Center for Real Estate at the University of San Diego .
At the same time , Miller said lenders are " overwhelmed with the sheer volume of defaults which may turn into foreclosure . "
Auction boom
Regardless of any pullbacks by lenders , Tranzon and other auctioneers had a banner year in 2008 , and expect this year will be even better .
" I think we ’ll see a lot more properties moving to auction as banks realize they need to sell at the market price , " Olshin said .
Real Estate Disposition LLC ( REDC ) , which claims to be the nation ’s largest real estate auction company , held 300 ballroom auctions in 2008 and sold nearly 33,000 foreclosed homes for $ 3.4 billion — a seven - fold increase in sales volume and nearly triple the proceeds the company generated in 2007 .
Company CEO Jeffrey Frieden said he expects to " smash that record " this year as banks and lenders continue to amass a huge inventory of foreclosed homes and are more motivated than ever to sell their inventory .
" I ’d say all of the top 10 loan servicers have an auction strategy in place , and that between 5 and 15 percent of the ( REO ) portfolio is sold through auction , " said Michael Davin , president and co-founder of Hermosa Beach , Calif . - based discount brokerage CataList Homes Inc .
CataList , which provides marketing and transaction management expertise for sellers , is a partner with the Los Angeles Times Media Group and others in Zetabid , an online auction marketplace for bank - and builder - owned properties .
Industry groups like the National Association of Realtors , the Mortgage Bankers Association and the National Association of Home Builders have been pushing for more emphasis on incentives for buyers , such as tax credits , subsidized interest rates , and higher loan limits for Fannie , Freddie and FHA loan guarantee programs ( see story ) .
But O’Toole thinks such subsidies were what " got us into this trouble in the first place .
Subsidies may increase demand , and in the case of subsidized interest rates might even increase prices , but for how long ? "
Some observers fear that if the massive amount of debt the government is taking on to stimulate a recovery , inflation — and higher interest rates — are inevitable consequences .
Inflation can spur home sales because households are looking for an inflation - proof place to park their assets .
But rising interest rates can also reduce consumer ’s home - buying power , undermining prices .
If interest rates shoot up , buyers who close a deal on a home with a subsidized mortgage could see the value of their homes plummet when subsidies end and interest rates shoot up .
" Unless we want to continue the foreclosure cycle , we need to return to traditional home - buying practices — with qualified buyers , in affordable homes , at market interest rates , " O’Toole said .
Stickel said she is all for programs aimed at preventing foreclosures and keeping troubled borrowers in their homes , because that would help check falling home prices .
" I really think if we can just keep people in their homes , we ’re going to do wonders for stabilizing our market , " Stickel said .
" I do n’t know if that ’s what a real estate agent wants to hear — that if I can keep someone in their home , then I can sell a home . "
But Stickel thinks a strategy emphasizing foreclosure prevention would actually produce a healthier environment than a market glutted with REOs , because stemming foreclosures would limit the carnage among lenders and get buyers off the fence .
From his perspective in Oakland , Calif . broker - owner L.J. Jennings said the key to stabilizing neighborhoods hit hard by speculators and foreclosure is to get properties in the hands of homeowners , rather than investors .
That means bringing homes up to livable condition , or providing loans that provide the funds for buyers to make repairs on their own .
Jennings , whose Pyramid Real Estate and Investments specializes in REO properties , also wants to see more TARP money channeled directly into foreclosure relief — including government guarantees of loan modifications — rather than used to prop up banks ’ bottom lines .
" Let ’s hope the next round of TARP reaches consumers , " Jennings said .

Still hunting for Christmas gifts for that special conservative someone ?
Well , look no further than the Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute , a nonprofit group advocating for Republican women , and their new 2009 pin-up calendar , Pretty in Mink !
The project can be summed up in four words : Ann Coulter , Miss September .
But in case anyone 's worried about right - leaning pundits such as Michelle Malkin ( see No 28 on this list ) being objectified , Sarah Palin - style , the Luce Institute can explain :
We took some of your favorite leaders of today 's conservative movement on a journey back in time , and made them up into glamorous movie stars of classic Hollywood .
Back when the big screen was a little more glamorous , women were a little more feminine , the men a little more charming — and the world a little less politically correct .
Such a canny PR move recalls the immortal words of Luce herself : " Advertising has done more to cause the social unrest of the 20th century than any other single factor . "
In perhaps the most shocking news since the dawn of time , a new ThinkProgress report finds that when it comes to discussion of the Obama stimulus plan on cable news , FOX News has actually been the most " balanced " , hosting only slightly more Republicans than Democrats .
MSNBC and CNN , on the other hand , have given substantially more time to the GOP .
ThinkProgress :
In total , from 6 AM on Monday to 4 PM on Wednesday , the networks have hosted Republican lawmakers 51 times and Democratic lawmakers only 24 times .
Surprisingly , Fox News came the closest to offering balance , hosting 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats .
CNN had only one Democrat compared to 7 Republicans .
The drastically imbalanced coverage is n’t the first time that the news networks have effectively supported attacks on the recovery plans .
As ThinkProgress reported on Monday , the cable networks , the Sunday shows and the network newscasts promoted a controversial CBO non-report 81 times before the actual CBO analysis of the stimulus plan was released .

Even as Congress looks for ways to expand President Obama ’s $ 819 billion stimulus package , the rest of the world is wondering how Washington will pay for it all .
Few people attending the World Economic Forum question the need to kick - start America ’s economy , the world ’s largest , with a package that could reach $ 1 trillion over two years .
But the long - term fallout from increased borrowing by the United Stated government , and its potential to drive up inflation and interest rates around the world , seems to getting more attention here than in Washington .
“ The U.S. needs to show some proof they have a plan to get out of the fiscal problem , ” said Ernesto Zedillo , the former Mexican president who helped steer his country through a financial crisis in 1994 .
“ We , as developing countries , need to know we wo n’t be crowded out of the capital markets , which is already happening . ”
Mr. Zedillo said that Washington , unlike most other countries , had the option of simply printing more money , because the dollar was a reserve currency for the rest of the world .

Obama order could present problems for Rove John Byrne
Published : Tuesday January 27 , 2009
Print This Email
This A little - noticed twist in an order issued by President Barack Obama the day after his inauguration may present problems for former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove and other Bush Administration officials that have been targeted for their alleged role in various scandals .
Rove was subpoenaed Monday afternoon by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
When the dogged Democrat subpoenaed him last year , Bush Administration lawyers invoked " executive immunity " to prevent Rove from testifying .
This year , however , George W. Bush is no longer in the president 's chair .
Determination of executive privilege must now also be examined by President Obama 's lawyers .
In fact , Rove 's lawyer made direct reference to Obama 's role in any future decision to enjoin Rove 's appearance on the congressional witness stand Monday night .
" It 's generally agreed that former presidents retain executive privilege as to matters occurring during their term , " Rove 's lawyer , Robert Luskin , told The Washington Post .
" We 'll solicit the views of the new White House counsel and , if there is a disagreement , assume that the matter will be resolved among the courts , the president and the former president . "
Luskin does n't concede that Rove is n't covered by Bush 's blanket immunity , but appears to acknowledge that the question of keeping Rove off the witness stand has become more complex .
" The Attorney General and the Counsel to the President , in the exercise of their discretion and after appropriate review and consultation under subsection ( a ) of this section , may jointly determine that invocation of executive privilege is not justified , " Obama said in his executive order Jan. 21 .
" The Archivist shall be notified promptly of any such determination . "
In addition , a White House counsel to President Bill Clinton told The Washington Post late Monday that a recent executive order issued by President Obama directing the National Archives to consult with Justice Department and White House lawyers " concerning the Archivist 's determination as to whether to honor the former president 's claim of privilege or instead to disclose the presidential records notwithstanding the claim of privilege , " could open the door to the release of more information relating to controversies under the Bush Administration .
" The language , " the Post wrote , " according to W. Neil Eggleston , a White House associate counsel during the Clinton administration , leaves open the possibility that more information could emerge in some long - running controversies . "
Whether Rove can stay off the witness stand indefinitely is an open question .
He could certainly plead the Fifth -- invoking his constitutional right to avoid self - incrimination -- and refuse to answer questions .
But Obama 's order opened the door to the release of presidential records the Bush Administration fought aggressively to keep out of the public eye .
On the flip side , Vice President Dick Cheney recently won a court case seeking his vice presidential records ; the court said that the Vice President alone gets to make the determination as to which records are personal and which records should become public .
The Presidential Records Act , which requires Administrations to surrender their files to the National Archives upon leaving office , provides an exemption for records of a personal nature .
Obama might also effectively protect Rove and President Bush by retaining a broad interpretation of executive privilege .
Such an interpretation would n't be designed to save Rove from congressional investigators -- instead , it would allow Obama to protect himself and his team upon his own departure from the Oval Office .

Oasis axeman Noel Gallagher has admitted that he could never be considered better than " average " on the guitar .
In an interview with Total Guitar magazine , the Mancunian suggested that while his ability is enough to help him achieve what he wants with his band , he is nowhere near as good as his friends Paul Weller and Johnny Marr .
" Those two are virtuosos to me although neither of them would admit it , " he remarked .
" On the electric guitar they 're it . "
Weller , who made his name in the Jam , nevertheless had some consolatory words for his mate .
He said that while his style is " rudimentary " , Gallagher does have a " distinctive " sound , particularly when playing rhythm guitar and designing chord progressions .
None of the three musicians placed inside the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list that was published by Rolling Stone in 2008 .
In those rankings , Jimi Hendrix came out on top , ahead of Duane Allman and BB King .

Hormonal women are more responsive to manly men , and Kinsey Institute researchers have the brain scans to prove it .
Women participating in the Kinsey study were shown 224 photos of men's faces , some of which had been " masculinized " or " feminized " using photo - morphing software .
MRI scans revealed higher levels of brain response to the masculinized photos , particularly in women who were in the phase of their menstrual cycle immediately preceding ovulation and higher fertility .
The study , published this month in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior , is the first to show differences in neural activation to masculinized and feminized faces .
One of the areas of the brain most activated by the images , the anterior cingulated cortex , is involved in decision - making and assessment , which indicates that women are calculating the risks and rewards related to a man with high levels of testosterone .
" Because male traits generally thought to predict good condition and even genetic quality often coincide with less desirable characteristics , women must balance potentially disparate mating priorities , " writes Heather Rupp , who headed up the study .
" For example , although men characterized by more masculine testosterone - linked traits may be socially dominant and physically healthy , they are also less likely to invest in offspring and to enter into a partnered relationship . "
In the battle of nurture vs. nature , however , ovulating women ultimately will choose in favor of genetically strong children .
At other points in the menstrual cycle , the feminized faces are preferred , indicating a dip in certain hormones and a preference for men who are willing to stick around and play catch with Junior .
" As is true for most social behaviors , both biology and social influences impact the output of behavior , and likely interact , " Rupp told LiveScience .
In addition , Rupp and her colleagues asked the women — none of whom were on hormonal contraceptives — to subjectively rate the images , and discovered that scan results did n't always match up with stated preference .
The finding is a nod to the complexity of sex , and the phenomenon of making up your mind without using your brain .

Who Survives a Plane Crash ?
When a jetliner made a water landing on the Hudson River last week and all 155 passengers survived , Levitt wrote that maybe airplane safety briefings are n’t entirely useless after all .
In his forthcoming book The Survivors Club , Ben Sherwood writes that around 30 percent of plane - crash fatalities could have been prevented had the passengers known what to do .
Sherwood is a journalist and the former executive producer of Good Morning America .
His book , he says , “ reveals the hidden side ” of who survives and who dies in crises spanning from cancer to bear attacks .
Below , Sherwood answers our questions about the Hudson River crash and why everyone survived .
Are emergency water landings really such rare occurrences , or is that a misconception ?
In commercial aviation , a deliberate emergency landing on the water — known as “ ditching ” — is very rare .
Including USAir 1549 , there have only been four intentional ditchings since the beginning of commercial airliner service in 1958 , according to AirSafe.com .
Of 442 passengers and crew involved in those intentional ditchings , by my own math , 66 percent survived .
In general aviation — smaller private planes — ditching is more common .
From 1983 to 1999 , there were 143 ditchings , according to the government .
In 86 percent of the incidents , there were no fatalities .
A misconception you write about in the book is that in a plane crash , people become panicky and animalistic and pandemonium ensues .
What can people actually expect in such a situation ?
Panic is one of the biggest myths of disasters and emergencies .
We ’re accustomed to seeing pandemonium and chaos in disaster movies , but experts say that kind of unreasoning fear and hysteria almost never happens in real life .
In fact , one of the most surprising things you ’ll encounter in a disaster is inaction .
Believe it or not , but most people do nothing .
They ’re bewildered .
In a stupor , they wait for instructions .
Experts say that 80 percent of us are likely to respond this way with so - called “ behavioral inaction . ”
Only 10 percent act quickly and decisively .
Fortunately , just 10 percent of us act dangerously or counterproductively .
We also should n’t forget that 150 ordinary people without any evacuation training managed to get off USAir 1549 without serious incident .
It was “ organized chaos , ” they reported , which should n’t come as any surprise .
Pushing and shoving should be expected in a narrow aluminum cylinder that was supposed to land in North Carolina instead of a frigid river .
You mention in the book that certain personality traits can work for or against you in survival situations .
How does this apply to , say , someone who is an optimist ?
Optimism is a critical survival tool , but only when it ’s balanced with realism .
This concept is known as the Stockdale Paradox , named after Admiral James Stockdale , the highest - ranking American prisoner of war in Vietnam .
The idea was popularized by author Jim Collins in his best - selling book Good to Great .
When Collins asked Stockdale to explain which American prisoners did not survive captivity in Vietnam , the admiral replied , “ Oh , that ’s easy .
The optimists . ”
Collins was perplexed , but Stockdale explained that the optimists “ were the ones who said ‘ we ’re going to be out by Christmas . ’
And Christmas would come , and Christmas would go ; and then Thanksgiving , and then it would be Christmas again .
And they died of a broken heart . ”
Stockdale went on : “ This is a very important lesson .
You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end — which you can never afford to lose — with discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality , whatever they might be . ”
Can a positive outcome to a crash like USAir 1549 change often unrealistic public perceptions of the fatality of plane crashes ?
I doubt it .
It ’s incredibly safe to fly — your chances of dying on your next domestic flight are just one in 60 million — but many Americans are still petrified of air travel .
It ’s no surprise : Plane crashes monopolize media coverage .
Indeed , one MIT study found that airplane crash coverage on the front page of The New York Times was 60 times greater than reporting on HIV / AIDS per 1,000 deaths ; 1,500 times greater than reporting on auto hazards ; and 6,000 times greater than cancer .
How much can I really increase my chances of surviving a plane crash ?
Up to 30 percent of the deaths in plane crashes are preventable if passengers know what to do , according to experts .
In other words , you can make a difference in saving your life in a plane crash ( or virtually any situation ) .
Pay attention to the safety briefing and information card .
Rehearse an escape plan in your mind :
What ’s your primary exit and your backup ?
Count the number of rows to each of those two exits .
If you can , sit within five rows of any exit ; your chances of survival are much greater if you ’re within that range .
Again , if you can , choose an aisle seat for more mobility .
And then , try to relax .
Experts say that a stress - induced heart attack is a much greater threat on an airplane than a crash .
The other way to prepare for adversity is to know more about your survivor personality and how you would behave in a crisis .

G etting S tarted with BASH
A Bash Tutorial
What is the Bash Shell ?
The GNU Bourne - Again SHell ( BASH ) incorporates features from the C Shell ( csh ) and the Korn Shell ( ksh ) and conforms to the POSTIX 2 shell specifications .
It provides a Command Line Interface ( CLI ) for working on *nix systems and is the most common shell used on Linux systems .
Useful bash features will be the subject of the rest of this document .
Bash 's Configuration Files
Because what I want to say here has already been written I will quote the section entitled " Files used by Bash " from freeunix.dyndns.org 's " Customizing your Bash environment "
In your home directory , 3 files have a special meaning to Bash , allowing you to set up your environment automatically when you log in and when you invoke another Bash shell , and allow you to execute commands when you log out .
These files may exist in your home directory , but that depends largely on the Linux distro you 're using and how your sysadmin ( if not you ) has set up your account .
If they 're missing , Bash defaults to /etc / profile .
You can easily create these files yourself using your favorite texteditor .
They are : . bash_profile : read and the commands in it executed by Bash every time you log in to the system
: read and the commands in it executed by Bash every time you log in to the system
. bashrc : read and executed by Bash every time you start a subshell
: read and executed by Bash every time you start a subshell
. bash_logout : read and executed by Bash every time a login shell exits Bash allows 2 synonyms for .
bash_profile : . bash_login and .profile .
These are derived from the C shell 's file named .login and from the Bourne shell and Korn shell files named . profile .
Only one of these files is read when you log in .
If . bash_profile is n't there , Bash will look for .bash_login .
If that is missing too , it will look for . profile .
. bash_profile is read and executed only when you start a login shell ( that is , when you log in to the system ) .
If you start a subshell ( a new shell ) by typing bash at the command prompt , it will read commands from . bashrc .
This allows you to separate commands needed at login from those needed when invoking a subshell .
However , most people want to have the same commands run regardless of whether it is a login shell or a subshell .
This can be done by using the source command from within .
bash_profile to execute . bashrc .
You would then simply place all the commands in . bashrc .
These files are useful for automatically executing commands like : set , alias , unalias , and setting the PS ( 1 - 4 ) variables , which can all be used to modify your bash environment .
You can use the source command to apply the changes that you have just made in a configuration file .
For example if you add an alias to /etc / profile to apply the changes to your current session execute :
$ source /etc / profile
Active aliases can be viewed by executing the alias command .
Some common files that may modify aliases are : ~/.bashrc , ~/.bash_profile , ~/.profile , /etc/ bashrc , /etc / profile , files in /etc / profile.d .
Modifying the Bash Shell with the set Command
Two options that can be set using the set command that will be of some interest to the common user are " - o vi " and " - o emacs " .
As with all of the environment modifying commands these can be typed at the command prompt or inserted into the appropriate file mentioned above .
Set Emacs Mode in Bash $ set -o emacs
This is usually the default editing mode when in the bash environment and means that you are able to use commands like those in Emacs ( defined in the Readline library ) to move the cursor , cut and paste text , or undo editing .
Commands to take advantage of bash 's Emacs Mode : ctrl-a
Move cursor to beginning of line ctrl-e
Move cursor to end of line meta-b
Move cursor back one word meta-f Move cursor forward one word ctrl-w
Cut the last word ctrl-u
Cut everything before the cursor ctrl-k Cut everything after the cursor ctrl-y Paste the last thing to be cut ctrl-_ Undo NOTE : ctrl- = hold control , meta- = hold meta ( where meta is usually the alt or escape key ) .
A combination of ctrl-u to cut the line combined with ctrl-y can be very helpful .
If you are in middle of typing a command and need to return to the prompt to retrieve more information you can use ctrl-u to save what you have typed in and after you retrieve the needed information ctrl-y will recover what was cut .
Set Vi Mode in Bash $ set -o vi Vi mode allows for the use of vi like commands when at the bash prompt .
When set to this mode initially you will be in insert mode ( be able to type at the prompt unlike when you enter vi ) .
Hitting the escape key takes you into command mode .
Commands to take advantage of bash 's Vi Mode : h Move cursor left l Move cursor right A Move cursor to end of line and put in insert mode 0 ( zero ) Move cursor to beginning of line ( does n't put in insert mode ) i
Put into insert mode at current position a
Put into insert mode after current position dd Delete line ( saved for pasting ) D Delete text after current cursor position ( saved for pasting ) p Paste text that was deleted j
Move up through history commands k
Move down through history commands u Undo
Useful Commands and Features
The commands in this section are non-mode specific , unlike the ones listed above .
Flip the Last Two Characters
If you type like me your fingers spit characters out in the wrong order on occasion .
ctrl-t swaps the order that the last two character appear in .
Searching Bash History
As you enter commands at the CLI they are saved in a file ~./.bash_history .
From the bash prompt you can browse the most recently used commands through the least recently used commands by pressing the up arrow .
Pressing the down arrow does the opposite .
If you have entered a command a long time ago and need to execute it again you can search for it .
Type the command ' ctrl - r ' and enter the text you want to search for .
Dealing with Spaces First , I will mention a few ways to deal with spaces in directory names , file names , and everywhere else .
Using the Backslash Escape Sequence
One option is to use bash 's escape character \.
Any space following the backslash is treated as being part of the same string .
These commands create a directory called " foo bar " and then remove it .
$ mkdir foo\ bar
$ rm -r foo\ bar
The backslash escape sequence can also be used to decode commands embedded in strings which can be very useful for scripting or modifying the command prompt as discussed later .
Using Single / Double Quotes with Spaces and Variables Single and double quotes can also be used for dealing with spaces .
$ touch ' dog poo '
$ rm " dog poo "
The difference between single and double quotes being that in double quotes the $ , \ , and ' characters still preserve their special meanings .
Single quotes will take the $ and \ literally and regard the ' as the end of the string .
Here 's an example : $ MY_VAR =' This is my text '
$ echo $ MY_VAR
This is my text
$ echo " $ MY_VAR "
This is my text
$ echo '$ MY_VAR '
$ MY_VAR
The string following the $ character is interpreted as being a variable except when enclosed in single quotes as shown above .
Lists Using { and }
The characters { and } allow for list creation .
In other words you can have a command be executed on each item in the list .
This is perhaps best explained with examples : $ touch {temp1, temp2,temp3,temp4}
This will create / modify the files temp1 , temp2 , temp3 , and temp4 and as in the example above when the files share common parts of the name you can do : $ mv temp { 1,2,3,4} ./ foo\ bar /
This will move all four of the files into a directory ' foo bar ' .
Executing Multiple Commands in Sequence
This is a hefty title for a simple task .
If you want to run three commands , one right after the other , you can type them on a single line : $ ./ configure ; make ; make install
OR
$ ./ configure && make && make install
With the first if the ./ configure fails the other two commands will continue to execute .
With the second the commands following the && will only execute if the command previous finishes without error .
Thus , the second would be most useful for this example because there is no reason to run ' make ' or ' make install ' if the configuration fails .
Piping Output from One Command to Another Piping allows the user to do several fantastic thing by combining utilities .
I will cover only very basic uses for piping .
I most commonly use the pipe command , | , to pipe text that is output from one command through the grep command to search for text .
Examples :
See if a program , centericq , is running : $ ps ax | grep centericq
25824 pts/2 S 0:18 centericq
Count the number of files in a directory ( nl counts things ) : $ ls | nl
1 #.emacs #
2 BitchX
3 Outcast double cd.lst
4 bm.shader
5 bmtexturesbase.pk3
If my memory serves using RPM to check if a package is installed : $ rpm - qa | grep package_name A more advance example : $ cat /etc / passwd | awk - F : '{print $ 1 " \t " $ 6} ' | sort > ./users
This sequence takes the information if the file passwd , pipes it to awk , which takes the first and sixth fields ( the user name and home directory respectively ) , pipes these fields separated by a tab ( " \t " ) to sort , which sorts the list alphabetically , and puts it into a file called users .
Aliasing Commands
Once again I like how this topic is covered on freeunix .
dyndns.org:8088 in " Customizing your Bash environment " I will quote the section entitled " Aliasses " :
If you have used UNIX for a while , you will know that there are many commands available and that some of them have very cryptic names and / or can be invoked with a truckload of options and arguments .
So , it would be nice to have a feature allowing you to rename these commands or type something simple instead of a list of options .
Bash provides such a feature : the alias .
Aliasses can be defined on the command line , in . bash_profile , or in . bashrc , using this form : alias name =command
This means that name is an alias for command .
Whenever name is typed as a command , Bash will substitute command in its place .
Note that there are no spaces on either side of the equal sign .
Quotes around command are necessary if the string being aliassed consists of more than one word .
A few examples : alias ls='ls - aF -- color=always ' alias ll='ls - l ' alias search=grep alias mcd= ' mount / mnt / cdrom ' alias ucd= ' umount / mnt / cdrom ' alias mc='mc - c ' alias ..='cd ..' alias ...='cd ../..'
The first example ensures that ls always uses color if available , that dotfiles are listed as well , that directories are marked with a / and executables with a *.
To make ls do the same on FreeBSD , the alias would become : alias ls= '/ bin/ls - aFG '
To see what aliasses are currently active , simply type alias at the command prompt and all active aliasses will be listed .
To " disable " an alias type unalias followed by the alias name .
Altering the Command Prompt Look and Information
Bash has the ability to change how the command prompt is displayed in information as well as colour .
This is done by setting the PS1 variable .
There is also a PS2 variable .
It controls what is displayed after a second line of prompt is added and is usually by default '> '.
The PS1 variable is usually set to show some useful information by the Linux distribution you are running but you may want to earn style points by doing your own modifications .
Here are the backslash - escape special characters that have meaning to bash :
\a an ASCII bell character ( 07 ) \d the date in " Weekday Month Date " format ( e.g. , " Tue May 26 " ) \e an ASCII escape character ( 033 ) \h the hostname up to the first `.'
\ H the hostname \j the number of jobs currently managed by the shell \l the basename of the shell 's terminal device name
newline \r carriage return \s the name of the shell , the basename of $ 0 ( the portion following the final slash ) \t the current time in 24 - hour HH : MM :SS format \ T the current time in 12 - hour HH : MM :SS format \@ the current time in 12 - hour am / pm format \u the username of the current user \v the version of bash ( e.g. , 2.00 ) \ V the release of bash , version + patchlevel ( e.g. , 2.00.0 ) \w the current working directory \ W the basename of the current working direcory \!
the history number of this command \# the command number of this command \$ if the effective UID is 0 , a # , otherwise a $
nn the character corresponding to the octal number nnn \\ a backslash \ [ begin a sequence of non-printing characters , which could be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt \] end a sequence of non-printing characters
Colours
In Bash :
Black 0;30 Dark Gray 1;30 Blue 0;34 Light Blue 1;34 Green 0;32 Light Green 1;32 Cyan 0;36 Light Cyan 1;36 Red 0;31 Light Red 1;31 Purple 0;35 Light Purple 1;35 Brown 0;33 Yellow 1;33 Light Gray 0;37 White 1;37
Here is an example borrowed from the Bash - Prompt - HOWTO :
PS1= " \[ \033 [ 1;34 m\ ] [ \$ ( date + % H %M ) ] [ \u@\h : \w ] $ \ [ \033 [ 0 m\ ] "
This turns the text blue , displays the time in brackets ( very useful for not losing track of time while working ) , and displays the user name , host , and current directory enclosed in brackets .
The " \[ \033 [ 0 m\ ] " following the $ returns the colour to the previous foreground colour .
How about command prompt modification thats a bit more " pretty " :
PS1= " \[ \033 [ 1;30 m \ ] [ \[ \033 [ 1;34 m\ ] \u\ [ \033[ 1;30 m\ ] @\ [ \033[0;35 m\ ] \h \ [ \033 [ 1;30 m\ ] ] \[ \033 [ 0;37 m\ ] \W \[ \033 [ 1;30 m\ ] \$ \[ \033 [0 m\ ] "
This one sets up a prompt like this : [ user@host ] directory $
Break down :
\ [ \033 [ 1;30 m \ ] -
Sets the color for the characters that follow it .
Here 1;30 will set them to Dark Gray .
\u \h \ W \$ - Look to the table above
\ [ \033[0 m \ ] -
Sets the colours back to how they were originally .
Each user on a system can have their own customized prompt by setting the PS1 variable in either the . bashrc or . profile files located in their home directories .
FUN STUFF !
A quick note about bashish .
It allows for adding themes to a terminal running under a GUI .
Check out the site for some screen - shots of what it can do .
Also , the program fortune is a must [ At least I have considered it so every since my Slackware days ( it is default ) ] .
It does n't have anything to do with bash and is a program that outputs a quote to the screen .
Several add - ons are available to make it say stuff about programming , the xfiles , futurama , starwars , and more .
Just add a line in your /etc / profile like this to brighten your day when you log into your computer : echo ; fortune ; echo
CDargs - Shell Bookmarks
Impress your friends and colleagues with lightening fast directory switching using the CDargs bookmarking tool .
CDargs is not exclusive to BASH , but is a great addition and works on *nix based systems , including OS X. Download CDargs here in source or rpm .
CDargs allow for setting named marks in directories and moving to them quickly using the cdb command or a ncurses view .
Install
Compile / install source
Move cdargs - bash.sh to /etc
Add this line to your users . bashrc file
source /etc/cdargs - bash.sh
Relogin or run source ~/. bashrc
Usage
mark Mark a directory that you want to get to quickly in the future .
Move to the desired directory and type mark < name > or simply mark to have it take the name of the current directory .
You can also mark a directory using the ncurses tool .
Run cdargs or cdb to start the ncurses tool .
Add a new mark by pressing a. cdb
Now you have a bunch of marked directories .
Simply type cdb < name of a mark > to move to the marked directory .
Alternatively use cdb and navigate with arrows or number to the desired mark .
manage Start the ncurses tool cdb .
Some useful keys to thump : a add new mark d delete mark e edit mark right left arrows move in and out of directories l list the files in the highlighted directory c make a copy of a mark enter go to selected directory / mark
You can also edit the ~/.cdargs text file directly to manage marks
Basic and Extended Bash Completion
Basic Bash Completion will work in any bash shell .
It allows for completion of :
File Names Directory Names Executable Names User Names ( when they are prefixed with a ~ ) Host Names ( when they are prefixed with a @ ) Variable Names ( when they are prefixed with a $ )
This is done simply by pressing the tab key after enough of the word you are trying to complete has been typed in .
If when hitting tab the word is not completed there are probably multiple possibilities for the completion .
Press tab again and it will list the possibilities .
Note that when completing a user name using ' ~ ' the resulting completion will be the user 's home directory .
E.g. " ls ~ myus " would complete to " ls ~myuser / " and executing it would show the contents of the myuser 's home directory .
Extended Programmable Bash Completion is a program that you can install to complete much more than the names of the things listed above .
With extended bash completion you can , for example , complete the name of a computer you are trying to connect to with ssh or scp .
It achieves this by looking through the known_hosts file and using the hosts listed there for the completion .
This is greatly customizable and the package and more information can be found here .
Configuration of Programmable Bash Completion is done in /etc / bash_completion .
Here is a list of completions that are in my bash_completion file by default .
completes on signal names
completes on network interfaces
expands tildes in pathnames
completes on process IDs
completes on process group IDs

Pretty slow !
So I took a look at the code .
The first thing that would catch the eye of any C# programmer is this :
unsafe struct Data { public int key ; public fixed char data [ 128 ] ; }
That ’s the data structure he ’s sorting .
An unsafe struct with a fixed array ?
I had to look up fixed to even know what that means .
Now , I understand that he ’s trying to make an apples / apples comparison and keep the data structure as close to the C++ one as possible , but I think that ’s missing the point .
If you ’re going to compare two languages , using their built - in typical sort functions , should n’t you use their typical data structures too ?
Here ’s what how a regular C# developer would define Data :
class Data { public int key ; public char [ ] data ; public Data ( ) { data = new char [ 128 ] ; } }
No unmanaged code , no structs ( which are rarely used in C# ) .
Just a regular class with an array .
Here ’s the results :

In his original post , he states that the indirect sorting is twice as fast in C++ than in C# .
I ca n’t do a direct comparison since I did n’t run the C++ code , but since my change to the C# made it run 2.885 times faster than his C# code , it stands to reason that the C# and C++ performance are neck and neck , if not a bit faster in C# .
Apples to Oranges to Avocados
If you ’re rooting for the C++ side , you ’re probably thinking , “ No fair !
The C# one did n’t have to move the whole array around in memory ! ”
Well , yeah , it did n’t : because that ’s how C# programmers use the language .
Since it ’s safe to rely on the garbage collector to handle deallocations , C# programmers do n’t spend effort avoiding using “ dangerous ” pointers ( i.e. reference types ) .
This is simply how the language is used .
To me , the fairest comparison is one that preserves both the procedures ( which he did by using the built - in sorts ) and the data structures ( which he did not do ) used by each language .
The Code
Aside from the Data change above , I cleaned up some of the copy and paste in his code .
Here ’s what I used :
The Japanese animation studio Sunrise has officially announced the plans for a live - action film adaptation of its Cowboy Bebop science - fiction anime franchise .
The American film studio Twentieth Century Fox , the production company 3 Arts Entertainment , and Sunrise itself are collaborating on the project .
Keanu Reeves ( The Matrix , A Scanner Darkly , Johnny Mnemonic ) is slated to star .
Joshua Long is acting as a production supervisor , and Erwin Stoff , a film producer who worked closely with Reeves on The Matrix and A Scanner Darkly , is also attached .
The associate producers are Sunrise President Kenji Uchida , the original Cowboy Bebop director Shinichiro Watanabe , and the original series script supervisor Keiko Nobumoto .
The Sunrise studio itself and Masahiko Minami ( former Sunrise producer and Bones studio co-founder ) are both acting as production consultants .
Stoff first revealed the existence of the proposed project last July to the IFMagazine.com entertainment website after the parties " just signed it the other day . "
Reeves confirmed the plans and his intentions to play the lead role with MTV Movies Blog last month .
He also indicated that the preliminary story outline partly draws inspiration from the " Red Eye " storyline from the first episode of the animated series .
Reeves and Watanabe had previously worked together on the " Kid's Story " segment of The Animatrix animated video anthology .
Watanabe 's original Cowboy Bebop series follows the motley crew of the spaceship Bebop as it travels throughout the solar system in search of the next job .
The anime distributor Bandai Entertainment and Cartoon Network 's Adult Swim programming block released the 1998 television series in the United States , and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the subsequent 2001 animated movie .
The anime was also adapted into two separate manga series , and Tokyopop released both manga series in North America .

Meet Lilith , Adam 's first wife , who left him because he refused to let her get on top .
She then became Satan 's favorite wife and the Queen of Hell .
Or so say centuries of Judeo - Christian lore .
Originally Lilith was a Sumerian goddess of death and the underworld .
She once lived in the garden of Inanna , the Sumerian fertility goddess .
But by Assyrian times she had become a demon of waste places and was called ardat lili , the " maid of desolation . "
Dreading her as a succuba , a demon doomed to roam at night until she found a mate , the Assyrians made her a wind spirit , wild - haired and winged .
And that 's how we see her here -- winged , taloned , and feather - legged like the two owls that flank her , on this terra - cotta ( baked clay ) plaque , probably placed over her altar or shrine during her rites ,
She holds in her hands measuring ropes to measure out the span of a man 's life or take his measure after death .
Her triple crown indicates a goddess , as does the divine mountain ( symbolized by a traditional scale pattern ) on whose ledge she stands , ready to swoop silently down in the night like a bird or beast of prey .
Like an owl , for example .
And in that form men may glimpse her flying through the dark woods at night to claim one of their number .
An early fragment of the Gilgamesh epic says she builds her house in the middle of a hollow tree , as owls do ; and in the Bible ( Isaiah 34:124 ) she is called Lilith , a name translated in the King James Bible as " screech owl . "
Or like a lion : like her mistress the Sumerian Inanna , the Babylonian Ishtar , or Ashtoreth , the Assyrian and Canaanite goddess of fertility , love and war , Lilith stands on the backs of lions .
What happened to this dread Mesopotamian deity when Jews and Christians got hold of her ?
It 's a fascinating story .
The rabbis had long wrestled with the different accounts of creation in the Book of Genesis .
Especially troubling was the seemingly simultaneous creation of man and woman in chapter 1 ( " man and woman created he them " ) vs. the much older story in chapter 2 of Eve 's creation from Adam 's rib .
Then came a godsend .
A Jewish book called The Alphabet of Ben Sura entered Europe from the East in the 6th century A.D.
In it , the delighted rabbis read that Lilith , not Eve , was Adam 's first wife , created at the same time and from the same dust .
Claiming to be thus created equal , she refused to sleep or serve " under him . "
When Adam tried to force her into the " inferior " position , she flew away from Eden into the air , where she copulated with demons , conceiving hundreds more each day .
God sent three angels after her , who threatened to kill her brood if she refused to return to Adam .
But she did refuse .
So God made Eve from Adam 's rib to be his " second wife . "

Teenager died in the arms of his sister after being stabbed as he left anti-violence party
Victim : Steven Lewis died after being stabbed by a gang of youths
A teenager was repeatedly stabbed in front of his 13 - year - old brother before dying in his sister 's arms .
Stephen Lewis , 15 , was attacked by a gang of youths as he left a charity event aimed at campaigning against youth violence .
Stephen was cradled by his 16 - year - old sister Tanya as he lay dying in the street while his younger brother looked on .
Police said two youths , aged 16 and 17 , have been arrested over the killing .
The killing on Saturday night in Plaistow , East London , was the first violent death of a teenager in the capital this year .
Last year 22 youngsters were stabbed to death across London .
It is feared Steven was the victim of a ' postcode war ' involving youths from a rival area .
Witnesses said the gang , who were armed and ' looking for trouble ' , had issued death threats to the teenager over the last four months .
Tributes to Steven , describing him as a ' tru fallen soldier ' , appeared on his MySpace website page last night .
A mother 's grief : Sharon Lewis visits the scene of the fatal stabbing
The party on Saturday had been arranged as a charity fundraiser for the One World Foundation Africa , which campaigns against youth violence .
It was halted after trouble broke out , prompting around 100 youths to spill onto the streets at about 10.30 pm .
It is understood Steven was set on by a gang just yards from the party venue , St Cedd 's hall next to St Philip 's And St James 's Church .
Steven 's mother Sharon ( left ) views flowers and tributes supported by friends or family
Natalie , Steven 's girlfriend , described him as a ' bubbly ' teenager
This area sits in London 's E13 postcode area .
Friends claimed Steven had been receiving threats from youths in Custom House , which is in E16 .
The youngster was taken to nearby Royal London Hospital , but died less than an hour later .
At the scene two women , Brigitte and Georgette , members of Steven 's family , said : ' His sister was holding him when he was dying .
His little brother saw everything and he 's just 13 .
It 's been a real shock to his family . '
Investigation : Forensic officers collect evidence near where Steven was stabbed
A close friend , who did not want to be named , said Steven had been stabbed in October and he had been getting death threats .
He said : ' The boys from Custom House feel like they are untouchable .
' They obviously came over to cause trouble .
They would have seen Steven , seen that he was by himself , and just attacked him .
He was in the wrong place at the wrong time . '
Steven 's mother Sharon Lewis sobbed as she lay flowers at the spot where he was attacked .
Steven Lewis is believed to have been set upon by up to 30 youths after the party
Her sister Michelle said : ' All Sharon wants to say is everyone loves him and they are going to miss him . '
The youngster 's girlfriend Natalie , who did not want to give her last name , said : ' He was bubbly .
He was a happy boy .
That 's why I liked him .'
Steven , who went to Lister School in Plaistow , is understood to have been a talented footballer and was a West Ham fan .

' Tragic ' : DCI Simon Moring
The Rev Eugeniah Adoyo , vicar at St Philip 's And St James 's Church , said : ' It is dreadful , the knife crime has got out of hand .
The hall was hired by a charity that deals with violence between young black people . '
Police were last night questioning two people over the murder .
DCI Simon Moring appealed for witnesses to come forward .
He said : ' This is a tragic stabbing on a young man in the prime of his life .
There were up to 100 youths in the street because there had been a large party taking place in the church hall . '
A number of Canadians attempting to flee from the violence in the Gaza Strip with the help of the Canadian and Israeli governments remain stranded in the territory after it was deemed too dangerous to cross the border into Israel .
At least 250 foreigners , including 39 Canadians , were expected to cross into Israel at the Erez Crossing — the main terminal out of Gaza located at the Gaza / Israeli border — on Monday .
But when a busload of about 35 people came to the border point , they had to turn back .
" Travelling in Gaza right now is immensely dangerous .
The group came up on something that is being described as an obstacle in the road , " the CBC's Peter Armstrong reported .
" Nobody will tell us precisely what that obstacle was .
But they say it was deemed unsafe to try to pass it and turned around . "
The Canadian government said Sunday that it asked Israeli authorities Friday to issue the necessary travel permits to allow Canadians to leave Gaza as quickly as possible , the CBC's Nahlah Ayed reported .
But Israeli officials said the request only came Saturday evening , the same night the ground offensive began .
Armstrong said artillery shells and machine - gun fire could be heard close by , indicating there may have been skirmishes close to the border .
' We want to get those people out '
" Essentially they decided it was safer to try to turn around and go back to their homes in the midst of all this than to try to make the crossing and try to make it to Erez Crossing itself , " he said .
Mark Regev , a spokesman for the Israeli government , told CBC News that its officials have been working closely with the Canadian government and other foreign governments to get foreign nationals and people with dual citizenship out of the Gaza Strip .
Regev said 100 people were able to leave on Sunday and another group was set to leave on Monday .
" Because of the fighting , I understand it became difficult .
I ’m still hopeful that it will happen today .
We want to get those people out .
" They should n't be caught up in the conflict if at all possible . "
Calgary 's Marwan Diab , who was visiting Gaza City with his wife and four children , told CBC News that it 's difficult to stay safe in the territory because of the violence .
" We are dealing with electricity cut off for the last four days .
We ’re dealing with lots of bombing .
Every once in a while , you hear extreme explosions .
You hear tanks shelling at buildings or at open space .
You are hearing lots of bombings everywhere . "
Diab said he is on the waiting list to be taken out of Gaza and into Israel .
" I applied to leave , I guess , later than I should have done , " he said .
A former Canadian ambassador to the UN , Paul Heinbecker , said that while quiet diplomacy may be taking place behind the scenes , Canada is at a disadvantage .
" As foreign minister , Mr. Cannon has n't had much opportunity to travel … and personal diplomacy matters , relationships matter , and he has n't had much time to develop them , " he said .
In another development , Israel cancelled plans to allow a small group of foreign journalists into the Gaza Strip .
Since the operation began , Israel has denied entry to foreign reporters , prompting the Foreign Press Association in Israel to go to the country 's Supreme Court to demand access .
Israel had agreed to allow in about six journalists .
First it was frozen foreheads .
Now it ’s Betty Boop eyelashes .
Allergan , the company that turned an obscure muscle paralyzer for eyelid spasms , Botox , into a blockbuster wrinkle smoother , hopes to perform cosmetic alchemy yet again .
At the end of the month , the company plans to introduce Latisse , the first federally approved prescription drug for growing longer , lusher lashes .
The product has the same formula as Allergan ’s eye drops for glaucoma , called Lumigan .
It is one of several drugs in a category known as prostaglandin analogs , which are meant to reduce dangerous pressure in the eyeball .
But as a side effect , the treatment tends to make the eyelashes of many patients longer and fuller .
Some medical experts say they worry that cosmetic customers may occasionally experience some of the glaucoma drug ’s other side effects , which can include red , itchy eyes and changes in eyelid pigmentation .
Some financial analysts , meanwhile , wonder how many people will want to spend $ 120 for a monthly dose of lash - lengthening Latisse .
But other analysts predict that in a world where people spend about $ 5 billion a year on mascara , Latisse could be the biggest thing to hit cosmetic medicine since , well , Botox .
Sales for the cosmetic use of Botox were $ 600 million in 2007 .
The call for flagged revisions came from Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales
The online user - generated encyclopaedia Wikipedia is considering a radical change to how it is run .
It is proposing a review of the rules , that would see revisions being approved before they were added to the site .
The proposal comes after edits of the pages of Senators Robert Byrd and Edward Kennedy gave the false impression both had died .
The editing change has proved controversial and sparked a row among the site 's editors .
Wikipedia 's founder , Jimmy Wales , is proposing a system of flagged revisions , which would mean any changes made by a new or unknown user would have to be approved by one of the site 's editors , before the changes were published .
This would mean a radical shift from the site 's philosophy that ostensibly allows anyone to make changes to almost any entry .
In a blog entry , Mr Wales said the " nonsense " of the false reports would have been " 100 % prevented by Flagged Revision " and said he wanted the changes to be implemented as soon as possible .
" To the Wikimedia Foundation : per the poll of the English Wikipedia community and upon my personal recommendation , please turn on the Flagged Revisions feature as approved in the poll , " he said in a statement .
Flame war However , this posting caused a storm of comments on his site , with many editors saying the proposal was unworkable .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Anything that makes Wikipedia more accurate can only be advantageous Amanda Dolan , Glasgow One user posted that " Enabling Flagged Revisions will undoubtedly create backlogs that we will be unable to manage " while another said that there were " gaping holes in what you propose to do " .
Mr Wales has now offered a compromise , asking those who were opposed to the changes to make " an alternative proposal within the next 7 days , to be voted upon for the next 14 days after that . "
A system of flagged revisions has been used by the German Wikipedia site for almost a year .
However critics say that the process is labour intensive and some changes can take days , if not weeks , to appear .

Australian arrested in Egypt for trying to smuggle 2,000 - year - old animal mummies
An Australian teacher who stuffed his luggage with 2,000 - year old animal mummies and religious figurines wrapped as gifts has been arrested , an Egyptian airport security official said .
The man was heading to Thailand when a security official became suspicious of the wrapped figurines that were placed amid souvenir ceramic pots in his suitcase .
When security officials opened the case , they found two mummies of a cat and an ibis , a long - beaked bird , both dating back to 300 B.C .
A mummy like this one was discovered in the teacher 's luggage
The confiscated collection also included 19 figurines of the revered ancient Egyptian gods of Horus and Thoth , wrapped as gifts .
Horus is a falcon - headed god , who represented the greatest cosmic powers for ancient Egyptians .
Thoth is believed to have given the Egyptians the gift of hieroglyphic writing .
The man was arrested and has been charged with smuggling antiquities , which can carry a penalty of as much as 15 years .
The Egyptian antiquity chief Zahi Hawass said later in a statement that the seized artifacts altogether weighed about 12lbs .
An antiquity official at the airport described the bust as rare because of the number of items involved and the age of the items .
Animal mummification was a common practice throughout Egyptian history .
Thousands of mummified animals and many animal deity figurines were found from Egypt 's Late Period , between 330 B.C. and 30 B.C .
Certain animals , such as ibises , falcons , and cats , were thought to be holy , the living representatives of Egyptian gods .
Another unlucky traveler in Cairo 's airport was stopped Wednesday with 56 cartridges , 20 pieces of live ammunition and an old bayonet that dates back to World War II .
The Canadian passenger , who was heading to Switzerland , was freed .
He told the authorities he picked up the ammunition in the Egyptian north coast town El Alamein , the site of one of the most decisive battles in World War II .
He said he was unaware transporting the ammunition would be illegal .
Its been almost four years since Google announced the nofollow agenda ( this link is nofollowed according to the principles of nofollow reciprocity )
Is the spam gone yet ?
Of course you know I ’m joking .
Spam is as bad as its ever been , its probably even worse because comment moderation has become incredibly lazy
Nofollow Only Benefits Google
It does n’t really benefit the human readers of a blog , and it definitely does n’t help people who contribute thoughtful , valuable content to another person ’s website .
Human readers likely do n’t know if a link is “ nofollowed , ” and it probably would n’t make them feel any better if you explained that all the spam in your comments is no good for SEO .
Nofollow is Lazy
There ’s no way around this one .
Look at the Google blog , they are basically saying “ This attribute will let you leave all those pharmacy ads on your website ! ”
Gee , thanks !
That seems like such a better solution than clearing spam trash off of a site .
Nofollow on Sources is SE Plagiarism
I ’m looking at you Wikipedia .
I Googled a topic and read a Wiki page the other day but it was pretty incomplete and brief .
I decided to check out the sources to learn more about the topic and I was shocked with what I found :
The Wikipedia entry only cited one single source !
The entire entry was based on the work of a pre-existing website and thanks to the thieving magic of nofollow , Wikipedia outranks the site that they are essentially stealing content from
If you ’re using nofollow on your outbound links or the crowd - sourced parts of your content , do n’t expect me to link at you unless its an attempt to make you look foolish .
Even then , I ’ll be sure to add nofollow to the link and even do my best to outrank you for those keywords we ’re talking about .
In short , the internet is n’t going to work like this , where everyone wants to take and everyone is too selfish to give .
I know where Youtube and Wikipedia and CNN are , I do n’t need a search engine to find these domains .
The internet is starting to look really shallow , with fewer and fewer destinations grabbing a larger share of the traffic .
Most of these destinations rely on crowd - sourced content and they ca n’t be bothered to share the links that make the economy work .
I ’m not anywhere close to done with this topic , but the rant provided here should help me vent enough to get through the rest of my day .

First , let me say this : I ’ve been a Dell customer for a long time .
And I hope someone from Dell reads this .
I ’ve bought systems and servers from them for the past 10 years .
As I moved from job to job , I brought them along with me , giving them new business with companies that were n’t using them for their computer needs .
The main reason for this is that as a large business customer , I ’ve always been really happy with them : Product deliveries are usually on time , and their large business support is excellent .
But as a small business owner , I ’m not so happy .
On January 7th , I ordered a Dell Mini 12 , which I planned to use in early February for a short trip I was planning .
I got an excellent price on the system .
The expected delivery date was fixed to January 19th – two weeks .
Not terribly quick , but I could live with that .
But almost three and a half weeks later , I still have n’t received my system .
And , if I had n’t called Dell multiple times to get a status update on the delivery , I would n’t have gotten any news about it at all .
Sure , you can always go to Dell ’s website to get your updates via your order number , but when your system is listed as “ in production ” for three weeks , you have to start asking some questions .
The system is still listed as “ in production ” today .
That means it probably wo n’t get shipped until a few days , and that I wo n’t be getting my laptop before the middle of next week , at the minimum .
Now , the Dell Mini line is a very popular line of computers , and perhaps demand is outstripping production .
I do n’t mind that – what I ’m having a problem with is being quoted a time of two weeks , and then getting the equipment several weeks later .
If I had been told in the beginning that it would take a month or more to get the laptop to me , I would have decided to order something else .
Now , I ’ve paid hundreds of dollars for the computer which can no longer be used for the specific purpose it was purchased for .
You can understand my frustration .
And this is not the first time something like this has happened with Dell .
I thought it was an anomaly when , around a year and a half ago , I ordered a $ 3000 box through them , and had to live through the exact same thing .
When I received it , the system was over a month late – and by the time I got it , the price for it dropped around $ 75 .
I called up Dell ’s representative , and he said he would reimburse me the difference .
I never received the reimbursement , but unfortunately only realized it six months later .
I then decided to drop the matter , as I did n’t feel like arguing with them again .
A few work colleagues and friends have had similar experiences – One of them had a 3 - week delay on his order , and when he got told he had to wait , and that there was n’t anything that could be done about the issue , he called his sales rep ’s boss , and eventually ended up speaking with one of Dell ’s Canadian VPs .
On the same day , his system was shipped by air , and he got it the following morning .
The moral of this story ?
If you are a small business or an individual and need a Dell product quickly ( two to three weeks , if that can be called “ quickly ” ) , do n’t even bother trying to order it from them .
Go to your local electronics store and get what they have in inventory .
I still think that Dell makes excellent products , but when it comes to delivery time and follow - ups for consumer ’s products , they ’re just not in the game .
Have you experienced anything similar with Dell or any of their competitors ?
Are they worse than everyone else , or is this kind of thing generalized through manufacturers that deal directly with home customers ?
Edit : Followup story : CDW Astroturfs [ GAS ] with Fake Comments
Update : My Dell Sales Rep. called me yesterday and told me there was some pieces on backorder for the Mini 12 .
He canceled my order and placed a new one for the same machine , but with an upgraded processor , hard drive , and warranty .
This time , the new expected delivery date is set to March 10th 2009 .

Mini Bio ( 1 )
James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20 , 1908 in Indiana , Pennsylvania , to Elizabeth Ruth ( Johnson ) and Alexander Maitland Stewart , who owned a hardware store .
He was of Scottish , Ulster - Scots , and some English , descent .
Stewart was educated at a local prep school , Mercersburg Academy , where he was a keen athlete ( football and track ) , musician ( singing and accordion playing ) , and sometime actor .
In 1929 , he won a place at Princeton University , where he studied architecture with some success and became further involved with the performing arts as a musician and actor with the University Players .
After graduation , engagements with the University Players took him around the northeastern United States , including a run on Broadway in 1932 .

The set was anything but tranquil on a Ford picture .
Ford believed that acting is a competitive thing .
That it 's good to be tense , good to be suspicious of other actors .
His direction would be mostly asides , whispers ...
In a Ford film you never exactly sure of what was going to happen next .
And this is the way he wanted it .
[ Asked in March 1957 interview " What do you think of your future " : ]
Eventually I 'd like to direct .
I 'd like to use the tools I 've developed in my years in the movie business .
If I have n't learned enough in all this time , I 'd better quit and go back to my father 's hardware store .
[ Asked in March 1957 interview " What do you do for kicks when you 're not working " : ]
I like to fly .
And I like music .
I 've got a cabinet full of pop stuff .
Also some Elvis Presley and that sort of thing that the kids drive me nuts with .
When I had a press conference in Chile a few weeks ago , I happened to remark that I did n't like rock ' n ' roll .
Well , you 'd think I had insulted the whole Chilean republic .
I had to backtrack on my statement .
[ to Frank Capra when he was offered the role of George Bailey ]
Frank , if you want to do a movie about me committing suicide , with an angel with no wings named Clarence , I 'm your man .
[ to Philip Van Doren Stern , the author of The Greatest Gift , the short story that inspired Ist das Leben nicht schön ?
( 1946 ) via letter on December 31st , 1946 ]
More important than anything , thank you for giving us that idea , which I think is the best one anyone has had for a long time .
It was an inspiration for everyone concerned with the picture to work in it , because everyone seemed to feel that the fundamental story was so sound and right , and that story was yours , and you should be justly proud of it .
[ Stewart testifying before Congress about Hollywood colourizing Ist das Leben nicht schön ? ( 1946 ) ]
I tried to look at the colourized version , but I had to switch it off - it made me feel sick .
Ist das Leben nicht schön ? ( 1946 ) ]
Such a pure movie .
It was n't taken from a novel or a play .
It was developed from one little paragraph .
Simple story , no message , no violence , no mob scenes .
When the movies have a story like this , they do it better than any medium there is .
I was six feet three and 138 pounds .
They must have thought I looked like I had just survived a famine .
Well , John Ford was a man who had certain values that he was dedicated to and he could get that up on the screen .
Not by telling actors what to do and having long rehearsal sessions with them , because he never did that .
He just had a vision of what the film should be like and he would let us sort of go along with him and do it .
If we did n't do it the way he liked , we would certainly hear about it .
He came so well prepared , knowing the script and everything about the picture , that I never even saw him even look at the script .
He 'd just say to his cameraman , " I want this , tell me when your ready . "
Then he'd shoo us actors in front of the camera and say , " all right , this is what you 're being paid for , go and get comfortable with what you 're going to do and whenever you 're ready , let me know and we 'll shoot it . "
( On John Wayne ) Duke Wayne was a great friend of mine and I also think he was an excellent actor .
He was a tremendous force in the whole production .
Everybody , including the actors , the producer and the director looked to Duke to sort of get the idea of what the scene meant , or how it should go .
Not , " how do I do this , " but the idea behind it , the tone of the scene .
I was also in his last picture , Der Scharfschütze ( 1976 ) and it was a great privilege and a wonderful honor to have worked with him .
