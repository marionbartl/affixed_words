One black lady once answered this .
I will quote her here .
" It 's a matter of interest .
I do n't know if you know many black people , but if you did you would probaly find that many black woment spend a lot of time making sure their hair looks nice which can cost up into the hundreds .
Swimming is for the most part a social activity at first .
Meaning people do n't usually swim alone especially when learnining .
So , if the black women are n't in the water , you probaly wo n't see a whole lot black men in the water .
This is not by any means the only reason ... only one of the reasons you do n't see black people in the water and the one I 'm most familiar with .
It 's a matter of health and beauty .
Generally speaking too much water especially clorinated is not good for black hair .
It tends to dry it out and cause breakage .
It also tends to dry out the skin which means we have lotion up more .
There are tons of other reasons too .
It 's a matter of time and money .
There a black single mothers who have to work who do n't have the time or the money teach or pay for the swim lessons .
Children can't go near water by themselves especially if they can't swim so ....
It 's a matter of cultural and exposure .
Many blacks who are willing to take extra care of hair and skin , who have the money and time , generally are n't exposed to how much fun swimming is until later in life because of the above reasons .
Finally , many black children grow up with more singing , dancing , football , cheerleading , church groups and other activities that are n't so good i.e. drugs etc instead of being exposed to tennis , swimming , golf ( until recently ) , and other expensive lessons .
It has little or nothing to do with genetics .
I hope this helps . "
As you can see it is mostly societal influences with very little if any medical influences .
Vast majority of people who own pools are Caucasian .
This does n't mean that Blacks are oppressed from owning pools but it is greatly a societal influence .
It is no secrete the the clicks in society plays a major upbringing .
Most blacks are neighbors with Blacks , most Hispanics are neighbors with Hispanics , most Asians are neighbors with Asians and most Caucasians are neighbors with Caucasians .
We each have unique cultures and lives that influence us .
We are different and I am thankful for that .
If everyone was the same life would be dull beyond imagination .
As for medical I can see skin and hair color being an issue .
People with darker complexions tend to suffer drier skin in many situations .
Sunlight , heat and most forms of radiation can burst , burn or dry out cellular structures faster on those with a dark complexion .
Testing with nuclear radiation has revealed that skin samples of darker complexion tends to burn at significantly lower doses than that of lighter skin .
Thanks for your posting ; I really appreciate your ideas .
Hope you can keep going .
This is a really great website , and I really like your essay .
Thanks for your sharing .

Mr. Ruholamini said he had tried for days to find his son , who was arrested in Tehran on July 9 .
Finally he was directed to the morgue , where he found his son ’s body , brutally beaten , his mouth “ smashed , ” according to an account by a retired senior Revolutionary Guards commander that was posted on various Iranian Web sites and blogs .
The report said that Iranian newspapers refused to publish the account .
In another surprising turnabout on Saturday , the head of Parliament ’s intelligence committee told the semiofficial Fars news agency that the intelligence minister had changed his mind about broadcasting videotapes of some detainees confessing to plotting a revolution .
The opposition and human rights groups say such confessions were wrung from people under duress .
The opposition leaders ’ open letter used language that was angry and blunt .
The letter called the government ’s crackdown “ reminiscent of the oppressive rule of the shah , ” who was toppled in Iran ’s 1979 revolution .
It denied and deplored the accusations of a “ velvet revolution , ” and criticized the state media and the use of “ show confessions . ”
It even accused the authorities of violating the precepts of the Islamic republic and its revered founder , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
“ The organizations behind this plot have brought us to a point where being a member of an election campaign has become an unforgivable crime , ” it said , “ even though on repeated occasions the late founder of the Islamic republic and the most distinguished officials of this system have approved and encouraged it . ”
The letter represents the latest in a series of stark challenges to Ayatollah Khamenei , who has dismissed claims of election fraud .
But it seemed unlikely that the letter would win the support of many of Iran ’s senior religious figures , analysts said .
And it is not clear what they could do to influence Ayatollah Khamenei .
Some prominent clerics have already made clear that they support the opposition ’s claims of fraud and injustice .
Only one of the nine men who hold the rank of marja-e - taqlid , or source of emulation , has congratulated Mr. Ahmadinejad on his victory .
Three others have condemned the violent crackdown that followed .
But few would dare to openly cross Ayatollah Khamenei .
Iran ’s clergy is less independent than it was before the revolution , and many analysts say it is growing less powerful .
Mr. Karroubi , the cleric and presidential candidate , also sent a separate letter to Iran ’s intelligence chief saying the crackdown on protesters has been worse than Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians , The Associated Press reported .
I 'm pleased to introduce Damian Sheehy as this week 's guest blogger .
Damian is a geometry developer at The MathWorks , his background is in the area of geometric modeling and mesh generation .

A Creature Called Epsilon
When I set out to write this I reviewed some of Loren 's past blogs to refresh my sense of what goes .
When I read her blog on A Glimpse into Floating - Point Accuracy , Another Lesson in Floating Point , and Collinearity , I knew I was in familiar territory .
The chances are , you too have had a brush with epsilon at some point in your programming past .
I had my first encounter with ulp ( unit in the last place ) and his accomplice eps when I was a graduate student in the early 90s .
My advisor and I were working on an algorithm that was based on a Delaunay triangulation .
The triangulation algorithm would often " fall over " due to numerical problems .
I wasted effort trying to " fine tune " the tolerances to get our collection of datasets to triangulate successfully .
As you know , this is like trying to push a wrinkle out of a fully - fitted carpet .
Sure enough , before long my advisor would present a new dataset from a research collaborator and I was back in business .
The frustrating part was the lack of information on how to deal with these failures , because they were rarely addressed in texts or technical publications .
When I was finishing up at graduate school and thereafter things began to change for the better .
Technical journals and conferences dealing with geometric computing began to solicit research papers on robustness .
The papers that appeared through the years were encouraging and I had a reassuring sense that help was on the way .
Why Geometric Computing is Susceptible to Robustness Issues
In Loren 's blog on Collinearity , we realized the collinearity test for three points could viewed as computing the area of a triangle formed by the points and then checking for zero area .
This reduced the geometric test to computing a determinant .
In fact , this geometric test can also be used to tell whether a query point lies to the left or the right of an oriented line defined by two points .
Here , give it a try . . .
p1 = [ 1 1 ] ; p2 = [ 5 5 ] ; p3 = [ 2 4 ] ; plotPointLine ( p1, p2,p3 ) ; axis equal ; pointLineOrientation ( p1, p2, p3 )
ans = LEFT
q1 = [ 1 1 ] ; q2 = [ 5 5 ] ; q3 = [ 4 2 ] ; pointLineOrientation ( q1, q2, q3 )
ans = RIGHT
dbtype pointLineOrientation
1 function orient = pointLineOrientation ( p1, p2,p3 ) 2 mat = [ p1(1 ) - p3( 1 ) p1( 2 ) - p3 ( 2 ) ; ... 3 p2(1 ) - p3( 1 ) p2( 2 ) - p3 ( 2 ) ] ; 4 detmat = det ( mat ) ; 5 if ( detmat == 0 ) 6 orient = ' ON ' ; 7 else if ( detmat < 0 ) 8 orient = ' RIGHT ' ; 9 else orient = ' LEFT ' ; 10 end 11 end 12
dbtype plotPointLine
1 function plotPointLine ( p1, p2, p3 ) 2 P = [ p1 ; p2;p3 ] ; 3 plot ( P( 1:2,1 ) , P( 1:2,2 ) ) ; 4 hold on ; 5 plot ( p3 ( 1 ) , p3 ( 2 ) , '*r ' ) 6 ptlabels = arrayfun ( @ ( n ) { sprintf ( ' %d ' , n)} , ( 1:3 ) ' ) ; 7 Hpl = text ( P( : ,1 ) , P( : ,2 ) , ptlabels , ' FontWeight ' , ' bold ' ) ;
If the point lies to the left of the line , the sign of the determinant will be positive – corresponding to a triangle of positive area .
Conversely if the point lies on the other side .
As we saw before , if the query point is on the line all three points are collinear and the determinant is zero .
Many problems in geometric computing reduce to evaluating the sign of a determinant .
The construction of a 2D Delaunay triangulation is based on two geometric tests .
The point - line orientation test which we just saw , and a point - in - circle test which is used to decide if a query point is within the circumcircle defined by the three vertices of a triangle .
It is surprising that you only need two simple geometric tests that you learned in high - school and some programming knowledge to write a 2D Delaunay triangulation algorithm .
However , if you were to try this for real you would find things can sometimes go wrong – very wrong .
Robust Delaunay Triangulations
The integrity of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm hinges on the correct evaluation of the determinants used in the geometric tests .
Problems arise when the determinant is ambiguously close to zero .
Inconsistencies creep in due to the presence of numerical roundoff , orientation tests can return an incorrect outcome , and the algorithm can subsequently fail .
The Qhull computational geometry library , which was developed in the early 1990s , identified these numerical precision problems during the computation .
Qhull communicated the problems to the user through a warning or error message , and provided some helpful interactive options to try to work around the issues .
For example , if we compute the Delaunay triangulation of the corner points of a unit square using the Qhull - based delaunayn method , a numerical precision warning is issued ; this is because all four points are co-circular .
Qhull provides an option to " workaround " these problems ; the ' QJ ' option adds noise to the points to avoid this degenerate scenario .
X = [ 0 0 ; 1 0 ; 1 1 ; 0 1 ] tri = delaunayn ( X , { ' QJ ' } )
X = 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 Warning : qhull precision warning :
The initial hull is narrow ( cosine of min. angle is 1.0000000000000000 ) .
A coplanar point may lead to a wide facet .
Options ' QbB ' ( scale to unit box ) or ' Qbb ' ( scale last coordinate ) may remove this warning .
Use ' Pp ' to skip this warning .
See ' Limitations ' in http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-impre.htm tri = 1 2 4 4 2 3
While this workaround is helpful , is not guaranteed to be robust and failure can still arise in practice .
Fortunately , technology has progressed since the early 1990s .
In Loren 's earlier blog on Collinearity , follow - up comments cited numerical inaccuracies associated with the computation of a determinant , and recommended the use of rand / SVD as being more numerically reliable .
But , reducing numerical roundoff does not guarantee the correct outcome of the geometric test either .
The implementation is still vulnerable to numerical failure .
In the past decade researchers have focused attention on robustness issues like these and on robustly computing Delaunay triangulations in particular .
Regarding Delaunay triangulations , the generally accepted solution is based on the notion of Exact Geometric Computing ( EGC ) .
One reply posted on Loren 's Collinearity blog highlighted this solution , but it did n't catch focus .
The idea is based on evaluating the determinant using exact arithmetic .
Since this is computationally expensive , a two - step process is applied ; the determinant is computed using floating point arithmetic in the usual way and a corresponding error bound is worked out along with this computation .
The error bound is used to filter out the ambiguous cases , and EGC is then applied to these cases to ensure a correct outcome .
In R2009a we adopted 2D and 3D Delaunay triangulations from the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library ( CGAL ) to provide more robust , faster , and memory - efficient solutions in MATLAB .
CGAL employs EGC and floating point filters to guarantee numerical robustness .
Let 's see how EGC performs for our collinear test .
We will use the new class DelaunayTri , which is based on CGAL , to experiment a little .
Collinear Test Revisited
Let 's take a look at Loren 's collinear test again , first choose 3 points we know are collinear .
If we attempt to construct a Delaunay triangulation using DelaunayTri , then a triangle should not be formed because the three points are collinear .
format long p1 = [ 1 1 ] ; p2 = [ 7500 7500 ] ; p3 = [ 750000 750000 ] ;
Here 's the test based on the determinant computation
collinear = ( det ( [p2-p1 ; p3-p1 ] ) == 0 )
collinear = 1
and the test based on rank computation .
collinear = ( rank ( [ p1 ; p2 ; p3 ] ) < 2 )
collinear = 1
P = [ p1;p2;p3 ] ;
Here 's the test based on EGC .
dt = DelaunayTri(P )
dt = DelaunayTri Properties : Constraints : [ ] X : [ 3x2 double ] Triangulation : [ ]
The Triangulation is empty [ ] since the points are collinear , this is what we expect .
Now move point p1 by a small amount to make the three points non-collinear .
p1 = [ 1 1+eps ( 5 ) ] ;
Here 's the test based on the determinant computation
collinear = ( det ( [p2-p1 ; p3-p1 ] ) == 0 ) % Gives incorrect result
collinear = 1
and the test based on rank computation .
collinear = ( rank ( [ p1 ; p2 ; p3 ] ) < 2 ) % Gives incorrect result
collinear = 1
Finally , here 's the EGC - based test .
P = [ p1;p2;p3 ] ; dt = DelaunayTri( P ) ; collinear = isempty ( dt ( : , : ) ) %
Gives the correct result
collinear = 0
In this instance a triangle was constructed which indicates the three points are not considered to be collinear .
We know this is the correct assessment .
What Conclusions Can We Draw From
This ?
Well , EGC plays a very important role in the robust implementation of algorithms like Delaunay triangulations , Voronoi diagrams , and convex hulls .
These algorithms have a long history of being notoriously susceptible to numerical precision issues .
This raises an interesting question ; should we adopt exact geometric tests for general algorithm development within MATLAB ?
For example ; should we be using exact collinear tests and exact point - line orientation tests and the like ?
In general we should not , because the environment we are working in has finite precision .
If we used EGC extensively we would realize that while it is numerically correct , it may fail to capture our programming intent .
In the flow of an algorithm , we take the output from one step of the computation and pass it as input to the next .
What happens if we pass inexact input to an exact geometric test ?
Suppose we begin our computation with three collinear points , and next we apply a matrix of rotation to reorient the points in a particular direction .
In doing so we introduce inaccuracies ; will the exact geometric test right those inaccuracies ?
No , it will not ; see for yourself .
p1 = [ 1 1 ] ; p2 = [ 7500 7500 ] ; p3 = [ 750000 750000 ] ; P = [ p1;p2;p3 ] ; T = [ cos ( pi/3 ) sin( pi/3 ) ; - sin( pi/3 ) cos( pi/3 ) ] ; P2 = P*T ; dt = DelaunayTri( P2 ) ; collinear = isempty ( dt ( : , : ) )
collinear = 0
A triangle was constructed from points { p1 , p2 , p3} , so in terms of EGC the three points are considered to be noncollinear .
While the outcome is technically correct it 's probably not what you expected or hoped for .
In the context of Delaunay triangulations and their applications , the consequences of imprecise input are relatively benign .
EGC is a powerful tool for addressing a long - standing robustness problem in this domain .
In our programming world of finite precision a judicious choice of tolerance is generally sufficient to capture the correct behavior .
Now , that just begs the question ; what 's a judicious choice of tolerance ?
What would be a suitable tolerance for use in the collinearity test , for example ?
Well , in this context , a good tolerance in one that captures the loss in the computation of the determinant in a dynamic or relative sense .
It should work when the coordinates of the points are small and it should work when they are large .
A predefined fixed value will not work over a wide range of coordinate values .
When I compute a tolerance - sensitive determinant to be used in a geometric test , I examine the products that are produced during the expansion .
I then choose the product with the largest magnitude and use it to scale eps .
For example , when computing the determinant of matrix [ a b ; c d ] , I choose the magnitude ,
mag = max ( abs ( a*d ) , abs ( b * c ) )
and then compute the relative tolerance ,
relativeTol = eps( mag ) ;
and I apply the tolerance as follows .
collinear = ( abs ( det ( [ p2-p1 ; p3-p1 ] ) < = relativeTol ) )
( For simplicity , the products a*d and b*c are not reused to compute det . )
The Bottom Line ?
So , what 's the point of telling you all about Exact Geometric Computing ?
Ohhh , I am hoping this overview gives you some insight into numerical issues in geometric computing .
But the important point for you , the user , is you no longer need to worry about numerical robustness issues when constructing 2D / 3D Delaunay triangulations , Voronoi diagrams or Convex hulls in MATLAB .
Since other applications like nearest neighbor queries and scattered data interpolation are built on these features , you can expect robstness , performance improvements , and memory efficiency there as well .

Coming up Next
Next week I will talk about an important application area of Delaunay triangulations in MATLAB , and that 's Scattered Data Interpolation .
We introduced new interpolation features in R2009a that improve usability , robustness , and performance , so stay tuned for more insight into that .
In the meantime , please let me know your views , thoughts , and opinions here .
Three major movie studios are about to try an interesting experiment .
They are launching a new TV network called Epix that will show their own recent films in HD , but they 're going a step beyond by bundling it with an online , on - demand service that offers HD streaming of the same films over the Internet .
Think of it like Hulu for movies that are n't yet out on DVD .
Oh — and did we mention that the service will have no advertising and wo n't appear on your cable bill ?
A new business model
The music industry was never much good at being a digital retailer — anyone remember MusicNet and Pressplay ? — but TV networks and movie studios now seem to think they have learned the lessons of the past .
Like Hulu , the Epix movie service is a joint venture formed by the content owners ; in this case , the service is powered by the movie studios Lionsgate , Paramount , and MGM .
The Epix TV network will air movies that are in the " pay - TV " window , those weeks before a film appears on DVD in which it is available on pay - per - view or HBO , among others .
That does n't sound so new , but Epix will be bundled directly into cable packages ; under the current business model , it will never appear as a separate charge on the bill and will never have to be added to a package .
If Epix can convince enough cable operators to sign on ( it is n't yet announcing partners ) , the service will have an immediate competitive advantage over pay - TV channels with an additional monthly fee .
But the best part is that Epix viewers can access the same material online , on demand , at Epixhd.com .
Ars spoke with Emil Rensing , chief digital office at Epix , who says that watching films online will be a two - click experience with full support for 720 p streaming .
The video is offered through Flash and is multi-bitrate enabled ; the player checks the available bandwidth every ten seconds to see if a larger or smaller stream is required .
Epix currently creates six different encodings of each film which range from full HD support all the way down to 500 Kbps ( cell phone quality ) .
In our own test preview of Iron Man , video was the best we have ever seen in a mainstream streaming service .
Pushing out that sort of data is bandwidth - intensive , and Epix would love to avoid streaming HD content across the public Internet wherever possible .
One way to make that happen , which the company is currently pursuing , is to install caching servers directly in the data centers of ISPs with whom Epix has a relationship .
( Rensing says that Epix does not require any sort of quality of service guarantees or bandwidth prioritization from ISPs . )
These " relationships " are one of the unique points about Epix .
The company currently has no plans to offer content directly to consumers ; it only wants to sign deals with TV distributors .
These distributors certainly include the cable companies , but now also include Verizon 's FiOS , AT&T's U-verse , and satellite services .
Epixhd.com will only be available to people who subscribe to one provider 's TV offering and also subscribe to that same provider 's Internet offering .
That is , if Comcast were to offer Epix , users would need to pay for both Comcast cable and Comcast Internet in order to access the streaming , on - demand service .
That 's good for Comcast , and it helps them cover the cost of the service .
Do you Hulu ?
Given that services like Hulu and Netflix On Demand work well and are increasingly popular , the real question is why the studios would launch their own distribution network instead of just offloading the films to partners already equipped to handle them ?
Rensing insists that the services are just too different .
While Hulu does offer some films , it 's focused almost exclusively on TV at the moment and is ad - supported .
Netflix On Demand does n't have access to the same super - recent hit titles .
Left unsaid is the fact that controlling distribution is also a chance to make more money , if it 's done right .
Epix is pursuing a strategy that has similarities with ESPN 's streaming service , ESPN 360 , which is also sold directly to ISPs and not available to end users directly .
Again , the charge for the service never shows up on a customer 's bill but instead looks like a nice added bonus that ISPs can use to differentiate their service from rivals .
The downside is that those who like the Epixhd.com site ( which looks fairly slick at the moment , even though development continues ) and would gladly pay some monthly fee for access — well , they 're out of luck .
An invite - only beta of Epixhd.com begins today , with a sign - up form for rolling admission over the next few months .
Until we abolish legal tender laws , all attempts on the part of entrepreneurs to set up gold and silver banking institutions will be labeled as " a tax evasion scheme to hide income . "
If you do n't believe me , ask Franklin Sanders .
He is a man who knows first - hand , that when you try to question the government 's role in our monetary affairs , you do n't have a chance .
How can one man win in a battle for economic freedom against the government , when the government has vast monetary resources through its control of the printing press and armed attack squads that can use brute force against anyone who challenges government decrees ?
Mr. Sanders fought gallantly given the impossible circumstances in which he found himself .
He ran a gold and silver bank for more than a decade , serving customers in Mississippi , Arkansas and Tennessee .
His hope was to run his business as a truly free bank , such that he would exchange Federal Reserve notes for gold and silver — and here is the kicker — he tried to do that without charging sales tax on the exchanges .
It is true , what Mr. Sanders was doing was entrepreneurial suicide , but you have to give him credit for showing courage and tenacity .
In 1980 , he opened his doors for the first time , selling physical gold and silver .
According to his fascinating autobiographical essay , available on his website : www.the-moneychanger.com, he did his best to cover his bases with the local authorities :
First thing I did was , write to the Arkansas Attorney General to explain that I thought exchanges of gold and silver money for paper money were n't subject to the sales tax , since they were exchanges of money for money .
Gold : The Once and Fut ... Nathan Lewis Best Price : $ 1.94 Buy New $ 21.11 ( as of 04:35 EST - Details )
Even though no one chose to respond to him , he continued to contact local political officials to confirm that his business was not violating state law .
He even wrote to the Commissioner of Revenue to inform him of what he was doing — to no avail .
He never got a response from anyone , at least not until Revenue officers and IRS criminal Investigation Division ( CID ) agents came to harass him .
During the time he was left alone , his bank did very well .
He attracted depositors from all over .
The government brought a swift end to his business , however .
First , they forced him to move to another state , and then , they scared all of his customers away by requiring that they send records of their exchanges with him to IRS CID agents , threatening to issue subpoenas to whoever refused to comply .
After his first dramatic escape from IRS hounds , Sanders opened his doors in another state :
I moved my business to Tennessee , doing the same thing , exchanging gold and silver money for Federal Reserve notes .
By this time I had realized that although every American had a constitutional and legal right to gold and silver money , the problem was , you could n't use them in everyday business .
We had the right to sound money , but no means .
We needed an interface between the paper system and gold and silver .
So in May , 1984 I opened a gold and silver bank .
I attracted depositors like wildfire , but somebody did n't like my idea .
After years of harassment , Sanders was eventually arrested .
As Murray Rothbard repeatedly reminds us , the government reviles anyone that challenges its monetary monopoly .
The harsh treatment of Sanders illustrates this point .
" My bond was set at $ 150,000 , fully secured .
For comparison , that same day they arrested a child molester and set his bond at $ 10,000 , not secured . "
A powerful quote that accounts for Sanders ' treatment came directly from the agents of the government : " The assistant US attorney here told one lawyer that I was u2018 the most dangerous man in the mid-South . '
In a four and a half year investigation the government spent $ 5  $ 10 million , maybe more . "
According to Sanders , the government was desperate to claim that he was the mastermind behind a cluster of illicit activities .
Foremost among them was " delaying and depriving the state of revenue to which it was lawfully entitled at the time it was lawfully entitled thereto . "
The government 's inch thick indictment claimed that a total of 26 people , with Franklin Sanders at the helm , were part of a " conspiracy to defraud the government , willful failure to file , and divers other malefactions .
The government claimed that the gold and silver bank was a tax evasion scheme to hide income . "
Sanders tried to use the law in his defense , but his points went unanswered .
" On the money issue , the real heart of the case , the court dodged and denied all my arguments . "
They obviously had no historical or theoretical background that would open their eyes to the truth of his arguments .
If Austrian - Libertarian leaning individuals heard his arguments they would cheer in approval .
Take this statement , for example , in which he brilliantly states what Austrian economists have been trying to convey to the public for decades :
They were charging me with not collecting sales tax on exchanges of gold and silver money for paper money .
You know — like when you go to the bank , and give the teller a twenty and she gives you back a ten and two fives , less sales tax .
What ?
She does n't charge you with sales tax ?
Of course not , because it's an exchange of money for money .
He attempted to battle in court for his right to exchange what he considered to be " money for money . "
Yet , he was trying to fight a legal battle in " Legal Never - Neverland : monetary law . "
In his fiercely direct style , he explains the dilemma that anyone faces when they try to argue with the government over monetary freedom .
neither the state of Tennessee nor any other state can admit that gold and silver coins are money .
If they do , they will admit they are operating outside the law .
The monetary emperor is naked , and state officials from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to the governor to the second assistant tire checker are afraid to tell him .
They should be afraid , because the monopoly on money creation is the jugular vein of the American fascist state .
He understands how dangerous and perverse the government 's control over our monetary system is .
He tried to battle the government with the best legal arguments he could muster , but since the government 's legal bureaucrats would never address the money issue , he lost his case , after fighting a legal battle that lasted for 15 years .
That takes fortitude !
To those who would question his sanity for pursuing an obviously unwinnable legal battle , he says :
Why keep on fighting ?
After 15 years , why not just put down the load and forget it ?
Because the fiat money system is both the strength and weakness of America 's tyrants .
It bleeds the people 's wealth and labor , but it also threatens to collapse under its own weight — or whenever the scales fall off the people 's eyes .
With its green engravings of famous Americans , electrons whirling around in bank computers , and loans created out of thin air , it is one vast confidence game .
Franklin Sanders ' story reminds us that the future of private enterprise in money has no chance until we abolish legal tender laws , and remove all forms of taxes on commodity money .
This type of change will require a political revolution .
Unless we witness a mass political movement demanding monetary freedom , I do not see any way forward for a market - driven substitute to the government 's monopoly over money .
We have to gather and inspire enough political will to abolish legal tender laws and all taxes on commodity money .

IDIOT LOGIC — RNC chairman Michael Steele is only a few weeks into the job and already proven himself to be no ally to gays .
He made a quick attempt at joining hands with queers by saying Republicans needed to do a better job reaching out to minority communities , and then scoffed at the idea of gay men and women being given the right to get married .
In typical fashion , Steele — who says he responds to criticism by “ pray[ing ] on it ” — continues to run his hateful mouth .
Although he tells GQ that being gay is “ your nature ” ( by this we ’re assuming he believes in biology ? ) , he refuses to budge on the issue of gay marriage .
And not because he ’s “ antigay ” ( his words ! ) , but because he ’s … um , pro-straight ?
Well , my position is , hey , look , I have been , um , supportive of a lot of my friends who are gay in some of the core things that they believe are important to them .
You know , the ability to be able to share in the information of your partner , to have the ability to — particularly in times of crisis — to manage their affairs and to help them through that as others — you know , as family members or others — would be able to do .
I just draw the line at the gay marriage .
And that ’s not antigay , no .
Heck no !
It ’s just that , you know , from my faith tradition and upbringing , I believe that marriage — that institution , the sanctity of it — is reserved for a man and a woman .
That ’s just my view .
And I ’m not gonna jump up and down and beat people upside the head about it , and tell gays that they ’re wrong for wanting to aspire to that , and all of that craziness .
That ’s why I believe that the states should have an opportunity to address that issue . [ … ]
Just as a general principle , I do n’t like mucking around with the Constitution .
I ’m sorry , I just do n’t .
I think , you know , in a pluralistic , dynamic society as the one that we have , every five years you can have a constitutional convention about something , you know ?
I do n’t think we should be , you know , dancing around and trying to amend it every time I ’ve got a social issue or a political issue or a business issue that I want to get addressed .
Having said that , I think that the states are the best laboratory , the best place for those decisions to be made , because they will then reflect the majority of the community in which the issue is raised .
And that ’s exactly what a republic is all about .
Alright , Mr. Steele , let the states deal with those pesky gays and their civil rights .
Because we do n’t need federal protection !
It ’s not like gay men and women deserve to be a protected class because they were born that way , like , I do n’t know , people of color ?
Return to Transcripts main page PAULA ZAHN NOW President Bush Addresses Arab World ; New Trial For Martha Stewart Denied Aired May 5 , 2004 - 20:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
PAULA ZAHN , CNN ANCHOR : Good evening .
Thanks so much for joining us tonight .
I'm Paula Zahn .
The Iraqi prison scandal and the Bush administration 's all - out effort at damage control dominate the news tonight .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN ( voice - over ) : New details come to light about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners .
Tonight , a U.S. general says he 's sorry .
MAJ .
GEN .
GEOFFREY MILLER , U.S. ARMY : I would like to personally apologize to the people of Iraq .
ZAHN : And President Bush addresses the Arab world trying to diffuse its anger .
GEORGE W. BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : People in Iraq must understand that I view those practices as abhorrent .
ZAHN : But will it work ?
And the fallout in Washington .
Will Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld lose his job ?
SEN .
JOHN KERRY ( D - MA ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : I called for Secretary Rumsfeld 's resignation months ago .
ZAHN : And those endless photos .
Is the media stoking the fire ?
( END VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : Also ahead tonight , will the U.S. soldiers in the abuse scandal be able to get fair trials ?
And speaking of trials , Martha Stewart found out whether she will get a new one .
I 'll be talking about that with legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin .
First , though , some of the other headlines you need to know right now .
A U.S. offensive in southern Iraq is targeting the militia loyal to a renegade Iraqi cleric ; 10 militants and one U.S. soldier died today in fighting around Karbala .
The State Department is shooting down a " GQ " magazine article that portrays Secretary of State Colin Powell as frustrated , tired and ready to leave the Bush administration .
A Powell spokesman says the secretary is very proud and satisfied with his service in the Bush administration .
Cooler weather thankfully is helping Southern California firefighters as they battle wildfires that have consumed some 20,000 acres .
No fatalities have been reported , but hundreds of people remain evacuated from their homes tonight .
Back to our main focus tonight , conflict within the Bush administration as it tries to cope with the Iraq prison scandal .
At the very least , Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has a lot of explaining to do both on Capitol Hill and in the Oval Office .
Let 's go to senior Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre in a moment .
But our extensive coverage begins with senior White House correspondent John King .
Lots of seniors here tonight .
Let 's start with you , John .
Good evening .
JOHN KING , CNN SR .
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT :
And good evening to you , Paula .
And just the fact that the president himself needed to take the lead in this damage control operation here at the White House is proof the administration realizes it has a significant perception problem , not only in Iraq , but across the Arab world .
Mr. Bush began his day with a meeting here at the White House in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
The main subject of discussion , we 're told , was the prisoner abuse scandal .
Mr. Bush said he told Secretary Rumsfeld to get to the bottom of this and hold those responsible accountable .
And the president then discussed his meeting in one of two interviews he gave to Arab - language television net works .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BUSH : We want to know the truth .
I talked to the secretary of defense about this morning , by the way .
I said , find the truth and then tell the Iraqi people and the world the truth .
We have nothing to hide .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Now , the administration already has a very sullied image across the Arab world .
Its relations with Israel , its failure to deal directly with the Palestinians directly , its invasion of Iraq already causing controversy in the Arab world .
In those interviews , the president himself acknowledging the administration has a very tough time now in trying to change Arab perceptions about America .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) BUSH : Terrible .
I think people in the Middle East who want to dislike America will use this as an excuse to remind people about their dislike .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Now , here at the White House , a damage control effort , but still the administration cannot or will not answer some key questions .
The investigation into these abuses began by the military back in January .
Here at the White House , they say the president was informed sometime after that , but they say they do not know exactly when .
They also say it is true that he did not read a classified report on this , did not even know about it until that report was mentioned in media accounts , and that the president did not know about those graphic , horrific pictures until they were featured in media accounts .
And tonight , Paula , administration officials publicly defending Secretary Rumsfeld , but we are told in that private meeting in the Oval Office this morning that Mr. Bush bluntly told the secretary that he was not happy , not satisfied and believed that he been kept out of the loop , if you will , not sufficiently informed about what was going on in the investigation and about the abuses to begin with -- Paula .
ZAHN : John King , thanks so much for the update .
And in a few minutes , we 're going to hear from one of the Arab journalists who interviewed President Bush earlier today .
Now , before that , we have more on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's troubles , this time with Congress as well .
Here is senior Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre .
The secretary must be smarting a little from what the president reportedly had to say to him earlier today , too , Jamie .
JAMIE MCINTYRE , CNN MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT : A little bit .
He 's not one to admit he was wrong about anything .
It would have been very interesting to hear that conversation .
Also , tension between the Pentagon and Congress today , daylong negotiations between the Senate Armed Services Committee and Secretary Rumsfeld 's office about when Rumsfeld might come up and testify .
Rumsfeld wanted to put off any appearance until next week .
The committee wanted to hear from him tomorrow .
The comprise is that he will testify on Friday .
The big question , a version of the old Howard Baker question :
What did Rumsfeld know , when did he know it and in this case why did n't he tell Congress sooner ?
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
SAXBY CHAMBLISS ( R ) , GEORGIA :
We should have been advised of this situation long ago .
And I 'm not sure when the secretary find out about it .
But he is going to be grilled pretty good about what happened , how it happened , and how far up the chain it looks like it went .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MCINTYRE : One of the questions he 'll be asked no doubt is why he took so long to read that damning Army investigation that has been out for more than a month detailing all of the abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad .
Some members of Congress has been calling for Rumsfeld to possibly resign , noting that he was a former Navy officer .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
JOSEPH BIDEN ( D ) , DELAWARE :
In my heart of hearts , I believe that the responsibility rests at much higher levels .
Look , you know , there is a tradition in the United States Navy .
If a captain of a ship goes up on the shoals , almost regardless of whether it is his fault or not , he loses command .
It is time for a little grace and dignity here .
It is time for someone to step forward and take a hit for the team .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MCINTYRE : Now , Rumsfeld likes to say that he serves at the pleasure of the president .
And while the White House has indicated , as John King reported , some displeasure with how Rumsfeld handled this , key aides to Rumsfeld say tonight that they do n't believe he 's really in any trouble of possibly losing his job -- Paula .
ZAHN : Jamie McIntyre , thank you .
Now , after a closed - door hearing today , the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said so far there is no evidence that intelligence personnel directed any of the Iraqi prison abuse .
Senator Pat Roberts stresses , the investigation continues into whether operatives were involved at all .
Meanwhile , some lawmakers are asking why they were n't told about this abuse earlier .
But the Defense Department says an investigation into the report of mistreatment was announced back in January .
Now , a press release sent out by Central Command on January 16 that you 're looking at right now on the screen mentions that investigation .
And today , I discussed the report with Republican Senator Olympia Snowe , a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : Senator Snowe , always good to see you .
Thank you so much for joining us tonight .
SEN .
OLYMPIA SNOWE ( R ) , MAINE : Thank you , Paula .
ZAHN : If these pictures had n't been made public , would we have ever seen the fallout we 're seeing today from this alleged prison abuse ?
SNOWE : Well , that 's a very good question since this report was not formally or officially transmitted to Congress .
So this is regrettable and it is hard to believe that Congress would not have been informed in any way about the nature and the extent of these atrocities and these abuses .
ZAHN : Senator Snowe , I have in my hand a copy of the news release that CENTCOM put out on January 16 , 2004 , basically saying that an investigation had been initiated into reported incidents of detainee abuse at a coalition forces detention facility and that specific information concerning the investigation would not be released because they did n't want it to hinder the investigation .
Who responsibility is it to get this kind of information to Congress ?
SNOWE : Well , obviously , it is their responsibility .
I mean , obviously , you would expect that the Pentagon would understand that they are accountable to Congress as well .
ZAHN : But going back to Congress being out of the loop , the president seemingly out of loop .
He said he learned about this on television .
Is it a case of CENTCOM being tone - deaf about what these allegations might inspire as far as public opinion goes or does it go further than that , or the suggestion that someone was trying to minimize the damage ahead of time ?
SNOWE : Well , I think that you have identified a problem .
And that is a failure to understand and recognize the severity of even one instance of this type of abuse .
And , frankly , that may have well led to the point that we had some systemic failures .
We 're talking about one prison .
There could be several prisons .
We do n't know the extent of this problem and the magnitude of this problem .
ZAHN : Your Democratic colleague Senator Biden is saying that if he does n't get the answers he thinks the American public is entitled to as far as the arc of this investigation that perhaps someone should call for Donald Rumsfeld to resign .
Do you agree ?
SNOWE : Well , you know , we 're going to look at the issue and I think we have to find out how pervasive , what happened , who knew what when , where the failure exists .
Accountability is obviously going to be part of our decision - making process , a part of the investigation .
And so until we get the facts , it is pretty hard to determine it .
ZAHN : But , Senator Snowe , could n't you make the argument that CENTCOM did cover its rear end by putting this press release out in January , many months ago before these pictures ever surfaced , calling attention to the fact that an investigation had been launched ?
SNOWE : Well , if that was their intent , then , you know , then obviously they failed at that , because ultimately we do n't even know the extent of the problem that might have occurred this year .
I mean , basically the report that has been issued was for a period of time last fall from October to December .
But we do n't even know the instances in which these atrocities or abuses could have occurred this year as well or prior to the reporting period of last year .
So , again , I think that frankly had they acknowledged the severity of even one instance , several instances and probed deeper and further , they would have discovered how severe this problem was .
ZAHN : Senator , you raise a critical issue here .
And it is something that Senator Kennedy weighed in on earlier today when he says he believes the abuse reports we have heard so far only represent -- quote -- " the tip of the iceberg . "
Do you believe that to be true ?
SNOWE : It could well be .
I hope these instances are an aberration .
But , again , it remains to be seen .
And we really do n't know , to be honest with you .
We 're just going to see one period in this report .
We do n't know this year or prior to that reporting period of October and December as to what else occurred and where it occurred .
ZAHN : Final question for you .
What are you learning about the extent of the involvement in intelligence officers in the abuse of prisoners ?
SNOWE : Well , you know , again , we understand that , you know , many of these abuses occurred under the leadership of the military intelligence community .
And it could be far - reaching .
We do n't know .
And so , again , we have to determine how pervasive and how wide - ranging it is and who was involved , who is responsible for setting the stage and creating the culture and the conditions to allow this to happen .
It is unimaginable , frankly , that this could have been going on for any extended period of time and the numerous instances that have already cited and no one was able to detect it .
I think that that is really surprising .
ZAHN : Senator Snowe , good of you to join us tonight .
Thank you so much .
SNOWE : Thank you , Paula .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : And now we return to the question of how the Arab world will react to the president 's interviews today .
A short while ago , I spoke with Mouafac Harb , the news director of Al - Hurra , the U.S. - sponsored Arabic network .
He was one of the two reporters who interviewed the president today .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : So did you expect President Bush to apologize today during your interview ?
MOUAFAC HARB , DIRECTOR OF NETWORK NEWS , AL - HURRA : I did not ask him directly to apologize .
But I tried to see where the buck stopped , who should be responsible .
And I asked him a question , because he kept saying , in a democracy , people investigate .
And I said to him , do n't you think also someone should be held responsible and step down and if you still have confidence in Secretary Rumsfeld ?
And he said , yes , he still had confidence in Secretary Rumsfeld .
ZAHN : Do you believe that the president 's words of condemnation were strong enough to ameliorate many of the bitter feelings in Iraq right now ?
HARB : I think it is so difficult to get the impact of the president 's speech today .
But all I can tell you , the worst - case scenario , it did not hurt .
And what was so evident and obvious that the administration and the president himself , he understands the magnitude of the problem that we have today in Iraq .
And he was very forthcoming .
ZAHN : Mouafac , one thing you would have to acknowledge is that there are critics in the Middle East who charge your network is simply an outlet for U.S. propaganda .
You certainly do n't expect that president to make any sort of traction with those folks , do you ?
HARB : I do understand why people would say that , that we are propaganda , because most media outlets in the Middle East are propaganda .
And they 're all funded by the governments .
However , there is a slight difference between what we do and what they do .
That is , the political system in the United States does not allow for the government or the Congress to use taxpayers ' money for propaganda .
I understand where they 're coming from .
But if our political system and the U.S. is similar to the political system of Arab regimes today , I would accept this analogy .
But , unfortunately , they are not the same .
But I do understand why people in the Middle East find it difficult to get the mission and what we 're trying to do .
But we do understand the challenge and I know why people are kind of testing our credibility .
It takes time before people can -- it is a track record .
It will take time before people can see and rely on us as a credible source of information .
ZAHN : So basically , what you 're telling me tonight , in spite of the fact that Al - Hurra is owned and operated by the U.S. government , you do n't ...
HARB : It is not operated .
I 'm sorry .
It is not operated .
We are a grantee .
We are funded by the government .
We 're not operated by the government .
There is a huge difference .
( CROSSTALK ) ZAHN :
All right , but you maintain that there are absolutely no constraints put on you about what you can broadcast , what you can say and how you can say it .
HARB : Absolutely .
The only constraint is mission of the broadcasting board of governors .
We have a journalistic mission .
I 'm a journalist .
And all the people we have recruited to work in our newsroom in Washington and worldwide , they accepted the job as journalists .
And they have not accepted the job to be part of a propaganda machine .
And this is not what we intend to do .
And this is the only constraint .
ZAHN : Mouafac , were there any ground rules for the interview today with the president ?
HARB : Not at all .
It only was like , I had only 10 minutes .
And it ran for 12 minutes .
I had more questions to ask .
And that 's the only thing .
ZAHN : Well , we always feel that way at the end of an interview .
What was the one question that you wanted to ask that you did n't have time to ask of the president ?
HARB : Actually , I wanted to ask more about the plan right now in Iraq ?
Do we have really a strategy ?
Is there a reversal of policy ?
What has changed over the past two months and if there is a new dynamic in Iraq that we did not anticipate .
I wanted to get into more details about this subject .
But I did n't have time .
ZAHN : All right .
Mouafac Harb , thank you for sharing your interview with us tonight .
Appreciate it .
HARB : Thank you .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : Will U.S. soldiers accused of allegedly abusing prisoners be able to get fair trials ?
Well , one of their attorneys says no way and he blames the president for that .
He 'll tell us why .
And did the media underplay the killing of four American contractors while going overboard on coverage of Iraqi prisoners ?
We 'll have that debate .
And it seems Martha Stewart is running out of options , the latest legal setback in her fight to stay out of prison .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : Are the alleged abusers of Iraqi prisoners being found guilty even before they 're tried ?
Well , last week , after the pictures first aired , President Bush said -- quote -- " There will be an investigation .
I think they will be taken care of . "
Meanwhile , Joint Chiefs Chairman General Richard Myers said in an interview -- quote --
" The perpetrators of those acts that we see in the pictures , were soldiers , actually .
The folks that perpetrated it will have to face justice by our system . "
So , do these comments like these prevent an alleged abuser from getting a fair court martial ?
We 'll debate that .
Joining us now from Houston tonight , attorney Guy Womack , who represents one of the accused soldiers .
He believes the comments could taint a potential jury .
Also joining us is retired Army Colonel John Jay Douglass , a law professor at the University of Houston .
He believes the alleged abusers could still get a fair court - martial .
Welcome to both of you .
GUY WOMACK , ATTORNEY FOR ACCUSED SOLDIER : Good evening .
ZAHN : Mr. Womack , I want to start off tonight by all of us looking at a picture of your client with his arms folded behind the pile of naked Iraqi soldiers .
Are you going to tell me tonight there is an innocent explanation for your client 's actions ?
WOMACK : Yes .
Yes , there is .
ZAHN : And what are they ?
WOMACK : He was complying with orders that he believed to be lawful .
ZAHN : Can you share with us who gave him those orders ?
WOMACK : Well , actually , General Karpinski has been sharing that all week .
That prison was being run by officers with the military intelligence command , other government agencies collecting intelligence , and even civilian contract intelligence officers .
It had an intelligence and interrogation mission .
And these guards were working directly for intelligence officers and at their direction .
ZAHN : Have you had a chance to talk to Charles Graner , the man you 're representing , about what would have happened if he had n't complied you say with the instructions he was given ?
WOMACK : Well , of course .
He had , as every American serviceman has , an obligation to follow any lawful order .
You can only refuse to obey those orders that you know must be unlawful .
We do n't want soldiers debating the niceties of an order during time of war .
If an order appears to be lawful or could be lawful , you have an obligation to obey it .
Under the climate that existed at Abu Ghraib , Specialist Graner thought that he was complying with a lawful order because he had seen similar things being done for the weeks and months that he was in that facility working directly for intelligence officers .
ZAHN : So you 're going to tell us tonight your client was n't aware of the Geneva Convention which prohibits the kind of behavior that would humiliate an Iraqi prison ?
WOMACK : He 's aware of the conventions generally .
And they require that servicemen follow lawful orders .
And from what he saw in the prison , the way the intelligence officers were crafting and using psychological methods to control and to interrogate prisoners , what he was asked to do , what he was told to do appeared to be lawful .
ZAHN : And do you really believe that the pictures we 're looking at tonight are almost as prejudicial as what the president has had to say and high - ranking military officials about the behavior of these soldiers ?
WOMACK : They 're different .
The photographs are evidence that certain acts were staged and were committed in that prison .
And at trial , I 'll put into context exactly what those pictures depict and why they come to exist .
Those are staged photographs .
The comments by the president , by Secretary Rumsfeld , General Miller today , by a spokesman for the Army , by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , more statements than the one that you have quoted earlier have implied that my client and the other soldiers guarding these prisoners are guilty and should receive severe punishment .
ZAHN : What about that , Mr. Douglass .
Do you to think his client has a shot at getting a fair trial here ?
JOHN JAY DOUGLASS , UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON LAW CENTER :
Well , of course they do .
When I first heard the president 's statement , whenever it was , a week or two ago , I was so amazed .
I said , well , he has got some good advice from some Army legal officer who told him what he could say .
So he did n't destroy the case in any way .
I think there is plenty of opportunity .
And I do n't know the facts of the case at all .
I must say that .
I 'm only concerned about this question of whether the court - martial has been tainted in some way by the statements being made .
I 'm convinced that this is not the case with the statements that have been made .
If you look at them carefully , there is no indication that the president or the secretary of the Army or the secretary of the defense or anyone else has said convict these people and send them to jail forever .
ZAHN : All right , but , Mr. Douglas , why do n't we reread what the president had to say when he -- the president basically says they 'll be taken care of .
Does that imply to you that -- and we can I guess parse this any way you want -- that the president thinks perhaps they 're guilty of what they 're being accused of ?
DOUGLASS : I do n't think he even knows who the prisoners are .
I do n't think he even knows who those people are that are being tried .
He 's unable -- he does n't have the evidence .
And there is no indication that " They 'll be taken care of " means that somebody is going to find them guilty .
I think this is -- this is really reaching for it , to my mind , to try to parse a statement like that , which is a phrase of the statement , I might add , right at the end of the statement that would somehow taint the entire proceedings .
I think this is really carrying it too far .
Now , if I were on the side of Colonel Womack , I would certainly raise this issue .
But I do n't think it is a valid issue .
ZAHN : Mr. Womack , are you guilty of overreaching here when it comes to what you think the intent was of what the president said ?
WOMACK : No .
And believe me , there have been many other comments paraphrased from the president and other officers beneath him .
And I certainly do n't think that President Bush is trying to taint anything .
But , as Colonel Douglass would agree , rule for court - martial 104 provides that no person subject to the code , the Uniform Code of Military Justice , shall make any statements or commit any act that would tend to coerce or influence a court or a member , which is a juror , of that court .
There are two ways I think this could be influential and could taint this trial .
The first time is right now , while the commanding general who appointed the Article 32 investigation is considering whether to levy charges .
Having heard the comments by the president and the chain of command , he may be hard - pressed to dismiss the charges even if he thinks he should .
ZAHN : And the second point , quickly ?
WOMACK : And the second part would be the members themselves know that the general officers in their direct chain of command have taken the position publicly that these soldiers must be guilty and deserve severe punishment .
ZAHN : Mr. Douglass , you get the last word and you can react to both of those now .
DOUGLASS : Well , I think he 's going to be hard - pressed not to bring charges .
I 'll agree to that .
But he 's going to be hard - pressed because of the evidence that apparently is available to him .
And that 's the problem he faces .
And he 's going to be given legal advice as to whether charges are warranted or not .
ZAHN : Guy Womack , John Jay Douglass , thank you for the fascinating look at a very controversial topic .
Appreciate your time .
WOMACK : Thank you .
ZAHN : And some new pictures from inside Iraq 's most notorious prison where the alleged mistreatment of Iraqis took place .
We 're going to show you what we were allowed to see .
Also , does the U.S. media have a built - in bias against the White House when covering events in Iraq ?
We 'll debate that question .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : We 've spent some time tonight looking at the Bush administration 's effort to regain the trust of the Iraqi people in light of the prisoner abuse scandal .
In Iraq itself , the military took the very unusual step of letting reporters and cameras inside the prison where the abuse took place and gave assurances that it will not happen again .
Ben Wedeman has been listening to the Iraqi response .
He joins us tonight from Baghdad .
Good evening , Ben .
BEN WEDEMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes , good evening , Paula .
Well , outside Abu Ghraib Prison , when -- while the journalists were inside , I was outside within -- among the Iraqi crowd .
This was a demonstration of several hundred people .
They had assembled , organized by the Society of Muslim Scholars to present a list of demands to the prison authorities .
They want free access to prisoners by Iraqi lawyers and international human rights organizations .
They want all those prisoners who are inside the prison who have n't been formally charged to be set free .
They want more Iraqi control of the prison .
Now , I spoke with one of the Muslim scholars who spoke with the prison authorities , and he said that the -- as much as they would like them to respond to their list of demands , he felt that they did n't -- they rather -- this group of scholars simply did n't have faith in the American authorities ' willingness to make good on their promises to make changes inside the prison -- Paula .
ZAHN : So do you believe that President Bush 's message today on various Arab television outlets will have any resonance at all there ?
WEDEMAN : Well , people are listening , and that 's obviously a positive aspect .
And we did conduct a rather unscientific poll of opinion on one street , asking people what they thought .
Some people said it just wo n't make any difference .
Others said it 's a positive thing that he is saying that those involved in this incident will be brought to account .
But by and large , we have to take into account the fact that this is just the latest incident in which Iraqis have expressed disappointment and frustration and anger at the coalition authority .
And really , the U.S. has a long way to go before it really restores its credibility with the average Iraqi -- Paula .
ZAHN : And Ben , going back to the top of your report , when you showed us some of those protests that broke out earlier today , tell us who all those protesters were .
WEDEMAN : Well , some of those people are former prisoners .
Some of them have relatives inside the prison .
Others are simply concerned Iraqis .
And in addition to that , on a normal day without a protest , you will find dozens , scores of people outside the prison who are simply looking for relatives who seem to have disappeared into the detention system , others who are waiting for some sort of visit with relatives inside .
So this is the sort of event that will not be difficult to draw a crowd when it happens -- Paula .
ZAHN : Ben Wedeman , we 're going to leave it there tonight , reporting from Baghdad .
Thanks so much .
Coming up : Did the media underplay the killing of four American contractors while going overboard on coverage of Iraqi prisoners ?
We 'll debate that coming up next .
Plus :
The president reaches out to the Arab world , but makes no apologies .
Can a presidential " I 'm sorry " make a difference in the court of public opinion ?
We 'll have a broad look at that tonight .
And tomorrow , deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage .
I will talk with him about the June 30 handover and the challenges for the U.S. in Iraq .
And I believe his first name is Richard there , Mr. Richard Armitage .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : Time for some of the headlines you need to know right now .
Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld goes to Capitol Hill Friday morning .
He will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and about why Congress was n't told about the problem earlier .
The Bush administration , meanwhile , has informed Congress it 's getting ready to ask for another $ 25 billion to cover the cost of military action in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The administration had been hoping to put off a request for more money until after the November election .
Filmmaker Michael Moore says the Walt Disney Company has blocked the distribution of his new film , " Fahrenheit 911 , " because it 's critical of George Bush .
Well , Disney issued a statement saying Moore has known since May , 2003 , that a subsidiary , Miramax , would not release his film .
And Pablo Picasso's painting , " Boy With a Pipe , " was auctioned today for a record - setting -- get this -- $ 104 million .
The previous record for the most expensive painting ever sold was $ 82.5 million for a Van Gogh .
Back to the issue of Iraq prisoners .
Is the media coverage in Iraq slanted now ?
Some media watchdogs think so .
They say us U.S. journalists are giving far more attention to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners than they did to the brutal killing of four Americans in Fallujah in March .
Others , though , disagree with it -- that .
And that is our debate tonight .
Joining us now from Washington is Peter Beinart .
He is the editor of " The New Republic . "
He does not believe the media coverage has been unfair .
And Brent Bozell , the founder and president of the Media Research Center , a watchdog group .
He believes there is a bias .
Good to see both of you .
PETER BEINART , EDITOR , " THE NEW REPUBLIC " : Hi .
How are you ?
L. BRENT BOZELL III , FOUNDER AND PRES . , MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER : Hi .
ZAHN : I 'm fine , thanks .
But Brent , I want to start with you this evening .
First of all , do you think the media is justified in covering the story of the alleged abuse in an Iraq prison ?
BOZELL : Sure .
It is a story , and it needs to be covered .
I think I 'll also say that you can't compare pictures of a murder with pictures of abuse .
There 's is difference in degrees there .
That said , however , I think there is -- pardon the pun -- an overkill that 's taking place here .
In the cosmic order of things , there 's a war going on , and it's as if everything else has stopped and what was going on in that jail is the only story .
And the bigger problem that I had is that everything is attached to George Bush politically , where somehow this is politically damaging to him .
And I think he 's done everything correct so far .
So I do n't know why the media ...
ZAHN : Well , who would you attach it to , Brent ?
BOZELL : Pardon ?
Well , I think you 've got to look at the military investigation .
But you know , if you 're going blame George Bush for everything that goes wrong , then the media should also be crediting him for everything that goes right .
But you never hear that side of the story , Paula .
ZAHN : Well , that about that , Peter ?
Do you think , as you look at the -- you analyze the coverage you 've seen or -- seen in newspapers , on TV and heard on the radio , is all directed at George Bush , or have you seen evidence , as we saw with our interview earlier tonight with Senator Snowe -- she 's highly critical of the military .
BEINART : They 're both coming in from criticism .
But the problem that Brent Bozell can't get around is that when you 're president and you take the country to war , if the war is perceived as going well , you 'll get the credit , as Bush did a year ago when he went out to that aircraft carrier , and if it 's going badly , as even many Republicans now admit it is -- I wish it were n't , but it is -- you get the negative flak .
You know , the idea that we 've been overcovering the prison story is ridiculous , when you think about the fact that it 's actually gotten far more coverage in the Arab world and in Europe than it has in the United States .
It 's a bigger story abroad .
And it should because the effects -- pretty much every foreign policy expert who 's spoken on this agrees .
The effects on American foreign policy could be -- could last for years from this .
It 's a big story .
ZAHN : You do n't deny the impact of that , do you , Brent ?
BOZELL : No. No . But I -- no .
First of all , I do n't think that we ought to set our standards by the standards of Al Jazeera and what ...
BEINART : I 'm talking about democratic ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) media .
BOZELL : But secondarily , I 've already said this is a story that needs to be covered .
But you talk about the perception of what 's going on in Iraq .
There -- you talk to anybody who 's come back from Iraq , and they will tell you everyone is clamoring about the fact that there 's so much good that 's taking place .
None of it 's covered because it -- you know , it does n't bleed , it 's not sensationalistic and the media are n't covering it .
If you 're going to attach the blame on George Bush , then also give him the praise for the good things that are going on .
ZAHN : All right , Peter , let 's -- let 's pose a narrow version of that question .
Do you think that the stories we 've seen lately in the last couple of weeks would reflect that the power grid system has been improved in Iraq , that Iraqi schools are open and kids are beginning to feel safe going to some of these schools for the first time ?
Have you seen that enough in newspapers and heard it enough on TV and radio ?
BEINART : What 's happened is that the media coverage has gotten very negative as a result of things that were very negative -- the uprising in Fallujah , the uprising in Najaf and now the prison story .
Those things ...
ZAHN : So these other stories , you think , get buried .
BEINART : But the problem is that those stories were getting a lot of attention , but reconstruction is now essentially at a halt because the insecurity has spiraled out of control in large parts -- not in the Kurdish north , but in large chunks of the Sunni center and in the Shia south .
That 's why this is n't getting -- you 're not getting as many stories on the power grid , nor should you , because the insecurity issue is right now the central issue .
If they get those two cities cleaned up , then you probably will see a return to some stories about reconstruction .
Right now , there 's not a lot of reconstruction going on .
ZAHN : Give us a historical perspective on this tonight , Brent .
Take us back to Somalia and the crisis there .
Do you think the media was fair to President Clinton ?
BOZELL : Well , I think -- I do n't think that the American media did a very good job in Somalia , period , and I do n't know that I 'm making a political statement here .
But I think this was just pretty much off the American radar screen , what happened to Somalia .
Those people who say that if you think Iraq was an atrocity , with what Saddam Hussein was doing , what about Somalia , I think have a very good point .
ZAHN : Oh , come on , Brent .
BOZELL : Far more people have been killed ...
ZAHN : You remember the coverage being highly negative of President Clinton .
BOZELL : I 'm sorry ?
ZAHN : Do n't you remember that coverage being highly critical of President Clinton , in a broad sense ?
BOZELL : Well , I think that if you look back on it , I think what you 'll find is that the coverage was very , very swift on Somalia .
It came and it went .
ZAHN : What about that , Peter ?
BEINART : That 's because we pulled out .
BOZELL : Yes .
Yes .
But it really was n't that big a story .
ZAHN : Peter , what about that ?
BEINART : Look , the truth is that when Americans are dying and it looks like we 're losing , when is fortunately the way it looks now -- I mean , you can say that things are going great in Iraq all you want , but the recent polls show a fairly dramatic swing in Iraqi public opinion , unfortunately , against the U.S.
The other countries that were in our coalition that have pulled out have n't pulled out for no reason at all .
These are facts on the ground , and all of us , liberals and conservatives , have to try to deal with them ...
BOZELL : Look ...
BEINART : ... to save this occupation and not blame the media .
BOZELL : That is absolutely not true !
It is absolutely not true ...
BEINART : What 's not true ?
BOZELL : ... that American -- that public opinion is against Americans in Iraq .
BEINART : Did you just see the recent poll ?
BOZELL : And it 's absolutely -- it 's a laughable proposition that we 're losing !
BEINART : No , it 's not a laughable proposition .
If you look at the ...
BOZELL : How are we losing ?
BEINART : If you looked at the recent poll , you would see that the number of people who want American to leave right now and the number of people who disapprove of the media ( ph ) , particularly when you factor out the Kurds , is much larger than it was when the last big series of polls were done this spring .
That 's indisputable .
I do n't know if you 've seen these recent polls , but ...
BOZELL : I have seen the polls !
BEINART : ... the numbers have increased dramatically .
ZAHN : But there were also , Peter -- there were also some contradictions in that poll ...
BEINART : Yes .
ZAHN : ... about the Iraqis feeling safer if American troops stayed in there and hung in there longer .
BOZELL : Exactly .
BEINART : Sure .
If you look at the progression , the progression was unfortunately not in the right the right direction .
And we did not have insurgencies in two major cities , with insurgents in control of those cities , a few months ago .
That 's a -- that 's a downward slope , unfortunately .
BOZELL : That does n't mean we 're losing a war !
It 's preposterous that you would say that , Peter !
BEINART : It 's not preposterous .
Unfortunately -- read George Will 's column .
He essentially says the same thing ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) not a noted liberal .
More --
I do n't want us to lose this war , but we have to acknowledge the realities if we 're going to turn this thing around .
ZAHN : Peter , you 're not suggesting tonight that you think the press wants the U.S. to lose this war ...
BEINART : Not at all !
( CROSSTALK )
ZAHN : ... I 'm asking Brent that .
Brent , is that -- is that what you 're arguing tonight , Brent ?
BOZELL : No , no .
No .
No , I think what the press is doing is sensationalizing a sensationalistic story .
And I think that it 's getting blown out of proportion .
There 's more to what 's going on in Iraq than this one story .
ZAHN : All right , gentlemen , we 're going to leave it there .
Brent Bozell , Peter Beinart ...
BEINART : Thank you , Paula .
ZAHN : ... thank you , both .
BOZELL : Thanks .
ZAHN : Will Martha Stewart get a new trial ?
We change our focus quite a bit .
We will tell you what the judge decided in her case coming up .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : Time to talk law now .
A setback for Martha Stewart in her bid for a new trial .
The judge in the case today rejected her request on the grounds that one juror 's failure to reveal a prior arrest did not mean the original trial was unfair .
Senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin is here now with some insights into this latest development in the case .
Good to see you .
JEFFREY TOOBIN , CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST : Hi .
ZAHN : So the judge do the right thing here , Mr. Prosecutor ?
TOOBIN : I think -- I think this was a pretty easy call for the judge .
There is a strong bias in the system against investigating jurors because if you could investigate jurors after every conviction , the defense would then go pore over the voir dire , the questioning of the jurors , and say , Well , they did n't tell the truth , let 's have a new trial .
So it 's got to be ...
ZAHN : There 'd be a lot of even richer attorneys ...
TOOBIN : That 's ...
ZAHN : ... is what you 're saying !
( LAUGHTER )
TOOBIN : That 's always the case ..
ZAHN : So go into further detail about the grounds on which Martha Stewart was trying to get a new trial .
TOOBIN : Right .
Chappell Hartridge , who became a -- briefly a celebrity , he was the juror who was sort of the spokesman after -- the self - appointed spokesman after the verdict , who came out ...
ZAHN : Yes , the first one on the steps .
TOOBIN : He was the first one on the steps , gave a long press conference , talked about how this was a message to the -- you know , in favor of the little guy against the big guys .
And in -- during jury selection , he was asked about -- as all jurors were , about his legal history , and it turns out Mr. Hartridge had quite a colorful legal history .
He had been involved in some lawsuits .
His son had been arrested .
And the defense argued that he lied to get on the jury because he wanted to get Martha Stewart .
And what the judge did I thought was a very intelligent decision .
She said , Well , maybe some of the statements were arguably false , but what you have to show , defense , is you have to show that he wanted to get Martha Stewart -- not that he lied , but he lied to get her .
And there was really no evidence of that .
ZAHN : So let 's take a look now at a statement put out by Ms. Stewart 's attorneys .
Quote , " We regret that a case about false statements was decided by a juror who appears to have made many false statements in an effort gain access to the Stewart jury . "
Why do n't you think his statements had that big of an impact on the judge ?
I mean , she -- I think , basically , you said there was an acknowledgement that some of the things might have been false .
TOOBIN : Right .
ZAHN : But you had to prove that he wanted to get Martha Stewart ?
TOOBIN : Right .
False is not enough .
It has to be false in such a way that indicates a real bias against Martha Stewart .
And they were n't really biases in that way .
In fact , what was interesting , what Judge Cedarbaum pointed out , is that , you know , in fact , these statements might have made you think he'd be more sympathetic to the defense because he had all this connection to the criminal justice system between his son and accusations against him .
That -- he looked like a defense juror , if he had told the truth .
So I just think this was -- this was kind of a -- an understandable attempt by the defense , but a losing one .
ZAHN : And another movement under way by the defense to appeal the verdict .
TOOBIN : Right .
But I think by writing such a thorough and thoughtful opinion , Judge Cedarbaum makes an appeal even less likely .
ZAHN : Why ?
TOOBIN : Well , because the judge -- the courts of appeals judges , they always want to know that the issues were fully aired in the district court and that the district court judge took them seriously , considered them .
And once they know the district judge has done that , they are even less likely to overturn .
And remember , over 90 percent of cases are affirmed on appeals .
So the odds are heavily stacked against an appeal , to start with .
ZAHN : Let 's fast - forward to June 17 .
That is the day that Martha Stewart is sentenced .
Do you believe she 's going to end up getting some jail time ?
TOOBIN : I do .
The way I figure the federal sentencing guidelines which control all sentencings in federal court ...
ZAHN : A little bit of latitude in them .
TOOBIN : A little bit of latitude , but it seems pretty clear that we 're talking about 10 to 16 months as the range .
And that , I think , indicates she 's probably going get probably on the low end of that , but certainly jail time .
ZAHN : Pretty good chunk of time to inspire a book , too , is n't it .
( LAUGHTER ) TOOBIN :
It could be .
I think it 's really -- it 's really lousy being in jail .
You know , people talk about " country club prisons . "
There 's , in fact , no such thing , really , as a country club prison and ...
ZAHN : And she would be likely to be put in a prison in Connecticut , not far from her home .
TOOBIN : Although , you know , the Danbury prison , which is not far from her home , is a pretty heavy security prison .
Because there are so few female prisoners compared to the number of male prisoners , there are not a lot of minimum security women 's prisons .
And Danbury is not one of them .
So she might want to travel a little farther because Danbury 's a tough place .
ZAHN : Jeffrey Toobin , thanks for dropping by tonight .
Appreciate it .
Coming up : What could a presidential apology about the Iraqi prison scandal do for the White House ?
We 're going to look at how some past presidential apologies have been received .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : They are two simple words that could go a long way , but many people , especially those in power , have trouble saying " I 'm sorry . "
As the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal is investigated , there have been some apologies and calls for many more .
Of course , this is n't the first time powerful figures felt the need to say sorry .
Bruce Morton takes a look at some famous apologies .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
GEORGE WALKER BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :
It 's a matter that reflects badly on my country .
BRUCE MORTON , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) : President Bush did n't formally apologize for the mistreatment of prisoners , but one of his generals did .
MAJ .
GEN .
GEOFFREY MILLER , U.S. ARMY : I would like to personally apologize to the people of Iraq for the actions of the small number of leaders and soldiers who violated our policy and may have committed criminal acts .
MORTON : Do presidents , administrations , apologize ?
Well , sometimes .
We all remember Richard Clarke , a counterterrorism official in four administrations , before the 9/11 commission .
RICHARD CLARKE , FORMER WHITE HOUSE ANTI - TERRORISM ADVISER :
Those entrusted with protecting you failed you , and I failed you .
MORTON : When a crippled U.S. plane landed without permission at a Chinese air base in 2001 , the U.S. ambassador apologized .
" We are very sorry the entering of China 's air space and the landing did not have verbal clearance but very pleased the crew landed safely . "
Be nice , so the Chinese will release the crew , and they did .
On the other hand , when the U.S. shot down an Iranian airliner in 1989 , the first President Bush said , " I will never apologize for the United States of America .
I do n't care what the facts are . "
Bill Clinton apologized a lot -- for slavery once , though he had nothing to do with it , for Monica Lewinsky often .
WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : I have acknowledged that I made a mistake , said that I regretted it .
I 've already said that I made a bad mistake .
It was indefensible , and I 'm sorry about it , so ...
MORTON : Ronald Reagan denied and denied the U.S. had sold arms to Iran to gain the release of American hostages but finally admitted he was wrong .
" My heart and my best intentions still tell that is true , but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not . "
And a young John Kennedy , after the failed U.S. - backed invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs , did n't use the " A " word but did shoulder the blame .
" I 'm the responsible officer of the government . "
Voters like that straight talk .
His poll numbers went up .
Bruce Morton , CNN , Washington .

Fidel Castro may have outlasted nine American presidents , but he and his family continue to be the butt of practical jokesters this side of the Florida Straits .
A few years ago , a couple of Miami DJs were able to get him on the phone and convince him he was talking to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
And more recently , a Miami man convinced one of Fidel ’s sons that he was a sexy Colombian woman with a penchant for communist scions .
Luis Dominguez spent eight months carrying an online relationship with Antonio Castro Soto del Valle , spending up to five hours a night chatting with the younger Castro .
Pretending to be “ Claudia Valencia ” , Dominguez convinced Castro that he was a 27 - year - old brunette with blond streaks who loved soccer and technology and was just unable to find a man in her own country .
Dominguez has documented the steamy Cold War affair on his website .
It 's in Spanish but includes at least one shirtless photo of the younger Castro .
The 42 - year - old son of a dictator was apparently smitten with his cyber sex kitten , according to The Miami Herald .
“ I will make love to you without stopping , ” Castro wrote to an elated Dominguez .
“ I have a desire to kiss you , ” he wrote in another message .
And in yet another message , he told Dominguez that he wanted to “ kiss you , love you and make love to you . ”
Dominguez was ecstatic at the passionate exchanges because it proved he was able to penetrate the " impenetrable . "
And it will be sure to raise him to celebrity status in Miami .
They might even name a street after him .
I ’ve been prompted to write this because of the misconceptions about the concept of the “ Selfish Gene ” in Evolutionary theory – evident in both blog replies on this site and more widely .
I get really irritated when I see writers in the social sciences characterise evolutionary biology as somehow being based on the same assumptions as rational choice theory .
Here is the first paragraph from a book chapter I saw today which motivated me to start this blog and write this entry ...
Evolutionary Theory and Cooperation in Everyday Life David Sloan Wilson and Daniel Tumminelli O’Brien
" Theories of cooperation in both biology and the human social sciences have had a
turbulent history .
During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , it was
common to regard societies as like organisms in their own right .
This holistic
worldview was largely replaced during the middle of the twentieth century by a
more reductionistic view that sought to explain as much as possible in terms of
individual self - interest .
In evolutionary biology , this trend was represented
by the rejection of group selection in favor of “ the theory of individual
selection ” and ultimately “ selfish genes . ”
In the human social sciences , the
trend was represented by “ methodological individualism ” ( Sober and Wilson 1998 ;
Wegner 1986 ) and especially rational choice theory in economics , which assumes
that all human preferences can be understood in terms of individual utility
maximization , with the utility usually conceptualized as material gain ( e.g. ,
income ) . "
If you read this and thought it sounded OK , please read on as its really really not .
Hopefully by the end of this article you 'll see why biologists get so frustrated when people equate their theories to economic rational choice .
Of course I agree that saying humans behave as rational self - interested utility maximisers is totally silly in many situations particularly when it comes to looking at humans in a social context .
It ’s a shame that rational choice was so unquestionably accepted , and its given rise to some awful government policies .
People in the rest of the social sciences ( sociology , anthropology etc. ) , from the start could see how flawed rational choice was , and clearly as the main areas of their interest fell into the realm where rational choice failed , they disliked the theory intensely .
So as the world started to talk in terms of rational choice and individualism I can imagine how irritated whole departments of anthropologists were getting ... It took a lot of empirical evidence before economists took the criticisms seriously , but fortunately since the mid-90s , the limitations of rational choice are being considered seriously by its supporters .
The field of behavioural economics is rapidly expanding and there are exciting and inspiring cross-disciplinary collaborations happening between economists and social science disciplines ( economist - psychologist , economist - anthropologist etc ) .
So I agree with what this paragraph says about economics .
What about evolutionary theory ?
To someone outside the field , it sounds like a similar story is going on ... in the 1970s , the collectivist " group - selection " ideas were finally extinguished , and everything was studied in terms of individual maximisation , indeed biologists went one step further and by the end of the 1970s were talking of " Selfish Genes " ... and like rational choice , the theory had its opponents - especially with the claims about human behaviour made in a inaccuracy - ridden coffee table book ( see the Sociobiology EO Wilson controversy ) .
The critics labelled this new way of evolutionary thinking as “ NeoDarwinism ” ( by the way , biologists never talk of Sociobiology or NeoDarwinism , its evolutionary biology and social evolution ) .
Starting in the 1980s and continuing today , the “ Selfish Gene ” ideas have been challenged and a new way of looking at evolutionary biology from a group - or multi-level - perspective has challenged the " NeoDarwinian " ideas .
In recent years , this has lead to a flurry of Science and Nature papers by leading economists suggesting how human sociality can be understood as a group adaptation .
OK , I 'll stop there with my account of what " NeoDarwinian " evolutionary biologists think ....
For anyone interested in this topic most of this historical story will be old news anyway .
For any biologists reading this , I do n’t want to piss them off any more !
I'm not going to have time this evening to go through all the misconceptions in detail in this article - but I 'll start with the biggy ... that evolutionary biology rejected group - think and went for an individualist approach .
Before I go on , if you are interested , I humbly suggest you read this paper I 've written with my colleagues at Oxford which we 've submitted to the Journal of Economic Literature .
It lists in detail many of the misconceptions I 'll not doubt find myself writing about in this blog .
If you would like further reading go there and then see the references therein .
Evolutionary theory DOES see individuals as fitness maximsers BUT evolutionary theory DOES NOT see the individuals fitness ( number of offspring ) as the maximand .
Defining the “ Selfish Gene ”
Multiple copies of the same Gene occur in different individuals in a population ( if you are members of the same species , the vast majority of your genes will be identical , after all we share 97 % + of our genes
with a chimp ) .
Selfish Genes are only “ selfish ” when seen as a whole ( as it is the fitness of the Gene , not the fitness of its individual copies that is maximised ) .
As one Gene may be common to several species , for many Genes the individual gene copies over which it maximises are spread across a diversity of individuals .
It has been shown formally ( with maths ) that Genes ( i.e. all copies of a particular Gene ) can be accurately described as maximsers .
The " selfishness " here means maximsing its own transmission , not any other more emotive / morally loaded meaning of the word selfishness .
As an aside , I work in the same as Richard Dawkins and colleagues tell me he now wishes he called his book “ The Self Interested Gene ” but at the time decided the ( less accurate ) catchier title was preferable …
I think he regrets it now .
Consider now an individual person .
That person will have millions of COPIES of different genes .
The Selfish Gene idea never meant to suggest that an individual copy would be expected to behave selfishly .
Indeed most gene copies favour cooperation with individuals that also have a copy of the same gene ... because doing so maximises the Gene fitness .
It ’s a shame there is not two words , one for a Gene and one for one of its many gene copy .
I ’m using Gene and gene .
So I stress : Cooperation is expected because we share copies of the same " selfish " Genes .
Indeed at the individual level its more accurate to think of SOCIAL GENES , not selfish genes .
As individuals contain many genes , complex patterns of social behaviour are expected to occur between them .
Individuals ( humans ) from an evolutionary perspective are NOT predicted to be rational maximsers akin to economic agents ... their genes are ( but as genes have copies spread across many individuals the way rational choice - style theory is applied it very different from the way we 'd apply it assuming individual people are the economic agents ) .
Defining Fitness
How can we the define fitness in a useful way that helps us understand behaviours that individuals ( or groups ) perform that we are interested in ( like human cooperation ) ?
Gene fitness is great , but its not very useful if we want to go out and try to collect data to test evolutionary theories .
The answer is we can measure an individual ’s fitness as it inclusive fitness .
Recently , it has been shown formally ( with maths ) that it is accurate to say that an individual is adapted to maximse its " inclusive fitness " .
We can say it is a natural law ( as real as Newtons laws of physics ) that natural selection acts to maximise inclusive fitness ( or from a Gene level , its equivalent to say natural selection maximises Gene fitness ) .
By the way , the same group of mathematicians have looked at groups ( population - level ) and have found it is usually impossible to define fitness from a group perspective .
It can only be done in very restrictive situations ( which are if the group members are identical or the group members are unable to operate freely ) .
This means , unless its one of the special situations , natural selection cannot be said to operate at the group level .
Natural selection can always be understood at the individual level ( via inclusive fitness ) or at the gene level ( via gene fitness ) .
This is a fascinating , but complex topic ; I ’ll return to in the future .
People say natural selection is just a theory , but it ’s as real as the theory of gravity .
When Darwin was around , we did not have the understanding to develop the maths .
During the twentieth centaury , a series of excellent biologists ( Fisher , Hamilton and Price being the big three ) have formally defined with maths the process of natural selection , confirming it is a phenomenon just a real and universal as gravity ( if we looked at life on other planets , the maths would be the same , as it is if we think of evolution in any other system ) .
If you are an evolutionary biologist , you 'll recognise the equation in the banner of my blog as the E=mc2 of evolutionary theory .
It is the Price equation and the derivation from it of Hamilton 's Rule ( rb - c> 0 ) .
SO there IS an equation to explain evolution ( its just more complex and less well known that the most famous in physics ) .
What is inclusive fitness ?
Inclusive fitness measures the degree to which an individual succeeds in transmitting the genes it bears copies of to future generations .
To calculate the inclusive fitness of an individual you need to consider two things : an individual 's direct and indirect fitness .
Direct fitness is the reproductive value ( the number of offspring ) of an individual .
Many problems have arisen by thinking we can only consider inclusive fitness as equal to just the direct fitness – if you do this you can think of an individual ’s fitness in a similar way to that of an economic agent that maximses utility .
I should add that in practice , biologists often take measures that are related to direct fitness and assume this can infer what the inclusive fitness of the animal might be ( e.g. you measure antler length , clutch size , body mass , territory size , number of mates and assume these are proxy measures of fitness ) .
Whether this approach is valid or not depends on the question you are asking .
If you want to know anything about social behaviour it is not .
The big problem with many writers in the social sciences is they think the indirect fitness part is much less important than it is …
Indirect fitness , is the number of offspring that others produce as a result of the individual helping them .
The number produced it weighted by the relatedness between them .
I 'll have to discuss relatedness in detail in the future – relatedness in evolutionary biologly is a statistical measure of sameness – it can be positive or negative ( its not right to think of it as equivalent to genealogical kinship ) ... indirect fitness effects are often significant , even in large groups .
Thoughts on the Great Confusion
In the future , I ’ll write more about the different ways you can model natural selection and the different ways that you can get cooperative behaviours arising from it .
One thing I 'll say now .
Its a terrible shame how much work is being re-invented / misinterpreted due to these misunderstandings .
For example , many of the recent models of human cooperation use a between - within group selection approach which often makes it very hard to understand whether the behaviour being studied is altruistic or mutually beneficial , spiteful or selfish .
I 've seen models with statements like " we examine a model of human cooperation evolving between unrelated individuals " that actually works because of the indirect fitness benefits ( so it relies on relatedness ) ... the way the maths is done ( considering evolution in terms of between and within group selection ) makes this fact obscure .
Knowing why models work is obviously important because otherwise the model conclusions could be misapplied to real - world situations where they could not hold .
I ’ll write more on this in the future .
Just to stress , in these models the underlying process is identical to that which may be examined in a model a biologist typically uses , the way you do the maths is a matter of preference .
However all to often , people say that by modeling the process differently they are talking about a different process ( making a distinction between a group or individual level selection process ) .
This is just not the case , no matter what models you use ( gene - level , individual inclusive fitness or between - within group selection models , it should always be straightforward to get back to the Price Equation .
The reason the biologists have settled mainly on one approach ( doing models from an individual perspective ) is because they have found them to be the most useful - offering more intuitive results that can readily be tested and allowing more complex questions to be considered .
OK , that ’s enough chat from me .
To conclude I re-stress that evolutionary biologists do NOT think organisms are individual fitness maximisers !

Alan
Wake is one of those games that 's held everyone 's interest since it was first announced in 2005 , even though its intended platforms have changed over the years .
Originally , there was talk that it would be released on the PS3 , but that was before Microsoft snapped up the publishing rights to the game and thereby limited it to 360 and PC versions .
Now , however , it turns out that a PC incarnation of the game may not be in the cards .
Speaking to Edge Magazine , Sam Lake , the game 's lead writer , revealed that Remedy Entertainment is fully focused on getting the game finished in time for its Spring 2010 release date .
However , it does n't sound like a game for Windows is currently a priority for the developer .
" We are fully concentrated on the Xbox 360 version , " he said in the interview .
" Other than that the plans are up in the air and open .
Once we get this version done we ’ll see . "
When Edge asked Lake specifically about a PC version , he responded in as noncommittal a way as possible .
" As I said , the plans are open , and once we ’re done with the 360 version we ’ll evaluate the situation and see what makes sense . "
Alan
Wake is currently set to premiere at an unspecified point next spring , putting players in the role of the titular protagonist as he searches for his missing wife .
The game is set to be released in an episodic format , with Alan Wake 's plot providing the first season of a larger story that will hopefully be played out over future seasons .

A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the Cash For Clunkers program that was expected to be passed .
Now , a couple of weeks later the program has passed and is signed into law , and people will soon be able to take advantage of it .
I ’ve been getting emails and comments surrounding the program , asking for more details .
I decided to put together a quick FAQ covering some of the most common questions surrounding the program .
FAQ About Cash For Clunkers
Q : Is the billed signed into law yet ?
A : Yes the Cash For Clunkers bill has been signed into law .
The program is now the responsibility of the NHTSA and they will be implementing the system with car dealers .
The program ’s official website is : cars.gov .
Dealers will be responsible for signing up for the program , and participating dealers will eventually be listed on the government website .
Q : When will the program be available ?
A : Your new car must be bought or leased between July 1st and November 1st to qualify .
Q : Can the car you purchase with the trade in voucher be a used vehicle ?
A : The purchased vehicles must be new ( 2008 , 2009 , 2010 models ) and cost no more than $ 45,000 .
You cannot trade in a clunker for a motorcycle .
If you ’re looking for a used car , check out this site .
Q : Can I lease a car through the program , or do I have to purchase the new car ?
A : Yes you can lease , however , the Cash For Clunkers
Act requires that any lease under the program be for a period of at least five years .
Q : How do I find the combined EPA mileage estimates on my old clunker to make sure it qualifies for the program ?
A : Go to http://www.fueleconomy.gov and click on the model year of your vehicle , the make , and then the model .
Under the words “ ESTIMATED NEW EPA MPG ” in the red banner , there is a red number with the word “ COMBINED ” under it .
That is the new combined city / highway fuel economy for your vehicle .
You may then enter the make , model , and model year of a new vehicle you may want to buy and see its combined MPG for comparison .
Q : Are there restrictions on the year of my trade - in ?
A : The car can not be more than 25 years old , and it must meet the MPG requirements .
Q : Will all dealers be participating in the Car Allowance Rebate System ( CARS ) ?
A : Most new cars dealers in the US will participate .
They will have to register with the CARS program , but registration details have not been released yet by the NHTSA .
Registered dealers will be eventually listed , but it ’s a good guess that most new car dealers will want to be a part of it .
Q : What do I need to bring when I decide I want to do the Cash For Clunkers trade ?
A : You should bring documentation showing the current owner of the vehicle , preferably the title , and documents showing that the vehicle has been “ continuously insured by the same owner for a period of no less than 1 year prior to the trade - in . ”
The final rule will specify what types of documentation would be acceptable to prove ownership and the fact that the vehicle has been insured for the past year .
Q : Will I have to pay taxes on the voucher ?
A : No . The Cash For Clunkers
Act expressly provides that the credit is not income for the consumer , so the consumer will not have to pay taxes on the credit .
The credit will be considered as income for the dealer .
Q : Are higher income folks excluded from the program ?
Is there an income limit that leaves out some vehicle owners ?
A : No .
Anyone can take part in Cash For Clunkers since it is designed to help new car dealers , and to help the environment .
Q : I bought a new car in February 2009 .
Can the voucher apply to my past purchase – will it be retroactive ?
A : No .
Cars bought before the official start date ( see above ) wo n’t qualify for the credit retroactively .
Q : If my car is worth more than $ 4,500 , should I take advantage of the Cash for Clunkers credit ?
A : The Cash For Clunkers Program would not give you any benefit if you are able to trade in or sell your car or truck for more than the $ 4,500 credit .
You ’re probably better off not applying for the voucher .
Q : Is the CARS credit in addition to any incentives that dealers are offering toward a new car purchase , or would this credit supplant those credits ?
A : The CARS credit is separate from any manufacturer buyer incentives .
For example , if your new car dealer is offering $ 3,000 off the list price of a car and you qualified for a $ 4,500 CARS credit from your trade - in , then the total reduction off the MSRP would be $ 7,500 .
You should always shop for the best deals before buying a car .
Q : Can I trade in more than one vehicle under the program ?
Could I trade in two old cars and get a $ 9,000 credit ?
A : The current wording of the bill indicates that only one CARS credit can be applied to a new car purchase .
Q : How do I know the amount of my credit ?
Will I qualify for a $ 3,500 or a $ 4,500 CARS credit ?
A : The credit you get is determined by your current trade - in car ’s current combined MPG , the new car ’s combined MPG , and then the improvement you will get in MPG through getting the new car .
Here ’s a graphic showing how to determine what your credit will be .
Q : Can I go to the junkyard and buy an old car and use it for a trade or trade in my parents old car ?
A : Probably not .
The NHTSA says you need to bring to the dealer documentation establishing the identity of the person who currently owns the vehicle ( the title of the vehicle ) , and documentary proof that the vehicle “ has been continuously insured consistent with the applicable State law and registered to the same owner for a period of not less than 1 year immediately prior to the trade - in . ”
There is some debate as to whether this means someone – like your parents could trade - in their continuously insured clunker for you , and then you can use the voucher .
I would n’t count on it though .
Stay tuned for clarification on this question .
Q : What happens to my trade - in ?
A : The car will be sent to the salvage yard .
Some parts may be kept but the engine and drive - train will be crushed .
Conclusion
Those are a few of the more popular questions about the program that I ’ve heard , and I hope that this helps to answer them .

Advertisement Iranian state radio says seven people were killed during Monday 's protests in Tehran over the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The reports said the deaths came after " thugs " attacked a military post .
The country 's powerful Guardian Council has described the results of Friday 's disputed poll as " provisional " .
Opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi wants them annulled , alleging widespread fraud .
Rival marches are planned at the same site on Tuesday .
The demonstrations called by supporters of both President Ahmadinejad and Mr Mousavi are due to take place in Vali Asr Square in central Tehran .
See map of central Tehran Monday 's protest involved hundreds of thousands of people and was one of the largest since the Iranian revolution 30 years ago .
CHANGE OF MOOD Jon Leyne
Reporting from Tehran
I certainly get the impression from the authorities that the wind is really changing here .
The Guardian Council has now said it was only a provisional result and has called in all three losing candidates to speak to them this morning .
Bizarrely , all the communications seem to be working - suddenly international phone calls are working .
The BBC satellite is not being blocked .
At the same time , Mr Ahmadinejad has gone off to a regional summit in Russia , apparently oblivious to everything .
He did n't even mention the trouble when he spoke to reporters at the airport just before he left .
The radio report said the attack occurred at the end of the " illegal " rally as people were heading home " peacefully " .
" Several thugs wanted to attack a military post and vandalise public property in the vicinity of Azadi Square , " the radio said referring to the site of the protest .
" Unfortunately seven people were killed and several others wounded in the incident . "
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says that in light of what he saw of the vast and largely peaceful protests this seems an unlikely version of events .
Dozens of opposition activists have been arrested since the protests began .
A number of senior reformist politicians , including former Vice - President Mohammad Ali Abtahi and Mousavi ally Saeed Hajarian , were detained overnight , reports said .
Unrest has been reported in other parts of Iran .
One of Mr Mousavi 's websites said a student had died on Monday in clashes with hardliners in the southern city of Shiraz .
Foreign concern
Our correspondent adds that the authorities appear to be weakening in their support for President Ahmadinejad .
GUARDIAN COUNCIL
Iran 's most powerful body , currently controlled by conservatives Includes six theologians picked by Supreme Leader and six jurists approved by parliament
Half the members change every three years Approves bills passed by parliament and can veto them if deemed inconsistent with the constitution or Islamic law
The council can also bar candidates from standing in elections
How Iran is ruled Parliamentary Speaker Ali Larijani condemned the response to the protests .
Iranian media quoted him as saying : " The interior minister is responsible in this regard . "
The country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has ordered an inquiry into the allegations of vote - rigging .
Mr Mousavi and two other moderate candidates contesting the results are due to meet members of the Guardian Council - a powerful clerical group dominated by conservatives .
On Monday a spokesman for the council said that the results had not yet been finalised , and that they would only be final once the council has endorsed them .
The handling of the protests by the authorities has drawn international criticism .
EU foreign ministers expressed " serious concern " and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the election .
Supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi defied a ban on protest rallies
In his first comments on the situation , US President Barack Obama said he was " deeply troubled " by the violence in Iran .
He said he would continue pursuing tough dialogue with Iran .
" I think that the democratic process , free speech , the ability for folks to peacefully dissent , all those are universal values and need to be respected . "
But the BBC's Jonathan Beale , in Washington , says the president studiously avoided any comment on the allegations of vote fraud .
" We respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran , " Mr Obama said .
Meanwhile , President Ahmadinejad arrived in Russia on Tuesday .
He told a regional summit that the " age of empires " had ended , but made no mention of the protests .

Are we the “ third chimp ” or the “ second orang ” ?
Controversial new research suggests that we may be more closely related to the orang - utan than realised ( Image : Newspix / Rex Features )
Editorial :
In praise of scientific heresy
THESE days , we tend to accept without question that humans are “ the third chimpanzee ” .
The term , coined by author Jared Diamond , refers to the notion that our closest relatives are the two chimpanzee species – the common chimp and the bonobo .
But could we actually be “ the second orang ” – more closely related to orang - utans than chimps ?
That is the controversial claim made this week …
Twitter now has a brand spankin ' new homepage .
Of course , if you 're a regular Twitter user , you 're rarely going to see it because you 're already logged in .
But for the 5 billion + people Twitter has yet to convert , it provides the company 's big chance to get them to sign up and stay on their website .
So what 's Twitter 's big ace - in - the - hole ?
Well , just look at what the company puts in your face when you arrive : trending topics .
Not just 8 or 10 topics , but 23 topics that represent the collective discussion of the entire world .
Twitter 's no longer about updating your friends , but about being THE place for global events .
Evidence
Comparing the old homepage to the new homepage sheds an enormous amount of light on Twitter 's ambitions with its microblogging platform .
Here 's the old description text :
" Twitter is a service for friends , family , and co-workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick , frequent answers to one simple question :
What are you doing ?
And here 's the new text :
" Share and discover what 's happening right now , anywhere in the world "
You immediately notice the deemphasis on your personal network - the people you live , sleep , and work with - and the focus on realtime discovery and world events .
Twitter 's stepped away from being branded as a social network , or being compared to Facebook .
The second big change is search - specifically the trending topics .
The company not only makes sure you realize that the Twitterverse is talking about things you care about ( whether it 's pitcher Mark Buehrle or Blue M&Ms ) , but it explains them with a conversation bubble that appears when you hover over the question mark icon .
Even bigger , Twitter provides an explanation of the trending topics .
The explanations are pulled from What the Trend , although it looks like the explanations are n't updated in realtime .
So how do they decide which trending topics get homepage explanations ?
How long does it take for it to appear ?
Could it be abused ?
We 'll get the answers later , but the significance of explaining trends to a potential user is huge .
Everything is geared towards a curious onlooker seeing that Twitter is the place to have a conversation about anything that 's anything in the world .
Twitter 's Changing Directions
Actually , the more accurate subtitle is : Twitter is in the process of changing directions , and this new homepage is the biggest step yet towards that transformation .
Twitter was first conceived as a place to update your friends and interested parties on your life .
It was focused on you .
Now Twitter has taken away that focus , and in its place , Twitter is focusing on the entire world .
There 's not a single reference to you in Twitter 's new explanation .
We think we understand why , because we hear this reason for not joining Twitter all the time :
" I just do n't have anything to say . "
" I do n't need to update people on my life . "
" It 's for people with followings and something to promote , not for me . "
Emphasizing that Twitter is the world 's platform for realtime information , for being connected to the entire world , is a savvy move on the part of Twitter .
People who have something to promote are already on Twitter .
Now the company has to convert the people who think Twitter 's just about telling people about what cereal you ate .
Branding Twitter as the one place where you are plugged in to the collective world makes it tougher to ignore .
You can say " I do n't feel like updating people on my life , " but it 's far tougher to say " I do n't care about what 's happening in the world . "
Welcome to Twitter , the hotspot of cultural and global relevance .
Welcome to Twitter , Version 2 .
I ’ve heard this many times , even from my beautiful mother !
This is not true !
Let ’s bring up my SAMPLE tax table as a refresher :
$ 0-$ 10,000 = 0 % Tax Rate
$ 10,000 - $ 20,000 = 10 % Tax Rate
$ 20,000 - $ 50,000 = 20 % Tax Rate
$ 50,000 - $ 75,000 = 30 % Tax Rate
$ 75,000 + = 50 % Tax Rate
You will hear some people complain that they do n’t want their next raise because it will move them into a higher tax bracket and reduce their takehome pay and they will have less money to spend .
Okay , the Government does some interesting things but they ’ve figured this one out a long time ago .
Here ’s how it works :
Let ’s take someone earning $ 49,000 .
Their marginal tax rate is 20 % in our example tax system .
That DOES NOT MEAN they pay 20 % x $ 49,000 in tax .
They pay 0 % on their first $ 10,000 , 10 % tax on the next $ 10,000 , and 20 % on the next $ 29,000 .
Let ’s work that out :
( 0 % x $ 10,000 ) + ( 10 % x $ 10,000 ) + ( 20 % x $ 29,000 ) = $ 6,800 in tax
$ 49,000 Income – $ 6,800 tax = $ 42,200 TAKE HOME
So let ’s say they get their raise to $ 50,001 .
The myth is that now instead of paying 20 % on all their income , they pay 30 % – which would reduce their take home pay by roughly $ 5,000 !
This could not be further from the truth !
Let ’s do the real math :
( 0 % x $ 10,000 ) + ( 10 % x $ 10,000 ) + ( 20 % x $ 30,000 ) + ( 30 % x $ 1 ) = $ 7,000.30 in Tax
$ 50,0001 Income – $ 7,000.30 Tax = $ 43,000.70 TAKE HOME
Last time I checked , $ 43,000.70 is greater than $ 42,200 !
So feel free to ask for that next raise … :)

Today a comic spreads its leathery wings and softy flutters out into the world .
This was able to happen despite
Wes slowly mutating into a frog while Tony was off trying to destroy some pesky Death Stars .
Hadley Freeman has a very smart piece in the Guardian today about a very disturbing phenomenon : female journalists publicly baring their depressing and ultimately unsuccessful battles with various forms of self - loathing .
Advertisement
Freeman specifically mentions Christa D'Souza 's Daily Mail article about her increasingly harrowing experiences with breast implants , and of course Liz Jones 's truly upsetting story ( also , predictably , in the Daily Mail ) of trying to treat lifelong anorexia with three weeks of scones and brie and — shocker — still feeling bad about her body afterwards .
But she has a larger point : a genre has sprung up in contemporary lifestyle journalism , in which " a female journalist describes her obsession with her weight / breasts / ageing face / food or alcohol problems / inability to have a happy relationship " and usually ends up " sufficiently unhappy to be commissionable for another very similar piece . "
Advertisement
As Sadie pointed out in her coverage of Jones 's piece ( Jones is pictured above ) , this kind of writing is bad for everybody .
It 's bad for the writers , who — if they 're not totally manufacturing their distress for the reader 's benefit — probably need therapy .
But Freeman argues that it 's actually worse for readers .
For them , she writes , articles like Jones 's " are surely just as dangerous and potentially influential as the photos of the skinny models the journalist professes to abhor . "
Liz Jones is certainly troubling as thinspo , but Christa D'Souza is more complicated .
Her experience with scar tissue , lopsided breasts , cancer , pain , and the total absence of any self - esteem boost from her new breasts is n't going to convince anybody to get implants .
But it might convince some readers — male and female — that women are " self - hating , self - obsessed , " and that it 's normal to be like this .
One of the best pieces of feminist advice I 've ever gotten is not to insult my own body in front of others .
It perpetuates the idea that women should hate our bodies — that our inevitable physical flaws are worth valuable brain - space and conversational time .
But pieces like Jones 's and D'Souza 's are n't just body - snark , they 're self - snark : public expressions of low self - esteem so intractable that it lingers for years , harms relationships , and even endangers physical health .
Freeman says editors assign these pieces because they have a " misogynistic image of what women are like , " and that may well be true , but it 's a vicious cycle .
The more " boom and bust boob " stories we read , the more it seems that women are like D'Souza or Jones — irrevocably fucked up by aesthetic or social strictures they recognize are unhealthy but can't seem to escape .
And the easier it is to assume that we , the female readers , ca n't escape them either .
These strictures are n't just about beauty —
Zoe Lewis 's I - chose - a - career - and - now - I 'm - miserable screed and Lori Gottlieb 's cautionary tale about how failing to " settle " caused her lifelong loneliness are basically cut from the same cloth , maybe just a little more highbrow .
All these sob stories basically promulgate the notion that women can't have it all , or even much of anything , because even smart ladies who write for newspapers and magazines are basically unfulfilled and miserable .
Advertisement
The truth , of course , is much more complicated than that — even the disturbing Liz Jones is probably happier , at least at times , than she seems in her anorexia piece .
Freeman is correct that most confessional journalism of the Jones / D'Souza variety is likely conceived with the goal of " getting a reaction from readers , " and female misery seems to get hits .
But editors who rely on self - loathing for numbers ( and we 're looking at ladymags too here ) need to recognize that they 're exploiting their female writers and giving their readers a twisted view of what it means to be a woman .

" There were times you were n't let out of the cell for several days on end .
And you were only allowed to go to the toilet a limited number of times .
They gave you a card , which you had to shove under the door .
When a guard saw it , he 'd come and take you there , but you had to rush because they did n't give you much time .
Maybe Lord Corker will vote to confirm Sonia Sotomayor just to protect the equal rights of his lovely daughter Julia
Inhofe 's spokesman explained that since the Senator has already decided to vote against the nomination , there 's no reason to waste time on a sit - down discussion .
Earlier this week , Inhofe called his vote against Sotomayor a " foregone conclusion , " citing his vote against her nomination to a circuit court in 1998 .
... Inhofe 's Oklahoma colleague Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) did meet with Sotomayor , however , and had some kind words .
" She 's got the demeanor of a judge , " Coburn told NewsOK.com .
He added that the two had a " philosophical discussion [ about ] life , problems in our country , difficulties we face . "
NPR : Is there something in [ Sessions ’ ] record at the time that causes you to believe that he did cross that line from being merely conservative in his approach to social issues to being racially hostile or insensitive was the word that was commonly used ?
Mr. HEBERT : Oh , definitely back in 1986 , I had no doubt about that and testified to that effect , I believe , that it was n’t a question of , you know , he was joking about these things or saying them in a joking manner .
He was someone who was a product of the Deep South , and his racial attitudes reflected at that time a continued hostility towards equal - opportunity efforts by African - Americans , particularly in Alabama .
And that was true back then , and obviously he now represents many of those same people as a U.S. senator . [… ]
He will ask questions that he thinks he ’s entitled to ask , and he ’ll ask them in a very professional and what I would believe would be a very polite way .
At the same time , ultimately , many of us feel that no matter what the answers are , he ’ll still ultimately vote no .
Their own polling and focus groups warn the Senate Republicans that the right - wing jihad against Sonia Sotomayor 's nomination to the Supreme Court is a loser for them -- in every way .
They never thought they could actually derail the confirmation .
They just wanted to make a lot of noise to satisfy their drooling base and get them to donate some money to the faltering party .
Instead , the public has been very sympathetic to the nominee , has wondered why the Republicans are so automatically obstructionist on everything , and even the drooling base has not been forthcoming with the cash .
Predictions are that as many as a dozen Republican senators will abandon the far right of their party and vote to confirm .
“ She does n’t have the punch out there in terms of fundraising and recruiting , I think -- at least so far , ” said Sen. John Thune ( R - S.D. ) , who most likely will be elected as the No. 4 Republican in Senate leadership this week , following the abrupt departure of former GOP presidential hopeful , John Ensign , currently embroiled in a rapidly unfolding sex scandal and cover - up and fighting for his political survival
The worst of the hard core obstructionists , and the unreconstructed racists and misogynists , do n't carethe polls and focus groups say .
Opposition is all they know -- opposition to everything and anything Obama does .
Somehow it did n't surprise me last week when I read how the Senate 's most extremist fanatic , Jim Inhofe ( R - OK ) said he 's already made up his mind to oppose Judge Sotomayor -- he just hates all foreigners ( New York City is " foreign " to the dimwitted Inhofe ... unless he 's using it to demagogue about 9/11 .
And because he made up his mind he refused to talk with her .
Like I said , I was n't surprised but it does make me wonder about Oklahoma voters .
They just re-elected this bigoted kook to represent them by a very wide margin , 66 - 34 % , against an enlightened and accomplished state senator , Andrew Rice .
Coburn is one of 71 senators that Judge Sotomayor has sat down and talked with and Inhofe had been the only one rude enough to turn down the courtesy call .
Until today .
And then came Tennessee elitist , Bob Corker .
The multimillionaire businessman and real estate speculator -- and a squirrely attitude about disclosures -- Corker has taken easily to the customs of the American House of Lords .
Voters back in Tennessee are constantly complaining about his inability -- or unwillingness -- to represent regular working families .
Last week his Lordship got all huffy when Sonia Sotomayor " hobbling along with her leg in a cast " was 10 minutes late .
NO ONE IS 10 MINUTES LATE FOR LORD CORKER !
He bailed .
Back on May 5 we looked at the differences between an ill - educated KKK sympathizer ( at best ) from an unaccredited Bible " college " and one of the most qualified people ever nominated to a federal judgeship .
Jeff Sessions was rushed into his position as Republican ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committeehe is a partisan hack and vicious racist .
His appointment is a disgrace and an insult .
Yesterday NPR asked the question : Cab Jeff Sessions Fairly Evaluate Sonia Sotomayor ?
They interviewed Gerald Hebert -- a former DOJ attorney who worked with Jeff Sessions and testified at his 1986 hearings -- and one is drawn to the same conclusion I came to .
No doubt ... and along with most of the other hackish obstructionists who make the GOP Senate caucus so despised and loathed by normal Americans .

The elections have fragmented the European Parliament as never before after voters across the continent elected large numbers of non-aligned MEPs outside the traditional pro-EU Christian Democrats , Socialists and Liberals .
In Britain , the BNP , UKIP , and the Greens , made gains at the expense of Labour and Lib Dem votes .
After my previous article about installing Haskell ’s Cabal package in Ubuntu , I decided to do a bit more research on using Haskell in Ubuntu .
It turns out that the debian packages in the Ubuntu repositories for Haskell and GHC are hopelessly out of date , excluding not only the added functionality of new releases , but also the Haskell Platform , which is effectively an extended set of standard libraries surrounding Haskell .
Funnily enough , the Haskell platform actually includes Cabal , which effectively makes my previous post useless .
In its stead , I present to you a guide on installing GHC and the Haskell platform on your Ubuntu system ( though these steps should work equally well on any Linux system with apt - get as a package manager ) .
First things first , lets get the dependencies out of the way .
sudo apt - get install libedit2 libedit - dev freeglut3 - dev libglu1 - mesa- dev
Now let ’s remove any haskell packages we may have installed , as these will cause conflicts .
sudo apt - get autoremove ghc6
Note that if you installed cabal as per my previous post , you can remove the executable from your $ PATH by executing the following :
sudo rm /usr / local / sbin/cabal
This will not delete the executable , which is stored in $ HOME/.cabal / bin/ .
This just removes the sym - link that was in your $ PATH .
Next , lets grab the source for GHC 6.10.3 ( which is required to build the Haskell Platform )
wget http://haskell.org/ghc/dist/6.10.3/ghc-6.10.3-i386-unknown-linux-n.tar.bz2
and untar it .
tar - xvvf http://haskell.org/ghc/dist/6.10.3/ghc-6.10.3-i386-unknown-linux-n.tar.bz2
next , lets configure it and build it :
cd ghc - 6.10.3 / ./ configure sudo make install
After this , installing the Haskell Platform is just more of the same :
#grab the tarball wget http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/2009.2.0.1/haskell-platform-2009.2.0.1.tar.gz
# untar it tar - xvvf http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/2009.2.0.1/haskell-platform-2009.2.0.1.tar.gz
# ... and install it .
cd haskell - platform - 2009.2.0.1/ ./ configure make sudo make install
Along the way , the install scripts for the Haskell Platform will give you prompts for the next step to take .
Enjoy your Haskell Platform , and happy developing !
Karen Armstrong is one of the handful of wise and supremely intelligent commentators on religion who has become distressed by the tone of recent discussions of the subject .
Her targets are religious fundamentalism on the one hand and militant atheism on the other : in other words , al - Qaida as well as Richard Dawkins .
In plain language , and nowhere more eloquently than in this new book , Armstrong accuses both factions of misunderstanding the nature of God and , interestingly , of doing so in similar ways .
Both atheists and fundamentalists take God to be an essentially human sort of figure , a giant Father in the sky who watches over us , punishes the guilty , intervenes directly in our affairs and is entirely comprehensible to our minds .
" We regularly ask God to bless our nation , save our queen , cure our sickness or give us a fine day for a picnic . "
Fundamentalists commit , in Armstrong 's view , the grave error of presuming to know God 's mind and also of enlisting God on their side against their enemies .
Unsurprisingly , militant atheists observe this reductive vision of God and in turn slam religion as a child - like description of the world that cannot compare with the subtlety and practical powers of science .
Armstrong 's new book is shaped as a response to these two distortions .
She wishes to remind us of the mystery of God .
Her sympathy is with the great Jewish , Christian and Muslim theologians who have denied that any human attempt to put the divine into words will be accurate .
We are simply too limited to be able to know God ; our apprehension must hence be suffused with an awareness of our provisional and potentially faulty natures .
She writes : " He is not good , divine , powerful or intelligent in any way that we can understand .
We could not even say that God ' exists ' , because our concept of existence is too limited . "
Much of Armstrong 's book is spent pointing out the deep - seated needs that religions have traditionally addressed .
She begins in the caverns of Lascaux in the Dordogne and argues that the early religious rites to which the famous animal pictures belonged were connected with our ancestors ' wish to atone for the overbearing guilt that came from having to butcher other living creatures for survival .
Like art , religion has been a way of containing feelings that might otherwise tear individuals and societies apart .
Armstrong leans heavily on the distinction first made by the ancient Greeks between the realms of mythos and logos .
Logos is " a pragmatic mode of thought that enables people to function effectively in the world " ; it is what we rely on when organising society or planning a journey .
However , logos has its limitations : " It can not assuage human grief or find ultimate meaning in life 's struggles . "
For this , there is the realm of mythos or myth , to which religion and art belong .
Religion offers us moments of what Armstrong calls , using another Greek term , ekstasis , a stepping outside of the norm for the sake of release and consolation .
Aside from helping us to deal with our feelings of fear , aggression and guilt , religion is also defended by Armstrong as a source of compassion .
She recounts the story of a man who once came to see the great Rabbi Hillel and asked if he might undertake a rigorous course of study of the Torah with him .
Hillel waved him away : " What is hateful to yourself , do not to your fellow man .
That is the whole of the Torah and the remainder is but commentary .
Go learn it . "
Armstrong traces the emphasis on compassion across the major religions .
There are fascinating discussions here of the Buddhist state of " anatta " , or no self , a desirable condition that can be reached only through extensive meditation .
It can lead us , for brief periods , to look at the world as though we were not ourselves participants in it , and therefore free us from our noxious impulses to pass judgment and to presume that we know why other people have acted the way they have .
The concluding part of Armstrong 's book traces the growth of modern atheism and attributes it largely to religions ' failure to argue for what is most compelling about them .
Fatally , religions tried to defend themselves against science by arguing that they knew the truth better than the geologists , rather than presenting themselves ( as one feels Armstrong would have wished ) as the guardians of mystery and therapeutic manoeuvres of the mind .
A melancholy tone sometimes makes itself felt in this book , as one senses the author defending religion from its own worst impulses .
As a former nun , Armstrong 's perspective is unique in its combination of sympathy and lack of sentimentality towards religion 's wilder and more immature claims .
She joins Richard Holloway and Charles Taylor as one of the most intelligent contemporary defenders of religion , making a case that scrupulously avoids reliance on the supranatural .
As in so much of the rest of her hugely impressive body of work , Karen Armstrong invites us on a journey through religion that helps us to rescue what remains wise from so much that to many in Britain today no longer seems true .

“ What , ” asked my interlocutor , “ is the worst - case outlook for the world economy ? ”
It was n’t until the next day that I came up with the right answer : America could turn Irish .
What ’s so bad about that ?
Well , the Irish government now predicts that this year G.D.P. will fall more than 10 percent from its peak , crossing the line that is sometimes used to distinguish between a recession and a depression .
But there ’s more to it than that : to satisfy nervous lenders , Ireland is being forced to raise taxes and slash government spending in the face of an economic slump  policies that will further deepen the slump .
And it ’s that closing off of policy options that I ’m afraid might happen to the rest of us .
The slogan “ Erin go bragh , ” usually translated as “ Ireland forever , ” is traditionally used as a declaration of Irish identity .
But it could also , I fear , be read as a prediction for the world economy .
Nurse Owen Jay Murphy Jr. twisted the jaw of one patient until he screamed .
He picked up another one -- an elderly , frail man -- by the shoulders , slammed him against a mattress and barked , “ I said , ‘ Stay in bed . ’ ”
He ignored the alarms on vital - sign monitors in the emergency room , shouted at co-workers and once hurled a thirsty patient ’s water jug against the wall , yelling , “ How do you like your water now ? ” according to state records .
FOR THE RECORD :
California nursing board :
In Section A on July 12 , a graphic accompanying an article about the California nursing board , as well as a related story in Tuesday ’s Section A , referred to former Board of Registered Nursing Vice President Elizabeth O. Dietz as a professor of nursing at San Jose State University .
Although the board ’s website listed that as her current affiliation , the university says she retired in July 2008 . —
Murphy ’s fellow nurses at Kaiser Permanente Riverside Medical Center finally pleaded with their bosses for help .
“ They were afraid of him , ” a hospital spokesman said .
Under pressure , Murphy resigned in May 2005 .
Within days , Kaiser alerted California ’s Board of Registered Nursing :
This nurse is dangerous .
But the board did n’t stop Murphy from working elsewhere , nor did it take steps over the next two years to warn potential employers of the complaints against him .
In the meantime , Murphy was accused of assaulting patients at two nearby hospitals , leading to convictions for battery and inflicting pain , board and court records show .
Even Murphy , who has since taken classes to curb his anger , was surprised the board did n’t step in earlier .
“ The nursing board is there to protect the public from me , ” he said in an interview .
The board charged with overseeing California ’s 350,000 registered nurses often takes years to act on complaints of egregious misconduct , leaving nurses accused of wrongdoing free to practice without restrictions , an investigation by The Times and the nonprofit news organization ProPublica found .
It ’s a high - stakes gamble that no one will be hurt as nurses with histories of drug abuse , negligence , violence and incompetence continue to provide care across the state .
While the inquiries drag on , many nurses maintain spotless records .
New employers and patients have no way of knowing the risks .
Reporters examined the case of every nurse who faced disciplinary action from 2002 to 2008 -- more than 2,000 cases in all -- as well as hundreds of pages of court , personnel and regulatory reports .
They interviewed scores of nurses , patients , families , hospital officials , regulators and experts .
Among the findings :
* The board took more than three years , on average , to investigate and discipline errant nurses , according to its own statistics .
In at least six other large states , the process typically takes a year or less .
“ It ’s really discouraging that when you do report people . . . they do n’t take action , ” said Joan Jessop , a retired chief nursing officer in Los Angeles who filed multiple complaints with the board during her 43 - year career .
“ What is so frightening to me is that these people will go on and do it to somebody else . ”
* The board failed to act against nurses whose misconduct already had been thoroughly documented and sanctioned by others .
Reporters identified more than 120 nurses who were suspended or fired by employers , disciplined by another California licensing board or restricted from practice by other states -- yet have blemish - free records with the nursing board .
* The board gave probation to hundreds of nurses -- ordering monitoring and work restrictions -- then failed to crack down as many landed in trouble again and again .
One nurse given probation in 2005 missed 38 drug screens , tested positive for alcohol five times and was fired from a job before the board revoked his probation three years later .
* The board failed to use its authority to immediately stop potentially dangerous nurses from practicing .
It obtained emergency suspensions of nurses ’ licenses just 29 times from 2002 to 2007 .
In contrast , Florida ’s nursing regulators , who oversee 40 % fewer nurses , take such action more than 70 times each year .
In interviews last week , the board ’s leaders and other state officials defended its record .
“ We take what we do -- protecting the public -- very , very seriously , ” said Executive Officer Ruth Ann Terry .
Terry , at the helm for nearly 16 years and on staff for 25 , acknowledged that the pace of the disciplinary process has “ always been unacceptable ” and said the system was being streamlined .
But she blamed other parts of the state bureaucracy for delays and was vague about what changes would be made .
Later , the state Department of Consumer Affairs , which oversees the board , sent reporters a three - page list of “ process improvements . ”
Many were mundane or incremental adjustments -- such as revising disciplinary guidelines or planning expert witness training .
Others seemed more directly aimed at reducing delays : adding staff , meeting with investigators about stalled cases and using computer systems to better track complaints .
Patricia Harris , acting chief deputy director of the department , stood behind the board .
“ I think they do a good job , ” she said .
It ’s impossible to measure the number of nurses whose conduct endangers patients , but it is presumed to be a small fraction .
The board disciplines several hundred a year .
Even a small number of troubled nurses can have wide impact , however .
Registered nurses are required to perform or oversee complex treatment , and each can see dozens of patients a week .
Patients generally do n’t have a choice in which nurse they get .
Most trust that , at minimum , the government would n’t allow a nurse with known problems at their bedside .
In California , the board ’s vigilance is especially important .
The state has among the fewest registered nurses per capita of any state , with an estimated 654 working nurses for every 100,000 residents , compared with 836 nationwide .
Putting even greater strain on the nursing supply is a unique state law that limits how many patients each hospital nurse can treat at one time .
With demand outstripping supply , nurses have readily jumped from one hospital to another , and employers have relied heavily on the board to screen out poor performers .
Despite its critical mission , the board faces little outside scrutiny or pressure to change its ways .
Public board meetings , held five times a year , are filled with praise for staffers ’ efforts .
During five meetings attended by reporters since November 2007 , Terry never focused on the delays in discipline .
And board members -- including both nurses and public appointees -- never publicly challenged staffers or urged quicker action even though they review every disciplinary action .
( Board President Susanne Phillips said such questions are often raised with staff privately . )
While the board tarries , nurses like Owen Jay Murphy Jr. keep working .
In 2006 , more than a year after Kaiser warned the board about him , Murphy was employed at Riverside Community Hospital .
There , according to a criminal investigator ’s affidavit , he forcibly grabbed the face of a patient whose arms were tied down .
“ I was helpless , ” said Christy Ledebur , now 50 .
“ Why would they have someone like that working in an emergency room ? ”
Ten days later , Murphy punched and elbowed another restrained patient in the face , the investigator ’s statement said .
“ I do n’t even recall the first two hits , ” said Murphy , 41 , adding that his stress and anger at the time clouded his memory .
“ They said I hit ‘ em three times . ”
Riverside Community fired him in July 2006 and immediately alerted the nursing board , a hospital official said .
He later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges in both incidents .
A month later , a patient at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton complained that Murphy had put her in a headlock and shoved her against the wall , leaving clumps of hair on the bed and floor , according to hospital officials and board records .
The board took its first public action in June 2007 , filing a formal accusation detailing the administrative charges against Murphy .
The former Army medic said in an interview that he had been provoked in some cases by aggressive or mentally impaired patients .
But he said he was a good nurse and confident that court - ordered anger management classes had taught him self - control .
Still awaiting his first board hearing , he works in the emergency room of Parkview Community Hospital in Riverside with an unrestricted license .
Racking up accusations
The Times and ProPublica found more than 60 nurses disciplined since 2002 who -- like Murphy -- were accused of committing serious misconduct or mistakes in at least three health facilities before the board took action .
At least five employers reported Los Angeles nurse Carolyn Fay Thomas to the board for allegedly making medication errors and falsifying charts to hide her drug thefts .
And John Michael Jones racked up complaints from at least three hospitals for stealing and using drugs during work .
Yet the board waited five years to revoke his license , even after he allegedly dozed off while performing CPR on a dying patient in 2002 .
“ I was high some of the times that I was working .
Yes , I was , ” Jones , who denies falling asleep during CPR , said in an interview .
Several hospital administrators expressed shock when reporters told them that nurses they had turned in for dangerous failings went on to work at other facilities .
No one tracks these nurses , who typically are n’t required to tell the board where -- or even if -- they are working .
“ There ’s got to be a better system than now to protect our patients and their safety , ” said Deborah Hankins , chief nursing officer at Bakersfield ’s San Joaquin Community Hospital , one of the hospitals that complained about Jones .
As it stands , complaints often take a circuitous route through several clogged bureaucracies : from the nursing board for initial assessment to the Department of Consumer Affairs for investigation , to the California attorney general ’s office for case filing and the state Office of Administrative Hearings for trial .
Then the case goes back to the board for a final decision .
Other California health licensing boards are also hampered by delays -- but the registered nursing board stands out because of the sheer volume of licensees it regulates .
The biggest bottleneck occurs at the investigation stage , as Consumer Affairs staffers struggle to handle complaints against nurses as well as those against cosmetologists , acupuncturists and others .
The nursing board must share a pool of fewer than 40 field investigators with up to 25 other licensing boards and bureaus .
Some investigators handle up to 100 cases at a time .
All told , cases closed by the nursing board in fiscal 2008 took an average of 1,254 days .
That pace surprised officials at other states ’ boards .
“ I do n’t think it ’s ever to anybody ’s advantage to have a case open for three years , ” said Valerie Smith , associate director of Arizona ’s board , which typically takes 6 1/2 months from complaint to resolution .
Nursing boards nationwide vary widely in how they investigate and discipline nurses .
But many do it faster .
Officials from Arizona , Texas and Ohio say they handle almost everything within their own agencies , exercising tight control and questioning cases that take too long .
“ Where there ’s the greatest risk , we want to take the fastest action , ” said Betsy Houchen , head of Ohio ’s board , which requires 95 % of the most serious complaints to be investigated within five working days .
Boards with the fairest and quickest outcomes hire their own investigators , usually nurses themselves , as well as their own attorneys , according to a 2004 trade group report .
Terry could ask the state Legislature for broader authority or permission to hire her own investigators , but she said she has no plans to .
Rather , she said , she intends to adhere to the “ process that the state of California has set up in terms of protecting the public . ”
She said her staff had recently begun working with Consumer Affairs investigators to prioritize and expedite the handling of complaints .
It ’s not a new goal .
In a 2002 report to the Legislature , the board said that “ there has been a steady and unacceptable increase ” in length of disciplinary cases and called for “ strategies to expedite cases . ”
Current and former state attorneys say funding has been an issue -- at times they ’ve been asked to suspend work on nursing board cases to save money .
But Phillips said the board , which is funded by licensing fees paid by nurses , has enough money .
It has n’t raised its fees in 18 years .
There is no legal pressure for the board to act faster .
Unlike with disciplinary cases against doctors , there ’s no statute of limitations on nurses .
The delays make the pursuit of cases more difficult : Witnesses die .
Records are purged .
And former co-workers cannot be found .
Even nurses targeted by the board are frustrated by the slow pace .
Kimberly Ann Garza received three years ’ probation in 2008 -- 6 1/2 years after her bosses at a Central Valley hospital complained that she had failed to account for her patients ’ drugs .
At one point , the investigator went on medical leave and Garza ’s file sat for 11 months before a colleague took it over .
“ If I ’m such a danger and I ’m such a liability , why were they not on top of this ? ” said Garza , who denied she stole drugs .
A girl questions why
Caitlin Greenwell grinned slyly as she sat before a special computer at her family ’s ranch home in Lafayette , about 10 miles east of Oakland .
Her eyes darted around a keyboard on her screen , as a sensor tracked her gaze and allowed her to spell out words .
“ Let ’s test my mom , ” she typed , then looked up with a devilish smile .
“ We will test my mom on math . ”
Julia Greenwell laughed .
“ In so many ways , she ’s typical , ” she said .
But the 9 - year - old has begun questioning why she is trapped in a wheelchair , unable to control her limbs or speak , said her father , Steven .
Caitlin , he said , is “ very aware that things did n’t go right and some were due to people not doing their jobs . ”
Like many aggrieved patients and their families , the Greenwells say they feel doubly victimized , first by nurses and then by the board itself .
Steven Greenwell said he wo n’t rest until the board disciplines Candyce Warren , the nurse he holds primarily responsible for Caitlin ’s injuries at birth .
In October 1999 , Warren and the trainee she was overseeing missed crucial signs during Julia Greenwell ’s labor that the baby ’s condition was deteriorating , according to allegations in a 2000 lawsuit by the Greenwells against John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek .
Caitlin was deprived of oxygen and as a result has cerebral palsy , according to the suit , settled in 2003 .
A doctor paid a separate settlement .
Attorneys for the Greenwells said that Warren was responsible for the trainee , who had little experience reading fetal monitoring strips , and that both nurses tried to cover up their mistakes by altering the medical record .
Steven Greenwell lodged a complaint with the nursing board in June 2003 -- waiting , as his attorney advised , until after the civil case was resolved .
The board filed an accusation a year or so later .
Then the case disappeared into the state ’s bureaucracy .
There was no word on the matter until 2008 , when the board amended the charges against Warren to fault her handling of a different baby ’s distress back in 2002 .
That child was stillborn .
Still there was no resolution for the Greenwells and no explanation for the delays .
“ I kept calling the nursing board and getting nothing , ” Steven Greenwell said .
Greenwell said he also spent hours on the phone imploring a deputy attorney general to see the case through -- only to learn recently that she had left her job .
Warren , who still works at John Muir , feels wronged by the board as well .
She disputes the allegations and wants to clear her name but would n’t discuss specifics while the case is pending .
At least five hearings have been set , then put off , she said .
“ What they are doing is torturing us , ” she said .
“ It ’s not right . ”
Multiple alleged lapses
In 2005 , Los Angeles County officials fired Abbie Dickerson , a nurse at the publicly owned Olive View - UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar .
She had connected a patient ’s feeding tube so it leaked into a surgical wound , according to her Sept. 7 termination letter .
It was n’t Dickerson ’s first alleged lapse .
She ’d been written up four times for medication errors , according to the letter , which is on file with the county Civil Service Commission .
“ Your unsatisfactory job performance and medical errors are no longer tolerable , ” the letter said .
Dickerson ’s appeal to the commission was thrown out because she failed to show up for a hearing .
She declined to comment .
California nursing regulators either did n’t know about the allegations or did n’t do anything about them -- they would n’t say .
Anyone looking Dickerson up on the board ’s website would find a clean record .
She is free to work anywhere in the state .
Hers is one of the 120 cases in which the board has n’t acted despite sanctions imposed by other agencies or employers that were based on clear evidence .
Reporters easily found the cases through public records , and nothing prevents the board from getting the same information and acting on it .
Cases like these “ should be dealt with immediately , ” said Agoura Hills nurse Tricia West , an authority on healthcare quality who has been an expert witness both for the board and for nurses accused of wrongdoing .
Even when a registered nurse loses a license with another of California ’s professional boards , the nursing board does not always act promptly .
In more than a dozen cases , individuals were able to care for patients as registered nurses after they had been severely sanctioned -- or even had their license revoked -- by the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians .
Both boards use the same pool of investigators and fall under the Department of Consumer Affairs .
But the department has no central database that can be searched for all the licenses belonging to an individual .
Lynn
Teehee lost her LVN license in 2006 following allegations that she had improperly inserted a feeding tube into a patient , then ignored his cries of pain as his abdomen was flooded .
The man died two days later of septic shock , records show .
Her license was revoked after she failed to respond to the allegations .
The registered nursing board filed its charges two years after the LVN board acted -- and later put Teehee on probation .
Percy Randall
Wade surrendered his vocational nursing license in 2003 after being accused of failing to account for missing narcotics .
Then , while working under his registered nursing license , he billed San Quentin State Prison $ 161,000 for work he did n’t do .
He was convicted of felony grand theft in 2006 .
A year and a half later , the registered nursing board filed an accusation against him , citing both incidents .
He was given four years ’ probation in March .
The problem extends beyond the vocational nursing board .
Dorothy Wilson ( also known as Dorothy Bauer ) is licensed as both a registered nurse anesthetist and a podiatrist .
In 1999 , the California Board of Podiatric Medicine put her on five years ’ probation for repeated acts of negligence .
The following year , as a nurse handling anesthesia during a breast enlargement operation , Wilson did not notice that the patient had stopped breathing , according to filings in a subsequent malpractice suit against Wilson and the surgeon .
Mary Lopez , then 32 , was deprived of oxygen , went into a coma and suffered brain damage , according to the pleadings .
Lopez ’s attorney filed a complaint with the nursing board in April 2002 , alleging that Wilson had over - sedated Lopez , then altered records to cover up the error .
A judge found Wilson at fault and ordered her in August 2002 to pay Lopez $ 779,000 , although the case was settled for a lower , undisclosed amount on appeal , said Wilson ’s attorney , Michael Khouri .
The nursing board did not file an accusation against Wilson until December 2007 .
Wilson ’s lawyer said in court papers that any injury to Lopez resulted from wrongdoing by the surgeon , not his client .
( The surgeon was dropped from the case . )
As for Lopez , she had to relearn her ABCs , her numbers , even how to walk .
A clerical worker , she requires notes to remind her each day how to do her job and when to pick up her children .
“ I ’m not 100 % who I was , ” she said .
“ She took that away from me . ”
Data not demanded
The nursing board says it ca n’t act on cases it does n’t know about .
But it ’s not set up to find out what it needs to know , The Times and ProPublica found .
Most states require hospitals to report nurses who have been fired or suspended for harming a patient or other serious misconduct .
So , for that matter , does California ’s vocational nursing board .
Not the registered nursing board .
Heidi Goodman , the board ’s assistant executive officer , told The Times in 2007 that the board could be overwhelmed if such reports were mandated .
“ We have to work within existing resources , ” she said .
“ You get the flood .
What are you going to do about it ? ”
The board also largely shuts itself off from information about nurses licensed in California who get in trouble elsewhere .
It is not part of a national compact of 23 state nursing boards that share information about nurses who are under investigation or have been disciplined .
And unlike 35 states , California does not put the names of all its registered nurses into an industry database .
So if a California - licensed nurse gets in trouble in another state , that state may not know to notify California .
Terry said last week that the board would consider requiring California hospitals to report errant nurses -- a proposal that has come up before but never gained traction .
She also said the board wants to arrange a one - time computer sweep of other states ’ actions to determine which of them involve California nurses .
Until recently , the state did not even ask nurses renewing their licenses whether they had been disciplined elsewhere or convicted of crimes .
It began doing so only after The Times and ProPublica highlighted the loopholes last fall .
This spotty oversight has left some nurses suspended or barred from practice in other states free to care for patients in California .
One of those nurses , Sandra Corrine Taylor , had her license revoked by Oklahoma and Texas .
A third state , Idaho , took away her license as a lesser - skilled nurse .
Among her alleged offenses : verbal and physical abuse of nursing home patients , medication errors and lying about her academic credentials , according to records from the other state boards .
Taylor could not be reached .
Perhaps the most telling sign of dysfunction is when other states act against nurses for crimes and misdeeds committed in California before California ’s own board does .
Often it appeared they simply had better information and acted on it more quickly .
David Miranda was fired by a Pasadena hospital in 2003 for testing positive for drugs on the job , then convicted in Los Angeles in 2005 of illegal gun possession .
Citing those incidents , Arizona ’s nursing board denied him a license in 2006 .
Based in part on Arizona ’s action , California ’s board gave Miranda probation in November 2007 .
Just last month the board moved to pull his license after he failed two drug tests .
Given a second chance
More than half the nurses who respond to allegations from the board are handed a second chance .
Each year , California places at least 110 nurses on probation , warning that if they get in trouble again , their licenses may be yanked .
In reality , such action seldom happens quickly , if at all , according to a review of hundreds of nurse disciplinary records .
Just five board monitors oversee about 470 nurses on probation .
Often nurses must undergo physical and mental exams , take drug tests , submit to workplace monitoring and attend rehabilitation or support groups .
But when they do n’t meet some -- or any -- of those requirements , years often pass before the board tries to revoke their probation .
At times the punishment for violating probation is more probation .
One nurse was put on three years ’ probation in 1996 for stealing drugs from a Sacramento hospital .
After she ignored numerous requirements , her probation was extended three more years in 1999 , according to board documents .
Finally in 2003 , after she relapsed , skipped drug tests , was convicted of possessing codeine and Valium without a prescription , got a job without permission and missed support group meetings , her license was revoked .
But last year , the board found the nurse had “ demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation ” and gave her license back -- with probation .
Carolyn Claeys , now 61 , was put on probation in July 2005 .
The home healthcare nurse had showed up for work drunk and had stolen drugs from a former patient ’s house , according to her board disciplinary record .
At the time , Claeys also had three criminal convictions : two for drunk driving and one for petty theft .
Nursing board documents describe what happened next :
Less than four months into her nursing board probation , Claeys was convicted of a DUI .
Four months after that , she was fired from a nursing home for stealing drugs .
She tested positive for drugs three times between November 2005 and March 2006 and missed 12 required drug tests .
Any of these violations would have been grounds for the board to revoke her probation .
But the board took no action -- at least none that could be found in public records .
In July 2006 , Claeys was found passed out , high on drugs , in the Santa Cruz apartment of Dorothy “ Jeanie ” Rising , who had died of cancer the previous day .
Claeys , one of her caregivers , admitted to authorities that she ’d stolen Rising ’s painkillers and injected them .
Five months later , the board filed a petition to revoke Claeys ’ probation .
She did n’t contest the charges , and her license was later revoked .
In an interview , Claeys acknowledged that she was “ an impaired nurse . ”
But she said she ’d waited until Rising was dead to steal the drugs .
“ It was n’t that horrific , ” she said , “ as opposed to if I had been sitting right there when I was there with her : ‘ Here , one for you , one for me . ’ ”
Terry said that adding probation staff should help .
“ You wo n’t find that happening anymore , ” she said of such cases .
As for other improvements , she cautioned that they would take time .
“ It ’s not going to happen overnight , ” Terry said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has realized a $ 1.02 billion paper profit on a 10 - month - old investment in BYD Co after shares in the Chinese car and battery maker quintupled .
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett , chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway , smiles as he meets hedge fund manager Zhao Danyang ( not pictured ) who placed the winning bid in a charity auction for lunch with Buffett at New York 's famous steak house , Smith &Wollensky , June 24 , 2009 .

Berkshire ’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings
Co unit had agreed last September 26 to buy 225 million BYD shares at HK $ 8 each , a transaction then worth about $ 230 million .
The China Securities Regulatory Commission on Thursday granted approval for the transaction , which gives Berkshire a 9.89 percent stake .
BYD shares closed Friday at HK $ 42.90 , valuing Berkshire ’s stake at HK$ 9.65 billion , or about $ 1.25 billion .
Hong Kong ’s benchmark Hang Seng index is up 10 percent since Berkshire revealed the BYD investment .
Berkshire agreed to the stake three days after deciding to buy $ 5 billion of Goldman Sachs Group Inc preferred shares , despite the then - pervasive market turmoil after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc ’s bankruptcy .
Warrants attached to the Goldman investment have since generated a $ 2 billion paper profit for Berkshire .
“ Buffett has grown more comfortable investing in foreign companies in recent years , ” said Andy Kern , who writes the blog Berkshire Ruminations and is a doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri - Columbia .
“ Domestically , Buffett is taking advantage of Berkshire ’s solid capital position , ” he added , “ while internationally , it ’s more that Buffett is simply finding bargains . ”
Other non-U.S. investments by Berkshire include the reinsurer Swiss Re and the South Korean steelmaker Posco .
Earlier this decade , Berkshire made a few billion dollars on what had been a $ 488 million investment in Chinese oil company PetroChina Co .
Buffett is the world ’s second - richest person , after Microsoft Corp co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates , according to Forbes magazine .
Founded in Shenzhen in 1995 as a maker of rechargeable batteries , BYD expanded into mobile phones and automobiles .
It expects to sell 400,000 vehicles this year , and targets the sale of as many as 9 million by 2025 , according to Henry Li , general manager of BYD Auto ’s export arm .
BYD Auto launched its first plug - in hybrid vehicle , the F3 DM sedan , last December .
Berkshire , based in Omaha , Nebraska , is a roughly $ 150 billion conglomerate that has close to 80 businesses selling such things as car insurance , ice cream and underwear , and which invests in dozens of companies .
Analysts on average expect Berkshire on August 7 to report a decline in second - quarter operating profit .
Net income and Berkshire ’s book value may grow if rising stock markets boost the value of Berkshire ’s derivatives contracts .

Dear Cecil :
Can you tell me if the rumor is true concerning Catherine the Great , her unusual interest in horses , and her resulting death ?
C.S. , Baltimore
Cecil replies :
I knew if we waited around long enough someone was sure to ask this question , C. , and I and the Straight Dope staff want to thank you for coming through for us .
It ’s all very well explaining the theory of relativity and so on , but Catherine the Great and the horse is a story that truly comes from the heart .
The simple answer to your question is no , the rumor is not true .
However , that wo n’t stop us from repeating the rumor , to wit : that Catherine the Great , empress of Russia in the latter part of the 18th century , was crushed to death when attendants lost their grip on ropes supporting a horse that was being lowered on her for , ah , sexual purposes .
This is without doubt the most outrageous story I heard during my entire college career , which is when you usually come across these historical tidbits .
The boring truth is this : Catherine the Great died of a stroke while sitting on the commode in the palace at St. Petersburg .
Another less commonly circulated rumor has it that Catherine was so grossly fat ( true in itself ) that she broke the commode and died of blood loss from resultant injuries , but this is regarded as a fabrication also .
The story about Catherine ’s alleged yen for horses probably has its roots in the fact that she had an active and unusually public sex life .
She had numerous lovers throughout her long reign , one of whom , Grigori Potemkin , procured young men for her after their own relationship cooled .
The lucky stud would be “ tested ” by one of Catherine ’s ladies - in - waiting , and if he showed promise he would be appointed adjutant general , or something along those lines , and spend a couple soft years performing as required .
Catherine developed a colorful reputation among the courts of Europe on account of this system .
She had lots of enemies , any of whom might have embellished on the already randy truth and come up with the horse story .
There is some thought that Polish emigres might have invented it after her death to discredit her and the Russians in general , Poland having fared badly at the hands of Russian armies during her reign .

There are probably two major differences :
Ruby has elegant , anonymous closures .
Rails uses them to good effect .
Here 's an example :
class WeblogController < ActionController :: Base def index @posts = Post.find :all respond_to do |format| format.html format.xml { render :xml => @posts.to_xml } format.rss { render :action => " feed.rxml " } end end end
Anonymous closures / lambdas make it easier to emulate new language features that would take blocks .
In Python , closures exist , but they must be named in order to be used .
So instead of being able to use closures to emulate new language features , you 're forced to be explicit about the fact that you 're using a closure .
Ruby has cleaner , easier to use metaprogramming .
This is used extensively in Rails , primarily because of how easy it is to use .
To be specific , in Ruby , you can execute arbitrary code in the context of the class .
The following snippets are equivalent :
class
Foo def self .
make_hello_method class_eval do def hello puts " HELLO " end end end end class Bar < Foo # snippet 1 make_hello_method end class Bar < Foo ; end # snippet 2 Bar.make_hello_method
In both cases , you can then do :
Bar.new.hello
which will print " HELLO " .
The class_eval method also takes a String , so it 's possible to create methods on the fly , as a class is being created , that have differing semantics based on the parameters that are passed in .
It is , in fact , possible to do this sort of metaprogramming in Python ( and other languages , too ) , but Ruby has a leg up because metaprogramming is n't a special style of programming .
It flows from the fact that in Ruby , everything is an object and all lines of code are directly executed .
As a result , Class es are themselves objects , class bodies have a self pointing at the Class , and you can call methods on the class as you are creating one .
This is to large degree responsible for the degree of declarativeness possible in Rails , and the ease by which we are able to implement new declarative features that look like keywords or new block language features .
Screens are for suckers .

Will Chromosome Y Go Bye - Bye ?
Is the End of Men Imminent ?
What makes a man a man ?
Socially , that is a complicated question .
Genetically , however , it is as simple as a single Y chromosome .
But guys , that chromosome is in trouble .
In a new study , researchers say there is a dramatic loss of genes from the human Y chromosome that eventually could lead to its complete disappearance -- in the next few millennia .
While the Y chromosome 's degeneration has been known to geneticists and evolutionary biologists for decades , the study sheds new light on some of the evolutionary processes that may have contributed to its demise and posits that , as the degeneration continues , the Y chromosome could disappear from our genetic repertoire entirely .
" It 's certainly possible , but it 's difficult to predict when it will happen , " said Kateryna Makova , an associate professor of biology at Penn State University , who led the study , which was published Thursday in the journal PLoS Genetics .
Although geneticists and evolutionary biologists agree that the Y chromosome is degenerating -- and far more rapidly than its X counterpart -- they reject the idea of a world far in the future where men are obsolete .
" The idea that the Y chromosome has just bailed out of an airplane without a parachute simply does n't fit the facts , " said Dr. David Page , director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge , Mass . , and a Y chromosome expert .
" The evidence from studies on natural deletions of [ genes on ] the human Y chromosome shows there are consequences , especially for sperm production , that implies very strong natural selection against the loss of genes on the human Y chromosome . "
Y Chromosomes Had Problems From the Start
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes packed with genes that dictate every aspect of our biological functioning .
Of these pairs , the sex chromosomes are different ; women have two X chromosomes and men have an X and a Y chromosome .
The Y chromosome contains essential blueprints for the male reproductive system , in particular those for sperm development .
But the Y chromosome , which once contained as many genes as the X chromosome , has deteriorated over time and now contains less than 80 functional genes compared to its partner , which contains more than 1,000 genes .
Geneticists and evolutionary biologists determined that the Y chromosome 's deterioration is due to accumulated mutations , deletions and anomalies that have nowhere to go because the chromosome does n't swap genes with the X chromosome like every other chromosomal pair in our cells do .
Y Chromosomes Are Rapidly Losing Genes
However , Melissa Wilson , lead author of the study and graduate research fellow at Penn State University , pointed out that if there is no difference between a male who has lost a particular gene and one who still retains it , especially if both are still fertile , then that gene must be nonessential .
" Because they can lose [ a gene ] ... we conclude that it's on its way to dying in humans , " she said .
Yet the Y chromosome perseveres , despite its rapid rate of deterioration .
" The key flaw in the logic [ of Y chromosome deterioration ] is the assumption that the Y chromosome can only lose genes , " Page said .
" But the human Y chromosome has gained genes not even on the X chromosome .
Men who lose those genes do not transmit their Y chromosome . "
Y Chromosome Can Gain Genes
Page pointed out that , while the Y chromosome may not share genetic material with the X chromosome , it can swap genes with other chromosomes as well as keep multiple copies of functional genes to increase their number on the Y chromosome .
Makova and Wilson said that the increased rate of mutation on the Y chromosome could give rise to new genes that may prove beneficial and , therefore , remain on the chromosome .
Genetic change , whether by mutation , environmental stressors or by swapping bits of chromosomes , is the natural course of evolution , and evolution is weighted towards survival .
Perhaps most importantly , Y chromosomes with defective male - specific genes , especially those involved in sperm production , are unlikely to reproduce and pass on those genes to their sons , which knocks highly defective chromosomes out of the gene pool .
Genetic changes that do not favor reproduction are likely to get weeded out of the system .
" The most fundamental [ principle ] to all evolution is reproduction , " said Dr. Ronald Crystal , chairman of the Department of Genetic Medicine at Weil Cornell Medical College .
" No one knows why the Y chromosome has more pressures to evolve .
It may be that the genes are irrelevant .
...
But evolution figures out a way to maintain reproduction . "
Reproduction Is Still Paramount for Evolution
Even if the Y chromosome becomes obsolete , reproduction will continue , in some form .
Makova and Wilson said that new sex chromosomes may rise from non-sex chromosomes or that essential genes might move to other chromosomes , which has happened in some species of deer .
" Presumably , we will have moved genes around , " said Dr. Harry Ostrer , director of the Human Genetics program at the New York University School of Medicine .
" But the reproductive structures will be well conserved . "
In other words , men will not fade away , even if their Y chromosomes do .

Here is my contribution to the genre : Sarah Palin becomes president of the United States .
Far - fetched ?
Not really .
After all , Palin really was on the Republican ticket , and the Democratic candidate was both untested nationally and the first African - American to claim the nomination .
A significant misstep here or there and the winner could have been John McCain , the oldest man ever elected president .
My brothers and sisters in punditry spent a jolly Fourth of July weekend having a swell time with Palin and her decision to quit as governor of Alaska .
Her words were parsed for their meaning and her plans were deduced while political operatives of both parties analyzed her move to see if she is really very clever or as dumb as a mud wall .
A good time was had by all .
It would behoove us , though , to consider how close we all came to utter disaster -- the " counterfactual " suggested above .
A recent Vanity Fair article provides further evidence of just how awful a vice president ( or president ) Palin would have made .
During the campaign , she proved allergic to briefings and remained determined to stay uncorrupted by knowledge .
More recently , she explained her decision to -- permit me some GOP talk -- cut and run as Alaska governor by lapsing into no known language , explaining herself afterward in a burst of Tweets that only raised more questions .
One question , though , has been settled :
She is unfit for office .
What is most pertinent about Palin is that she was named to the GOP ticket -- a top - down choice by McCain .
This was the most reckless decision any national politician has made in the longest time , and while it certainly says something about McCain , it says even more about his party .
It 's lost its mind .
Recall , after all , that Palin was not McCain 's first choice .
That was either Joe Lieberman or Tom Ridge .
They were both rejected by the party itself because of their appalling moderation on social issues over which the president has little direct authority anyway -- abortion , above all -- and in Lieberman 's case because he had been a Democrat .
In desperation , McCain turned to Palin .
Was there a scream of protest ?
No .
Did the Republican Party demand to know of McCain what the hell he had done ?
Again , no .
Was it OK with the GOP if the person a heartbeat away from the presidency was -- pardon me , but it 's true -- a ditz with no national experience whatsoever ?
You betcha .
The party had cracked up , accepting a nullity because she was anti-abortion over a seasoned senator and former governor because they were not .
Ideology won .
The nation lost .
Almost as interesting as Palin is South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford .
Never mind his affair .
These things happen .
Concentrate instead on how he hid his affair -- by disappearing and calling attention to himself .
Note also that even before he somehow took the Appalachian Trail to Buenos Aires , he was renowned for rejecting federal stimulus money .
Before that , as a congressman , he claimed to have forsaken a housing allowance -- and a cot -- and said , " I sleep on the floor of my office . "
Most of us would consider this weird behavior .
In the GOP , it was seen as presidential timber .
Shall I go on ?
Newt Gingrich , another possible candidate , is the Old Faithful of the Grand Old Party , erupting on a regular basis .
He recently suggested that Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a racist because of her comment about the innate astuteness of a " wise Latina . "
He later apologized , but his hair trigger is well established .
This is the same Gingrich , you may recall , who threw a tantrum in 1995 when President Clinton seated him in the rear of Air Force One and then , with ingenious malice aforethought , failed to come back to chat .
As for the rest of the GOP candidates , all of them must be vetted by the party 's Grand Inquisitor , Rush Limbaugh , a belch from the gutter .
For Tina Fey , Sarah Palin was comedic material .
For the rest of us , she 's been a summer weekend 's diversion .
But when the chuckling is over , you have to ask yourself what in the world was she doing on the GOP ticket and what would have happened if McCain had won ?
Only part of this is alternate history .
The rest is frightening reality .

Noted horror writer Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in Providence on August 20 , 1890 .
A precocious child , he was reciting poetry at age two , reading at age three , and writing at age six or seven .
He became a published author at sixteen , by penning a monthly newspaper column on astronomy .
His interest in the weird was fostered by his grandfather , who entertained young Lovecraft with imaginative tales of the macabre .
In 1923 , the publication of Lovecraft 's short story , " Dagon , " marked the beginning of his career as a regular contributor to such popular pulp magazines as Weird Tales , Amazing Stories , Astounding Stories , and Tales of Magic & Mystery .
Many of Lovecraft 's tales take place in and around Providence and incorporate real locations that you can still visit today .
In particular , the short story " The Shunned House " and the novel The Case of Charles Dexter Ward rely on Providence history and scenery to propel their action .
On March 3 , 1924 , Lovecraft married Sonia Haft Greene , another writer , and lived with her briefly in Brooklyn , New York .
It seemed a good match , but the marriage ultimately succumbed to financial troubles , Sonia 's poor health , and the disapproval of Lovecraft 's surviving relatives .
In 1926 , Lovecraft returned alone to Providence , where he lived and wrote until his death from cancer of the intestine and kidney failure on March 15 , 1937 .
Lovecraft published only one book during his lifetime , a badly bound edition of The Shadow Over Innsmouth .
His work might well have faded into oblivion had not two of his friends and protégés , August Derleth and Donald Wandrei , founded Arkham House to collect and publish Lovecraft 's work .
In 1939 they issued The Outsider and Others , and many more titles followed over the ensuing years .
Today , due in large part to the efforts of Derleth and Wandrei , Lovecraft is known around the world as one of the greats of early horror and science fiction .
Laid to rest in Swan Point Cemetery , Lovecraft was listed , along with his parents , on the Phillips family monument , but that was n't enough for his fans .
So , in 1977 a group of interested individuals pitched in to buy him a headstone of his own .
They chose an unassuming block of granite , on which they had inscribed Lovecraft 's name , the dates of his birth and death , and the weighty phrase , " I AM PROVIDENCE , " a line from one of his personal letters .
A Sixty - Year Rest Disturbed
Although it is nearby , Lovecraft 's body does not actually lie beneath his donated headstone , a fact that was evidently unknown to the person or persons who , on the night of October 13 , 1997 , apparently tried to dig him up .
The hole was discovered on the morning of the 14th by a Swan Point security guard .
It was about three feet deep and the dirt at the bottom appeared to be undisturbed .
Did the diggers merely give up , or were they spooked ?
Other than the hole itself , the only evidence they left behind was a single footprint .
Once it was determined that no coffin or vault had been breached , police allowed cemetery workers to refill the hole .
Lovecraft was probably never in any real danger of being taken for a ride .
Even if the nocturnal excavators had been more resolute , and even if they had been in the right spot , they very likely would have been thwarted by the heavy lid of a concrete coffin liner .
Such lids weigh a couple of tons and require heavy machinery to lower them into place .
Getting Closer to the Master
The H.P. Lovecraft Commemorative Service
Some measure of Lovecraft 's continuing popularity may be gauged by the fact that enthusiasts of his work gather each year around the anniversary of his death .
See the sidebar below for a detailed look at this event by one of its organizers , Carl Johnson of the H.P. Lovecraft Commemorative Activities Committee .
Walking Tours
The Rhode Island Historical Society and Providence Preservation Society both occasionally conduct walking tours of Lovecraftian Providence , generally around Lovecraft 's birthday ( August 20 ) and Halloween ( October 31 ) .

The H.P. Lovecraft Commemorative Service
by Carl Johnson
Mock not the crows of Swan Point , for they are the guardians of those souls which here linger …
— Excerpted from the " eulogy " of the H.P. Lovecraft Commemorative Service .
As a tribute to the unique talent and literary contributions of H.P. Lovecraft , a commemorative service open to free public attendance is conducted annually at a location significant to H.P. Lovecraft 's life .
This service , since the first one held in 1987 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of H.P. Lovecraft 's passing , has become something of a Providence tradition .
For years the service was held at H.P.L.'s grave in Swan Point Cemetery , but the cemetery 's owners have recently become less open to such gatherings .
Since 2006 the service has instead taken place at the Ladd Observatory , 210 Doyle Avenue ( off Hope Street ) in Providence .
As part of the standard procedure at this affair , a eulogy encapsulating the author 's life is read , as well as a recitation of a poem by Providence resident Brett Rutherford , entitled , " At Lovecraft 's Grave . "
Attendees are also invited to participate by contributing their own readings of Mr. Lovecraft 's prose or poetry , as well as their personal reflections on the man himself .
Some come attired in vintage or Gothic style clothing .
Another common feature is a dramatic reading by an actor in character as " the Old Gent of Providence , " an appellation that Lovecraft sometimes used when signing his letters .
It has been noted that something out of the ordinary — even for this eldritch affair — always seems to occur at these tribute services , often involving a dramatic and unanticipated change in weather conditions .
To cite an example from the March 16 , 1998 , service , a burst of snow flurries fell while a dirge was sung by a pretty young lady clad in a black velvet cloak .
The sunshine then just as suddenly reappeared !
At the following year 's service , crows that had ominously gathered in the surrounding trees , seemingly to observe the assemblage , began loudly cawing as the lady 's singing commenced .
Also , inexplicable , vaporous distortions appear on some of the photographs taken during that service .
At the service conducted on April 2 , 2000 , surprisingly forceful wind gusts seemed cued to the readings of Lovecraft 's horror !
If this was n't sufficient , a seemingly disembodied " voice " once was detected in the playback of an audio recording made at Lovecraft 's final resting ( or , perhaps in his case , " resisting " ) place .
Although he prided himself on his implacable sense of the rational , relying on scientific observation to interpret the world around him and disavowing any belief in things supernatural , maybe Mr. Lovecraft was in his own way letting us know of his bemusement at all the commotion concerning him , by augmenting the proceedings .
But that is mere speculation , and of a decidedly " unscientific " nature .
Check Quahog.org 's events calendar for the next H.P. Lovecraft Commemorative Service .
It usually takes place at 3 pm on a Sunday in March at the Ladd Observatory ( 1891 ) , 210 Doyle Avenue , Providence .
For further information concerning this event , as well as future projects such as lectures , walking tours , and dramatic performances organized by the H.P. Lovecraft Commemorative Activities Committee , please call ( 401 ) 732-4870 , or email ConstableCJ@Hotmail.com .
Carl Johnson is a part - time actor and native of Rhode Island with blood ties ( through his mother ) to both Roger Williams and H.P. Lovecraft .
In 1988 and 1991 he had the privilege of portraying the Old Gent of Providence in Night Gaunts , a play by poet Brett Rutherford .

On MSNBC’s The Ed Show tonight Donny Deutsch was supposed to be on to talk about the future sales of Michael Jackson ’s music , but that was tossed aside as , Deutsch said , “ I think as a country we have lost our minds a little bit … People who are crying in the streets who do n’t know him , they need to maybe get a little bit of a life . ”
Check out the video .
Here is the video :
Advertisements
Deutsch said , “ Before I get to business , I want to first my condolences to the Jackson family , particularly those kids , watching that daughter as a dad your heart breaks .
Having said that and it ’s a loss , I think as a country , we ’ve lost our minds a little bit …
He was a wonderful singer and dancer but this deification . ”
He later continued , “ This man was a wonderful singer and dancer that ’s what he was .
He brought music to us , but I would have thought that I was watching one of the great world leaders of all time , and I think as a country we have lost our way a little bit .
It ’s a tragic loss for his family but the millions of other people that it ’s a loss in their lives , I am struggling a little bit , and I do n’t want to be the cold hearted guy because I am a dad .
His children , my heart goes out to them , but he sang and he danced .
Have I lost my way here ? ”
Deutsch was n’t done yet , “ His family my heart goes out , but people were crying in the streets who do n’t know him , they maybe need to get a little bit of a life …
I think the soul of this country , we have lost our way a little bit , beyond the sorrow I was feeling for his family members , particularly his children , I cried when I listened to his daughter , but as far as we as a country deifying this man , with the way people give their lives , but we have lost our way as country and nobody will say it .
There are heroes giving their lives for this country , and we in the media stand by , and yes he was an amazing singer and a dancer .
That ’s what he was , a singer and a dancer . ”
As if to prove Deutsch ’s point , Schultz ’s next guest compared Jackson to Jesus :
Tricia Rose of Brown University said , “ To say he was just a singer and a dancer is like saying Michelangelo was a just a painter or Shakespeare was just a playwright .
I mean we could make the claim that Jesus was just a carpenter , but that would only make sense if we do n’t understand the power of the individual to create a spiritual connection . ”
Deutsch does have a valid point , in that the media has gone way overboard with the Jackson coverage .
He is being treated like a head of state .
He was just a singer and a dancer .
He was a pop culture icon , but not a transformational world figure .
People are n’t spiritually connected to Jackson himself , but are connected to his music .
People are mourning Jackson because he represented a connection to their youth , not because he was a great man .
If anyone needed any more evidence of how out of control the media ’s Michael Jackson coverage has gotten , The Ed Show dedicated exactly 9 minutes to political coverage tonight .
I am not saying that they should have ignored the story , but they could have spent more than 9 minutes on politics .
Jackson ’s has been big ratings for the cable news networks , and MSNBC is trying to squeeze every last penny out of the story .

The closest most of us ' round here will ever get to outer space is blogging about the Lunar X Prize , so our inner astronauts get rather giddy any time an amateur makes it to the cusp of the gravity well .
The above photos were taken by the Meteotek team , a teacher and his four students from the IES La Bisbal school in Catalonia , Spain .
The group designed and launched a balloon kitted out with a Nikon Coolpix and custom built electronics , intending to get some shots at 30,000 feet .
Well exceeding their expectations , the $ 80 digicam ( held aloft by a $ 60 latex balloon ) reached over 100,000 feet , at which point it lost inflation and fell to the earth .
The Church of Scientology has had a bad couple of years , PR - wise .
You could start the damage - control clock running in January 2008 with the release of the Scientology indoctrination video featuring Tom Cruise -- you know , black turtleneck , eyes spinning -- claiming that Scientologists are the only ones who could really help at an accident scene .
This summer the church was tried for fraud in France .
In May , Wikipedia said it would ban entries originating from Scientology IP addresses on account of the church ’s self - serving wiki - revisionism .
And last month the St. Petersburg Times published a devastating four - part expose of Scientology ’s tiny tyrant David Miscavige , based on testimony from four former high - ranking executives in the church .
Then there was last week ’s Katie Holmes “ homage ” to Judy Garland on “ Dancing With the Stars . ”
Talk about the scene of an accident .
All of which has left the church with a smoldering crater where its public image ought to be .
And yet , the church did n’t get to be La-La Land ’s Holy See for nothing .
In May the church launched a series of new commercials , and they are nothing short of brilliant .
Sleek , chill and nonthreatening , these ads are visually beautiful , with a kind of tonal waveform of celestial bliss that invites fellow questers on a journey of self - discovery .
“ Scientology : Know yourself .
Know life , ” the tag line runs .
Well , who would n’t want a piece of that ?
The pleasure of these ads derives from their glossy cinematic execution , of course -- the cerulean monotones , the exquisite jib camera work , the husky , hunky voice - over , the tranquil soundtrack ( think U2 jamming with Vangelis ) .
Advertisement
But it also must be noted that , finally and surprisingly , the church with the greatest affinity for and proximity to Hollywood has finally turned up a decent branding spot .
I mean , these are the people of the exploding volcano .
If these spots were produced in - house , somebody ’s thetan deserves a case of beer or something .
To be clear , I ’m no fan of Scientology , and what I ’ve read of its cosmology -- the whole tale of Xenu -- sounds like a rejected “ Star Trek ” script to me .
Still , I kind of love these ads , or at least their perfect cynicism .
Consider the spot titled “ Truth . ”
Over a series of close - ups of gorgeous young faces , the copy reads : “ You are not your name , you ’re not your job , you ’re not the clothes you wear or the neighborhood you live in .
. . . not your fears , your failures or your past .
You are hope , you are imagination .
You are the power to change .
. . .
You are a spirit that will never die .
. . .
You will rise again . ”
In terms of marketing a religion , this ad has a proven winner of a message .
It is a direct co-opting of Christianity ’s language of resurrection and eternal life -- which is of a slightly different spiritual chemistry than Scientology ’s usual promise of millions of reincarnations .
In a stroke , Scientology positions itself as Mac in the Mac - versus - PC rivalry .
Advertisement
Another spot begins : “ We ’re all looking for it . . . . " Again , a series of quick cuts of young people who seem to have been drafted out of the Ford modeling catalog .
“ Some of us have been looking for it our whole lives .
Some think they can buy it , some think they can wear it .
Some travel the world in search of it .
. . . "
Here there are shots of people doing amazing things , cave - diving , mountain climbing , which seem to be counterposed to suggest vain and misguided attempts at self - fulfillment .
“ Most do n’t even know what they are looking for .
But we all feel it , that aching desire , that unexplainable emptiness that can only be filled by one thing .
. . . "
A woman standing looking in awe at a star - filled firmament .
" . . .
The Truth . ”
Awesome , with an emphasis on “ awe . ”
These are virtuoso pieces , tremendously appealing and remarkably shrewd .
For instance , nowhere in any of the three spots does the church take a defensive stance or refer to any boiling controversy around Scientology .
Advertisement
That would violate the first rule of advertising , which is : Never mention your competition .
Nor do the ads bother to associate themselves with any of the oddball trappings of the actual practice of Scientology -- no auditing or e-meters and absolutely no discussion of Xenu - focused back story , which simply cannot pass the laugh test in public discourse as far as I ’m concerned .
And yet , as splendid as these spots are , I do have a couple of questions :
What if you ’re not good - looking ?
Nearly everyone in these ads is pretty , handsome or better .
And some of these dewy , dreamy creatures are downright distracting , they are so beautiful .
Does Scientology offer hope to the plain ?
What about the homely ?
Or should they stick with Catholicism ?
I ’d also note that almost everyone in these ads is under 30 .
Now , reasonably , this is an age group that is more susceptible to the message , still searching , still curious , still credulous .
However , it is also much less likely to be affluent .
If money was important to my client -- and money , it seems , is truly the dark matter that binds Scientology ’s universe -- I ’d pitch to an older and better - heeled crowd .
Advertisement
These ads might recruit only an anguished army of baristas and part - time shoe clerks .
Lastly , judging from these ads , Scientology does n’t seem to have anything to offer those who are actually at peace with themselves and the universe .
You know , sometimes people investigate faiths out of a sense of curiosity and wonder , not because they hate their job or tend to sabotage their relationships .
It seems to me the Scientology ads leave a lot of conquest sales on the table .

Take a close look at the coins in your pocket - they could be worth a lot more than you think !
A recently released batch of 20 p coins have a fault on them which could make them worth £ 50 each .
The special coins were accidentally put out without a date on them after a mix - up in a recent redesign , which makes them valuable to coin collectors .
A coin company is offering the first 10,000 people to contact them with a faulty coin £ 50 .
The coins were meant to have dates on them , but a redesign of the 20 p last year went a bit wrong .
The date used to be on the tails side of the coin , but was shifted over to the heads side .
However , a batch of coins was made using the mould with the old heads side and the new tails side , meaning neither has a date .
It 's the first time that 's happened since 1672 !

Summary of all the forecasts ( figures are in mbpd ) as well as the last EIA estimates .
1 Productive capacities .
2MASE value for March 2009 , the value in bold indicates the best forecast ( i.e. the oldest with the lowest error ) .
Are We There Yet ?
M0 : The oil production will continue to grow with the world population at a constant rate of 4.3 barrels per capita .
M1 : The production will fall according to the average peak oil forecast .
Fig. 8 - Likelihood ratio ( M1/M0 ) at the left and Statistical significance of observed production levels according to M0 ( the red circle is March 2009 ) .
The following results are based on a linear or non-linear fit of a parametric curve ( most often a Logistic curve ) directly on the observed production profile :
It is difficult to compare forecasts because they deal with different liquid category and have different baseline .
The forecasts were evaluated using the Mean Asolute Scaled Error ( MASE ) proposed by Hyndman and Koehler [ 1 ] .
A good forecast will have a MASE value less than 1 ( i.e. better performance than a simple naive forecast ) .
We can notice than some MASE curves are decreasing with time indicating that their predicted values are getting more accurate further in time .
We can consider two competitive models for the crude oil + NGL production :
These two models are represented as a magenta and a yellow area on the top figure of this post .
According to the M0 model , the current fall in production levels for March 2009 is 0.004 significant .
However lower deviations were observed in the late 90s and in 2001 ( there were previously 16 months with larger deviations since 1990 ) .
The likelihood ratio between the two models has significantly increased above 3 indicating than the M1 model is more stronly supported by the recent production levels than the M0 model which was not the case before 2009 .

OMG , not another electrical gadget at home … where do I plug it … too many extension cords , wires , plugs , hassles !
Does this thought often bog you down ?
It did bother designer Ashley too much , since she resides in a Victorian house where wiring and plugs have n’t been changed for more than 70 years !
Instead of cribbing , she mulled and came up with the AllSocket Power Track and AllPlugs .
Now she has the perfect solution for us …see her demo it for us after the break .
The Power Track integrates the electrical wiring into a skirting board or a similar wall panel .
‘ AllPlugs ’ replace conventional electrical plugs , then simply slot into the distribution system anywhere around the perimeter of the room , giving you access to power wherever it is required .
AllPlugs are environmentally friendly , with options that allow users to turn the power off to one or several appliances at a time , by either a flick of one conveniently placed wireless wall switch , or automatically by smart plugs which detect standby states .
AllSocket Power Track System and AllPlugs is a James Dyson entry , you can vote for it here :

Fiscal Q1 sales figures hit the net recently , and the results show PlayStation 3 may be closing the gap .
Microsoft sold 1.2 million Xbox 360 while Sony‘s PS3 sold 1.1 million consoles in the same time period .
On face value this appears that Microsoft is still besting Sony for yet another fiscal quarter , but this may be short sighted , considering Sony ’s momentum .
The Xbox 360 offers three different versions of their console .
The arcade which retails for $ 199 , the Pro which retails for $ 299 , and the Elite which retails for $ 399 .
On the flip side Sony offers two versions of it ’s shiny black console .
The 80GB version which retails for $ 399 , and the 160GB version which retails for $ 499 .
Generally speaking , it is a foregone conclusion that in this struggling economy , the more expensive console is the harder sell .
It is unlikely that every Xbox 360 sold was the Elite version and simple math will reveal that Sony ’s higher priced offerings commanded more revenues .
How is it that with a price as low as $ 199 the Xbox 360 only managed to outsell the $ 399 PS3 by a mere 100,000 consoles ?
This goes to show that the battle for the hearts of core game players is still very much anyone ’s ball game .
It ’s only a matter of time before Sony lowers the cost of its technical masterpiece , which will spur even higher sales .
PlayStation 3 overall sales lag Xbox 360 by just under 8 million units , even with Microsoft ’s year long head start .
It may be that $ 299 is the magical price point to really keep the momentum going and the install base expanding .
The real winner here is Sony , who has driven more revenue , while selling 100,000 less consoles than its closest competitor .
Profit on the other hand , is a different story , since Sony is allegedly still losing money on every console sold .
Sony has already lowered some of the manufacturing costs with more changes in the pipeline .
Once they lower the price , there is no stopping the PlayStation 3 .

PADUCAH , Kentucky ( CNN ) --
He arrives in the early morning hours , when the downtown streets here are empty and quiet .
Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl .
An electric gate jerks to life as the black sedan with tinted windows pulls into a parking lot protected by an iron fence .
It 's five blocks from the local county jail to the U.S. Federal Courthouse of Western Kentucky .
Not even a five - minute drive .
This is the only freedom Steven Green knows .
He 's ushered from the car by a contingent of U.S. marshals .
It 's 30 feet out in the open air .
A brief chance to look up at the clouds .
A moment to hear sounds not reverberated against cell walls : a bird , a car engine , a breeze in nearby trees .
He is a lanky 24 - year - old .
He looks lean , like he could grow a little more .
Not really a man , but too old to be called a boy .
Regardless , he is a convicted murderer , rapist , and conspirator .
The orange prison coveralls make him look a bit taller .
The jury never sees Green in the fluorescent jumpsuit .
Inside the federal courthouse there is a change of clothes .
Usually it 's a button - down shirt and a pair of khakis .
He keeps his cuffs buttoned .
He looks nerdish , and you half expect him to start working on the courtroom computers .
Not like a man who once asked FBI agents if they thought he was " a monster . "
Evidence comes in a steady display of pictures and videos that seem oddly connected .
The snapshot of a smiling woman lying in a field of bluebonnets .
The image of a dead Iraqi strapped to the hood of an Army Humvee .
A high school yearbook photo of a Texas football team .
The diagram of a brain cell .
Video of a firefight shot from an insurgent perspective .
The most unusual trial exhibit sits against the wall behind the prosecutor 's table : a small architectural mock - up of a home .
Roughly 18 by 18 inches , it is like no home in Kentucky .
A flat - topped square with a raised rectangular structure at the top providing access to the roof .
It is beige in color .
The tiny windows have tiny bars .
It is a 3 - D map of a crime scene .
Earlier this month , a jury found Green guilty of a raping a 14 - year - old girl who lived in the home in Iraq , then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence .
Green also was found guilty of killing the girl 's parents and 6 - year - old sister .
There is a casual manner to Steven Green 's daily entrance into the courtroom .
It defies the circumstances of the moment and the imagination without proper context .
This is the sentencing phase of his death penalty trial and he is the defendant .
Testimony resumes Monday , with the expectation of closing arguments as early as Wednesday .
Green faces life in prison without the possibility of parole , or death in prison .
The testimony transports the court to unusual places : across Texas following Green 's dysfunctional childhood , into the sense of structure and order of Army basic training at Fort Benning , Georgia , and back to the chaos of horrendous combat situations four years ago in Iraq 's Triangle of Death .
Green is a former member of the 101st Airborne Division , inserted into a very bad section of Iraq during some of the worst fighting of the war .
His memories are of a place known as Yusufiya , 20 miles south of Baghdad .
Jurors form a mental picture of his life then as former members of his unit , Bravo Company , take the stand .
Amid the military lingo , the witnesses pause occasionally , struggling to convey the contempt , confusion , exhaustion , and death they knew .
They speak of being shot , of killings , booby traps and sudden bloody dismemberments .
This toxic emotional mix is what former Pfc. Green knew in 2005 and 2006 almost every day , along with the very real possibility of his own death .
If the jury opts for its most extreme option -- the death penalty -- unlike his daily death watch in Iraq , at least Green will see that coming .
When a friend or family member enters the courtroom , Green tries to make anxious eye contact .
He whispers a lot to his attorneys .
His hands stay around his face and his gaze on the table when the victims ' family speak through an interpreter .
The Al - Janabis ' relatives do not speak of details of the crime .
The questions come only from the prosecution , and the defense does not cross-examine .
They speak of an orchard worker , Kassem , and his wife , Fakhriya .
They speak of a simple family who did not own either their home or the furniture .
They speak of a funny 6 - year - old girl , Hadeel , being chased through the orchard trees by siblings .
They speak of a 14 - year - old girl , Abeer , with dreams of living in the city and wearing nice clothes .
The jury never hears the words " rape " or " murder " come from the translation .
It is a testimony about loss .
The defendant sits rigid the entire time .
The mention of other names comes frequently in court .
Spc. James Barker :
The jury knows him as the soldier who concocted a plan over a card game to target the Al - Janabi family -- a mission of gang - rape and murder .
Sgt. Paul Cortez :
The defense counsel describes him as senior non-commissioned officer , the one who approved the mission as long as he was the first to rape Abeer .
Pfc. Jesse Spielman :
His name is familiar as the fourth member of the squad to leave their traffic checkpoint on March 12 , 2006 , after donning disguises , and enter the Al - Janabi home .
Pfc. Bryan Howard is the soldier left behind to guard their post .
Each is out of the Army , sentenced to prison time by a military court for his part in the crime and the failed coverup .
Green , the trigger man , is the odd man out .
He sits before the jury , convicted in civil court for this war atrocity .
His early release from the Army two months after the crime is a possible death sentence , while three of his accomplices face the possibility of parole from an Army prison in 2016 .
Green still sports a military haircut .
Seated at the table alongside his defense team , he often leans over and speaks with Darren Wolff , a former Marine Corps captain turned Kentucky defense lawyer .
There are letters on file in the court docket from Wolff petitioning Defense Secretary Robert Gates to re-enlist Green in the Army , so the former private could face trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
It is not unheard of in this war .
Wolff points out in conversation that the Pentagon re-activated two former Marines after word surfaced of an alleged murder in Falluja in 2004 .
He says Green should face a jury of his military peers .
The fact that has not happened , and the former Army private sits in the U.S. District Court of Western Kentucky tried under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction
Act for crimes committed in Iraq , may be a point of appeal .
At the end of the day , Green exits the courtroom , climbs back into his prison garb and is shackled .
There 's another short walk to the car , then a five - block return drive to take in the world .
He returns to solitary confinement .
This is his human interaction for the day .

Move over , silicon — it may be time to give the Valley a new name .
Physicists at the Department of Energy 's ( DOE ) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have confirmed the existence of a type of material that could one day provide dramatically faster , more efficient computer chips .
Recently - predicted and much - sought , the material allows electrons on its surface to travel with no loss of energy at room temperatures and can be fabricated using existing semiconductor technologies .
Such material could provide a leap in microchip speeds , and even become the bedrock of an entirely new kind of computing industry based on spintronics , the next evolution of electronics .
Physicists Yulin Chen , Zhi-Xun Shen and their colleagues tested the behavior of electrons in the compound bismuth telluride .
The results , published online June 11 in Science Express , show a clear signature of what is called a topological insulator , a material that enables the free flow of electrons across its surface with no loss of energy .
The discovery was the result of teamwork between theoretical and experimental physicists at the Stanford Institute for Materials & Energy Science , a joint SLAC - Stanford institute .
In recent months , SIMES theorist Shoucheng Zhang and colleagues predicted that several bismuth and antimony compounds would act as topological insulators at room - temperature .
The new paper confirms that prediction in bismuth telluride .
" The working style of SIMES is perfect , " Chen said .
" Theorists , experimentalists , and sample growers can collaborate in a broad sense . "
The experimenters examined bismuth telluride samples using X - rays from the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at SLAC and the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
When Chen and his colleagues investigated the electrons ' behavior , they saw the clear signature of a topological insulator .
Not only that , the group discovered that the reality of bismuth telluride was even better than theory .
" The theorists were very close , " Chen said , " but there was a quantitative difference . "
The experiments showed that bismuth telluride could tolerate even higher temperatures than theorists had predicted .
" This means that the material is closer to application than we thought , " Chen said .
This magic is possible thanks to surprisingly well - behaved electrons .
The quantum spin of each electron is aligned with the electron 's motion — a phenomenon called the quantum spin Hall effect .
This alignment is a key component in creating spintronics devices , new kinds of devices that go beyond standard electronics .
" When you hit something , there 's usually scattering , some possibility of bouncing back , " explained theorist Xiaoliang Qi .
" But the quantum spin Hall effect means that you can't reflect to exactly the reverse path . "
As a dramatic consequence , electrons flow without resistance .
Put a voltage on a topological insulator , and this special spin current will flow without heating the material or dissipating .
Topological insulators are n't conventional superconductors nor fodder for super - efficient power lines , as they can only carry small currents , but they could pave the way for a paradigm shift in microchip development .
" This could lead to new applications of spintronics , or using the electron spin to carry information , " Qi said .
" Whether or not it can build better wires , I 'm optimistic it can lead to new devices , transistors , and spintronics devices . "
Fortunately for real - world applications , bismuth telluride is fairly simple to grow and work with .
Chen said , " It 's a three - dimensional material , so it 's easy to fabricate with the current mature semiconductor technology .
It 's also easy to dope — you can tune the properties relatively easily . "
" This is already a very exciting thing , " he said , adding that the material " could let us make a device with new operating principles . "
The high quality bismuth telluride samples were grown at SIMES by James Analytis , Ian Fisher and colleagues .
SIMES , the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at SLAC , and the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are supported by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences within the DOE Office of Science .
B - 52 carries a heavy visage amidst the talk of an audit of the Federal Reserve .
Inside we have a short clip from TechTicker and Aaron Task who interviewed Congressman Alan Grayson yesterday about his very popular youtube video showing an extreme lack of oversight at the Federal Reserve .
According to Grayson , that video has helped dramatically to convince certain Congressional members to demand more transparency from the Fed .
He also discusses the status of H.R. 1207 , Ron Paul 's bill to audit the Federal Reserve .
Video is courtesy of TechTicker .
From Reuters :
One of the featured speakers at today 's Big Picture conference ( which was largely coordinated by TBM columnist Marion Maneker ) was freshman Congressman Alan Grayson , who represents Orlando 's district in Florida .
Grayson is an interesting character ; he came to prominence suing the government for military contracting fraud , which earned him this 2007 Vanity Fair profile .
( He has since abandoned the beard . )
Grayson appeared on a panel with Nassim Taleb , best known as the author of The Black Swan .
Their exchange about the proper role of government regulation of the financial system was entertaining , if a bit meandering .
Grayson , who grew up in the Bronx and holds three Harvard degrees , has a rare ability to say relatively radical things without coming off as a rabid populist .
Moderator Barry Ritholtz , author of the just - published Bailout Nation , asked a straightforward question :
The U.S. government does a reasonably good job of regulating things like the safety of airplanes and foods .
Why , then , does it do such a lousy job of regulating the financial system ?
Grayson 's answer was immediate and succinct : " Capture . "
For those not up on regulatory theory , this refers to the notion that regulators become captive of the industries they regulate .
Noting that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spent $ 100 million on campaign contributions over the last 10 years , Grayson said : " The system is in some sense corrupt .
A senator said the other day that Wall Street owns Washington , and while I might not go that far , you do n't have the airlines ‘ owning ' the [ airline regulators ] .
There is a lot of influence that Wall Street has on the government , even the judicial branch . "
Indeed , Grayson could have cited the front - page story in today 's Wall Street Journal , documenting the remarkable efficiency with which banking campaign contributions appear to have helped ease accounting rules that in turn helped the banks .
Grayson even hinted that there are powers in Washington that would like him and the Financial Services Committee to trim their investigations somewhat .
Referring to a hearing scheduled for this afternoon about how Fannie and Freddie went awry , Grayson said : " We 're getting instructions from on high saying , ‘ Do n't dwell on the past . ' "
Taleb later remarked that while Grayson had laudable views about the proper role of government , he was almost certainly " a little lonely " in Washington .
But one of the most intriguing aspects of Grayson is how effectively he has been able to get his message out on YouTube , updating a tactic used by Republicans in the early ‘ 80s .
When C- SPAN first came around , GOP rebels realized they could get great play by giving rabid speeches on the House floor in the middle of the night .
It did n't matter if literally no one was listening to them in the chamber ; cable would get the word out .
Similarly , Grayson usually gets a couple of minutes in any given hearing to ask his questions , and he puts the video version out on YouTube , where he comes off as a crusader .
A journey of faith is a pilgrimage .
It is not standing still , but moving to new places with new perspectives .
It involves making changes in believing , belonging and behaving .
As a teenager I made the transition from the unbelief of my parents to journey into faith .
I liked the sense of belonging not only to my own parish church community , but also the wider community of Anglicans .
I was challenged in various ways about choices and behaviours for one who had made a Christian commitment .
I sought to understand , in order to be able to explain to others , the doctrines I was taught .
During more than 40 years of believing , belonging and behaving in the Anglican tradition , it was the theology that I found the most difficult .
I questioned , explored , doubted , and looked for explanations that satisfied me .
In the end , it was my failure to find that satisfaction , and other people 's behaviour , that caused me to look elsewhere for the next stage of my journey in faith .
I moved to the Quakers .
The open , accepting attitude which is typical of belonging to most Quaker meetings is heartwarming , refreshing and unusual among faith communities .
Quakers are often prepared to accept ex-offenders ( with appropriate safeguards ) at meetings , and help them rebuild their lives ; most accept and celebrate committed relationships – including second marriages and same - sex relationships .
Quakers are strong too on behaving .
Quaker testimonies to peace , simplicity , equality , integrity , to the sustainable environment , and a concern for people who are poor , treated unjustly or vulnerable , are daily lived out by Quakers .
Quakers are less clear about believing , with a traditional refusal to have a creed that all members must subscribe to .
The community coheres around a common tradition and way of doing things rather than a common way of describing beliefs : orthopraxy rather than orthodoxy .
While some British Quakers have a concept of the divine which is close to the classical orthodoxy of Christian tradition , many have difficulty in agreeing the words that adequately describe their experience of the numinous .
Christ is the divine saviour for some , whereas perhaps the majority of British Quakers value Jesus as an inspiring teacher , an outstanding prophet , and source of the values that characterise the Quaker way .
Quakers deeply value the experience of inspiration , insight , discernment , and shared experience of " the divine " we find in regular sharing in largely silent worship , interspersed with ministry from any person who feels drawn to speak .
The Quaker community is one in which I have been able to continue my journey of faith without the burden experienced by many in other churches who search beyond the bounds of a narrow orthodoxy .
So many such searchers have been criticised , ostracised or silenced by those who feel threatened by their readiness to explore radical concepts .
Quakerism , which emerged as a Christian reform movement at the end of the Reformation , sought to shed the accretions of formal practice , abstract theology and hierarchical abuse in the churches of 17th - century England .
Nowadays British Quakerism has a considerable contribution to make in different forms of practical service , whether in the criminal justice system , international peace work , or creative spiritual exploration .
I am grateful to have found a community of faith that can accept that my journey may be different from others , but is supportive , accepting , and open to fresh ideas – from whatever source .
In my theology , my spirituality and my attitudes and relationships , I am in a different place on my journey from where I was five or 10 years ago .
I expect to have moved on , in ways I cannot anticipate , in the next five or 10 years .
I am very glad to have a found the Quaker community in which that is understood , accepted and indeed encouraged .

" Single - payer is the health system that works for every other industrialized nation on earth . "
By Sylvia Hampton
Supporters of real health care reform want a national expansion of the popular Medicare single payer program now covering every American over age 65 .
But they are being told that it is just not “ politically feasible . ”
When one asks “ Why ? ” there is double talk and a run-around .
The facts are clear .
Oxen will be gored -- and the industry and some in Congress are circling the wagons to protect their own self interests .
We have some blatant conflicts of interest here that would make an eight - year - old blush : Congress members who have stock holdings in the industry and get large campaign contributions from insurers .
Imagine that .
The insurance industry competes by selling large group insurance to businesses employing young healthy people .
Ca-ching !
They get those contracts by promising low cost to the employer , so the employee “ contribution ” becomes a pay deduction .
Then if an employee gets sick or in an accident , his co-pays can become so large as to cause him to go bankrupt .
But hey --- no skin off the insurance company ’s nose !
Ca-ching .
If the sickness or injury is bad enough to lose your job they do n’t have to mess with you anymore .
They just drop you if you live long enough ( after they do everything in their power to deny the claims . )
After all , they have stockholders to think about --- they must , by law , make a profit .
Ca-ching .
And because the drug companies do n’t want to have to negotiate with the big bad government on prices , they stick with the captains of this industry like two peas in a private money pot .
That ’s what makes health insurance hooked to employment so darn great - - for insurers .
The result is that they have so much money they can scare the pants off everyone in government .
They will run an ad campaign so slick a good guy will look like Satan when they are done .
Who gets the money for all those campaigns to sell insurance , sell drugs , sell the negative campaign ads ?
The Media .
Ca-ching .
So do n’t ask them to help you gore that ox .
That money talks --- big time .
Single - payer is the health system that works for every other industrialized nation on Earth .
Single - payer results in health statistics better than ours , costs the people far less than ours , and at the same time covers everyone in their country .
But it was not given consideration in Congress and is deemed an evil communist plot by 30 % of our population .
The other 70 % have caught on after hard knocks in our system and now support single payer / Medicare for all .
But that is not even what the president is asking for ; he just wants a “ public option ” in addition to the private plans .
But no , the industry says that is not fair .
Why ?
Too many employers and workers will grab it in a heartbeat .
Why ?
Better , cheaper , faster , nicer and more complete --- like what all of us over 65 have and love : Medicare .
The modern robber barons are throwing so much money and weight around Washington D.C. right now that you ordinary people out here in the real world do n’t have a chance .
There is only one way you young ‘uns will get what I have -- and that is to take to the streets and demand it .
Call your congressman , demonstrate in the street by his office , call the talk shows , and scream bloody murder .
Because murder is what is happening to you right now .
They are killing you .
But as long as insurers , drug companies and legislators make a profit and you do n’t pay attention , their life goes on .

People who bought Orwell 's 1984 and Animal Farm for their Kindle were surprised to discover that it had disappeared from their devices overnight .
It turns out the publisher changed its mind about offering an electronic version , and Amazon caved into their demand to sneak into people 's electronic libraries and take back the book at the publisher 's request .
From Pogue 's Posts :
This is ugly for all kinds of reasons .
Amazon says that this sort of thing is " rare , " but that it can happen at all is unsettling ; we 've been taught to believe that e-books are , you know , just like books , only better .
Already , we 've learned that they 're not really like books , in that once we 're finished reading them , we can't resell or even donate them .
But now we learn that all sales may not even be final .
As one of my readers noted , it 's like Barnes & Noble sneaking into our homes in the middle of the night , taking some books that we 've been reading off our nightstands , and leaving us a check on the coffee table .
This kind of bullshit will encourage readers to visit Web sites in countries where the copyright has expired on Orwell 's books so they can get free un-stealable electronic copies .
Some E-Books Are More Equal Than Others

Groups of ethnic Han Chinese have marched through the city of Urumqi carrying clubs and machetes , as tension grows between ethnic groups and police .
Earlier , Uighur women had rallied against the arrest of more than 1,400 people over deadly clashes on Sunday .
A Bethlehem man whose sexual assault victim later faced a $ 400 charge for missing school was sentenced today to at least 90 days in Northampton County Prison .
Osvaldo Correa , 48 , of the 2800 block of Fairview Street asked Judge Kimberly McFadden for " an opportunity to show you and the community " that he would n't offend again .
Correa 's wife and three children wept as McFadden sentenced Correa to up to two years in prison .
Correa was also ordered to pay $ 3,900 , the victims ' family 's cost to move out of Correa 's neighborhood .
Correa repeatedly kissed and hugged a Liberty High School ninth - grader on Sept. 14 and told her he wanted to be a father to her and that " what happens here , nobody needs to know but us . "
He pleaded guilty to indecent assault on April 16 .
The victim repeatedly missed school after the assault and failed several classes .
The Bethlehem Area School District imposed a charge for summer school , the victim 's mother told the Express - Times earlier this week .
The mother , in tears , told McFadden today her daughter remains distraught .
After an earlier sentencing was postponed , the mother said , the victim , who is now 16 , " spent three days in bed , saying , ' Mommy , this is never going to go away . ' "
McFadden assured her help is available .

One of the things people tend to forget when posting pictures and personal information online is that a lot of it is only a short Internet search away from their current or potential employers ( not to mention their parents ) .
It has now become standard procedure for many employers to sit down with Google and cyberstalk potential employees , while the more savvy hunt down Facebook profiles and Twitter feeds .
The city of Bozeman Montana , however , has decided that all of that is too much work — it 's now requesting that potential employees hand over the login credentials for any social networking sites they frequent .
Background checks are standard procedure for many jobs , as it allows employers to identify problematic legal histories and things of that nature .
Bozeman is no exception , as it uses a waiver form to obtain an applicant 's consent to use their Social Security and driver 's license numbers to dig into their past .
But the form is notable in that about a third of area that needs to be filled out by an applicant is devoted to website information .
" Please list any and all , current personal or business websites , web pages or memberships on any Internet - based chat rooms , social clubs or forums , to include , but not limited to : Facebook , Google , Yahoo , YouTube.com , MySpace , etc. " the form reads .
But Bozeman is n't simply interested in finding out where to look for potentially embarrassing personal details ; the city wants full disclosure , since the form demands username and password information for each .
City employees will apparently be able to dig through any information applicants have put online , regardless of whether it 's accessible to the public .
This is especially ironic given that Bozeman 's website has an extensive privacy policy that indicates a significant familiarity with some of the major issues that have cropped up regarding the retention and security of information entrusted to websites .
This actually goes well beyond a startling invasion of privacy in a state that has a reputation for a strong independent streak ; it provides a serious risk of running afoul of employment law .
Employers are typically prohibited from digging into an applicant 's ethnic or religious background .
An Internet search already runs the risk of picking up photos or text that can reveal these sorts of details ; opening a person 's social networking accounts would seem to make the discovery of these details almost inevitable .
A local news station spoke to Bozeman 's attorney and asked about the potential for problems of this sort .
The city 's answer ?
Trust us !
" One thing that 's important for folks to understand about what we look for is none of the things that the federal constitution lists as protected things , we do n't use those , " said attorney Greg Sullivan .
The interviewer was wise enough to point out that there were far less invasive ways of obtaining access to some of this information , such as having Bozeman open its own Facebook account , at which point Sullivan apparently said that might be worth looking into .
It 's probably safer to ascribe this sort of behavior to cluelessness rather than malice .
But the cluelessness is apparently a two - way street , as Sullivan indicated that nobody has objected to the city 's request for login credentials .
Photo Gallery Is Anybody Out There ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Definitely not , says Frank Drake , the man behind the SETI Projects .
In an interview with SPIEGEL ONLINE , the US astronomer spoke of the search for aliens and why they are so elusive .
Even if you can find something you want to watch , television is generally a waste of time .
Approximately 20 minutes out of every hour is commercials , so when you watch 3 hours of television , you actually are watching 2 hours of your show and 1 hour of commercials .
Here are a few ideas to make watching television more productive .
( It sounds funny reading that . )
Do n’t Channel Surf
If there is a show you want to watch , then watch that show .
Jumping from channel to channel can eat up huge amounts of time without actually watching anything .
Think in terms of having a complete experience : a start , a middle , and an end .
If you simply jump from channel to channel you are n’t really having any type of experience –you are just killing time and should probably do something else .
Watch Movies Instead of Television
Movies usually have had much more thought put into them .
So in general , the quality of your entertainment is higher watching movies than watching television .
Watching movies also frees you from getting addicted to watching a particular series each week .
Netflix and Blockbuster
The ability to have DVDs delivered to your home is a great way to take advantage of movies .
You ’ll usually pay much less than you would for cable and be in complete control of when and what you watch .
In fact , you could probably subscribe to Netflix and Blockbuster for less than what a decent cable package would cost .
DVD of Television Shows
If you want to watch a television show , consider getting a DVD set after the series is complete .
The downside is that you ca n’t discuss the latest episode of Lost or Heroes with your friends at work .
The upside is that you can control when you watch it and there are no commercials .
Tivo
A Tivo is another way to handle skipping the commercials and give yourself control of when you watch television .
However , it is easy to watch a bunch of stuff that you would n’t normally just because the Tivo recorded it .
Excercise
Get a benefit out of your television or movie watching by exercising .
This works particularly well if you have some type of cliff hanger weekly television show on DVD and you make a contract with yourself to only watch an episode while exercising .
The suspense will keep you coming back every day .
Libraries
Many libraries have a great collection of DVDs that you can check out for free or for a very low price .
This can be a great alternative to Netflix .
Buying Used on Amazon
Buying a used DVD or set of television DVDs on Amazon can be a great way to get a good deal .
Even better , if you turn around and sell them once you ’ve watched them , you can end up paying $ 3.99 for the shipping to get the DVD set to you and recover the cost of the original purchase when you turn around and sell them to someone else .
If you do this , just be sure to keep the DVDs scratch free .
Do Something Else
The best tip when it comes to television is to do something else .
Use the time that you ’d spend watching television to go for a walk with family , give a friend a call on the phone , or read a book .
If you take the amount of time that the average person spends on television each week and put it into education , the hours add up very quickly .
With the right program you can get a Master ’s degree in just a few years using the time most people would invest in television .
Originally published June 9 , 2008 .
With a spray of water , Guy Gleichmann surfaces from a 40 - foot dive during which he helped set his mother ’s remains in their final resting place : a sunken city where brightly hued fish shimmy among fantastical architecture .
“ I did n’t want to leave , ” Gleichmann says , doffing mask and mouthpiece .
“ It ’s so beautiful down there .
It ’s so serene . ”
The 48 - year - old investment manager and diver from Pompano Beach , Fla. , wanted a unique and accessible spot for his mother , Emma , who died in December at age 75 .
So he had her cremated remains mixed into concrete in the shape of a seashell , which was placed near the statue of a lion .
Ashes to ashes , dust to deep .
Emma Gleichmann was one of nearly 60 souls whose cremated remains rest in nautical sculptures on the sea floor about three miles off Key Biscayne at the one - of - a- kind Neptune Memorial Reef .
The alternative burial option creates an environment for reef creatures and a destination for divers .

“ It will always be a special place when I go diving , to come out here and be where she ’s at , ” Gleichmann says .
“ It just gives you a feeling that they ’re not totally gone . ”
The reef , a subsidiary of the Neptune Society , the nation ’s largest cremation company , opened in fall 2007 after four years of permitting hurdles .
It encompasses 16 acres and features oversize sculptures : arches , columns , gates and benches , all designed by Key Largo artist Kim Brandell .
“ I was trying to achieve some sort of sunken city , but not Atlantis , ” Brandell says , calling his architectural style futuristic rather than classical .
The scale is appropriately gargantuan for an undersea necropolis : 5 - ton columns on 50 - ton bases , arches soaring 25 feet .
About a tenth of the underwater sculpture garden has been developed , says project manager Jim Hutslar .
When the entire reef is completed , perhaps in 10 years , its rings and spokes will resemble a massive mandala .
Leaping dolphins , chariots and Neptune himself are planned as future monuments .

In the company ’s Deerfield Beach plant , Hutslar mixes a client ’s cremated remains into special underwater concrete in 10 - pound sculptures of starfish , shells and coral .
Family members can watch or participate .
Some place small tokens from the deceased in the mix -- fishing lures , angels or rosaries .
“ Sometimes I warn the family , ” Hutslar says .
“ ‘ If you start crying , I may cry . ’ ”
On the reef , the sculptures are affixed to pavers along paths or set into columns and statuary .
They eventually will be covered with coral , but plaques reveal who resides there .
The cost is $ 2,600 for a standard placement of cremated remains .
A cremation and placement package runs about $ 4,000 .
Appealing to sea lovers , the reef is home to the remains of boat captains and divers .
Others desire a unique alternative to the graveyard .
“ We ’re seeing a lot of baby boomers because it ’s different , ” says Stephen Ziadie , Neptune Memorial Reef ’s chief operating officer .

Fish swarm there by the hundreds ; an eel and two stingrays have taken up residence .
“ As I ’m working , they ’re around my hands , trying to see what I ’m doing , ” Hutslar says .
Of the 1,200 spots in the reef ’s initial development , more than half have been sold , he said .
The company does n’t own the site -- it ’s in international waters -- but has federal and state permission to build on it .
Hutslar makes several maintenance dives to the reef each week , and places the remains of five to six people there a month .
Nine family members of one woman learned to dive so they could watch him set her sculpture .
“ They all got certified for that one event , ” he says .
Ron Hink , 54 , of Fort Lauderdale , suggested the reef for his mother , Edith , when she was in a hospice .
“ She just lit up and said , ‘ Gosh , I love the idea .
I ’ve always lived on the water , and I ’ll have waterfront property , ’ ” he recalls .

Hink bought space in a column for himself , his wife and two kids .
“ One by one we ’ll all go there , ” he says .

He denies being the man who murdered love , but he is one of the men who served as a member of XTC .
That ’s right , he ’s Andy Partridge , and this upstanding musical legend was kind enough to take on the daunting task of answering the questions of the Popdose readership … questions which , it must be said , ranged from the obscure to the ridiculous and hit virtually every spot in - between .
Mr. Partridge was a gem throughout the conversation , however , and endured them all with great aplomb , never failing to come back with a witty retort .
( “ You bastard ” still counts as witty , right ? )
Join us now as we enter into the Popdose Interview with the one and only Andy Partridge …
Popdose : Hello , may I speak to Andy ?
Andy Partridge : Thatâ€™ll be Will !
It will be !
Ah , knock twice and ask for Will ! ( Laughs )
Let me put down my cheap little guitar that I treated myself to about two weeks ago .
I didnâ€™t even intend to buy a guitar .
I went to buy a pair of trousers , and I just saw this guitar on the wall , and Iâ€™m a real sucker for little - body guitars .
It just sort of whimpered to me .
You musicians have no restraint .
( Laughs )
Well , it was the first one Iâ€™ve bought since 1983 , so come on , thatâ€™s pretty good restraint .
Thatâ€™s restraint into tight - fisted , I think !
Soâ€ ¦youâ €™ve got your recording device going ?
I do .
Itâ€™s already rolling along .
Oh , good man !
And Iâ€™ve got plenty of reader questions for you as well .
Yeah !
Donâ€™t hold back ; let them all go .
Iâ€™m sitting here in a small model of a dreadnaught made entirely out of candyfloss , floating on an indoor lake , so Iâ€™m relaxed and ready to go .
And totally living up to my expectations .
Ha-ha !
Well , youâ€™d do best not to have any !
Well , the first question is only appropriate , since this conversation came about because of the Dukes of Stratosphear reissues :
* Is it true that â€ œyou canâ€™t get the buttons these daysâ€ ?
Well , the thing is , weâ€™ve just put a set of buttons out !
If you order both of the Dukes reissues from the site , I think you get a set of buttons with them .
In fact , Iâ€™m convinced you do get a set of buttons .
But , yeah , I actually said that because a puffin would say something like that .
Dâ€™ya know what I mean ?
In the Victorian world of psychedelia and all that kind of stuff , then thatâ€™s the sort of thing a puffin would say .
And a puffin is a suitably psychedelic animal .
Manatee , walrus , kiwi , dugong , puffinâ€ ¦maybe rhinoceros , actually .
Thatâ€™s a pretty psychedelic animal .
If you can imagine it in a Lewis Carroll story , itâ€™s usually safe .
Exactly .
In fact , there was a pipe and a waistcoat and a monocle , maybe .
So had you been hankering to reissue the Dukes albums for quite some time ?
I had .
Iâ€™d liked the idea of doing them really properly , because Chips from the Chocolate Fireball is a good compilation , I think , but the sleeve art was really crap .
It was not what I asked for , and , of course , knowing Virginâ€ ¦like , I said , â€ œI want a solarized photograph … this photograph , solarized on that background .
We want all the lyrics.â€ 
What happened ?
They printed it in the negative , no lyricsâ€¦ ( Growls )
So we actually got the use of those records back again , and I donâ€™t know how the hell we managed that , but we did , and it was a case of , â€ œWell , letâ€™s do them how they really should have been done.â€ 
* There are some obvious musical touchstones on the songs , but who are some of your favorite semi-obscure psychedelic artists that we might not be recognizing ?
I was greatly affected by a band called the Moles .
There was a little sort of mystery story behind them , because a big DJ on the BBC in Englandâ€ ¦Alan â€ œFluffâ€  Freeman , his name wasâ€ ¦had this show late on a Sunday afternoon called â€ œPick of the Pops.â€ 
And every teenage kid listened to it , because thatâ€™s all there was , literally .
And one Sunday , he said that heâ€™d been sent a key to a locker at Paddington Station , and heâ€™d sent somebody to go to this locker with this mystery key , and there was a disc in there .
And he took the disc out , and he played it , andâ€ ¦I think he came to the conclusion that it was Ringo singing , with the rest of the Beatles backing him up .
This was aboutâ€ ¦I dunno , late â€ ™67 , early â€ ™68 .
Something like that .
And , of course , this sort of entered the mythology , that this was the Beatles with Ringo .
It had all of the sort of psychedelic effects on it , yâ€ ™know , singing through a Leslie cabinet , and it just extremely of the time .
With a stretch of the imagination , you could say , â€ œWell , maybe that is Ringo , â€  but it was actually the group that became later Gentle Giant .
They were called Simon Dupree and the Big Sound .
It wasnâ€™t the Beatles at allâ€ ¦as we suspected , really .
But Iâ€™d gotten wrapped up in the mystery of it , and I think psychedelia has that thing of Edward Lear / Lewis Carroll nonsense mystery about it .
The Rolling Stones , who did it pathetically and beautifully wrong with the album Satanic Majesties , did one thing perfectly by putting a maze on the album sleeve which couldnâ€™t be completed .
I thought that was …I thought , â€ œYeah , thatâ€™s the spirit!â€ 
The last time you and I talked , you said that Rhino had never actually asked you to include the Dukes of Stratosphear songs on their Children of Nuggets box set .
Did they get around to sending you a copy of the box set , at least ?
They did .
Only after we complained , I think .
They never asked .
They actually put two of our songs on there , didnâ€™t they ?
â€ œVanishing Girlâ€ and â€œ25 Oâ€™Clock.â€
But nobody ever asked us .
That doesnâ€™t surprise me , in the wide world of record companies .
* Do you ever miss the psychedelic days of the Dukes , and have you â€ “ either now or in the past â€ “ ever seriously considered resurrecting them ? >
Well , I got to be a Duke last year with the track â€ œTin Toy Clockwork Train .
â€ 
I donâ€™t know whether youâ€™ve heard that or not ; thatâ€™s on one of the reissues .
I was asked by a French advertising agencyâ€ ¦the fellow in charge of this agency was a huge Dukes fan , and he said , â€ œCould you sort of imitate yourself imitating other people ?â€ 
So I did .
I wrote a â€œmissingâ€ 
Dukes song and recorded it all in my little garden shed studio , only to find out that he was the same person that , a couple of years earlier , had instigated a big ad campaign in stations in Londonâ€ ¦well , certainly at Waterloo Station , where the Eurostar used to depart from , they had a big 50 foot by 50 foot ersatz cover of 25 Oâ€ ™Clock stuck to the floor .
I mean , it was almost identical .
Theyâ€™d just changed a few things .
That was his sort of homage to the Dukes , to use it in an ad campaign .
So , no , the Dukes were the Dukes , and they were of their time , and we should leave them to be fertilizer now , I think .
* Will you please consider reviving the bubblegum album idea ?
Not as an XTC thing , but as an Andy Partridge with maybe some special guests thing .
Well , it broke my heart when I changed computer formats , actually , and I lost quite a few of the recordings Iâ€™d done .
I managed to save a couple .
I managed to save â€ œCave Girlâ€ and â€ œLicky Licky Liquorice.â€
Butâ€ ¦I dunno , that was something I wanted to do in the early â€˜90s , andâ€ ¦ ( Sighs ) â€¦again , you know , if you donâ€™t serve the meal when itâ€™s hot , it sort of congeals , and thereâ€™s nothing as stale as the recently - stale , but now I guess itâ€™s getting to the point where itâ€™s not recently stale and itâ€™s becoming a museum artifact .
So maybe Iâ€™ll look at it again .
But I donâ€™t have the jones , I think you say , for doing the bubblegum thing at the moment .
Lots of other things , but not the bubblegum thing .
* When is your solo record coming out ?
Oh , gosh .
A few people have started asking me this , and right now I have loads and loads of bits of songs , something like 350 .
I havenâ€™t pegged it exactly , but theyâ€™re in that sort of number .
And I just havenâ€™t mentally felt like finishing any of them off .
If I go down this route now , youâ€ ™re going to end up being my psychiatrist here , so Iâ€™ll just touch on it quickly , butâ€ ¦I just donâ€™t know if any of them are looking to me to be better than anything that Iâ€™ve done in the past .
And I would rather not put out records rather than putting out records which I consider to be not quite as good .
Does that make sense ?
Yep .
I can understand that .
I would rather stop until something says to me , â€ œOkay , this is better than what youâ€™ve done , or certainly on a par.â€ 
I hate the idea of going down and decaying aurally in front of peopleâ€™s ears .
I wish a lot of other bands would do that as well .
Precious few do , though .
And thatâ€™s the problem .
* Are you planning on working with Barry Andrews again ?
Iâ €™d love to !
I like working with Barry .
I find his intellect stimulating .
I walked past his house a couple of days ago , and Iâ€™ve noticed that heâ€™s got this ever - changing window display that just boggles my brain beautifully .
I noticed thatâ€ ¦do you know what a Dalek is ?
Absolutely .
Heâ€™s got about eight gold Daleks on his windowsill , stood in front of a lot of yellow and orange flowers , and with a sort of purple -y backdrop .
And I thought , â€ œYep , there they are : Daleks of the Lord.â€  A shrine laid out .
But , yeah , I find Barry immensely stimulating .
What were your thoughts about how the Monstrance album turned out ?
I liked it .
And I occasionally play it .
Actually , it couldâ€™ve been odder .
It couldâ€™ve been weirder .
I think it tended to gravitate a little towards the straighter side of things , but , then again , Martyn ( Barker ) is more a sort of groove drummer than an exploratory drummer , and Barryâ€ ¦well , I mean , I think what Monstrance is is the three of us at the point where our personalities meet .
I probably bring the weird stuff , Barry brings the dramatic stuff , and Martyn brings the groove , if you see what I mean .
I enjoyed it .
I thought some of the things on there were as good as anything Iâ€™ve done , actually .
I thought â€ œI Lovely Cosmonautâ€ came out just wonderfully .
I had a bit of struggle with it , but Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve heard that from a lot of XTC fans .
Oh , sure .
And itâ€™s nothing like anything XTC have done , apart from maybe some of the dub things .
Thatâ€™s probably the nearest I can suggest .
* Would you ever do a kids record ?
Iâ €™d like to .
There are several things Iâ€™ve got on my sort of mental list of things to do if I can get back to loving music , which Iâ€™m sort of a bit out of love with music at the moment .
But Iâ€™d love to do a kids album .
Iâ€™d like to do an opera , because I canâ€™t stand opera , therefore I think I feel the need to defeat it , if you see what I mean .
Just the noise of itâ€ ¦ ( Makes a high - pitched siren - like sound ) â€ ¦and all that sort of thing .
Usually , 90 % of operas have crap songs !
Itâ€™s , like , you know , get rid of all of that singing , and is the song any good ?
No !
Itâ€™s shit !
There are very few operas with really good songs in them .
And I would love to do an opera , and I know the subject I would do it about : Cortez and Montezuma .
Iâ€™m also working on the idea of doing a cross-dressing Western musical .
So lots of sort of silly irons in the fire , but I donâ€™t know whether any of them will come to fruition .
Well , funny you should say that …
* If I get myself to Swindon somehow , will you co-write some songs with me ?
Iâ€™m unvirtuosic but persistent .
No .
No , no , no !
Do not chat with me !
Go away !
Oh , but he says itâ€™s probably time he wrote another musical !
So Iâ€™m sure heâ€™d be ready to collaborate with you on yours .
And who is this ?
One of our readers .
Thatâ€™s all I can tell you definitively .
So itâ€™s not Mr. D. Bowie or P. McCartney or E. Costello ?
Sadly , probably not .
Oh , okay .
No , I donâ€™t like people turning up and A ) wanting to stare at me , B ) wanting to play me their music , C ) wanting to be my best friend .
You see , I justâ€ ¦Iâ€™m very private , and I hate all that .
I usually try and be pleasant to them , but inside Iâ€™m going , â€ œFuck off and die !
Fuck off and die !â€ 
( Laughs )
So this next offer , then , is probably off the table for youâ€¦ ?
* Would you consider enjoying a spot of homemade macaroni-n - cheese , my treat , if I ever make it back to England ?
No .
I canâ€™t stand macaroni and cheese .
I donâ€™t eat cow cheese anymore .
I only eat sheepâ€™s cheese .
And I never had a thing for macaroni and cheese .
They seem to not complement each other .
It was like some down and out had thrown up on lots of bits of rubber tubing that youâ€™d just finished an enema with .
â€ œHere !
Hereâ€™s your dinner !
Enema tube and tramp vom!â€ 
Tasty .
Read me some more questions .
Just go through the lot of them !
* Are you , in fact , the man who murdered love ?
No .
It was the man next door .
* What do you think of the covers of â€ œScissor Manâ€ and â€ œMaking Plans for Nigelâ€ by Primus , and what are some covers of your work that youâ€™ve heard and liked ?
I thought the Primus ones were okay .
I didnâ€™t write the songs , so they can murder them how they want .
I donâ€™t care .
But what ones did I hear that I liked ?
Oh , there was a band called 4DB that did an acapella version of â€ œRookâ€ that I thought was beautiful .
You can find that on YouTube somewhere ; somebodyâ€™s cut â€ œHarry Potterâ€ film to it .
( Writerâ€™s note : one presumes that the copyright police took care of that particular footage , but you can still hear the track over top of the closing credits to an adaptation of Agatha Christieâ€™s â€ œAnd Then There Were None.â€ )
Itâ€™s a lovely version of â€ œRook.â€ 
And thereâ€™s a choirâ€ ¦though I canâ€™t remember the name of the choirâ€ ¦who do â€ œRiver of Orchids , â€ and I thought that was pretty interesting as well .
What other covers ?
Oh , there was a band that did a real shit - kicking hoedown version of â€ œComplicated Game , â€  but , again , I canâ€™t remember the name of the band .
Iâ€™m sure the people that are into all of this stuff will say , â€ œOh , heâ€™s talking aboutâ€¦â€ 
And then fill in the blank .
( Writerâ€™s note : though Iâ€™ve no clue about the name of the choir , a reader has kindly corrected my theory that the “ Complicated Game ” covered was done by the Poster Children .
While the band did cover the song , this “ hoedown version ” appears to have been the work of Moonshine Willy . )
* How do you feel about the Testimonial Dinner tribute album ?
Never saw a penny from it .
I think it wouldâ€™ve been nice if Terry and the Lovemen saw some accounts and saw how many copies sold , whether they actually had a pitiful royalty or not , â€˜cause they never got an advance , and Iâ€™m sure that none of the other bands that covered the stuff beautifully never saw any royalties or accounting .
So I think the record label that did it are assholes , but the bands that did it are wonderful .
Especiallyâ€¦oh , Jesus , my brainâ€™s not screwed on today !
Umâ€¦â€ The Man Who Sailed Around His Soul.â€
Ruben Blades .
Ruben Blades !
Or Ruben Blah - Days , I think , if you do the Spanish pronunciation .
No , the band that did it are rather lovely , but the record company , I think , treated everyone very poorly and , Iâ€™m sure , have ripped them off , Terry and the Lovemen included .
* Would you consider working again with Todd Rundgren ?
Yes .
But he would never work with me again , â€˜cause Iâ€™ve said some really shitty things about him in the past .
But if I worked with him , heâ€™d have to be the arranger .
He wouldnâ€™t be allowed to be engineer , and he wouldnâ€™t be allowed to be the mixer .
But as an arranger , heâ€™s faultless .
But he would never work with me .
Although Dave ( Gregory ) saw him recentlyâ€ ¦he went to see him at a showâ€ ¦and , yâ€ ™know , hopefully , the axe is well and truly buried .
And I donâ€™t mean in my back !
It was really difficult , but the finished project is fine .
( Chuckles )
The birth was painful , but the baby is beautiful .
* I heard it reported that some new recording was done by you and Colin on some uncompleted XTC demos , for upcoming reissue packages .
Is that true ?
No .
Not at all .
Iâ€™ve been mixing some outtakes from English Settlement .
Virgin are doing an expanded English Settlement in a couple of months , and Iâ€™ve been mixing a couple of tracks for that .
But I havenâ€™t been really recording anything .
* Would you please kiss and make up with Mr. Moulding so we can have the pleasure of listening to another XTC album ?
Umâ€¦no .
No , not at the moment .
Weâ€ ™re going through divorce at the moment .
So heâ€™s not my favorite individual , and Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not his .
Has there been any further conversation ?
The last time I talked to you , he had pretty much gone on silent running .
Yeah , but we just send bad - tempered E - mails to each other at the moment .
But we seem to be in some sort of agreement as to how to put out what access weâ€™ve got to certain tracks in the back catalog .
We got access to a little bit of the back catalog .
Not the main big selling ones , unfortunately .
Virgin still have those forever .
But weâ€™ve got access to the Dukes and some other bits and pieces , so itâ€™s , like , â€ œHow best to work those ?â€ 
We seem to have painfully come to an agreement on that .
But , no , there wonâ€™t be another XTC album .
( With mock gruffness ) Is 25 years of magnificent albums not enough for you ?
* Now that youâ€™ve resumed working with Virgin , will we see a career - spanning DVD of promotional videos ?
Thereâ€™s a plan for Virgin to put out a compilation album called Poppycock , where one of the discs in the set will be a DVD of the singles .
But I would imagine that theyâ€™re not spending much on sort of cleaning it up .
Itâ€™ll just be the copy they grab , and away they go .
It wonâ€™t be a sort of draughtmanâ€™s contract , getting digitally restored or anything
* A lot of us see Oranges and Lemons as seminal work .
What , if anything , would you have done differently with that record in hindsight , and how does it hold up in your mind ?
Orange and Lemons is okay .
Iâ€™d put it at about # 4 or # 5 in my favorite albums of ours .
I wouldnâ€™t say it was one of the top three , but I think itâ€™s got some good stuff on it .
It is a little long .
Maybe we shouldâ€™ve , to be truthful , written a few more songs and made two different albums , maybe a year apart .
But it seemed to come out okay , and I think it was of the time , if you know what I mean .
It was what we wanted to be at the time : we wanted to be brash and bright and citrus and very precise .
Which it is .
It is all those things .
Now I wouldnâ€™t want to make a record like that , but in 1988 , I really did .
How was Paul Fox to work with as a producer ?
Excellent !
A really very happy sort of person , and a very good midwife .
Mid-husband .
Is that such a term ?
Are there any male midwives ?
If so , you never hear about them .
No !
â€ œUp to his elbows in work ! â€ ( Laughs ) Yeah , he was very good and very sort of caring .
I suppose my only one criticism would be that he was such a big fan of the band that we would fire a load of ideas at him , and rather than picking one and saying , â€ œOkay , letâ€™s go with this , â€  he would tend to try and accommodate everyoneâ€™s idea , so the tracks do sound a little fuller than maybe they shouldâ€™ve been .
But , hey , it was the â€˜80s .
Youâ€™ve got to figure that in .
This one has no back story accompanying it , butâ€ ¦
* Do you remember taking a few Polaroids during the Oranges and Lemons sessions ?
( Exuberantly ) Yes !
I should imagine that one of them is of me wearing the Colonel Cunt hat .
Because Iâ€™d be ordering people around , saying , â€ œLook , come on , can we do another take , letâ€™s try this again , â€ thereâ€™d be lots of muttering under the breath of the band , you know .
I guess I got into the bandleader role a little bit stronger on that album than on previous albums .
But I thought to lighten the moodâ€ ¦weâ€™d always had loads of porn mags around the studio , so I cut out a particularly well - photographed close - up of a pudenda and made a real sort of Russian commissarâ€™s peaked cap and stuck that where the badge should be on the front .
And we had this hat on the mixing desk , and if I suggested or if anybody suggested anything that was a little dictatorial , everyone would point to the hat , and they had to go and put on the Colonel Cunt hat .
This one comes from one of my Facebook friends .
* Simon Tedd says to say , â€ œHello.â€ 
Simon Tedd !
Yes !
He used to be in a bandâ€ ¦that had a really pathetic wet girlâ€™s name .
And they played a few gigs in the miniature version of the Hollywood Bowl , which is in the town gardens in Swindon .
They have , like , a 1/3 scale Hollywood Bowl .
And in the early â€ ˜70s , him and this band , who I seem to remember having a particularly wet girlâ€™s name , used to play a few gigs there .
And for some reason , I ended up getting to sort of vaguely know him .
He said , â€ œWe were mates way back in the Helium Kidz days , Swindon Town Gardens and Swindon Viewpoint Television .
I lost track of him around the time of Big Bam Boo.â€ 
That was his band .
That was a later band of his .
Right .
He also said , â€ œI remember having a long phone call with him about the merits of Paul Fox , the producer of Oranges and Lemons .
Fox was being foisted on us by our record label for the second BBB album .
It never happened .â€ 
That was probably the last time I ever spoke with him .
That was quite some time back .
Well , he says to say , â€ œHello.â€ 
Right !
( Pauses )
What else have you got ?
* Did you have anything to do with the Scrotal Scratch Mix from Johnny Japes and the Jesticles ?
Well , there was no B - side for that disc , and I canâ€™t remember who suggested it , but it was decided that we would do a Scrotal Scratch Mix .
And , basically , itâ€™s just the backing track withâ€ ¦I canâ€™t remember , but I think we auditioned who had the noisiest trousers at the recording session .
It was myself , Dave Gregory , John Otway , and Neville Farmer , who is sort of a writer / editor of a music magazine , that sort of thing .
And we just auditioned who had the noisiest crotch .
We put a mike about crotch high , and everybody had to stand and scratch their crotch , and whoever had the noisiest crotchâ€ ¦I think it was somebody with corduroys onâ€ ¦they just got to scratch their balls , really , over the backing track .
* Thanks for cluing us in to the Milk and Honey Band .
How did you first come across them ?
Purely by accident .
Bob White , the Milk and Honey Band main songwriter and singer , posted me an album they did on a small label called Ugly Manâ€ ¦which I think they sold about two copies of that album on the Ugly Man label .
He said , â€ œLook , hereâ€™s an album we hand out , lots more where this came from , can we be on your label ? â€ 
And I thought , â€ œWell , this is not going to be any good , because the previous 99 discs Iâ€™d just suicidally trolled throughâ€ ¦well , all these other bands havenâ€™t been any good , so Iâ€™ll just play one or two tracks and see what I get out of this .â€ 
And I played one or two bits of track , and usually within a few seconds I know whether Iâ€™m going to be interested in somethingâ€ ¦and I just thought it was marvelous !
( Laughs )
And I thought , â€ œWhoa !
I must get in contact with this chap !â€ 
And I rang him up , and he had about three or four albums worth of recordings .
And it was a case of , â€ œRight , letâ€™s go !
This is brilliant stuff !â€ 
So it was just happy happenstance , you know ?
* How the hell do you play the opening riff to â€ œMeccanic Dancingâ€ ?
Oh !
Well , Iâ€™ll put the phone on the table for a second .
( Pauses )
There , youâ€™re on speaker now .
And you play it like thisâ€¦ !
( Plays the riff on his aforementioned new guitar )
There you go .
But I could describe it .
Here you go : top E string and G string , slid up to the A position , with the B string ringing open .
Now let me just make sure thatâ€™s correct .
Hold it .
( Plays the riff again ) Yeah .
And the second chord isâ€ ¦top three strings , open E , open G , andâ€ ¦ ( Plays another chord ) â€ ¦D on the B string covered .
So itâ€™s just those two positions .
Well , itâ€™s only the top three strings of the guitar , andâ€ ¦yeah , what I said earlier .
* Where does your inspiration come from , especially this late in the game ?
For instance , I know the back story , but “ I Ca n’t Own Her ” and “ Harvest Festival ” still just reduce me every time I hear them .
Loss , probably .
And never being able to attain something .
â€ œI Canâ€™t Own Herâ€ was a realization that you donâ€™t own people .
Iâ€™d just been divorced somewhat against my will , and somebody just walked out of my life , and I couldnâ€™t own them .
And somebody was just walking into my life , and I couldnâ€™t own them , either .
And itâ€™s that realization that you canâ€™t own people .
You can love them , but it is an amazingly solitary feeling .
You can love them and try to express that you love them , but thereâ€™s nothing to stop them from wandering off or dying orâ€ ¦well , do you see what I mean ?
You just canâ€™t own people .
Love is an incredibly solitary sensation , I think .
So that was that one .
And I always wanted to write a song that had kind of Burt Bacharach chords , and â€ œI Canâ€™t Own Herâ€ is a little bit Bacharach in chords .
So is that where your general inspiration comes from , then ?
Real life events combined with a desire to write your own versions of other peopleâ€™s songs ?
Yeah !
Thatâ€™s where a lot of songs are started .
Youâ€ ™re dicking around , andâ€¦actually , â€ œWrapped in Grey , â€ that was more ersatz Bacharach .
Maybe â€ œI Canâ€™t Own Herâ€ had a little dollop of Bacharach .
But , yeah , I get a lot of ideas for songs by fucking up other peopleâ€™s songs .
â€ ˜Cause Iâ€™m no good at learning stuff .
Like , â€ œKnights in Shining Karmaâ€ came from dicking around with â€ œBlackbirdâ€  and getting it wrong .
Or â€ œAll You Pretty Girlsâ€ came from mucking â€˜round with a Hendrix riff and getting that wrong .
And you just sort of stumble across these things , and you think , â€ œHey , thatâ€™s good !
Nobodyâ€™s found that .
Oh , of course , itâ€™s a bit like that , but Iâ€™m messing it up here .
But thatâ€™s fine , it still sounds good ! â€ 
So , yeah , I get a lot of inspiration from messing up other peopleâ€™s songs .
( Laughs )
And I donâ€™t mean intentionally .
Iâ€™m just not a great learner !
* Can you describe your demo process and how itâ€™s evolved ?
I know your early demos were you stomping and strumming , and theyâ€™ve evolved into very well developed recordings .
Yes .
( Goes silent )
( Laughs )
So how has the process evolved over the years ?
Just technology .
Being able to afford a machine where you can multi- track yourself .
Like , a four - track cassette machine .
Then I leapt up after a few years to an eight - track cassette machine .
Then I thought I was leaping up , but I probably leapt down in quality to an ADAT eight - track digital machine .
Then I got into recording on computer , and there we go .
Thatâ€™s sort of where I am at the moment .
* What do you record first ?
The drum track ?
Usually some sort of rhythm thing .
I usually record the bass last , and thatâ€™s a habit that Colin also caught , because some bass players can overplay and play too much .
And if they listen to what the drums are doing and what the chord instruments are doing , they realize they donâ€™t have to play so much , and they can be much more selective and much more melodic in their playing .
McCartney does that .
From â€ ™66 onwards , he was putting his bass on last .
And I used to do that with my demos , and Colin got into doing that .
I think itâ€™s a very good way of approaching the bass , â€˜cause so many bass players are , like , â€ œOkay , letâ€™s put the bass and drums down first !â€ 
And , of course , thereâ€™s no other instrumentsâ€¦or , yâ€ ™know , they arenâ€™t very loud in the mix or whatever .
Bass players are just filling up all the holes , all the time , and itâ€™s horrible .
They donâ€™t need that .
* How do you know when a song is â€œdoneâ€ ?
Itâ€™s never done .
You just have to abandon it .
You have to say , â€ œOh , for Christâ€™s sake , thatâ€™s good enough awful.â€ 
If you see what I mean .
And then you just have to walk away from it and try not to return to your vomit too much .
You really have toâ€ ¦thereâ€™s somebody who said , â€ œGreat art is knowing when to abandon it.â€ 
Thatâ€™s completely true .
You do have to say , â€ œOh , for Christâ€™s sake , thatâ€™s gonna have to do.â€ 
And , you know , sometimes you can work things to a peak of perfection and sort of not realize it and go through and start spoiling it .
Itâ€™s a bit like overegging a pudding , or crushing the cake with the weight of icing , or something like that .
Thatâ€™s a bit of an art , doing that .
But you do have to sort of throw it away , really , at some point , and shove it out into the world and say , â€ œYouâ€ ™re old enough now , get out and stop sponging off of me , you layabout ! â€ 
* Do you have the ability to release any more of XTCâ€™s live recordings ?
Not really , although , thinking about it , we may have the rights to some of the live things that have come out already .
Weâ€ ™re looking into doing a complete box of everything we did for the BBC .
So that could be good .
* When did you first become aware of guitarist Ollie Halsall and in what ways has he influenced your playing ?
Oh , heâ€™s an enormous influence !
Heâ€™s one of the top three influences , I think .
I first discovered him with the first Patto album , and I heard the track â€ œThe Man.â€  I donâ€™t know whether you know Patto , but they made , I think , two and a half really excellent albums .
And some of the tracksâ€ ¦Iâ€™d say three or four of the tracks on each of those albumsâ€ ¦are just stunningly wonderful , with the other stuff just being sort of okay .
Certainly very good for the time .
Iâ€™m not sure when the first album came out .
â€ ™70 , â€ ™71 , something like that .
And I heard a track called â€ œThe Man , â€  which is very slow and very empty , and I loved the sort ofâ€ ¦this sounds rather rude , but I loved the aching holes in it .
There were some great holes in the funk of this track , and it just seemed to ache .
And I thought , â€ œWow !â€ 
And I was only a young kid , but that was very impressive .
And then when I heard the complete opposite of that , tracks like â€ œAir Raid Shelter , â€ where the guitar plays such inventive runs , not your standard blues stash of things , your standard blues licks that absolutely everybody was doing , the kind of cheap copy of Clapton .
He didnâ€™t play like that .
He just played it likeâ€ ¦he made the guitar sound more like Albert Ayler or John Coltrane , more like a sort of fluid piano player .
Once I heard his guitar playing , I was , like , â€ œ
Oh , I need to be able to play like that !â€ 
And I still catch myselfâ€ ¦if I sit with a guitar , which I do most evenings , I still find Ollie - esque things falling under my fingers .
* What is it about Ollie that you took into your own music ?
Surprise .
And the element that walls are for breaking down , and that scales are for wrecking .
But the sense of surprise , which for me is a lot of joy .
Itâ€™s like a beautiful gift , where youâ€ ™re opening a box , and you think you know what might be in it , but then youâ€™re , like , â€ œ
Oh , that is phenomenal !
Wow !
Look at that !
How did that get in there ?
What a lovely little surprise !â€ 
His playing is full of that , and I try to do thatâ€ ¦or I have tried to do thatâ€ ¦with my songwriting and playing to date .
But if you donâ€™t know Patto , they did make some stinky records , but the first twoâ€ ¦I think itâ€™s just called Patto , and then the second one , I think , is called Hold Your Fire .
Patto was the name of the singer : Mike Patto .
A very tragic band .
Mike Patto died of cancer to the throat , Ollie Halsall died , I think , of an overdose , and the bass player ( Clive Griffiths ) was in a car crash , has no recollection of having been in the band , and is in a wheelchair .
The only member thatâ€™s sort of together is the drummer of the Rutles !
The Barry Wom character , whose name is John Halsey .
So itâ€™s Ollie Halsall and John Halsey .
It was a tragic band , but Ollieâ€™s playingâ€ ¦thereâ€™s a couple of bits of Ollie on YouTube .
Theyâ€™re not fantastic , but you do get a sense of how he was quite willing to break stuff down musically .
The person who actually posed the question made note of the semi-similarity between the Rutles and the Dukes of Stratosphear .
Yeah , we like to think the Rutles copied everything we did !
Another person simply asks the following :
* Fanno vs. Ibanez ?
Ibanez , definitely .
I really grew with that guitar .
Thatâ€™s really sort of my wife in guitar terms , I guess .
And I donâ€™t own a Fanno !
I only owned a Fanno for about six months .
He took it back because he said he wanted to make some adjustments , and I never , ever saw it again .
So I donâ€™t own a Fanno .
Dave Gregory does , Colin Moulding does , but I donâ€™t .
So Dennis , if youâ€ ™re reading these , dâ€™ya think I could have my guitar back , please ?
Iâ €™ve just got a couple more hereâ€ ¦
Oh , no , you can ask me as many as you want !
Well , okay , then .
Next upâ€ ¦
* What the hell is a butter pie ?
A butter pie isâ€¦isnâ€™t that the side dish you have when you have a four of fish and a finger pie ?
I think you have to have a butter pie to lubricate the sensation of four of fish and a finger pie .
* When writing â€ œDear God , â€ did you really mean what you wrote , or is it just a song ?
Itâ€™s just a song , and I was examining my attitude toward it all .
* Do you believe in God ? >
No .
Not at all .
There is no aging English actor in white sheets sitting in the clouds .
I think the truth is unbearable for people , so they tend to make up fairy stories .
There is no God .
And why should there be ?
Thereâ€™s no reason for God. Mother Nature has no reason for God .
* With the upsurge of atheism as a kind of movement , are you getting different reactions or more reactions to â€ œDear Godâ€ these days ?
No , it just seems to keep bobbling along , pissing off Christians and giving some sort of hoorah for people who tend not to believe .
But I was wrestling with the tail end of my belief when I wrote it , because as a kid , I was reallyâ€ ¦I got myself worked into such a sweat over religion .
I remember that , about the age of eight or nine , one afternoon I had visions in the sky of clouds parting , and there was God on His throne , surrounded by angels , talking to me and grinning at me .
I mean , if I lived in a Catholic community , I couldâ€™ve milked that and made myself a fortune !
But , no , I think it happened because I was in such a hysterical state about religion as a child , and about the existence of God and that sort of thing .
Religion is a source of a lot of problems , and if there is a God , he would hate Christianity , he would hate Islam , he would hate Buddhism , he would hate everything thatâ€™s done in His name , because nobody behaves in a way that youâ€™re supposed to behave .
If you see what I mean .
* Will you ever consider selling your art , drawings , paints , etcetera ?
Iâ €™ve given a few away .
In fact , an ex-manager of ours , Tarquin Gotchâ€¦yes , thatâ€™s Tarquin Cedric Gotch , the silliest name in manager - domâ € ¦I gave him one called , I think , â€ œThe Yellow Archer.â€ 
And Iâ€™ve given a few others to people in the past .
But , you know , theyâ€™re not great , and theyâ€™re notâ€ ¦I dunno , I think if I painted for a living , Iâ€™d have to get over that .
Iâ€™ve actually considered it lately as a way of running away from music , to paint .
But I donâ€™t know if I could make a living doing it .
I mean , itâ€™s nice and romantic , but , you know , youâ€™ve got to make yourself some money !
* When are you coming back to Chicago ?
If itâ€™s summertime , weâ€™ll take you sailing on Lake Michigan .
Make sure Iâ€™ve got plenty of lifejackets on , if thatâ€™s the case , because I donâ€™t swim !
Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t swim out of choice ; I just canâ€™t .
I wade phenomenally .
If the waterâ€™s about three feet deep , Iâ€™m just the best wader .
But I can do the brick stroke better than anyone else !
I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™m coming back , but I have some fond memories of Chicago .
One of them is of a little bar called the Bucket Oâ€™ Suds , where the squeaky - voiced old fellow that ran it actually brewed some of his own booze .
And he had bottles of this deadly stuff behind him on the shelf .
I went in there one night after a show , and this squeaky - voiced character , this squeaky - voiced barman , said , â€ œWelcome to my bar !â€ 
And I said somethingâ€ ¦and I was really croaky after this show , so I said , â€ œWell , Iâ€™ve just done a show , and Iâ€™m rather croaky , and I think Iâ€™ve got a cold coming .â€ 
He said , â€ œIâ€™ve got just the thing for you !â€ 
And he poured me a couple of glasses of this homemade liquor that he did , and it was fantastic !
Iâ€™ve no idea what was in it , but , hey , I forgot my cold !
I donâ€™t know whether the Bucket Oâ€™ Suds is still there , though .
Nor do I , but Iâ€™ll certainly find out .
( Writerâ€™s note : sadly , the Bucket Oâ€™ Suds closed in 1998 when the health of the aforementioned â€œsqueaky - voicedâ€ proprietor , Joe Danno , began to fail .
He died in 2002 , but his liquor lived on for a few years afterwards via the BOS Distilling Company .
Alas , it too has since gone out of business . )
Do you get Stateside very often ?
Not so much these days .
Iâ€™m a little bit phobic about flying these days .
The last time I flew was actually about nine years ago .
I sort of think that if God had meant us to travel at those speeds , he wouldâ€™ve given us wheels .
No , wait , thatâ€™s not right , is it ?
( Laughs )
He wouldâ€™ve upgraded us !
No , I just prefer not to fly if I can help it .
Thatâ€™s so cowardly of me .
But , no , I donâ€™t get Stateside .
* When are you going to make another good album like Nonsuch ?
You bastard !
Iâ€™m not calling you â€ œyou bastard.â€ 
( Laughs ) I understand .
But this personâ€ ¦you bastard !
What was wrong , dear boy , with Apple Venus , Vol. 1 ?
I must tell you that , within his question , he used the word â€œoverrated .â€ 
Of what ?
Of Apple Venus .
And Wasp Star as well , actually .
( Gasps )
My favorite album , Apple Venus .
My favorite album that we did .
But Nonsuch is my second favorite , so heâ€™s not too out of whack .
And then I had a couple of follow - ups to questions from the last time I interviewed you .
Did you ever hear from Dave Balfe of Food Records ?
( Writerâ€™s note : Balfe reportedly never paid Partridge for the sessions he produced for Blur . )
( Sighs ) Jesus Christ .
I never want to hear from that twerp again .
Yeah , he never paid me .
It was five hundred pounds and a penny , those were my expenses .
I just remember the penny on there .
It made the amount indelible .
Yes , that was one of the pull quotes from our last conversation : â€ œIf Dave Balfe from Food Records ever gets to read this , pay me my expenses , you bastard !â€ 
Five hundred pounds and a penny !
Funnily enough , Virgin approached me recently and asked , â€ œWere there any outtakes or finished things from that Blur session ? â€ 
Because theyâ€™re doing a Blur retrospective .
And I said , â€ œYes , there are three tracks , one of which has never come out in any form at all .â€ 
Itâ€™s called â€ œSeven Days , â€ and it sounds fine to me .
I played it a couple of months back , just to check , and it sounds completely fine .
So who knows ?
Maybe some of my Blur productions will see the light of day !
What is the status of the Robyn Hitchcock collaborative album ?
Oh , fuck knows , honestly .
Heâ€™s just too busy running around the planet .
We started this a couple of years back , and heâ€™s just been so busy running around doing other stuff with other people .
I feel very much the ignored party in all this , actually .
I sent him an E - mail about six weeks or so ago , saying , â€ œLook , I think this thingâ€™s died of apathy , donâ€™t you ?â€ 
And he then sent me a postcard from on tour , saying , â€ œHey , weâ€™re just getting into San Francisco , and , yeah , letâ€™s record when I get back !â€ 
And , of course , Iâ€™ve never heard anything from him , so I guess heâ€™s off on tour with somebody else again .
He just seems to like touring and hanging out with other people , so I think the project seems to have died of apathy .
Are you still Andy â€ œTwo Shedsâ€ Partridge ?
Iâ €™ve still got the two shed .
Iâ€™m looking at them now through the window .
There they are , basking in the dusk .
Actually , what does one do ?
One basks in the sun , but one really just gasps in the dusk , I think .
( Pauses )
So , what , is that all the questions , then ?
I thought there were tons !
Well , there were quite a few of them , but we blew through them rather quickly , so thatâ€™s all of them .
Perhaps youâ€™d like to offer up some fake information to place on the internetâ€¦ ?
If so , feel free !
( Laughs ) Yes , letâ€™s start some lies !
Do you realize that , from the top of my house , you can see all nine continents ?
I did not realize that .
And would you care to comment on the status of the unreleased album you recorded with John Lennon ?
Yoko had it made into a hat .
Oh , dear .
Yes , she had the tapes knitted into a fur coat .
Is it true that she had vast refrigerated warehouses full of fur coats ?
I donâ€™t know .
It sounds viable , but Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s actually true .
I was reading something , and someone said she was to fur coats what Imelda Marcos was to shoes .
Well , weâ€™ll certainly be adding credence to that theory by putting it online .
Right !
You know , Iâ€™d love to see a mash - up between her and Brian Eno. Brian Ono! Yoko Eno !
Think of the music !
( Offers an imitation of the possible shrieking sound )
Like that , but very quietly .
More ambient .
Actually , that reminds me , though : I was wondering if you yourself had any collaborations coming ?
The last time we spoke , you had worked with Jamie Cullum , and youâ€™d just finished writing with Charlotte Hatherley .
Charlotte Hatherleyâ€ ¦I donâ€™t know what sheâ€™s doing at the moment .
She sent me a burn of her soon - to - be - released album , and Iâ€™m afraid I didnâ€™t like it much .
And I was very bad .
I was bad Uncle Andy , and I didnâ€™t get back to her , â€˜cause I couldnâ€™t think of a nice way of saying , â€ œI donâ€™t really like your new album.â€ 
But as for collaborations with others , is there anything on the cards ?
Yeah , I seem to be doing most of my collaborating with a chap called Stuart Rowe , whoâ€™s a re-mixer cum producer cum musician , and heâ€™s got a project called Lighter Thief .
And I go to his studio and just improvise things , and he tends to chop them up and sort of make strange songs out of them .
We just put out an EP , a three - track EP , of some of these things .
Itâ€™s called Maximalism , and Iâ€™m really proud of one of the things on there .
Itâ€™s called â€ œFalling Into the Future , â€ and that was literally just improvised at that moment in his shed and tweaked into becoming a whole thing , if you see what I mean .
You can hear part of itâ€¦actually , part of it is up on the XTC MySpace .
The first two minutes of it or something is on there .
But that was a great experience .
It was fun doing that .
Weâ€ ™re actually going to be putting out a whole album of these things later , but on the run-up to that , weâ€ ™re putting out a series of EPs .
I enjoy working with Stu because I never intend to do anything , and I just get down there , and if something boils to the surface , we record it .
Itâ€™s like making music where you donâ€™t intend to make it , if you see what I mean .
Itâ€™s not like writing a song and then , okay , now letâ€™s record it .
Itâ€™s , oh , Iâ€™ve got a idea , quick , now turn that microphone on .
And then we shape that into a piece or a song or a landscape of some sort .
Well ,
Andy , I think youâ€™ve covered them all .
Grand !
Itâ€™s been good talking to you again .
Alrighty !
Well , I always enjoy it .
Letâ€™s ask people for some more out - there questions .
They were all a little conservative .
( Laughs ) Well , thank you , Andy , and Iâ€™ll keep my fingers crossed that we do see some new music from you soonâ€ ¦at your leisure .
All righty !
Cheers , Will !
Explaining that he was unable to come to Atlanta on such short notice , Mr. Lee then received two letters from the organization ’s lawyer , Dexter M. Wimbish , threatening him with suspension or removal as president of the Los Angeles chapter if he did not come soon to explain himself .
Mr. Wimbish did not return calls to his office , nor did the Rev. Raleigh Trammell , chairman of the organization ’s national board .
A woman who identified herself as Renee Richardson left a voice - mail message for a reporter , saying the organization did not “ discuss internal matters . ”
She did not return follow - up calls .
The issue attracted the attention of the president of the Los Angeles City Council , Eric Garcetti , who wrote to the board in support of Mr. Lee .
Because chapters of the leadership conference operate autonomously and presidents are picked by local boards , it is not clear that the national organization has the authority to remove Mr. Lee from his post , which he has held for two years .
“ It ’s been our position that the local board hired him , ” said Reginald Byron Jones - Sawyer , chairman of the local board and secretary of the California Democratic Party .
“ And , in fact , we are also the ones that approved his stance on the position of marriage equality .
We have asked the national board if we have violated any procedures , and we have not gotten an answer . ”
Mr. Lee , the former pastor of In His Steps , an African - American Wesleyan church in Los Angeles that he described as “ very conservative , ” said he saw failures both in the leadership of the conference ( “ Dr. King would be turning over in his grave right now , ” he said ) and the largely white anti-Proposition 8 movement that did not more actively seek the support of church - going African - Americans .
“ The black church played a significant role in Proposition 8 passing , ” Mr. Lee said .
“ The failure of the campaign was to presume that African - Americans would see this as a civil rights issue . ”
This wonderful vacuum tube chess set , by maker Paul Fryer , actually has electricity running inside the board so that the tubes can draw power and glow as you move them from square to square .
It is called , somewhat appropriately , Chess Set for Tesla , and Paul actually made seven sets last year .
The colors respect the good / evil conventions set by Star Wars : Red is bad ( black ) and blue is good ( white ) .
I seriously dig this kit —
I have quite a thing for custom chess boards and this is probably my favorite since Marcel Duchamps ’s amazing set , which was a little out of my price - range .

All about Infinity
Article by Katherine Körner
Infinity is not a number , and trying to treat it as one tends to be a pretty bad idea .
At best you 're likely to come away with a headache , at worst with the firm belief that 1 = 0 .
You may have met various '' paradoxes ' ' that play on this fact ( and our instinct to ignore it ) before .
An infinitely long line , for instance , is surely infinitely many centimetres long .
It 's also , equally surely , infinitely many miles long .
But each centimetre is a great deal shorter than each mile , so does this mean an infinitely long line is two different lengths at once ?
The answer , of course , is to assert confidently that the question is meaningless ( and , if you 're in the mood to be unkind , just shows how little the asker knows about proper mathematics ) and then go back about your business untroubled by such silly quibbles .
Or , as I will hopefully convince you over the course of this article , the answer is a simple '' No . ''
Counting the natural numbers
We should n't treat infinity as a number .
We can't count up to it , and if we have an infinitely large set we will never be able to count all of the objects in it .
A set is a collection of objects .
They can be any sort of objects , although generally mathematicians use them to talk about mathematical objects , such as numbers .
An infinitely large set is , of course , one containing infinitely many objects .
It seems strange , therefore , to talk about certain infinitely large sets being '' countably infinite ' ' , but that is indeed what I 'm about to do .
Consider the natural numbers ( the positive , whole numbers : 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) .
There are infinitely many natural numbers ( if there were only a finite number of them , there would have to be a largest natural number - what would happen if we added 1 to that number ? ) so the set containing all the natural numbers must be infinitely large .
We 'll never be able to count them all .
However , we can list them in such a way that if we counted forever , we'd be sure not to miss any out .
The natural numbers are what we use for counting anyway , so we can think of them as coming ready - listed .
There is an obvious starting point ( 1 ) and a sensible order ( 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) .
To illustrate what I mean by a sensible order , imagine what would happen if we tried to count the natural numbers randomly .
However long we counted , we 'd never be sure we 'd counted them all - we could check for individual numbers in our random list , but we'd never know if they were all there , or when ( if ever ) we were going to reach a particular one .
Now imagine what would happen if we tried to count the natural numbers by counting the odd numbers first and then the even ones .
We 'd count forever , and never start counting the even numbers .
However , if we count them in the order given , we 'll know once we 've reached 100 that we 've counted everything between 1 and 100 once and only once .
We might never reach the end ( in a finite time , at least ) but we 'll know we 've not missed anything on the way and that it 's just a matter of time before we reach any given number .
That is , the only thing stopping us from counting them all is that we 'll run out of breath before we run out of numbers .
The proposed method of counting them all is sound , just impractical .
This is what we mean by saying the natural numbers are countably infinite .
In much the same way , any infinite set of numbers that can be put in a sensible , systematic order with a clear beginning such that we 're sure to get everything if we count forever is thought of as countable .
Counting other sets
When we talk about comparing the sizes of two sets that contain finite numbers of objects ( a set , $ C$ , containing some cats and a set , $ M$ , containing some baby mice , say ) then one way to do so is to match each object in one set with exactly one object in another set and see if we have any left over .
For the sets $ C$ and $ M$ , we can instruct each cat to catch exactly one baby mouse - no sharing allowed , nor hogging more than one mouse , nor letting one escape if the cat does n't already have another one .
If each cat does catch exactly one baby mouse - no more , no fewer - we know there are ( or , at least , were ) the same number of cats as mice .
That is , the sets $ C$ and $ M$ were the same size .
If any cats go hungry , there were more cats than mice ( $ C $ was larger than $ M$ ) and if any mice go free , there were more baby mice than cats ( $ M $ was larger than $ C $ ) .
This is called putting the objects into one - to - one correspondence , and the same can be done when comparing the sizes of infinite sets .
Another way of thinking about countably infinite sets is that they are those sets whose objects can be put in a one - to - one correspondence with the set containing the natural numbers only .
That is , if for each element in the set of the natural numbers there is exactly one - no more , no fewer - element in the set we 're trying to count , then the set is the same size as the set containing the natural numbers : countably infinite .
Putting the elements of an infinite set in sensible , systematic order with a clear beginning such that it 's just a matter of time before we reach any particular element is , in fact , the same thing as putting those elements in one - to - one correspondence with the natural numbers .
If the natural numbers are the cats from the above illustration and the elements to be counted are the baby mice , then the cats already have an order to line up in .
Lining the mice up next to them so none escape and none are eaten together ( putting them in a sensible order ) is the same as allotting the cats their dinner ( putting the elements of the two sets into one - to - one correspondence ) .
Are the integers ( all the whole numbers : ... , - 2 , - 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) , therefore , countable ?
At first , you might think not .
First we need to find a sensible beginning , and that may not be obvious .
With the natural numbers , we just started at the smallest and worked up .
But the integers do n't have a smallest number ( just as before , when showing there was no largest natural number , think to yourself : if there were a smallest integer , what would happen when we subtracted 1 from it ? ) , so where can we begin ?
Say we start at 1 and work up , as before with the natural numbers .
Then we count 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , putting them into one - to - one correspondence as follows :
Natural numbers 1 2 3 ... Integers 1 2 3 ...
Here , the problem is however long we count for , we 'll never start on the negative numbers .
We 'll never even get to zero .
It is possible to do .
Before reading on , try to think how .
It may help to remember the problem we would have had counting the natural numbers if we had tried to count all the odd ones first .
How to count the integers
Consider the following table :
Natural numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ...
Integers 0 - 1 1 - 2 2 - 3 3 ...
Will each integer be listed once and only once ?
It may help ( or it may not - do n't dwell on this if it just confuses you ) to visualise the integers as distinct points on an infinitely long line .
Think of 0 as the centre of the line , and imagine a circle , centre 0 , which increases in diameter as we count up , covering the numbers we 've counted .
After we 've counted to the seventh integer on the list , say , the circle has a diameter of 6 , and covers every number from - 3 to 3 .
In other words , yes .
Once we reach any integer on the list ( $ p$ , say ) , any integer with the absolute value ( that is , $ +n $ if $ n$ is positive and $ - n$ if $ n$ is negative ) smaller than the absolute value of $ p$ will have been counted exactly once , and any number with a modulus larger than it will be yet to count .
Whether $ - p$ has been counted obviously depends on whether $ p$ is greater or less than 0 .
So , while at first glance it might seem that there are more integers than natural numbers , this is not the case .
This is exactly what happens in the so - called paradox I mentioned at the start of this article .
You might at first think that for each natural number , $ n$ , there are two integers , $ \pm n$ and so there are twice as many integers as naturals , which is not the case .
In the same way , you might think an infinite number of miles takes you further than an infinite number of centimetres .
In fact , the centimetres that go to make up the infinitely many miles can be put into one - to - one correspondence with the centimetres that go to make up the infinitely many centimeteres , so both take you the same distance .
Counting the rationals
How about the rational numbers ?
( all the numbers that can be written as one integer divided by another : ... , - 2/3 , 0/1 , 1/1 , 1/2 , ... )
In the case of the natural numbers and the integers , it was easy to check we 'd counted every number in a given range .
To check we 'd counted all the natural numbers less than $ n$ , we merely needed to have counted up to $ n$ .
To check we 'd counted all the integers between $ n$ and $ m$ , we needed to check we 'd counted as far as the absolute value of $ n$ or $ m$ , whichever is the largest .
However , we can't count all the rational numbers in a given range , however small the range is .
This is because between any two rationals , there is another rational .
( If you 're unconvinced , imagine $ x $ and $y$ are two rationals between which there is n't another rational .
How can $ (x + y ) /2 $ not be rational ? )
Between - 2 and 4 there are seven integers ( including - 2 and 4 ) and four natural numbers .
There are , however , infinitely many rationals .
How , then , could we possibly count them ?
We can never get anything in a given range , and there are infinitely many ( non-overlapping ) ranges we could be given .
In fact , if there are infinitely many naturals ( which there are ) and infinitely many integers ( which , again , there are ) then surely there must be infinity - squared many rationals , because to get all the rationals you take each integer in turn and divide it by each natural number in turn , as in the following table :
$ \frac{1} {1} $ $ \frac{1} {2} $ $ \frac{1}{3} $ $ \frac{1} {4} $ $ \frac{1}{5} $ $ \frac { 1}{6} $ ... $ \frac{2}{1} $ $ \frac{2}{2} $ $ \frac{2}{3} $ $ \frac{2}{4} $ $ \frac{2}{5} $ ... $ \frac{3}{1} $ $ \frac{3}{2} $ $ \frac{3}{3} $ $ \frac{3}{4} $ ... $ \frac{4}{1} $ $ \frac{4}{2} $ $ \frac{4}{3} $ ... $ \frac{5}{1} $ $ \frac{5} {1} $ ... $ \frac{6}{1} $ ... ...
How can infinity - squared possibly be countable , and therefore the same as infinity ?
The first thing to do is to take a deep breath and remember that infinity is not a number .
In fact , the rationals are countable .
To prove this , consider the above table .
Is the table a list of all the positive rationals ?
Consider the general term for a positive rational , $ p / q $ , where both $ p$ and $ q$ are positive .
If it 's on the table , then we know we 've got all the positive rationals there .
( If we had n't , yet $ p / q $ were on the table , there would be a positive rational that can't be represented as $ p / q $ , which is not the case . )
Is it there ?
Yes , it 's on the $ p^{th} $ row in the $ q^ {th} $ column .
So , we have a complete list .
However , trying to count along each row or column in turn gives problems - each row and column is infinitely long , after all , and so we 'll never reach the end of the first to start on the second .
Is there , then , a way of counting them without missing any out ?
Yes .
Just follow the red line in the image below :
So we know we 've counted every rational at least once .
Have we counted them at most once ?
Obviously , we have n't .
1/1 = 2/2 = 3/3 = ... means 1 is the first , fifth and thirteen number in the list .
Why does this matter ?
It 's a good habit to get into , certainly , but more than that it 's useful here to convince ourselves that these sets of numbers are all the same size .
If we do n't check we 're not counting the rationals too many times , what 's to stop there being more natural numbers than there are rational ones ?
Intuitively , this seems to be a fairly silly fear ( after all , the natural numbers are just the first column of the entire table of rationals ) but if you 're not doubting your intuition by this stage , I have n't explained what we 're doing well enough .
We could just check each number we reach against all the previous numbers , making sure it 's not equal to any of them .
That would work , but ignores the fact that the order in which we 're counting these numbers means the first time we meet each one , it 's in its simplest possible form .
Consider our trusty $ p / q$ , in row $ p$ , column $ q $ .
Assume this is the number in its simplest form - $ p $ and $ q$ have no common factors greater than 1 .
The next time we meet the same number , it 'll be $ 2p / 2q $ , which is in row $ 2 p $ , column $ 2q $ , therefore on a diagonal further from our start point .
$ ( n+1 ) p/( n+1 ) q $ is always further along than $n p/n q$ ( if you need convincing , find a formula to tell you which integer is the leftmost point on the diagonal passing through $ y / x $ ) .
So every time we reach a rational not in its simplest form , ignore it .
Hence the positive rationals can be put into one - to - one correspondence with the naturals , and so are countably infinite .
Multiply by $ - 1 $ and we get a similar list of the negative rationals .
Then , just as we did with the integers , start at 0 and interleave the two lists :
Natural numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... Rationals 0 $ \frac{1}{1} $ $ - \frac{1}{1} $ $ \frac{1}{2} $ $ - \frac{1}{2} $ $ \frac{2}{1} $ $ - \frac{2}{1} $ ...
We know we will have every positive and every negative rational , and zero , once and only once .
Thus the natural numbers are countable , the integers are countable and the rationals are countable .
It seems as if everything is countable , and therefore all the infinite sets of numbers you can care to mention - even ones our intuition tells contain more objects than there are natural numbers - are the same size .
This is not the case .
Counting the reals : Cantor 's Diagonal Proof
Are the real numbers countable ?
( The real numbers are all the irrationals - those numbers that cannot be written as one integer divided by another : $ \pi$ , $ \sqrt{2} $ , $e$ , ... - and the rationals together : 1 , 4/5 , $ \pi$ , ...)
Every other set of numbers we 've met so far has been countable .
Each new set of numbers that feels as if it should be larger than the set of the natural numbers has been put into one - to - one correspondence with the natural numbers - all we needed was to work out how to list the numbers sensibly .
The real numbers are made up of the rationals and the irrationals .
The rationals are countable , so if the irrationals are countable then the reals must be countable - just interleave our two systematic lists and we 'll get another systematic list .
For the same reason , if the reals are n't countable , we 'll know that the problem comes with the irrationals .
You 've probably met rational numbers in at least two guises - one is that they can be written as one integer divided by another , and the other is that they can be written as decimal expansions that eventually become repeating patterns .
1/3 = 0 . 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... - the threes repeat forever .
3/8 = 0 . 375 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... - the zeros repeat forever .
22/7 = 3 . 142857 142857 142857 142857 ... - 142857 repeats forever .
In fact , all real numbers can be represented as infinitely long decimal expansions .
The rationals are the ones that eventually repeat and the irrationals are the ones that do n't .
$ \pi$ = 3 . 14159 26535 89793 23846 ... - at no point does a finitely long string of digits start repeating for ever .
Now , suppose the real numbers were countable .
Then we could write a systematic list of all the real numbers .
What is more , we could do it as list of decimal expansions .
( In the following list , $ a_ { ( n , m ) } $ is the $ m^ {th} $ digit along in the $ n^ {th} $ number down the list . )
$ a_ { ( 0,0 ) }. a_{ ( 0,1 ) }a_ { ( 0,2 ) }a_ { ( 0,3 ) }a_ { ( 0,4 ) }a_ { ( 0,5 ) }... $
$ a_ { ( 1,0 ) }. a_ { ( 1,1 ) }a_ { ( 1,2 ) }a_ { ( 1,3 ) }a_ { ( 1,4 ) }a_ { ( 1,5 ) }... $
$ a_ { ( 2,0 ) }. a_ { ( 2,1 ) }a_ { ( 2,2 ) }a_ { ( 2,3 ) }a_ { ( 2,4 ) }a_ { ( 2,5 ) }... $
$ a_ { ( 3,0 ) }. a_ { ( 3,1 ) }a_ { ( 3,2 ) }a_ { ( 3,3 ) }a_ { ( 3,4 ) }a_ { ( 3,5 ) }... $
$ a_ { ( 4,0 ) }. a_ { ( 4,1 ) }a_ { ( 4,2 ) }a_ { ( 4,3 ) }a_ { ( 4,4 ) }a_ { ( 4,5 ) }... $
We might run into trouble with repeating a number without realising it ( 0.9 recurring = 1 , for instance ) but we can just check every number in our list off those that came before .
It might be that the system we use to list the numbers lends itself to a neater method , as we found with the rationals , but even if it does n't , this method will work .
But can we be certain we have n't missed any out ?
One way of answering this question is to assume our list is , in fact , infinitely long .
Then is it possible for it to contain every possible real number ?
The answer is that it is n't .
Not all infinities are , we finally see , the same size .
The problem , however - one raised and answered by Georg Cantor - is how to show this .
How can we write down or describe a number that we know wo n't be on the list ?
Before reading on , take a moment to think about this yourself .
It may help to think back to the title of this section : Cantor 's Diagonal Proof .
Consider the number $ A$ , where $ A = a_{ ( 0,0 ) } .
a_ { ( 1,1 ) }a_ { ( 2,2 ) }...a_{ ( n , n)}...$
( If the list above had started 1.111 ... , 2.222... , 4.379 ... , $ A$ would start 1.27 ... , as 1 is the noughth digit of the noughth number , 2 is the first digit of the first number , and 7 is the second digit of the second number )
Now , letting $ m$ take the value of all the natural numbers ( and zero ) in turn , do the following :
If $ a_ { ( m, m ) }
eq 5 $ , let $ b_{ ( m , m ) } = 5 $ .
If $ a_ { ( m , m ) } = 5 $ , let $ b_{ ( m , m ) } = 7 $ .
Then we have a new number , $ B = b_{ ( 0,0 ) } .
b_ { ( 1,1 ) }b_{ ( 2,2 ) }...b_{ ( n , n)}... $
Is $ B$ on our list ?
Well , it 's not the first number , because the first digits do n't agree ( if the first digit of the first number is n't 5 , then the first digit of $ B$ is .
And if the first digit of the first number is 5 , then the first digit of $ B$ is n't ) .
And it's not the second number , because the second digits do n't agree .
And it 's not the $ n^ {th} $ number , because the $ n^ {th} $ digits do n't agree ...
So $ B$ can't be the first number , and it can't be the second , and it can't be the $ n^ {th} $ , for any value of n , so it is n't on our list .
We could still run into the problem mentioned earlier , that some numbers with recurring digits are the same number , even when the digits are different .
However , this is a problem that only occurs when the digits involved are 0's and 9's , and the digits making up $ B$ were specially chosen so this would not happen .
Therefore , we know that $ B$ is a unique number .
This means the list is n't complete , and can never be complete .
However cunning our system , even if the list is infinitely long it wo n't contain every real number .
This means that we can't count all the real numbers - there are uncountably infinitely many .

Here ’s an interview with John Carmack ( right ) , the last remaining founder of id Software , the legendary video game developer which agreed to be acquired yesterday by another video maker ZeniMax Media .
Texas - based id was one of the last of the major indie developers that made mega - hit titles such as Wolfenstein and Doom .
I talked with Carmack , ZeniMax chief executive Robert Altman , and id Software CEO Todd Hollenshead about why they did the deal and what the future holds for the combined company .
VB : I was trying to figure out how to write some kind of id and ego pun ?
JC : I think you will have a hard time working that one out .
We do n’t have a lot of that .
RA : Not a lot of egos in the room .
We ’re all appreciative of everyone ’s expertise .
No winners or losers .
VB : John , why did you go through the process that ended with the sale of the company ?
JC : We have had offers made to us continuously over the years .
We made changes a couple of years ago where we decided to get away from doing just one project every four years .
There were structural reasons why we had to do that .
There was the pace of technology and how long it took to create a new game technology .
Then there was the time it took to train the game team how to use the technology to make a game .
It was clear that we had to leverage our technology and get things into a pipeline .
All the publishers were telling us that it was wise to license out our intellectual property to get more projects under way at once .
The publishers told us that we would be more valuable to them if we built our team larger .
So we listened to that .
We took games pretty far into development on our own nickel before pitching the publishers .
That ’s what we did with Rage .
That was our plan of record .
VB : Then ZeniMax approached you ?
JC : ZeniMax came with an offer .
The more we looked at it , the more we liked it .
The two obvious choices [ of id buyers ] were Electronic Arts and Activision .
They ’re the two giants of the industry .
But we knew that we would have to go through big corporate changes if we went with them .
We know the developers at the studios owned by those companies .
And while they have good things to say , there is no doubt about it that things would change at a company of that scale .
If we had gone to one of those companies , we would be one more studio .
We would be a prized studio .
But we would n’t even be their only shooter studio .
We would be competing for resources with our brother and sister studios .
There is no question if they have Call of Duty project , there would be some degree of conflict there .
With ZeniMax , they have a lot to be proud of .
Fallout 3 is one of the favorite games of so many of our people .
But they had zero overlap with the things we do .
We do the best shooters in the world .
It ’s a perfect hand and glove fit .
We started talking about this before they rolled out Fallout 3 .
We watch them roll it out worldwide .
They really did what they said they could do .
That was a important in how we looked at this .
They resurrected an old title and really made something big out of it .
We could be a sister company with Bethesda , where we had a lot of mutual respect and admiration .
That was about as good as it could get .
And we could do our games the same way we have been .
The corporate cultures are compatible .
And when we go out to publish the games , now we will be doing that .
We can become a publisher through ZeniMax .
VB : Robert , how did you approach this deal , and how did you figure out a price for id ?
RA : Well , the short answer is that it ’s id Software .
That ’s self explanatory .
I agree with John about the strategic fit .
We have a publishing pipeline that we have created .
We can use id to put additional titles through that pipeline .
That gives us more scale .
When you have an investment in publishing , you can release a series of large - franchise games that you can release each year .
The logic becomes irresistible .
The more we talked on a personal level , we liked these guys .
We had a sense of friendship and an easy working relationship .
Some deals look good on paper and then they do n’t work when you integrate them .
There will be none of that here .
This is something that is going unbelievably smoothly .
We are private entities and we do n’t give out financial information .
VB : Can you say if it was cash or stock ?
RA : ( pictured right ) :
We wo n’t disclose that .
VB : You raised money .
Was this kind of deal what you had in mind when you raised the money ?
RA : In 2007 , we did a transaction with Providence Equity Partners in Rhode Island .
They invested $ 300 million .
We did n’t have id in mind specifically .
We had a great deal of cash and were profitable .
We knew with an additional pool of capital , there were expansion opportunities that could help us reach our goals faster .
We did n’t have that money earmarked for anything in particular .
You want to compete effectively on a worldwide basis .
To do that , you have to spend tens of millions of dollars on development expenses , tens of millions of dollars on marketing , and a lot of money on costs of goods .
That ’s before any money rolls in .
So you need a lot of capital to compete effectively with large players .
VB : What are you going to do to grow now , John ?
JC : We already had a plan in place .
We will add a third major development team .
We started with the Quake Live team , which had less than a dozen people .
The idea was to get them through the Quake Live project .
Then we will take them through an intermediate step of doing multiplayer work for Rage ( right ) and Doom 4 .
They can get familiar with our technology there .
Then we will take one of our main intellectual properties and assign it to them .
It ’s not clear what that is .
And that ’s all we wanted : three teams .
It ’s not as if we wanted to create four , five and six teams .
We have two teams doing big titles now .
We have our mobile teams doing other work .
But we ’ll add that third major team over a period of time that we can foresee .
VB : How many people do you have and when will you hit the peak ?
JC : We have 105 now .
The ramp up wo n’t be done this year .
We hope we do n’t lose anybody .
We wo n’t intentionally lose anybody .
We will continue to look for the best talent .
VB : Where are your games committed ?
JC : The current title Rage is committed to EA Partners .
That ’s our only in - development commitment .
We have a mobile game committed to EA Mobile .
All future titles are ours .
TH ( right ) : The current Wolfenstein title that Raven is developing will be published by Activision .
The existing publishing relationships are not changing at all .
We do our deals one at a time , rather than giving publishers sequel rights .
Future publishing of titles like Doom 4 will be done by Bethesda .
VB : I know you are happy with the deal .
I wonder , John , if you feel some sadness that id will go away as an independent entity .
How do you feel about that whole trend about indie developers being squeezed in the game industry ?
JC : I would say I am a remarkably unsympathetic person .
I am a forward looking optimist .
I never reminisce about the good old days because the good old days are right now .
VB : Will a lot of indie studios become part of larger organizations ?
JC : I am not an industry pundit .
I ’m a heads - down engineering guy .
Valve has strength and Epic has strength .
I do n’t thinki either of them are in endangered positions .
But I do think it is harder to be a triple A independent developer now than it was five years ago .
I do n’t see that getting better .
There are some things that are exciting for distributors .
I love Apple ’s AppStore and the things people can do with digital distribution .
It ’s harder for someone to found a triple A game studio now .
VB : Will Doom Resurrection be out on the iPhone soon ?
JC : It was submitted today .
The Apple process is still opaque for us .
They owe us one for what happened at the keynote .
VB : Did the timing of Doom 4 affect this deal ?
JC : We were happy with funding Rage on our own nickel for years .
We intended to do the same with Doom 4 .
We had offers early on for Rage .
People offered us X million dollars .
But we carried the risk and when we finally signed a deal , it was X plus $ 10 million .
We had planned to do the exact same thing for Doom 4 .
Our plan was to show things to publishers late this year but we would n’t sign a publishing deal until next year .
Lots of things were going great .
The timing of this deal was just when we got it done .
VB : Robert , are you looking for more deals now ?
Are you able to publish a major game every year ?
RA : We expect to have more than one major game each year .
For 2010 , for instance , which does n’t include Rage , we have Fallout New Vegas ( right ) and Brink .
We expect a series of blockbuster releases each year .
Every deal depends on circumstance and opportunity .
We continue to look .
We will do things that make strategic sense .
But we are n’t under any pressure to do anything more .
VB : Thank you .
Marc Weber Tobias is a lock breaker .
It 's what he does for a living , the way he makes some of his money and much of his name .
But for a guy like Tobias , it 's far more than a job .
Hacking locks , when you pick your targets , can be a sort of geek revenge - as - hobby , an adolescent life view morphing into a dangerous adult obsession .
And like addiction , obsession does n't need provocation .
It needs an excuse .
Tobias ' excuse , the way he remembers it , was that he was pissed off at Japan — the country , in general — because the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor had come and gone without a formal apology from the Japanese government .
He was also aware that one of Japan 's more prominent lock companies , Showa , was making significant inroads into the US hotel lock market .
So therefore Showa , Tobias reasoned , was a legitimate target .
Never mind that the brand name for a magnetic hotel lock has no more relationship to the reign of Emperor Hirohito or the bombing of the US Pacific fleet than Alamo Rent A Car has to the bloodline of Davy Crockett —
Marc had decided to take it personally , and ensure that , for Showa at least , December 7 , 1994 , would be a day that would live on in infamy .
He drove from his frozen home in South Dakota to the warm sands of Southwestern Florida and checked into a hotel equipped with Showa locks .
His plan was to right this historic wrong — to activate his superpower , Hulk out , and smash their puny company .
But first , of course , his inner Bruce Banner had to learn how to hack the Showa lock .
The hotel lock Showa made at the time was a variant of the familiar type you 'd find outside most modern hotel rooms , the kind where a credit card - shaped key slides into a slot .
The design was simple , elegant , and straight - forward , and solved a specific problem .
For generations , hotels had suffered from the problem of lost or stolen room keys .
Replacing the keys not only cost hotels money and time , but also opened them up to all sorts of liability — at any given moment , they had no idea how many people out there had keys to the rooms of their sleeping guests .
Unless they replaced each lock after each guest , a hotel could be on the hook for hundreds of potential home invasions .
The Showa credit card - style keys solved the key - loss problem .
Unlike physical keys , they were programmable and reprogrammable — and inscrutable , too , because you could n't just take them to a hardware store and make a copy .
The reason was magnets .
Each of the credit card - like keys was imprinted with a unique fingerprint of small , round magnets , each with a north ( or positive ) or south ( or negative ) polarity .
These magnets , N or S , were arranged across the card like dots on a domino .
Each domino configuration represented a unique key code .
Each room lock had its own unique arrangements of dots .
A lock 's magnet pattern was exactly the same arrangement as the one on its corresponding credit card key , but with the opposite polarity , like a photograph and its negative .
Slide the right key into the right lock and the magnetic spots in the lock would pair up with the magnetic spots on the card ; you 'd get a green light , and click — the door would open .
With this system , you did n't have to shell out to a locksmith every time you lost a key .
Instead , you 'd use a little electromagnetic zapper at the hotel 's front desk .
The zapper programmed the domino dots on the credit card key , so that they matched up with the magnets inside a specific room lock .
Change the dots and you change the key ; turn the magnets off together and the key was junk .
Key loss problem solved .
But a Marc Tobias problem created .
To torpedo the lock company , Tobias needed to demonstrate that its tech was junk — and that any hotel using that technology had a finger in the dyke of corporate liability .
To prove his tech junk idea , Tobias needed to come up with a low - fi hack that could beat the lock .
If Tobias wanted to hack into one room , he 'd need to copy the magnetic fingerprint of the individual room lock .
But Tobias wanted to show that the locks , the entire lock system , was worthless .
So what he needed was a hack that would open every single room in the whole hotel .
He needed to hack the Showa master key .
Tobias theorized that while every lock in the hotel system was unique , all of them must share a common piece of code .
This common piece of code would be the master key that would be able to open all of the doors in the hotel .
He looked at each room key as a master key — each of which also had extra , unique information that would code specifically for one room and not the others .
The wrong extra information essentially told a lock not to open , but * no* additional information told the lock nothing .
This is why a master key , which has no additional code , opens everything — a concept familiar to anyone who 's been walked in on by housekeeping .
If Tobias could collect enough room keys , he could compare their magnetic signatures and see what they had in common .
Separate the common code from the extra information of individual room codes and voilà — he had a blueprint for a master key .
In theory it was easy .
But what was the next step ?
Every Marc Weber Tobias problem is built with the basic assumption that all locks , however complicated , can be broken down into a series of simple steps ; confront each in turn and you may break the lock .
Now Tobias sat on the rented bedspread of Deerfield Beach Hotel , staring at the lock , breaking it down step - by - step in his mind .
He knew he needed to compare the magnetic fingerprints of dozens of locks , which meant he first needed to collect those dozens of magnet fingerprints from locks up and down the hallway .
This meant that he needed to invent a fast - and - dirty Showa hotel lock decoder , one small enough to fit through a credit card - sized key slot , and one smart enough to read those magnets , record the data , and present it all back to him .
And he had to do it himself in his Florida hotel room .
Tobias stewed over the problem over complimentary breakfasts of mini boxes of cereal and cranny - less English Muffins , during early - bird dinners of rib tips and tap water , which usually ended with him eking out a tip using a calculator .
At night he sat on the rented sheets , staring at the credit card key , turning it over in his hand .
What sort of technology could he make himself that was as thin as a playing card and could decode a magnetic lock ?
The answer was , duh , videotape .
In fact , duh , when you thought about it , of course videotape , because that 's exactly what videotape is for , reading and copying magnetic signatures .
What he needed specifically was old - school , magnetic , pre-Betamax television tape .
At an archaic 2 inches wide , it is the mei fun noodle of magnetic tape , more than big enough to read a credit card - sized magnetic domino .
Tobias drove around the unfamiliar town until he found a box of the stuff at a local pawn shop .
Then he stopped off at a craft shop and stocked up on glue sticks and scissors , X - Acto knives and razor blades , spool wire and hard plastic .
Then Tobias squirreled himself back in his hotel room to fix snippets of film onto 12 hard plastic cards .
And late that night , after perving down his hallway left and right to ensure he was alone and not on camera , Tobias tested his decoder on his own rented door .
And it worked — sorta .
Yes , sliding magnetic tape into the lock slot recorded a magnetic snapshot .
But the act of sliding it in and out gave him the equivalent of a blurry picture .
The result was imprecise enough to be useless .
Tobias sat in his room for a whole day , idly flipping through the cable package , waiting for the answer .
Again and again , he came across old movies in which fedora - wearing press photographers used the old - style cameras — the kind where the unexposed film negative is encased in a sliding light shield .
Click - click , open - closed , they got a picture .
It was stupid , obvious even .
It always is .
Tobias had been trying to take a photograph without a shutter .
His missing killer app was 100 years old .
He built his prototype hotel lock magnet decoder and waited .
Nothing is so dead as a Saturday afternoon in a Florida hotel , when business travelers are home and vacation travelers are beaching .
The hallways belonged to Tobias .
He trolled the carpet with ribbons of old - school magnetic tape encased in his jerry - rigged shutter , a long thin metal wallet with a sliding sunroof .
He tiptoed door to door , in and out , stuffing each sample into his coat before trotting back to his own room .
Then Tobias spread his samples on the tightly made bed and started decoding the magnetic dot configurations with his handy traveling Gauss Meter .
Each of the samples was different , but all of them had one small section of magnetic dots in common , just as he'd theorized .
That section had to be the master key .
Tobias razored thin rounds off a small kitchen magnet and glued the shavings onto a plastic card , one on each of the common spots he believed to be the master key code .
The finished product did n't look like much , sort of a Frankenstein credit card with ladybug acne .
But when the glue dried he could walk down any hall in the hotel , opening doors at random .
He owned the place , him and this ugly stick in his pocket .
Nobody was there .
Nobody cheered .
Nobody witnessed Tobias hulk out and go green and wield a little piece of plastic which could take down a company .
In fact , as Tobias remembers it , it was about six months later when the company lawyers asked what it would take for this particular Marc Weber Tobias problem to go away .
The lawyer thinking : money , a contract , something with a number .
It was mid-spring in South Dakota , but Tobias was still hooked on the Pearl Harbor thing .
So Tobias said , simple :
All he needed was for the Emperor of Japan to formally apologize to George Bush .
It did n't happen of course , it never does — Tobias has done a couple of the nationalistic torpedo things , targeting French and English companies for WWII debts and the Boston Tea Party respectively , and damn it , they never seem to work out as dramatically as you 'd like , no lawyers jigging to hornpipes , no reparations or apologies or boatloads of Vichy Francs .
Tobias would have to be content with the consolation that Showa no longer does business in the United States .
And that nobody would have to stay in another hotel room , protected by a magnetic lock of such a stupid domino design .

Favre , who is nearly 40 , said his decision was made after consulting with former coaches Mike Holmgren and Andy Reid , and despite the lobbying efforts of Vikings players .
Adrian Peterson , Jared Allen and Steve Hutchinson made phone calls or sent text messages in what one source described as Minnesota 's " full - court press " to convince Favre to sign the previously negotiated one - year , $ 10 million contract .
But Favre rejected the Vikings on more than one occasion in the past week .
Last Monday , Favre informed offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell , a former Green Bay assistant coach and a close friend , he thought playing again was too risky and that he would remain retired .
When Favre told Bevell he was n't sure his body could endure a full season , Bevell pleaded with him to reconsider , and Favre consented but could " never get over the mental hump . "
" It was a rare and unique opportunity to consider adding not only a future Hall of Fame quarterback but one that is very familiar with our system and division , " Vikings head coach Brad Childress said in a statement .
" That does not detract from the team that we have .
As we have consistently communicated , we feel good about our team and they have put forth a tremendous effort this offseason preparing for the season ahead .
With this behind us , we look forward to getting to Mankato and getting training camp underway . "
Favre underwent arthroscopic surgery to release a partially torn biceps tendon in his passing shoulder , a painful injury that contributed to his tying for the NFL lead in interceptions last season .
The surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews proved beneficial .
But , ultimately , Favre feared that the pain that emerged in his ankles and knee from previous injuries created too much uncertainty .
He was concerned that the pain might never subside and could continue to worsen , and he understood that signing and reporting to camp and then leaving prematurely would result in criticism over his decision to play again .
" The problem with playing in every game for 16 or 17 years is that people think there 's nothing wrong with you and you can play forever , " he said .
" The things that bothered me , bothered me a little more .
It takes longer to recover -- if you do recover . "
Favre also said on Tuesday that he enjoys working out with the kids of Oak Grove High School -- where his nephew is going to be a senior -- and will continue to do so .
But contrary to reports , he is not throwing with the intention of returning to the league .
The decision is a stunning blow for the Vikings , who openly courted Favre all summer .
Adding Favre would have been viewed by many as the final piece for a team that already has star running back Peterson and a stingy veteran defense that returns nearly intact from last year 's NFC North championship season .
" When I heard the news , I was probably as surprised and shocked as everybody else , " linebacker Ben Leber told The Associated Press in a phone interview .
" The writing on the wall was as long as his arm was healthy he was going to play .
I thought it was just a contractual deal that was taking so long and I really expected him to be at camp .
So I was really surprised . "
Now Childress has some damage control to do with Tarvaris Jackson and Sage Rosenfels , the two veterans who were expected to compete for the job before the Favre drama began for a second straight year .
Jackson and Rosenfels were peppered with questions about Favre during the team 's minicamps this summer .
It was a testy situation already for them to deal with , and now they will likely face a whole new set of inquiries with the job up for grabs all over again .
Jackson 's agent , Joel Segal , said he spoke to his client shortly after the news broke .
" He was his usual cool , calm and collected self , " Segal said .
" He said , ' Great , let 's get ready for camp . ' "
Vikings players will begin arriving in Mankato for training camp on Wednesday , with a mandatory reporting day of Thursday and the first practice on Friday .

Why should they get a state ?
Modern Palestinian demand for state stems from anti-Semitic desire to harass Jews
Hagai Segal
Our independence celebrations this year will be held against the backdrop of the upcoming Palestinian independence .
We are the only state in the world excited ahead of the establishment of an enemy state .
Some groups around here are already planning huge parties .
To our new government ’s credit , it ’s not taking part in the celebrations .
As opposed to the previous government , it does not show religious longing to the 1967 borders .
However , it ’s making life easy for itself by focusing on reciting the security risks posed to us by the Mitchell plan : A second Hamastan , Qassam rocket attacks on central Israel , the right of return , etc .

Netanyahu and his people are in fact admitting that the Palestinians deserve a state , but they claim that it wo n’t be safe enough to have one , and therefore it cannot be established now ; perhaps we can do it later .

It appears that even the most right - wing Likudniks ran out of the courage to question the basic assumptions entrenched here by the Left .
Only 30 - 40 years ago , we were arguing whether there ’s even such thing as a Palestinian people , and today there are almost no reservations over its demand for complete sovereignty .
Its sophisticated PR agents managed to bring it into the family of nations via a fast tracked registration procedure .
As opposed to what is customarily required , it was not required to present documents that prove longtime existence , cultural uniqueness , and previous experience in running a country .

Yeshayahu Leibowitz once ruled that even a kitchen table is allowed to present itself as a people , and the Palestinians jumped on the bandwagon of this simplistic criterion .
However , even Leibowitz refrained from arguing that every fresh nation immediately deserves a state .
After all , earth is too small to contain all the different desires for sovereignty of the people who live here .

Anti-Semitic trick
The Kurds , for example , a people boasting a rich history and numbering 25 million souls , are forced to get by without a state of their own .
The Basques , Catalonians , Corsicans , and Scots also have no state .
Even the Native Americans , Flemish , the Copts and the Maronites have no state .
Therefore , it is quite odd that it is precisely the absence of a Palestinian state that preoccupies the international community and the Israeli consciousness .

With all the giant states in the Middle East , it is the Jewish State that is required to share with the Palestinians the little territory that we have .
Instead of our neighboring countries crowding a little more in favor of their repressed brethren , we are the only ones required to make do with less territory .

Twitter is internet cancer .
It 's just a devolution of our society into one line messages .
Peter R. Orszag , Director
This morning , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) analyzed proposals to shift more decision - making out of politics and toward a body like the Independent Medicare Advisory Council ( IMAC ) put forward by the Administration .
CBO noted that this type of approach could lead to significant long - term savings in federal spending on health care and that the available evidence implies that a substantial share of spending on health care contributes little , if anything , to the overall health of the nation .
This supports what President Obama has said all along : we can reduce waste and unnecessary spending without reducing quality of care and benefits .
In part because legislation under consideration already includes substantial savings in Medicare over the next decade , CBO found modest additional medium - term savings from this proposal -- $ 2 billion over 10 years .
The point of the proposal , however , was never to generate savings over the next decade .
( Indeed , under the Administration ’s approach , the IMAC system would not even begin to make recommendations until 2015 . )
Instead , the goal is to provide a mechanism for improving quality of care for beneficiaries and reducing costs over the long term .
In other words , in the terminology of our belt - and - suspenders approach to a fiscally responsible health reform , the IMAC is a game changer not a scoreable offset .
With regard to the long - term impact , CBO suggested that the proposal , with several specific tweaks that would strengthen its operations , could generate significant savings .
( The potential modifications included items such as providing mandatory funding for the council , rather than having the council rely on the annual appropriations cycle , and requiring independent verification of the expected reductions in program spending rather than relying only on the Medicare actuaries for such verification , along with other suggestions , such as including an across - the - board reduction in payments as a fallback mechanism if the council did not produce proposals that generated adequate savings . )
And if you look back at recent history , one can see why an empowered advisory council would be useful .
For example , for the better part of this decade , MedPAC has recommended reducing overpayments to insurance companies for Medicare Advantage plans – to equate those payments with the cost of covering the same beneficiary under traditional Medicare .
Yet , nothing happened , costing taxpayers tens of billions of dollars .
We ca n’t afford that type of inertia .
The bottom line is that it is very rare for CBO to conclude that a specific legislative proposal would generate significant long - term savings so it is noteworthy that , with some modifications , CBO reached such a conclusion with regard to the IMAC concept .
A final note is worth underscoring .
As a former CBO director , I can attest that CBO is sometimes accused of a bias toward exaggerating costs and underestimating savings .
Unfortunately , parts of today ’s analysis from CBO could feed that perception .
For example , and without specifying precisely how the various modifications would work , CBO somehow concluded that the council could " eventually achieve annual savings equal to several percent of Medicare spending ...[ which ] would amount to tens of billions of dollars per year after 2019 . "
Such savings are welcome ( and rare ! ) , but it is also the case that ( for good reason ) CBO has restricted itself to qualitative , not quantitative , analyses of long - term effects from legislative proposals .
In providing a quantitative estimate of long - term effects without any analytical basis for doing so , CBO seems to have overstepped .

NASA fondly remembers veteran broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite who died July 17 at his home .
He was 92 . " From the earliest days of the space program , Walter brought the excitement , the drama and the achievements of space flight directly into our homes , " said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden .
( › Full Statement Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong said Cronkite " had a passion for human space exploration , an enthusiasm that was contagious , and the trust of his audience .
He will be missed . " ( › Full Statement Cronkite was admired for his enthusiastic coverage of America 's technological prowess , especially NASA 's space missions , from the early Mercury launches , through the ground - breaking Gemini missions , to the subsequent moon landings and the space shuttle program .
From the beginning of America 's manned space program to the age of the space shuttle , Cronkite anchored CBS Evening News .
He was on air during the launch of Apollo 11 , shouting " go , baby , go " as it rocketed into space .
His marathon , live coverage of the first manned mission to Moon brought the excitement and impact of the historic event into the homes of millions of Americans and observers around the world .
He spent 27 of the next 30 hours on the air .
In a 1996 interview with Kira Albin , Cronkite opined that " the whole period of the '60s changed a lot of us ; there was never a decade like that in American history ... to have the decade capture one of the great accomplishments of this century : man landing on the moon .
That will be the one event of the 20th century , despite all the other great scientific and technological innovations and inventions that came down the line , that will live in history 500 years from now .

In honor of his iconic coverage of America 's space program , NASA presented Cronkite with an Ambassador of Exploration Award on Feb. 28 , 2006 at a ceremony in Austin , Texas .
He was the only Ambassador of Exploration recipient who was not an astronaut or NASA employee .
Calling the honor , " beyond anything I could have ever believed , " Cronkite said he wanted to share it with his fellow journalists who covered the great adventure of space exploration .
" It 's hard for us to really understand the immensity so far of the conquest of space , " he said .
At the awards ceremony , Cronkite drew parallels between Apollo 11 and Christopher Columbus ' 1492 landing on the Americas : " I think that 500 years from now the young people that are living on space stations and space cities and perhaps on the orbs themselves out there ... they will be recognizing the most important feat of all time .
500 years from now they will be celebrating the first landing on the moon and the first walk on the moon .
"
He also quipped that the Apollo 11 landing was the only time he'd ever been left speechless -- " What I said was ' Gosh !
Wow ! Gee !' -- immortal words obviously . "

At UFC 41 , a young Frank Mir got to welcome old school UFC legend Tank Abbott back to the Octagon after a five year layoff .
Mir was coming off a loss to journeyman English brawler Ian Freeman .
It 's widely believed that Mir was sent in to lose to Tank by the Zuffa brass who wanted to leverage his popularity with the old school UFC audience that had abandoned the promotion during the Dark Ages .
0:46 later , Frank Mir had put the kibosh on those plans with a submission hold not often seen in MMA : the Toe Hold or Foot Lock . *
After taking the fight to the ground by pulling guard , Mir immediately attacked the floundering Abbott with a flurry of submission attempts .
From a triangle attempt , he moved into an omaplata , giving him control over Tank 's right arm with his legs .
From there he spun his body around and attacked Tank 's right leg , locking the foot in a figure four grip and getting the tap out .
From Luke Thomas :
Toe holds are hard to finish , that 's why you do n't seem them very often .
It 's partly that Tank is weak on the ground and I know people will howl , but the reality is Mir is using a butt load of strength .
Truth is Mir is strong as shit .
Not as strong as Lesnar , but he has really nasty submissions because he leverages so much power .
Note how Mir finishes
Tank with both of his shoulder blades pinned to the mat .
That 's technique , but with a lot of brute force behind it .
He 's turning the ankle with the hold , but he's not using his body at all to finish nor any special angle , just powering the ankle into breaking .
The Bas Rutten video ( see full entry ) shows Bas using angles on the toehold to finish where Mir just cranked it .
What Bas is doing puts pressure on the knee as well .
It reminds me of a Sambo or catch wrestling variation , what you 'd expect him to learn in Pancrase .
Most BJJ practicioners learn toe holds from the oma plata , but it 's hard to finish .
The opponent will squirm both to free his legs and arms .
You 've got to be quick and crank it fast to get the tap out .
Mir is both
This performance was one of the early Frank Mir fights that set the MMA world buzzing .
Here was a heavyweight with the speed and skill to apply submissions like a lightweight .
In recent years we 've seen Mir broaden his game to include a more robust striking skill - set , but its telling that he beat Brock Lesnar and revived his career with a submisison .
* According to Leland Roling 's analysis of the FightFinder database : Only 115 fights ( out of approx .
62,600 ) have been won via Toe Hold .
There are probably others that were called Ankle Lock or Footlock but that only accounts for another 204 fights .

On the left you can see Mir 's legs locked in a figure four to seal the omaplata he 's got on Tank 's right shoulder .
He 's torquing Tank 's foot and putting immense pressure on the ankle .
Tank 's attempt to spin his left leg over is irrelevant and does nothing to relieve the pressure .
Sorry I do n't have a gif of Frank spinning from the omaplata to take the leg .
Here 's more on the toe hold from Riz's Martial Arts :
Sometimes referred to simply as a ‘ Foot Lock ' , the Toe Hold Ankle Lock is a submission that is applied via the twisting and applying torque around one 's instep and the axis that runs along the centre of the foot .
It is easy to apply and worlds safer than the Heel Hook ; as such , it is the second most frequently used ankle lock ( following the Achilles Lock ) and probably one of the most popular leg locks used .
The submission is applied using both your arms .
In the case of applying the submission to your opponent 's ( who has his / her back to the ground ) right leg , your right arm grasps his right foot with your hands placed over his toes ( your fingers should be curling in below his foot ) .
Your left hand should move in front of his shin and wrap around his leg ( thus encircling it with your arm ) and then grab on to your right wrist using a five finger ‘ monkey ' grip .
Using the left arm as a fulcrum , apply pressure by pushing down on the foot / turning your body and twisting the toes towards your opponent 's groin .
From Wikipedia :
A toe hold involves using the hands to hyperextend and / or hyperrotate the ankle , typically by grabbing the foot near the toes , and twisting or pushing the foot while controlling the opponent 's leg .
A common type of toe hold is the figure - four toe hold , where a figure - four hold is used to hold the opponent 's foot .
This type of toe hold is performed by holding the foot by the toes with one hand , and putting the other hand under the opponent 's achilles tendon , and grabbing the wrist .
By controlling the opponent 's body , and using the hands to plantar flex the foot either straight or slightly sideways , hence putting considerable torque on the ankle .
The toe hold can also be applied in a similar position as an Ankle Lock ( as in Ashiyubi Jime in Danzan Ryu Jujitsu ) .

Here 's Bas Rutten explaining the toe hold :
WASHINGTON  Judge Sonia Sotomayor completed her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday , acknowledging regret for having said that a “ wise Latina ” judge could decide a case better than a white man while defending her role in a case involving New Haven firefighters in which she was reversed by the Supreme Court .
But over her four days in the witness chair , Judge Sotomayor provided Republicans little ammunition with which to block the Senate from approving her elevation to the Supreme Court , where she would become the nation ’s first Hispanic justice .
Senior Republican staff aides said in interviews they expected that at least one and perhaps as many as three of the panel ’s seven Republicans might vote to approve the Sotomayor nomination and send it to the full Senate , which is expected to confirm her in the first week in August .
Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont and the committee chairman , has scheduled a vote for next Tuesday , but Republicans on the panel have indicated they will ask the vote be delayed a week until July 28 .
I had been in something of a catatonic state when I picked up the papers last Thursday morning , but as I looked down at the front pages I was suddenly wide awake .
Staring out at me was a picture of Anthony Blunt – whose memoir after 25 years under lock and key had finally been released by the British Library .
Looking at it , my mind was transported back to a crisp morning in 1994 : I was 11 years old and about to learn for the first time of the figure whose cool absent gaze stared back at me .
That was n't the only occasion I had been called to the school office in the few short terms that I 'd been enrolled there , but it is one I still remember .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Where were you at prayers this morning ? " my headmistress asked , pushing her half - rimmed spectacles to the end of her nose , as my gaze darted between the ceiling and my purple Doctor Marten boots .
" Reading a book in the loo , " I admitted , slumping in the chair and getting prepared for a severe dressing down .
" Thank God , " she replied , to my bemusement : " I am so very , very pleased . "
Apparently , in my absence a colourful member of the local church , who had been invited to address the girls at school assembly , had – quite out of the blue and for reasons that were never fully explained – launched a scathing tirade aimed at Blunt who , along with my grandfather Kim Philby , Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean , had served as Soviet operatives during the Cold War .
I may have been young but I already knew a fair amount about the notorious Cambridge Spies , and enough to realise that by pure accident of birth , as the daughter of Kim 's eldest son , John , I had in some small way become embroiled in one of the biggest scandals in British history .
By the time I was born in 1983 , my grandfather was firmly ensconced in a small modest flat several floors above ground level , in central Moscow .
I remember thinking that day in school how strange it was trying to equate the Kim Philby I knew , the soft - eyed old man with a mischievous grin , who I always seemed to remember wearing a dressing gown – my Grandpa – with that people talked of : a much - loathed public figure who as head of the anti-Soviet section of the British Secret Intelligence Service had betrayed his country .
I 'd known from the very beginning that Kim was n't quite like my friends ' grandpas , those who would join in at birthday parties and Christmas dinners , but he was still pretty normal to me : the man who would play epic games of chess with my dad over several glasses of whisky , when we visited him in Moscow , while I 'd scuttled around on the carpet next to them with a waste paper bin on my head .
He was the one who'd bellow : " Who 's been sitting in my chair ? " when he returned to the living room to find that I had deliberately crumpled up the pillow on his favourite armchair while he went to refill his glass in the kitchen .
Yet when I think back on it now , the grandfather I knew was never truly extricable from that of the notorious double agent known as the Third Man .
One of my favourite images of my grandfather is from the end of one of our visits to Moscow , when he and my dad were shoved into a cupboard at the airport and passed a bottle of vodka to keep them compliant while members of staff frantically tried to work around the fact that they had accidentally scheduled my parents and I on the same flight back to London as the British ambassador , who was wafting around the terminal in a pinstripe suit .
The next time we tried to leave Russia at the end of a family visit , I recall being speeded down the motorway to the airport in the lane reserved for senior officials and visiting dignatories in an unmarked car , with pleated grey curtains pulled around the windows and a flashing blue light ; we certainly did n't miss that flight .

Yet there are simpler memories too , like packing my bear - fur coat and matching hat for a trip to see Kim and presenting him with jars of Colman 's mustard and pots of Marmite .
Once settled in his flat , where two polished guns hung above the sofa in the living room , we would spread the marmite across hunks of heavy black bread , which almost broke my jaw as I attempted to chew .
In fact , some of my favourite childhood memories derive from those holidays : afternoons spent with my mum at the bear park across the road from Kim 's flat , so - called because of the great carved wooden animals that stood in the playground .
Then there were the overnight trips to Leningrad on the sleeper train , and being given a small gift to take home at the end of our stay with Grandpa .
On one occasion , Kim presented me with a series of beautifully painted Russian dolls , which still stand on my mantelpiece today , next to a book on Karl Marx , which he had sent to my maternal grandfather , Basil , soon after my birth , along with a four - page , hand - typed letter to my mother 's father , whom he'd never had the opportunity to meet .
These glimpses of a man I never had the chance to talk to as an adult provide a small but intimate insight into the person behind the mask , for this is the man who I am truly interested in , not the masterspy .
But there could always have been more hints , further clues to who he really was , and so it is with a degree of personal interest – and also some sense of trepidation – that I read the numerous articles that continue to appear about Kim on an almost weekly basis .
The ones I like best are the anecdotal , which say something about his character , preferably his quintessential Englishness .
My favourite clipping of all time came earlier this year amidst reports on the MP expenses scandal .
A list of Kim's own claims for a number of personal items mislaid in 1940 while working as a war correspondent in France was published .
It included : a camel hair overcoat , a Dunhill cigarette lighter ( " six years old but all the better for it " ) and pig-skin gloves .
To me that says so much .
Obviously the majority of reports involving my grandfather are slightly less enjoyable to read , but I have never found myself begrudging any of these or judging Kim based on them ; one thing I have gleaned from conversations I 've had with my own father and others who knew Kim , is that for good or for bad , he was a proud man , and one who chose to publicly stand by his actions .
While he made a choice that few – if any – can really claim to fully understand , and one which had dire consequences for the friends and colleagues he betrayed , Kim was prepared to face the repercussions of what he did – either because he felt that was the right thing to do or because it was about saving face .
Either way , I 'm not sure that it matters .
Whether , when at the end of it all he sat back and reflected on the choices he'd made during his life , he did feel any doubt about the decisions he'd made , we will never know , but one thing is for sure : he would never have asked for absolution , so I should never expect that on his behalf .
But unfortunately , it seems , the same cannot be said for the man whose face I found staring back at me last Thursday morning as I scoured the headlines .
Anthony Blunt , during the course of his carefully constructed 30,000 - word memoir , written several years after he was publicly outed as the Fourth Man in 1979 and published decades after his death , does his best to redeem himself in the eyes of those who he had betrayed , to admonish his own guilt , without ever actually genuinely apologising for the actions which he goes on to describe as the " biggest mistake of my life " .
At one stage , Blunt blames the negative influence of the " extraordinarily persuasive " Guy Burgess , his student at Cambridge who recruited him to the Soviet cause in 1934 , before turning on his own political " naivety " .
Never really does he seem to accept personal responsibility for his actions .
Furthermore , Blunt waited until after his own passing and that of his Cambridge cohorts to release these claims ; while it is hard to speak of " the honourable thing to do " in a story that is bound with deceit and betrayal , it might at the very least have been brave if Blunt had , once exposed , stood up and admitted that what he had done had been a mistake if that 's really what he thought .
No one would have then been expected to pat him on the back and forgive him all just on the basis of an apology , but at least in his own mind he would have known he'd taken on the chin a long series of decisions which he says caused him so much grief in later years that he had " contemplated suicide " ( ironically , he says he thought better of it as that would have been a " cowardly " decision ) .
Instead , in his diaries , Blunt attempts to pass the buck .
This , in my mind , only serves to lose him whatever remaining admirers he might have had .
While few may applaud the decisions my grandfather made in his lifetime , at least in his autobiography , My Silent War – which was published while he was still alive , in contrast to Blunt 's manuscript which was only released once he and the men involved in his story were dead and buried – my grandfather stands by the choices he made , never once asking for forgiveness or for pity .
And so it should be .
After all , he , like Blunt , chose to live by the sword .
One key difference between my grandfather and Blunt is that at the end of it all , holed up in a pokey flat in Moscow with few if any trophies to speak of – and perhaps a lot less than the Soviets had promised him , Kim accepted his lot .
And that at least must count for something .
These men after all were professional gamblers among other things , and someone who makes their career taking risks has to be prepared to take the fall when it all comes crashing down .

What 's worse than graduating from college with no job and no prospects of finding one anytime soon ?
Graduating from college with no job , no prospects and thousands of dollars in student loans .
That 's the grim outlook for thousands of graduates who are looking for work in a take - no - prisoners job market .
The average undergraduate leaves college with more than $ 22,000 in debt .
Many graduate and professional students leave with loan balances of $ 100,000 or more .
Most borrowers are required to start repaying the loans within six months after graduation .
If you 're unemployed or suffering other economic hardship , you can apply to have payments deferred for up to three years .
But depending on the type of loan , interest may continue to accrue during that period , which means you 'll have an even bigger balance when you resume payments .
Starting July 1 , borrowers will have a new option : a repayment program that caps monthly payments based on income .
It targets borrowers who would have a hard time paying basic living expenses if they had to make standard monthly payments on their loans , says Lauren Asher , acting president for the Project on Student Debt .
Under the income - based repayment program , such borrowers will never have to spend more than 15 % of their discretionary income — an amount based on federal poverty guidelines — on student loan payments .
Most who qualify for the program wo n't spend more than 10 % of their income on student loans .
Those whose income falls below 150 % of the poverty level ( see box ) wo n't be required to make any payments , Asher says .
STUDENT LOANS :
You 're never too old for financial aid MOUNTING DEBT : Many college graduates struggle to repay student loans PAYING FOR COLLEGE : Tips on where to look for scholarships
Here 's an example of how it would work : Suppose you have $ 30,000 in student loans , and you estimate that your 2009 income will be $ 25,000 .
Assuming your loans have a fixed interest rate of 6.8 % , your monthly payment under the income - based repayment program would be $ 110 , vs. $ 345 under a standard 10 - year repayment plan .
If your income rises in the future , your payments will , too .
For some borrowers , the reduced payments wo n't cover the interest on their loans .
For those with subsidized Stafford loans — which are provided to students who demonstrate economic hardship — the government will pay the interest for the first three years of the program .
For unsubsidized loans , the interest will be added to the balance , so you could come out of the program with a larger loan balance .
However , any amount you owe after 25 years of qualifying payments will be forgiven .
This is significant , because in the past , it was nearly impossible for borrowers to get out from under their student loan debts .
Under current bankruptcy laws , borrowers must demonstrate " undue hardship " before a bankruptcy court will discharge a student loan , a costly and difficult standard to meet .
" Most folks will see their incomes rise , and most will pay ( the student loan ) off , but for those who can't , there is a light at the end of the tunnel , " Asher says .
Not all qualify Unfortunately , not all borrowers are eligible to participate in the income - based repayment plan , even if they 're experiencing economic hardship .
You 're ineligible if : • You have private student loans .
The income - based repayment program is limited to federal Stafford , Grad Plus and federal consolidated loans .
That 's important to remember if you 're starting college this fall and plan to borrow .
In 2007 - 08 , 14 % of undergraduate students took out private student loans , up from 5 % in 2003 - 04 , according to a recent analysis by the Project on Student Debt .
Many students use these loans to make up the difference between federal student loans and the cost of college .
But private loans are typically more expensive than federal loans and have less flexible repayment plans .
Limits on federal student loans were increased last year , so make sure you take full advantage of these loans before venturing into the private market .
• You 've defaulted on your student loans .
The income - based repayment program is available for all federal student loans , no matter when you took them out , but you must be in good standing to qualify , Asher says .
Most student loans are considered in default after you 've failed to make payments for nine months .
To enroll in the income - based repayment program , you 'll need to contact your lender .
The Project on Student Debt has set up a website with information and updates about the program .

• Inter coach would return to England ' if United want me ' • ' I like England ... the fans make the game a beautiful occasion '
Jose Mourinho would jump at the chance of managing Manchester United should the Old Trafford hierarchy decide he is the man to replace Sir Alex Ferguson .
At 67 , Ferguson knows he cannot continue indefinitely , even though he currently has no intention of giving up a job he has held for almost 23 years .
Mourinho 's name has been mentioned frequently as a successor since his exit from Chelsea , and he has now admitted the lure of returning to England would be hard to resist .
" I would consider going to Manchester United but United have to consider if they want me to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson , " the Internazionale manager told the Daily Mirror .
" If they do , then of course .
" I like England , where the fans are very passionate and make the game a beautiful occasion with such an incredible atmosphere . "
Mourinho also added a barb at Chelsea , who are now on to their fourth manager since his departure , and have failed to recapture the title , while the man who guided Chelsea to back - to - back championships has now won Serie A with Inter .
" I had many conversations before Chelsea and I decided on a divorce , " he said .
" It was difficult for me because we loved each other but the relationship went in one direction and it was best for everyone .
Since I left I became champion again but they have not been champions again .

* DuPont says Monsanto patents are invalid
* DuPont shares fall 2.3 pct , Monsanto down 3.9 pct ( Adds Monsanto comment )
NEW YORK , June 16 ( Reuters ) - Chemicals maker DuPont DD.N launched a counter - lawsuit against rival seedmaker Monsanto Co MON.N on Tuesday to force the company to allow it to sell its own products with Monsanto 's genetically modified soybeans .
The lawsuit is the latest fight in the battle for the rights to new biotechnology that could be worth billions of dollars in sales to farmers worldwide who are seeking boost crop yields and profits .
DuPont ’s suit , filed in the U.S. District Court in St. Louis , comes a month after Monsanto sued DuPont ’s Pioneer Hi-Bred International business , contending it had breached its license to market Roundup Ready soybean and corn seeds that are modified to be more tolerant of herbicides .
In a statement , DuPont said it is allowed to combine , or “ stack , ” the genetic traits of its Optimum GAT technology with Roundup Ready under its rights in a licensing agreement with Monsanto , and that Monsanto ’s patents around its soybean traits were invalid .
“ Monsanto ’s lawsuit is another tactic used to restrict the availability of competitive products , ” DuPont Vice President James Borel said in a statement .
Monsanto , the world ’s biggest seedmaker , has said Pioneer has misused the Roundup Ready traits to mask problems with its own Optimum GAT technology .
“ Rather than tell the truth about its failed product , DuPont improperly used Monsanto ’s proven technology to cover up the flaws of Optimum GAT .
This is the real issue in the case , ” Scott Partridge , Monsanto ’s deputy general counsel , said in a statement in response to DuPont ’s claim .
Earlier this month , DuPont and Germany 's BASF BASF .DE sued each other of claims of patent infringement for the technologies used in the DuPont 's Optimum GAT .
On the New York Stock Exchange , Monsanto closed off 3.9 percent at $ 81.62 and DuPont fell 2.3 percent to 25.20 .
The case is : Monsanto v Dupont , 09 - cv-00686 .
The S.C. GOP 's censure vote -- rather than a call to step down -- makes it likely he will be able to remain in office .
Sanford survives : Gov. rides out storm
The South Carolina Republican Party voted to censure Gov. Mark Sanford Monday rather than call for his resignation — an outcome that makes it likely the GOP governor will be able to weather the storm surrounding his extramarital affair and remain in office .
The vote of the state GOP executive committee took place late Monday night following a nearly four - hour - long conference call and three rounds of ballots aimed at getting a majority of the committee to either censure , support or ask the governor to resign .
Advertisement
The censure finally agreed to by the committee called the governor 's behavior a breach of " the public ’s trust and confidence in his ability to effectively perform the duties of his office . "
Sanford was also criticized by the committee for failing to adhere to the " core principles and beliefs " of the Republican Party , though the censure noted that " barring further revelation " Monday 's action would be " the party ’s last word on the matter . "
The final vote was 22 to censure , 10 calling for resignation and 9 supporting the governor .
" The events of the past two weeks have been as divisive as they have been disappointing for Republicans .
But today has brought a large measure of resolution to a sad chapter in our State Party ’s history , " South Carolina GOP Chairman Karen Floyd said in a statement following the vote .
" Republicans came together to speak with a unified voice , and now is the time for healing . "
Though Monday ’s vote does not have any binding effect on the governor , it serves as a sign that even many of Sanford ’s enemies among the state party establishment may no longer have the will to continue calling for his resignation , barring any unforeseen or additional disclosures about the governor ’s personal life .
For Sanford , it was an improbable outcome after events last week left him with a tenuous grip on the governorship .
In a tell - all interview with The Associated Press last Tuesday , he referred to his Argentine mistress as his “ soul mate ” and confessed having “ crossed lines ” with a handful of other women , admissions that proved so damaging that more than half the Republican state Senate caucus called for him to step down in the aftermath .
But the party vote Monday night and a series of other factors have provided him with some breathing room , if not ensured his outright political survival , according to top South Carolina Republicans .
First , there is his obstinate nature .
Sanford has long bucked the political establishment and made plain that he has no intent to resign , no matter what his fellow Republicans think is best for the party and state .
“ He can dig in and take a pounding , ” said former state GOP Chairman Katon Dawson .
A GOP state legislator recalled that the iconoclastic Sanford has never feared being a lonely voice , whether as the sole opposing vote in Congress or as governor .
“ He does not mind being the one guy , ” said this legislator .
“ He does n’t care , just does n’t give a hoot . ”
And , after divulging too much to the AP , Sanford has wisely clammed up .
He did n’t appear at a press availability on port security Monday near Charleston with Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and his office would only issue a statement reiterating his plan to stay in office .
Widespread concern about the most immediate consequence of Sanford ’s resignation also worked to his advantage .
While many Republican officials would like to see the governor save the state any more embarrassment , they worry about elevating Lt. Gov Andre Bauer , a fellow Republican with a record of his own erratic behavior in the past .
" It appears that the Republican establishment is more concerned about the next election than they are the next 18 months , " said one prominent state politician and a Sanford critic .
“ They seem more focused on keeping Andre Bauer from assuming the governorship than ensuring that someone serves effectively . ”
Even those close to Sanford recognize that apprehension over the prospect of Bauer – never an ally to the governor – are part of the reason there have n’t been louder and more strenuous calls on him to resign .
And no two voices have been more noticeably absent than those of the state ’s two Republican senators , Jim DeMint and Lindsey Graham .
Both have had candid private conversations with the governor about his political standing and DeMint said last week on television that Sanford needed to “ do the right thing . ”
But neither has said publicly that Sanford ought to resign – a golden silence that those advising the governor believe has prevented a critical mass of Republicans from forming to force Sanford out .
Then there are the procedural hurdles .
Even if there were a critical mass calling for his departure , Sanford has an ace in the hole : Absent a felony , it ’s very difficult to force a South Carolina governor to resign .
The legislature is out of session until January , for one thing , and lawmakers have not yet indicated any real appetite for impeachment .

“ It ’s a fascinating process . ”
Popular culture treats beer as the antithesis of stuffy pretension .
Beer has spent so long as the everyman ’s answer to snobby wine that investing it with serious appreciation and serious context is possibly too much to ask .
Yet enough restaurants and taverns today , from high - end to humble , treat beer seriously , knowledgeably and unpretentiously that it is hard to accept any less .
Blind Tiger Ale House on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village is one of New York ’s best beer bars .
Partly this is because of the extent of the beer selection , which bartenders can discuss with precision .
But it ’s also because of the food .
Dishes like chicken tacos , a Vietnamese - style sandwich of pork and mango slaw , or a bacon , apple and cheddar sandwich are creative extensions of pub grub , made with care and good ingredients .
In its original Hudson Street site , where it opened in 1996 , Blind Tiger did not serve food .
The kitchen was used as a coat room .
Patrons used to clear out at 8 p.m. and return at 10:30 , said Dave Brodrick , an owner .
When it moved to Bleecker Street in 2006 , the owners decided to add food .
They hired a chef , James O’Brien , who had worked at Spotted Pig , with the idea of going beyond typical bar food .
“ Now we have a lunch crowd , which we never had at the old Tiger , ” Mr. Brodrick said .
“ At dinner time there is n’t that falloff . ”

Far from the world of the ordinary beer pub , Beer Table in Park Slope , Brooklyn , is a small jewel , more atelier than bar , dedicated to showing off some of the world ’s best and most obscure beers .
To go with the brews , Beer Table serves charcuterie , cheese and simple cooked dishes .
One night , succotash with bacon was the unlikely accompaniment to an unlikely beer , Hardcore I.P.A. , from a Scottish brewer who may have spent too much time in California .
It was bitter , hoppy and delicious , and it went beautifully with the creamy succotash .
As rare as the beers at Beer Table may be , the server could answer my questions no matter how technical or geeky .
But with beer prices that rival box seats at Yankee Stadium , the specialized appeal of a place like Beer Table may not extend beyond the truly committed beer lover .
Jamie Waylett plays Draco Malfoy 's right - hand man in the Potter films
A teenage actor who appears in the Harry Potter movies has been charged with growing cannabis plants .
Jamie Waylett , 19 , who plays bully Vincent Crabbe in the film series , allegedly grew 10 cannabis plants at his home in Kilburn , north London .
He will appear at City of Westminster Magistrates ' Court on 16 July .
The world premiere of the next movie instalment - Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince - is taking place in Leicester Square on Tuesday .
Mr Waylett was arrested in April .
He has been in all the Harry Potter films as the right - hand man to character Draco Malfoy .
Mr Waylett will appear in court alongside John Innis , 20 , from Barnet , north London , who was charged with possession of 11 bags of cannabis and a knife .
A recent patent filed by Apple talks of an authentication mechanism based on a key t hat is embedded physically in a device and can be communicated remotely .
Even though the exact words open up a bundle of possible solutions to implement this mechanism BUT there are strong rumors which can not be just ignored .
But if you read between the lines and closely examine the diagrams filed with the patent they suggest nothing BUT a small chip that will be embedded into the very phone itself which will contain the phone ’s ( or the ‘ host ’s ’ as the patent calls it ) identification number .
This is exactly what an RFID ( Radio Frequency IDentification ) chip does .
Every RFID chip can be assigned a unique ID and upon sending a a specific frequency radio signal , the RFID responds with communicating it ’s ID .
[ Prototype iPhone Media player that responds to other object ’s RFIDs ]
If that is the case then iPhone 4G will have an authentication system that would be embedded inside of every phone and not only that but every iPhone will also feature RFID reader .
The antenna of the reader could easily be hidden inside of the top panel and yet remain a little exposed ( Product Engineering team has to do some engineering on that one ) .
So what will be the implications ?
One scenario for sure :
Not only will it enable a more secure iPhone but will also enable partial locking .
You would ask what ’s that ?
Well , as the name implies , you would be able to lock specific portions of the screen and reserve them for certain users ( in case others are also using your iPhone which is an unlikely scenario )
[ An RFID chip could be this small ]
With an RFID reader , iPhone will be able to interact with the surroundings which is something called NFC ( Near Field Communication ) .
This will have a huge application in Media Player which could interact with RFID embedded objects whenever it comes in its range .
And the good news is that iPhone SDK3.0 already has support to access external hardware .
Besides RFID authentication , the phone is also rumored to enhance user sensational experience by enhancing the responsiveness of the screen .
This would mean that you would be able to feel shocks and this will open up a new vista of gaming experience on iPhone .
We got hold of some cool concept designs for the new iPhone 4G :
Not picked up an iPhone 3g yet ?
Make sure you do it before the new mobile phone comes out to make sure you like it .

Under the bridge on Thursday , tents and plywood shacks competed for space with rusty bicycles , a skinny cat , and a beige lawn chair .
In a sign of the camp ’s bereft permanence , a yellow electrical cord attached to a generator snaked through the camp flat against the ground , pounded by countless footsteps .
“ Sometimes we have harmony , sometimes chaos , ” Mr. Wiese said .
Mr. Dorzena , who said he served 17 months in jail for having sex with a 14 - year - old when he was 18 , smoked a cigarette beside him .
“ Right now , ” Mr. Wiese said , “ we have so many people here , it ’s chaos . ”
The police agree .
John Timoney , the Miami police chief , said that on the Fourth of July , several officers used a stun gun against a man under the bridge who , in a fit of depression , began cutting himself with a knife , apparently in a suicide attempt .
Chief Timoney predicted more violence .
He said he had told city , state and county officials that the men ( only one or two women live there ) needed to be moved to more permanent homes , even if it meant changing one or more laws .
He has gotten mostly studies in return , along with politicians accusing one another of shirking responsibility .
“ It ’s like a hot potato , ” Chief Timoney said .
“ Everyone is just passing it on . ”
In fact , Jose Diaz  the county commissioner who sponsored the law establishing the 2,500 - foot boundary in 2005  said state corrections officials were to blame for placing sex offenders on state - owned land .
He defended the county law by saying , “ If I can save some kids from going through this agony , I ’ve done my job . ”
Gov. Charlie Crist , meanwhile , placed responsibility squarely on local governments , which have “ the right to do what they feel is appropriate for the citizens that they serve . ”

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will give his sermon during Friday prayers .
It will be closely watched for a sign of how the government plans to resolve the stalemate over the country 's recent presidential elections .
Crowds of demonstrators have been protesting in the streets of Tehran , demanding that officials throw out election results that showed hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defeated opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi .
Khamenei has appealed to Iranians to stand behind the Islamic republic .
The Basij militia -- which is affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps -- declared Friday a day for the Iranian nation to renew its allegiance to Khamenei .
Moussavi called for a day of mourning Thursday .
Tehran University students told a CNN iReporter that government forces staged a massive crackdown early Monday at the university .
Some students were detained in the raid .

Students jumped out of windows to escape the Iranian police forces who threw tear gas and beat them , according to the iReporter , a former Tehran University student who lives outside Iran .
He did not want to be identified .
The students said more than 100 were wounded , and there were reports of at least one death at Tehran University , but CNN could not independently verify their account because of restrictions on the international media in Tehran .
Iran 's parliament speaker , Ali Larijani , has blamed the country 's Interior Ministry for the crackdown on the university , as well as other attacks on civilians , government - funded Press TV reported .
However , Larijani also said " it appears that hidden hands are at work to feed foreign media outlets with propaganda , " according to Press TV .
Investigating lawmakers have spoken to Tehran University students and other officials and are demanding the release of the detained students , Press TV reported .
The lawmakers are also calling for the arrest and punishment of those who perpetrated the violence and for students to be compensated for their losses , according to Press TV .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) -
The world is ‘ sleepwalking ’ toward preventable natural disasters whose effects could be cut significantly with a modest increase in spending on risk reduction , the United Nations aid chief said on Tuesday .
“ The trends in disasters , particularly from climate change , are of enormous concern , ” said John Holmes , U.N. undersecretary - general for humanitarian affairs .
“ We can only expect that this kind of trend is going to continue , ” he told a news conference .
Holmes was speaking at the start of a four - day Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction which gathers over 1,800 participants from 169 governments and around 140 international and non-governmental organizations .
Risk reduction efforts had improved since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , which killed more than 250,000 people , but much more was needed , Holmes said .
“ We ’re still to some extent sleepwalking our way into disasters for the future which we know are going to happen , and not enough is being done to mitigate the damage , ” he said .
Holmes hoped the Global Platform would agree to spend around $ 3 billion a year on disaster risk reduction , representing about 10 percent of the $ 8 billion spent each year on disaster relief , plus 1 percent of the $ 239 billion development aid budget .
By comparison , disasters in 2008 caused approximately $ 200 billion in damage , Holmes said .
While the cost two years earlier was a quarter of that , the trend was clearly rising .
“ The most damaging disasters in developing countries can seem to cause the least damage because the property being damaged is less expensive ... but the real damage done to lives and livelihoods is much greater , ” Holmes said .
It was important global efforts to deal with climate change include disaster risk reduction and look at adapting behavior as well as mitigating the effects of disasters , he said .
About 90 percent of disasters are climate - related , said Holmes , who noted cyclones in Brazil in 2004 and Oman in 2007 had been of an intensity never before seen in those regions .
The massive earthquake in Sichuan , China , last year , and another earthquake in Italy this year had shown both the need for tough building codes and the importance of enforcing them .
PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
Priorities for the Global Platform meeting include plans to disaster - proof schools and hospitals , build up early - warning systems , reduce human settlement in disaster - prone areas and restore and safeguard ecosystems .
Bangladesh , where many people live in a coastal area prone to flooding and cyclone - driven sea swells , has cut the death toll from disasters dramatically through early - warning systems .
But the U.N. ’s World Meteorological Organization estimates 60 of its members do not have adequate systems , Holmes said .
Most of the 10 biggest “ megacities ” of 25 - 35 million people are in dangerous coastal areas or earthquake zones .
Nearly one billion people live in “ informal settlements ” or city slums , with the number growing by 25 million a year , as urbanization exposes more people to the risk of disaster , he said .

Recently , Dmitry Orlov offered a selection of possible topics for a talk he was giving , and several of them dealt with the ubiquity of permaculture as the articulated solution to our present crisis .
Orlov ’s point was that a consensus seems to be emerging that permaculture strategies – particularly the Transition movement – have emerged as the de facto solution to our collective crisis without a lot of public conversation or questioning .
I did n’t get to hear Dmitry ’s commentary on this subject ( although I can guess what some of it would be ) , but it pushed me to begin a subject I ’ve been gently avoiding for a while .
Now I am commonly described as a permaculturist , and I ’ve no objection , in fact it rather pleases me - I generally do n’t worry much about how people describe me , and this is one of the nicer ways .
Officially , I ’m not sure I qualify – I ’ve never taken a full design course myself , and am mostly self - taught .
I ’ve taught in a few design classes , but have never sought certification for one reason – I do n’t think of myself primarily as a designer , at least in a classical sense .
That may seem strange , since a lot of what I do is design work – I teach garden design , Adapting in Place ( ie , designing your life to work with less money and energy ) , etc …
But permaculture design is formal design of a particular kind – deeply visual , deeply concerned with maps and images .
I ’m not a terribly visual person – my own strengths have to do with the translation of the world into words , not images .
There are too many pictures in permaculture design for me .
Moreover , I tend not to sign up quickly for membership in “ ists ” or “ isms ” – even ones that I approve of deeply .
The only club I officially belong to is the order of agrarians , and only because I want to meet Wendell Berry someday .
Despite my lack of official signing up ( I have the same issues with joining the Kantians ) I do approve of permaculture in a broad sense .
I like many of the things it has brought to our society as a whole , and I like many permaculturists .
I can think of far worse principles from which to build a new society .
Moreover , I give enormous credit to Rob Hopkins and Transition practitioners , who have essentially created the only viable , large scale alternate model for dealing with a coming crisis – that ’s quite an accomplishment .
One of the reasons I have not written this post before is that I really do n’t want to criticize or undermine permaculture and transition , which have been fairly successful – Transition astonishing successful in a short time – in energizing a lot of people with a new idea and vision .
Given our shortage of good solutions for responding , and the need for coherent solutions , I do n’t want to seem as though I ’m sniping at something I admire and value .
That said , however , I admit to some doubts about the political viability of permaculture as a solution for our collective crisis , doubts I ’m going to articulate here , in the interest of promoting a larger discussion about permaculture , and about the possibility of movements in general as a strategy of mitigation .
I do want to be clear that I am not trying to undermine the enormous efforts made by people involved in permaculture and Transition , nor do I want to see them discontinue their efforts .
But I do feel that there are questions to be discussed and answered .
I should be absolutely clear here – all of my concerns about permaculture are about elements of permaculture ’s presentation and emphasis – not about the overall goals of Transition or the permaculture movement .
That is , even if I do n’t qualify as an official permaculturist , even if I critique them , there is no question I want to work with permaculturists – their emphasis on scale , on integrating food production and local economies , their emphasis on appropriate technology – all of these things are , I think , absolutely right .
The question is not whether permaculture is bad – I would deny that outright .
The question for me is whether permaculture and its offshoots , as they are presented and emphasized now , can do what they would like to do – make a smooth ( or smoother ) transition than any other method through tough times .
The first one is a philosophical one – can permaculture as a movement actually attract enough mainstream people to really and truly make a difference ?
This to me is a sincere and serious question , and perhaps the deepest issue to be addressed .
When I have given talks at permaculture classes , attended group meetings , or given talks to permaculturist audiences , I ’ve noticed a pervasive consistency among the attendees .
While there are exceptions , and I can’t speak for permaculturist gatherings outside the US , the ones I ’ve attended ( and I ’ve attended quite a few in different areas of the country ) have had some common denominators .
The attendees tend to be white and middle class , or if they are not middle class , they are very young , and immersed in alternative culture .
I do n’t mean to stereotype , but most of the people who attend these groups tend to visually signal their attachment to historical leftist or alternative communities .
There are plenty of exceptions , but the predominance is of grey pony tails , yoga mats , priuses , flowered skirts and lefty bumperstickers .
These are not bad things – I grew up in precisely this culture and am quite fond of it .
But the absence of trucks with gun racks , right wing bumper stickers , non-white people and other signifiers of ideological is somewhat disheartening , if you are looking for a universal movement .
At the Albany permaculture gathering , I was discussing with one of the other participants how pleased I was that the demographic involved more younger people , only to be mocked by the speaker , Larry Santoyo , for praising the diversity of the nearly all - white group .
And he was right – my standards have just been lowered over time .
I realize that permaculture has a somewhat wider audience in the UK and Australia , and that these may be primarily American objections .
The US , for example , has never gotten permaculture into any soap opera .
I also recognize that both are comparatively new here in the US , and that the early adopters do n’t necessarily describe who will come to the fold in the long term .
Both are meant to be deeply flexible and adaptive to local conditions , and it is possible that they will become so .
There is a case to be made that some elements of leftist culture – universal therapy , yoga and tofu , for example , have permeated into the mainstream of American culture quite gracefully .
There is a case to be made , however , on the other side , that other elements have not .
My claim is not that permaculture as an idea is ideologically leftist , or particularly hippyish , but that its practice has been , at least in the US .
And this , I think is , quite frankly , a bad thing if the goal is the creation of a mass movement .
Frankly , having grown up the child of baby boomers , my own tastes do n’t run that way .
I find myself in sympathy with people who are n’t attracted to the Transition Training ’s emphasis on visualizing , community building activities , etc …
My own entry into visualization exercises and trust - building dates back to summer camps as a child , and the whole thing makes me a bit queasy .
When the words “ get in a circle ” are uttered , I tend to start wandering off .
I recognize this may be my own personal design flaw , but I have no interest in ever building a Web of Resilience , and I think it extremely unlikely that many of my neighbors would be interested as well , or would take time off work and home life for it .
I ’m sure some of them would , but the emphasis of many permaculturists on the language of popular therapy and summer - camp style activities designed to create consensus , build trust and visualize the sustainable future are , well a turn off for whole classes of people .
They will speak to other groups – but the question of who you are speaking to is , of course , the essential one .
Even the language of “ acknowledging one ’s sense of loss and grief ” is one that is tough for a lot of people to swallow , despite the pervasiveness of Oprah and Dr. Phil .
I think there is a real question about how much public discussion of one ’s feelings is going to be attractive in different populations and communities .
A friend of mine recently attended Transition Training in his town , and said to me “ there was good stuff , but I could n’t shake the feeling that I was about to join a cult . ”
This is not the impression one wants to cultivate .
I make no claim that his experience was universal , but I ’ve heard more than few people express similar sentiments from different parts of the US and different countries .
There are countries in the world and a few regions of the US in which a movement that uses tools that primarily appeal to the crunchy left will be successful .
Speaking as an American , for America as a whole , however , I do not think the entire US is one of them , nor are most regions .
I think it is important to recognize that while permaculture itself is not a leftist movement philosophically , an extended diet of bearded and ponytailed permaculture teachers and enthusiasts ;-) making comments about the Republicans will tend to associate the movement with the politics of its public faces .
The painful reality of American politics for us leftists is that at no time as the American public cast open its arms and said “ we were just waiting for you to invite us to join with you ” .
Associate permaculture to closely with the American left , and the reality is that many people wo n’t join .
Is there a solution that problem ?
I suspect so , perhaps some attention to the design of permaculture ’s PR image .
Many ( not all ) of the people who embraced permaculture were mostly on the left , at least to a degree ( thank G -d for Bill Mollison and Larry Santoyo , who offer a cheerful confirmation that permaculture really is n’t politically associated with one side or another , and provide hard drinking , reality pushing , capitalist ( in Larry ’s case , anyway ) , versions of the things itself – I may not be a capitalist and I ’ve long since lost any tolerance for hard drinking , but I find them refreshing and funny , which is helpful ) , and they certainly know things we need to know .
And most of the permaculturists I know are more complex than that – Larry Santoyo was a California Cop , Toby Hemenway a scientist ….
that is , they are n’t what they are widely perceived to be .
But perceptions matter more than reality in some cases , and polling people who are not part of the club , the widespread perception I find is that permaculture is another hippie thing , to go with the “ liberal left behind movement ” reputation of peak oil .
Whether it is fair or not , it matters .
At a minimum , I ’d be careful about the language associations and techniques one adapts – I do n’t think that evoking meditation or trust building is a really good idea , say , for Transition Mississippi , or even Transition rural upstate NY if the goal is critical mass .
My main suggestion would be that at least in the US , Transition movements begin engaging religious communities on a serious level .
I give a lot of talks at churches and synagogues and other religious communities .
Many of those communities are already engaging in the nuts and bolts work of responding to an * existing *
Long Emergency – they are doing the marrying and burying , the preaching of moralities , both productive and not .
They run the food pantries , the battered women ’s shelters , the emergency funds .
They find clothing for the naked , food for the hungry and offer sanctuary and public appeals when violence breaks out .
This is the nitty gritty work of responding to the crisis as it unfolds , and it must be done simultaneously with the building of the “ better model . ”
I would argue that some of ( not all ) the best people to make the case for Transition to are the people who are already on teh ground in our cities and towns doing the work that desperately needs more hands .
My other suggestion is that permaculture groups seek out people who are * already * doing the work of sustainability , but do n’t get any credit for it , because they are poor .
Some do this , but the fact that these groups tend to be mostly made up of middle class white folks suggest to me that that asking the people who are already living in the city with no electricity , because the bill gets cut off every April , and the people who are already dumpster diving and making their livings of the waste of the city , and the people who are already stretching every resource because they have no choice , or urban farming because that ’s just what you do where they come from ought to be invested in the local permaculture community .
And it will not do to go among them as missionaries and teach them – let them teach you .
You may have done the food stamp budget challenge one month – they ’ve been doing it for years , and can tell you how to keep eating when the money runs out .
I do not want to see something so valuable become the territory only of an affluent middle class who can afford to pay a few thousand bucks and take two weeks off work to take a design seminar .
The second question / critique I ’d offer is this – is it possible to imagine permaculture responding successfully in situations not of peaceful exigency , of gentle shifts , but of violent ones ?
I think there is little doubt that some places will experience violent shifts – by this I mean war , civil or otherwise , rioting , vast increases in criminal activity and violence , and civic disruption .
Some of those places may not be in the US .
Recently Rob Hopkins and Richard Heinberg made public their correspondence about whether Transition should incorporate emergency preparedness into its training and work – it was an excellent conversation , and long overdue , but it inadvertantly exposed some real limitations to Transition ’s planning - Hopkins ’s conclusion was that perhaps it could begin to do so , and his first thought was that it could include camping and wilderness survival skills .
As useful as these might be to many people , and as good a thought as that is , it struck me as a measure of how far off from dealing with a truly disastrous situation we are – it is true some people may retreat into woods as refugees , but far more likely to be needed are plans for quelling local violence , building emergency shelters and providing emergency medical services , and urban survival .
Hopkins noted that he saw little way to address preparedness measures because they were traditional “ top down ” applications – ie , provided by the state .
But if Transition ’s bottom - up structures are overridden the moment there is a major crisis by existing top - down structures , then we can assume that we will no longer be living in a society governed by permaculture .
I realize that the long term goal is for permaculture models to replace existing structures , smoothly and gradually .
The problem is lack of time – historically institutions that have done very well in tough times have been those that had something to offer people in exigency – that took up the work of dealing with the crisis .
If a crisis comes before the town council or the local government is replaced by loving permaculturists , permaculturist movements must offer a compelling case that they can handle a rough transition better than existing infrastructure – that means heavy emphasis on preparedness .
Religious institutions have known this – think how powerful the relief institutions and madresses of Islam , or Catholic social welfare structures have been in influencing local relationships to religious communities .
Permaculture is not a religion , but it is perhaps , a faith at this stage – a faith that it has something to offer .
But if tough times come rapidly and it has nothing to offer those already experiencing exigency , if its message is “ wait , we ’ve go the right technique , it just takes a while … ”
I think that permaculture will be rapidly pushed aside .
Naomi Klein ’s superb
_ The Shock Doctrine_ observes the degree to which people cling to the familiar in tough times – and they cling even harder to those they believe were there for them .
If we had a decade or more before the Long Emergency was thrust upon us , or if we could assure a smooth shift , and if the language of permaculture can be shifted ( and I think it can be ) to one that is more encompassing , that works as well in the US as it has elsewhere , I would be less uncertain about the value of some of the work being done now .
But for most of us , our time to transition is measured in months or a couple of years at most – for a host of reasons .
The economic crisis is on us now , and we know that the energy crisis is coming rather quickly alongside it .
We have less than 5 years left from James Hansen ’s deadline to begin making “ radical and draconian ” changes on the climate .
We have so much to do and so little time .
I admire enormously much of the work of permaculture and permaculturists , and every time someone calls me one , I ’m pleased and proud to be associated with that community .
There is no group out there that does not have issues that need consideration and critique – and permaculture has more that I will attend to in my next post on this matter – the issue of how we will address the larger questions of feeding cities and whole populations , and the question of what degree of actual success Transition is having at this point are , I think , important questions to ask .
I find myself wanting permaculture to succeed – there are plenty of things to like about it , particularly as an economic model .
And if Transition or Permaculture can’t do enough fast enough , I ’m honestly dubious that they will succeed at all .
If we had world enough and time , that would be great .
But the models that will help us most are the ones that can work under circumstances of enormous disruption and difficulty as well as during a smooth shift .

このシリーズでは7月に刊行される翻訳書「レガシーコード改善ガイド（Working Effectively With Legacy Code）」に書かれている内容から、重要なトピックを取り上げて紹介していきます。今回は、レガシーコードの定義やテストの重要性、そしてその考えに基づくこの本の本来の目的などを説明します。
「 レガシーコード」とは何 か
最初に1つ質問です。皆さんは、「レガシーコード」と聞いて何を想像するでしょうか？ 多くの方はCOBOLなどで書かれたメインフレームで動くコードを真っ先に思い浮かべるのではないかと思います。しかし、本当にそれだけでしょうか？
ここでは 「レガシーコード」という言葉を『何年も前に誰かが作り、内容が複雑で何をしているのかよく分からず、まともな仕様書もない』というコードを指すものとします。そう考えると、必ずしもメインフレームだけの話ではなくなります。この記事を読んでいる皆さんなら、そのようなコードを少なからず目にしていることでしょう。
現在の業務システムは 、Java EEや.NETなどの基盤上に構築される、いわゆるオープンシステムが主流になっています。このようなオープンシステムであっても、構築されてから既に5年以上経過していることが珍しくなく、何度も手が加えられたコードは混乱し、簡単な機能追加であっても多くの労力と時間を必要とする状態になってしまっている場合があります。こういうシステムのコードも、立派な「レガシーコード」と呼ぶことができそうです。
原書「 Working Effectively With Legacy Code 」
さて、ここに 『Working Effectively With Legacy Code』というタイトルの本があります。タイトルは「レガシーコードを効果的に改善する」といった意味で、既存の混乱したコードの品質を少しずつ改善しながら変更する方法を説明しています。
IT関連の技術書は数多くありますが、こうしたテーマを取り上げたものはほとんどありません。私は原書を読んで、オブジェクト指向言語による業務システム開発が一巡した現在、まさに多くのプログラマが求めているテーマを取り上げた良書であると感じました。
そしてちょっとした縁があって、しばらく前からこの本を共同で翻訳することになったため、原書を隅から隅まで読むことになりました。この本は近々『レガシーコード改善ガイド』というタイトルの翻訳書として、翔泳社より刊行される予定です。このCodeZineの連載では、翻訳書の刊行に先駆けて、そこに書かれている重要なトピックを少しずつ紹介しながら、本書のすばらしさを皆さんにお伝えすることにチャレンジしてみたいと思います。
翻訳書 「レガシーコード改善ガイド」トピック
テストのないコードがレガシーコード
さて、この書籍では 「レガシーコード」を次のように定義しています。
レガシーコードとは、単にテストのないコードである
この定義を見て、皆さんはどう感じたでしょうか。現実問題として、なかなか厳しい定義です。私がこれまで見てきたシステムは、きれいな設計やコードだったとしても、テストまでしっかり揃っているものは少なかったからです。この定義だと、世に存在する多くのプログラムがレガシーコードと認定されてしまいそうです。
著者は上記のように定義した理由を、次のように説明しています。
テストのないコードは悪いコードである。どれだけうまく書かれているかは関係ない。どれだけ美しいか、オブジェクト指向か、きちんとカプセル化されているかは関係ない。テストがあれば、検証しながらコードの動きを素早く変更できる。テストがなければ、コードが良くなっているのか悪くなっているのかが本当には分からない。
これを見 て 「きれいな設計やコードなら、変更は簡単なのでは？
」と感じる方がいるかもしれません。設計やコードをきれいにすることは重要ですし、そのための技術書もたくさん書かれています。ですが、それだけでは不十分なのです。その理由を、本書に書かれている対照的な2つの変更方法を用いて説明してみます。
「 編集して祈る 」 か、 「 保護して変更する 」 か
皆さんは、システムを変更する際にどのような方法をとりますか？
この本では、システム変更の方法を大きく2つ、「編集して祈る」と「保護して変更する」に分けています。著者は「保護して変更する」方法を取るべきだと考えており、「編集して祈る」と対比させて、その重要さを説明しています。
1） 「 編集して祈る 」
「 編集して祈る」は、既存のコードを注意深く調べながら修正する方法です。この場合の手順を想像してみましょう。まずはステップごとに何が起こるかを明確に理解し、コード変更の影響範囲を把握します。次に、時間をかけて注意深くコードを書き、コード変更がすべて終わったら、祈る気持ちで動かしてみます。その結果は「あれ？
変更箇所は大丈夫だけど……別の機能が動かなくなってしまった……」。
既存のコードを変更した経験のある方は、このような状況に遭遇したことがあるのではないでしょうか。この状況は、きれいな設計やコードでも実に簡単に起こります。スパゲッティコードに比べれば理解しやすいとはいえ、今度は設計やコードの意図を理解するだけの技術力が求められます。理解していなければ、コード変更の影響範囲を把握できず、また手を加えてよい箇所も分かりません。次第にきれいな設計やコードは壊れていき、分かりづらくなっていきます。コードを変更するということはそれだけ難しいことなのです。
「 注意をより多く払ったからといって、必ずしもそれに比例して安全性が向上するとは限らない」と著者は強く述べています。既存コードに手を入れる際には、「残りの振る舞いを変えずに済ませることができるかが重要」ですが、注意深いだけでは、他の部分に影響が及んでいるかどうかまでは最後に動かしてみないと分かりません。どんなに注意深く進めても、結局は「編集して祈る」ことになってしまいます。
2） 「 保護して変更する 」
も う1つの 「保護して変更する」は、テストを用意したうえで既存のコードを修正する方法です。コードの変更が難しい理由をよく考えてみると、テストがあればコードの変更が簡単になるという、意外と単純なことに気がつきます。もし、変更している最中にうまく変更できているかどうか、他の部分に影響が及んでいないかどうかを確認する手段があったとしたらどうなるでしょうか。その場合は、少し変更をして、大丈夫かどうかを確認して、また少し変更をして、という作業を繰り返しながら進めることが可能になります。
少しずつ前進すれば、ステップごとの明確な理解や注意深くコードを書かなくても影響範囲が把握できますし、すぐに間違いが分かります。まるで、「空中ブランコの転落防止の網」のようです。転落防止の網とはテストのことです。テストがあればすばやくフィードバックが得られ、より細かい部分に注意を払いながら、修正を進めることができます。
コードは保護して変更しなければ安全ではありません。保護して変更するためにはテストが必要になります。テストのないコードはレガシーコードなのです。
Six months of the Obama administration
21 July 2009
Six months ago yesterday , Barack Obama was inaugurated as the 44th president of the United States .
The election of Obama represented a popular repudiation of the Bush administration and its domestic and foreign policies .
The principal slogan of Obama — “ change you can believe in ” — struck a chord with a population fed up with eight years of war and single - minded focus on the interests of the corporate elite .
Obama ’s persona and individual history symbolized , for broad sections of the working class and youth , this desire for change .
The fact that Obama would be the first African - American president was seen by many as reason to believe he would instinctively sympathize with the poor and oppressed .
In any case , it was thought , he would be very different from what had come before .
What evaluation can be made in light of six months ’ experience ?
The facts speak for themselves .
On every critical issue , Obama — presiding over substantial Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress — has continued the basic policy of his predecessor .
Military policy
The direction of the administration on military policy was signaled early on .
On January 23 , three days after his inauguration , Obama ordered missile strikes by unmanned Predator drones on a location inside Pakistan , killing 18 people .
With this initial blood on his hands , Obama proceeded apace .
The war in Afghanistan is now definitively “ Obama ’s war . ”
Under his watch , the US has set in motion a doubling of its forces , from 32,000 to 68,000 , and is presently carrying out a major operation to wipe out popular opposition in the south .
At least 30 US soldiers and 25 NATO troops have died so far this month , making July the deadliest month to date for occupation forces .
With Obama , however , the operation has become the “ AfPak ” war .
US missile strikes within Pakistan , often killing dozens of Pakistani civilians , have become a regular occurrence .
The administration has pressured Pakistan to carry out its own offensive in its northwestern territories , resulting in hundreds of thousands of refugees and massive causalities .
The occupation of Iraq continues .
The drawback of US forces from the cities does not herald an end to US military involvement in the country .
Some 130,000 troops remain in what amounts to permanent military bases outside the cities , and the administration has begun the process of relabeling troops as “ advisors . ”
In the event that the fragile political situation breaks down , the US military will intervene with full force .
Economic and social policy
On domestic policy , Obama ’s overriding concern has been to defend the wealth of the most powerful sections of the corporate and financial elite .
Through cash injections , subsidies and loan programs , trillions have been handed out to the banks and financial institutions , with no strings attached .
The administration has opposed any real constraints on executive pay or bonuses .
Utilizing the government handouts , the largest banks reported massive profits in the second quarter of 2009 , including $ 3.44 billion for Goldman Sachs and $ 2.7 billion for JPMorgan Chase .
The banks plan on handing out record bonuses this year to their executives and traders .
The very institutions that precipitated the economic crisis through their speculation and looting operations are doing better than ever .
This is not an accident .
It is the intended outcome of the policy carried out by the Obama administration .
Many auto workers looked to Obama for positive change .
Instead , the administration has forced through massive cuts in wages and benefits , along with the destruction of tens of thousands of jobs .
Obama has shepherded General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy court , where the two companies left billions in unwanted liabilities behind , including health care obligations to tens of thousands of retirees .
The administration is carrying out a similar policy in relation to state and local governments , refusing to give them the type of loans made available to the banks .
The largest state in the country , California , is on the verge of economic meltdown , and the state government is seizing on the crisis as an opportunity to gut education , welfare and other social programs .
Similar draconian measures are being implemented throughout the country .
As for the Obama ’s principal domestic initiative — health care “ reform ” — the administration ’s proposals are driven by the desire of corporations to slash their employee health care costs and are tailored to the demands of the major players in the health care industry — particularly the insurance and pharmaceutical companies .
Health care “ reform ” has been shifted from providing decent care for all to cutting costs .
Obama insists that reducing health care expenditures is imperative for lowering the budget deficit and restoring the economy , even as he declares he will do “ whatever it takes ” to bail out the banks .
If a bill on health care eventually passes , it will require workers to pay more for inadequate health insurance and rationed care .
This “ expanded coverage ” will be used as a pretext for slashing federal health care programs , particularly Medicare .
Like everything else , health care is being restructured as a more openly class - based system .
Workers will have to choose between their health and their other needs , while the rich are afforded the best treatment money can buy .
The outcome of the administration ’s policies to deal with the economic crisis is a massive redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top .
Democratic rights
On all essentials , the Obama administration has continued the antidemocratic policies of its predecessor .
It has invoked “ state secrets ” to block court cases challenging torture and domestic spying .
The administration reversed a promise to release photos showing US torture of detainees .
It has continued the military tribunals and indicated it plans to adopt a policy of indefinite detention for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
Obama has repeatedly insisted that there will be no prosecution of any of the crimes carried out by the Bush administration .
This means no one will be held accountable and that the crimes will continue .
* * *
The outcome of the 2008 elections is an object lesson on the failure of American democracy .
These elections produced an outcome that is diametrically opposed to the aspirations of the voters who cast ballots for the victor .
It is not possible , through the existing political system , to effect a change in government policy .
The basic reason is that the political institutions and parties are the unvarnished instruments of class rule .
The financial elite exercises absolute control over every aspect of political life .
What is perhaps most remarkable is the fact that the Obama administration barely makes an effort to conceal its class character .
It seems to assume that Obama ’s persona by itself is sufficient to quell opposition .
To the extent that the administration ’s attention is focused on the Democratic Party and its periphery — the assorted coterie of “ left ” publications and organizations — this evaluation is correct .
However , there has already been a significant fall in Obama ’s poll ratings , including substantial declines on the economy and health care .
According to the most recent Washington Post - ABC
News poll , Obama ’s overall approval ratings have dropped below 60 percent for the first time .
We suspect that public unease is , in fact , far broader and deeper than these figures yet indicate .
Here , Lincoln ’s famous aphorism is appropriate : “ You can fool some of the people all of the time , and all of the people some of the time , but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time . ”
Public disenchantment and anger are being driven by the objective impact of the economic crisis , the consequences of Obama ’s wars , and the ever more glaring contradiction between the popular sentiments to which he appealed to get elected and the social interests that he serves .
To the extent that the American people feel they have been taken for a ride and played for suckers , the mass opposition will be that much more intense .
The administration has yet to reckon with the independent intervention of the American working class .
When this class movement does develop , it will seek new channels independent of and in opposition to the entire political and social system .

The falling - out centres on a foreword Charles wrote for a handbook on the restoration of old houses .
The heir to the throne used the opportunity to express his belief that buildings should always be restored in their original style .
The society , which frequently uses modern architecture and design , asked Charles to amend his conservative views .
The Prince refused and subsequently resigned from the Society .
Philip Venning , secretary of SPAB , said : ‘ We agree with so much of what he says , but on the issue of new design there are occasions when we disagree , and we do n’t disguise the fact .
We were pleased he was our patron . ’
Charles was asked to write the foreword to The Old House Handbook by its authors , Roger Hunt and Marianne Suhr .
After his work was rejected , Philip Venning provided the introduction himself .

The SPAB , founded by socialist architect and writer William Morris , is the world ’s oldest environmental campaigning group .
It is understood that Charles resigned from the Society several months ago when his five - year term as patron ended - before his very public row with Richard Rogers over the Chelsea Barracks development .
SPAB has yet to appoint a new patron .
JERUSALEM  Senior Israeli officials accused President Obama on Wednesday of failing to acknowledge what they called clear understandings with the Bush administration that allowed Israel to build West Bank settlement housing within certain guidelines while still publicly claiming to honor a settlement “ freeze . ”
The complaint was the latest in a growing rift between the Obama administration and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over how to move forward to achieve peace in the Middle East .
Mr. Obama was in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and is scheduled to address the Muslim world from Cairo on Thursday .
The Israeli officials said that repeated discussions with Bush officials starting in late 2002 resulted in agreement that housing could be built within the boundaries of certain settlement blocks as long as no new land was expropriated , no special economic incentives were offered to move to settlements and no new settlements were built .
The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity so that they could discuss an issue of such controversy between the two governments .

The Emmy - winning scientist angered a few audience members when he criticized literal interpretation of the biblical verse Genesis 1:16 , which reads : “ God made two great lights — the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night .
He also made the stars . ”
He pointed out that the sun , the “ greater light , ” is but one of countless stars and that the “ lesser light ” is the moon , which really is not a light at all , rather a reflector of light .
A number of audience members left the room at that point , visibly angered by what some perceived as irreverence .
“ We believe in a God ! ” exclaimed one woman as she left the room with three young children .
That people can still deny this easily understood and intuitive scientific fact by relying on their holy text should give us pause considering some of the other , less benign , things that are written in it .
For instance , things about the roles of women , the value of certain races , and the end of the world .
While catching up on what is happening around the atheist blogosphere , I ran across a post at Religion * is* a Problem ( update : this blog is no longer available ) that absolutely requires a rant .
In fact , I think I may have just identified my # 1 pet peeve ( at least for today ) about some religious believers .
Of course , I recognize that many religious believers will find this every bit as upsetting as I do , but I still want to make sure they are taking the correct lesson away from it .
The story concerns scientist and entertainerbeing booed by Christians for highlighting an incompatibility between reality and their bible .
Yes , as farfetched as it seems , it appears that there may be some Christians who have managed to remain so ignorant of reality that they are unaware that modern science conflicts with some of what is in their bibles .
Here is how the incident was described by Tim Woods in the Waco Tribune - Herald What ?
So science should not be discussed when it conflicts with your irrational beliefs ?
Really ?
Which bothers you more - that you were the last to learn that your bible is filled with claims which have been dispelled by science or that some uppity scientist had the nerve to say so ?
Science has advanced considerably since your bible was written .
If you 've had even minimal education , I 'd expect that you 'd realize that none of the modern conveniences which you enjoy were around in biblical times .
None of these things were possible with the level of ignorance that ruled that time .
Does this mean you should give up your car , your refrigerator , and modern medical care for your children because these things are based on the same science that dispels much of your old book ?
Would it disappoint you if one of your children grew up and discovered the cure for cancer ?
No ?
You realize that this would be accomplished by medical science and that medical science is built on the same foundational sciences which contradict much of your bible ?
When you protest " We believe in a god " and then leave the room with your children , what are you hoping to accomplish ?
Do you want to make sure your children are deprived of a modern education so they 'll grow up in ignorance like you ?
This sounds an awful lot like child abuse ( or at least willful neglect ) to me .
Do n't you want your children to be better off than you are ?
Do n't you want them to know more about how the world works than you do or than the authors of your bible did ?
As Religion * is* a Problem noted , this would be somewhat funny if it was n't so terribly sad .
Agreed , but I think the real kick in the nuts is the idea that the woman who said " We believe in a god " before leaving with her kids probably thinks that her theistic belief is equally valid as the scientific findings which apparently upset her .
This is my main pet peeve - the confusion of personal belief with truth and the unfortunately common tendency to elevate personal beliefs to the level of reality .
In any case , the rules about private co-payments , as they are called , in cancer care are contradictory and hard to understand , said Nigel Edwards , the director of policy for the N.H.S. Confederation , which represents hospitals and other health care providers .
“ I ’ve had conflicting advice from different lawyers , ” he said , “ but it does seem like a violation of natural justice to say that either you do n’t get the drug you want , or you have to pay for all your treatment . ”
Karol Sikora , a professor of cancer medicine at the Imperial College School of Medicine and one of Dr. Charlson ’s co-authors , said that co-payments were particularly prevalent in cancer care .
Armed with information from the Internet and patients ’ networks , cancer patients are increasingly likely to demand , and pay for , cutting - edge drugs that the health service considers too expensive to be cost - effective .
“ You have a population that is informed and consumerist about how it behaves about health care information , and an N.H.S. that can no longer afford to pay for everything for everybody , ” he said .
Professor Sikora said oncologists were adept at circumventing the system by , for example , referring patients to other doctors who can provide the private medication separately .
As wrenching as it can be to administer more sophisticated drugs to some patients than to others , he said , “ if you ’re a doctor working in the system , you should let your patients have the treatment they want , if they can afford to pay for it . ”
In any case , he said , the health service is riddled with inequities .
Some drugs are available in some parts of the country but not in others .
Waiting lists for treatment vary wildly from place to place .
Some regions spend $ 280 per capita on cancer care , Professor Sikora said , while others spend just $ 90 .
In Mrs. Hirst ’s case , the confusion was compounded by the fact that three other patients at her hospital were already doing what she had been forbidden to do  buying extra drugs to supplement their cancer care .
The arrangements had “ evolved without anyone questioning whether it was right or wrong , ” said Laura Mason , a hospital spokeswoman .
Because their treatment began before the Health Department explicitly condemned the practice , they have been allowed to continue .
The rules are confusing .
“ It ’s quite a fine line , ” Ms. Mason said .
“ You ca n’t have a course of N.H.S. and private treatment at the same time on the same appointment  for instance , if a particular drug has to be administered alongside another drug which is N.H.S. - funded . ”
But , she said , the health service rules seem to allow patients to receive the drugs during separate hospital visits  the N.H.S. drugs during an N.H.S. appointment , the extra drugs during a private appointment .

TEHRAN , IRAN ( BosNewsLife ) –
As the world focuses on the political turmoil in Iran , two detained Christian women are “ in danger of being forgotten ” amid concerns they may face execution , Iranian Christians said Tuesday , July 7 .
Marzieh Amirizadeh , 30 , and Maryam Rustampoor , 27 , have been held for over four months in Tehran ’s notorious Evin prison apparently for converting to Christianity from Islam .
Iranian Christians and rights investigators said the two young women , who were arrested March 5 , suffered sleep deprivation as part of police interrogations and were held in solitary confinement for three weeks in May and early June .
Later , they were put together in one small cell for about two weeks before being moved to a larger area to make place for other inmates , including many protesters who were detained following last month ’s disputed presidential elections , said Christians with close knowledge about the situation .
About 600 women were reportedly brought to Evin prison during the protests .
EXECUTION PENDING ?
There was still no clarity regarding the case of the two Christian women , Tuesday , July 7 , with one judge reportedly telling them they were both to be executed as ‘ apostates ’ .
“ Maryam and Marzieh have responded with courage , however , telling the judge to ‘ expedite his sentence ’ , ” said Pray for Iran , an Internet initiative of Iranian churches .
After international pressure , the Iranian Government ’s Parliamentary Committee reportedly removed articles stipulating the death penalty for apostasy from the Islamic Penal Code Bill , but the changes have to be approved by legislators .
“ Until the Islamic Penal Code Bill is finalized by the Iranian Parliament and Guardian Council , there is still a danger that the judicial committee ’s revisions may not be taken into account , ” explained Alexa Papadouris , Advocacy Director of Britain - based Christian Solidarity Worldwide , a religious rights group .
Apostasy along with murder , adultery , rape , armed robbery , and drug trafficking are all punishable by death in Iran , and last week Iranian media reported that at least six people were hanged for murder in the same prison where the two Christian women are held .
“ GREAT COURAGE ”
Yet , “ Maryam and Marzieh have demonstrated great courage and trust in God .
They believe the promise of Jesus that they will be given the words to speak when they are taken before judges , ” said Sam Yeghnazar , founder of Elam Ministries , an organization supporting te growing churches in Iran .
Elam Ministries said the outcome of the “ political turmoil ” in Iran “ could crucially impact the level of suffering ” of the two women and other Christians who were formerly Muslim .
Besides Amirizadeh and Rustampoor , over 50 Christians were arrested , some being held for weeks in solitary confinement , several Christian sources said .
At least eight prominent Christians were killed since 1979 , Elam Ministries added .
IRAN HARD -LINERS
“ If the position of hard - liners is strengthened there is a real danger they could unleash more persecution against the church , ” the group added .
Elam Ministries linked the attacks to concern among Iran ’s leaders about the spread of Christianity in the Islamic nation .
“ Because Iran is a strategic gateway nation , the growing church in Iran will impact Muslim nations across the Islamic world . ”
The group said in 1979 , there were less than 500 known Christians from a Muslim background in Iran .
“ Today the most conservative estimate is that there are at least 100,000 believers in the nation . ”
Church leaders have reportedly said that they believe “ millions ” can be added “ to the church in the next few years - such is the spiritual hunger that exists and the disillusionment with the Islamic regime . ”
OPPOSITION LEADER
Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi vowed Monday , July 6 , to continue his campaign against the re-election of the perceived hard - line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
However Iran ’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned demonstrations and accused Western leaders for their alleged “ meddling ” in Iran ’s internal affairs , threatening to respond with a “ Iron fist . ”
At least 20 protesters and eight members of the feared Basij militia have died in recent protests , officials said .
They include Neda Agha Soltan , a 26 - year - old woman who was shot and killed by a suspected militia sniper .
Pictures and video footage of Soltan , with blood pouring from her mouth and nose as a few Iranian men struggled to save her , have became a powerful symbol of the protests taking place over Iran ’s disputed presidential election .
Authorities have reportedly forced her family to leave their Tehran home , and refused to return her body for a proper funeral .
A Sophos poll* of 550 IT professionals has revealed that seven out of ten respondents believe that NASA hacker Gary McKinnon should not be extradited to the US , despite the high court 's contradictory verdict earlier today .
Survey results
Should Gary McKinnon be extradited to the USA ?
Yes , he should be extradited 29 % No , he should not 71 %
The London - based hacker applied for judicial review following a previous decision in February this year by the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) that refused to bring charges against McKinnon in the UK .
Despite a relentless media campaign and several extradition appeals in the House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights , today 's decision by Lord Justice Stanley Burnton and Mr Justice Wilkie could leave McKinnon facing up to 60 years imprisonment in a ' supermax ' facility .
The same poll , conducted by the IT security and control firm back in 2006 ** , saw the IT community divided over McKinnon 's fate ( 52 percent against extradition ; 48 percent for ) , but the latest figures show that there has been a surge in public support for the self - confessed hacker .
" McKinnon has had tremendous support from hackers and ordinary people throughout this saga - but what is truly staggering is the support he has received from the IT community , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos .
" The consensus is that it is perhaps inappropriate to make an example of a UFO conspiracy theorist when serious crimes are still being carried out by financially - motivated hackers , stealing identities , sending spam and creating botnets . "
McKinnon was arrested seven years ago after allegedly hacking into computers belonging to the US Army , US Navy , US Air Force , Department of Defense and NASA .
The computer enthusiast from North London claims that he broke into the computer systems only to hunt for top secret information about anti-gravity propulsion systems and alien technology , which he believed the authorities were hiding from the public .
US authorities , meanwhile , allege that McKinnon - known by the handle ' Solo ' - caused nearly a million dollars worth of damage , shutting down systems responsible for the tracking the location of naval ships , and protecting Washington DC .
" Of course a strong message must be sent out to hackers that their activities are unacceptable , but there is arguably a difference between McKinnon and cybercriminals who are in it for the money , " continued Cluley .
" The question is , do McKinnon and his numerous supporters have any more tricks up their sleeve to prevent his unwilling departure from Heathrow airport ? "

Mozilla is working on a new technology that it hopes will remove the threat of Cross - Site Scripting ( XSS ) attacks , which have plagued websites for several years .
XSS vulnerabilities allow malicious code to be injected into legitimate websites , which users are persuaded to click on leading to an attack such as a drive - by download .
This is made possible because currently all the content received from a web server 's response is treated the same legitimate or malicious by the browser that requests it .
However , with Mozilla 's new technology snappily named Content Security Policy ' ( CSP ) , the makers of Firefox aim to stop XSS by telling the browser which content is legitimate .
The browser can then disregard the malicious code .
Brandon Sterne , security programme manager for Mozilla , said on the Mozilla security blog that the new model it was suggesting would be very different to the current unrestricted model for the web .
But Sterne said that CSP could be implemented in phases , that complex sites could be modified to support it , and that it could drive a stake through the heart of XSS .
" XSS vulnerabilities have real value to attackers and are shared rapidly across the web once discovered .
Sites can breathe a little easier knowing their users are protected , even if a XSS bug slips through , " he said .
The government 's efforts to rush through emergency legislation to clean up politics tonight took a second knock in as many days as it was defeated in its attempts to make it easier to secure prosecutions in alleged cases of " cash for questions " .
On the third and final day of debate on the parliamentary standards bill in the Commons , the government was defeated by three votes , 250 to 247 , on plans to end " parliamentary privilege " and allow parliamentary debates to be used in court as evidence .
John Reid , the former home secretary , voted against the government for the first time in his parliamentary career .
Margaret Beckett , the former foreign secretary , was another rebel .
The justice secretary , Jack Straw , said he would " respect " the will of the house .
But a government spokesman described the defeat as " scandalous " and accused Conservative MPs of a lack of will to reform .
A Conservative spokesman said the vote was " a complete shambles " and insisted they supported other planks of the bill .
The new legislation has been squeezed into the last three weeks of parliament 's agenda , as the main parties push for new rules to reach the statute book before the summer .
That would allow MPs to leave Westminster for the three - month summer break to work in their constituencies .
But some have been unhappy at the crunched timetable for the bill and the attempt by the government to add new " legal " elements to the legislation .
Under the plans , the new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority would oversee expenses claims and have powers to recommend fines or expulsion for MPs who break the rules .
On Monday night the government dropped plans which could have made a new code of conduct for MPs legally enforceable .
On Tuesday the justice secretary dropped a further aspect of the bill , which would have legally required MPs to declare any " specified financial interest " before taking part in a debate in the Commons chamber .
After the Labour backbencher Frank Field said he would rather go to jail than obey this , Straw announced he would drop that aspect .
Sir Stuart Bell , one of the Labour rebels , said : " When we kicked off we expected a bill that was going to get rid of the incestuous relationship between MPs and the Fees Office .
But then the government added in all sorts of additional clauses that created new criminal offences .
" The problem was that we were seeing all privilege going to the courts as in the US where Congress gets challenged all the way to the supreme court . " "
Today the cross-party justice select committee published a report warning ending parliamentary privilege would curb MPs ' ability to speak freely on behalf of voters .
Particularly damaging was evidence by the clerk of the house , Malcolm Jack , who warned the move would have a " chilling effect " on MPs and undermine parliamentary privilege .
The concerns of the justice committee were shared by the human rights committee .
Its chair , Andrew Dismore , said the parliamentary standards bill in its current form was incompatible with human rights laws , and MPs under investigation should have the " opportunity to be heard in person " .
It looked like the first drop of rain in the desert of drugs policy .
Last week Antonio Maria Costa , the executive director of the UN office on drugs and crime , said what millions of liberal - minded people have been waiting to hear .
" Law enforcement should shift its focus from drug users to drug traffickers … people who take drugs need medical help , not criminal retribution . "
Drug production should remain illegal , possession and use should be decriminalised .
Guardian readers toasted him with bumpers of peppermint tea , and , perhaps , a celebratory spliff .
I did n't .
I believe that informed adults should be allowed to inflict whatever suffering they wish – on themselves .
But we are not entitled to harm other people .
I know people who drink fair - trade tea and coffee , shop locally and take cocaine at parties .
They are revolting hypocrites .
Every year cocaine causes some 20,000 deaths in Colombia and displaces several hundred thousand people from their homes .
Children are blown up by landmines ; indigenous people are enslaved ; villagers are tortured and killed ; rainforests are razed .
You 'd cause less human suffering if instead of discreetly retiring to the toilet at a media drinks party , you went into the street and mugged someone .
But the counter - cultural association appears to insulate people from ethical questions .
If commissioning murder , torture , slavery , civil war , corruption and deforestation is not a crime , what is ?
I am talking about elective drug use , not addiction .
I cannot find comparative figures for the United Kingdom , but in the United States casual users of cocaine outnumber addicts by about 12 to one .
I agree that addicts should be helped , not prosecuted .
I would like to see a revival of the British programme that was killed by a tabloid witch - hunt in 1971 : until then all heroin addicts were entitled to clean , legal supplies administered by doctors .
Cocaine addicts should be offered residential detox .
But , at the risk of alienating most of the readership of this newspaper , I maintain that while cocaine remains illegal , casual users should remain subject to criminal law .
Decriminalisation of the products of crime expands the market for this criminal trade .
We have a choice of two consistent policies .
The first is to sustain global prohibition , while helping addicts and prosecuting casual users .
This means that the drugs trade will remain the preserve of criminal gangs .
It will keep spreading crime and instability around the world , and ensure that narcotics are still cut with contaminants .
As Nick Davies argued during his investigation of drugs policy for the Guardian , major seizures raise the price of drugs .
Demand among addicts is inelastic , so higher prices mean that they must find more money to buy them .
The more drugs the police capture and destroy , the more robberies and muggings addicts will commit .
The other possible policy is to legalise and regulate the global trade .
This would undercut the criminal networks and guarantee unadulterated supplies to consumers .
There might even be a market for certified fair - trade cocaine .
Costa 's new report begins by rejecting this option .
If it did otherwise , he would no longer be executive director of the UN office on drugs and crime .
The report argues that " any reduction in the cost of drug control … will be offset by much higher expenditure on public health ( due to the surge of drug consumption ) " .
It admits that tobacco and alcohol kill more people than illegal drugs , but claims that this is only because fewer illegal drugs are consumed .
Strangely however , it fails to supply any evidence to support the claim that narcotics are dangerous .
Nor does it distinguish between the effects of drugs themselves and the effects of the adulteration and disease caused by their prohibition .
Why not ?
Perhaps because the evidence would torpedo the rest of the report .
A couple of weeks ago , Ben Goldacre drew attention to the largest study on cocaine ever undertaken , completed by the World Health Organisation in 1995 .
I 've just read it , and this is what it says .
" Health problems from the use of legal substances , particularly alcohol and tobacco , are greater than health problems from cocaine use .
Few experts describe cocaine as invariably harmful to health .
Cocaine - related problems are widely perceived to be more common and more severe for intensive , high - dosage users and very rare and much less severe for occasional , low - dosage users … occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems . "
This study was suppressed by the WHO after threats of an economic embargo by the Clinton government .
Drugs policy in most nations is a matter of religion , not science .
The same goes for heroin .
The biggest study of opiate use ever conducted ( at Philadelphia general hospital ) found that addicts suffered no physical harm , even though some of them had been taking heroin for 20 years .
The devastating health effects of heroin use are caused by adulterants and the lifestyles of people forced to live outside the law .
Like cocaine , heroin is addictive ; but unlike cocaine , the only consequence of its addiction appears to be … addiction .
Costa 's half - measure , in other words , gives us the worst of both worlds : more murder , more destruction , more muggings , more adulteration .
Another way of putting it is this : you will , if Costa 's proposal is adopted , be permitted without fear of prosecution to inject yourself with heroin cut with drain cleaner and brick dust , sold illegally and soaked in blood ; but not with clean and legal supplies .
His report does raise one good argument , however .
At present the trade in class A drugs is concentrated in the rich nations .
If it were legalised , we could cope .
The use of drugs is likely to rise , but governments could use the extra taxes to help people tackle addiction .
But because the wholesale price would collapse with legalisation , these drugs would for the first time become widely available in poorer nations , which are easier for companies to exploit ( as tobacco and alcohol firms have found ) and which are less able to regulate , raise taxes or pick up the pieces .
The widespread use of cocaine or heroin in the poor world could cause serious social problems : I 've seen , for example , how a weaker drug – khat – seems to dominate life in Somali - speaking regions of Africa .
" The universal ban on illicit drugs , " the UN argues , " provides a great deal of protection to developing countries " .
So Costa 's office has produced a study comparing the global costs of prohibition with the global costs of legalisation , allowing us to see whether the current policy ( murder , corruption , war , adulteration ) causes less misery than the alternative ( widespread addiction in poorer nations ) ?
The hell it has .
Even to raise the possibility of such research would be to invite the testerics in Congress to shut off the UN 's funding .
The drug charity Transform has addressed this question , but only for the UK , where the results are clear - cut : prohibition is the worse option .
As far as I can discover , no one has attempted a global study .
Until that happens , Costa 's opinions on this issue are worth as much as mine or anyone else 's : nothing at all .
Mosley says he will now concentrate on family matters when his term ends Max Mosley has decided he will not stand for re-election when his term as president of motorsport 's governing body the FIA ends in October .
The 69 - year - old , who had last month hinted he might go back on an earlier decision to stand down , revealed his decision in a letter to FIA members .
" I have decided to reconfirm my decision - I will not be a candidate in October , " Mosley wrote .
Mosley has endorsed former Ferrari team boss Jean Todt as his successor .
The Frenchman has not yet put his name forward as a candidate to the World Motor Sport Council .
Finnish former world rally champion Ari Vatanen , however , confirmed his intention to stand as Mosley 's potential successor last week .
Mosley agreed he would not seek a fifth four - year term as part of a peace deal struck to end the threat of a breakaway championship by Formula 1 teams .
606 : DEBATE
We need someone who knows the sport , a technician instead of a politician
Wucash
The teams ' umbrella organisation Fota - which represents all current teams on the grid with the exception of Williams and Force India - opposed Mosley 's arbitrary style of governance .
In particular , the teams were frustrated by his plans to force through a budget cap and further rule changes for 2010 .
Once the threat of a breakaway had been averted , Mosley claimed he was under pressure to change his mind , saying he had received " almost 100 messages from FIA member clubs urging me to think again " .
However , Mosley , whose son Alexander died in May , has now said he will not reverse his decision to stand down .
" From a personal point of view , it would be very difficult for me to change my mind and stand again , " added Mosley , who became president in the mid-Eighties .
" To continue now would be inconsistent to my family , particularly after our recent loss .
After all I will be 70 next year . "
Mosley has now urged the WMSC to appoint a strong team to continue reshaping the sport and hinted he may not disappear from F1 saying ; " I hope to play a modest role myself . "
The teams want to find a neutral figure to succeed Mosley , however , the incumbent president has named Todt , 63 , as his preferred successor .
Couple Yeoh ( left ) and Todt could work together at the FIA " I believe the right person to lead the team would be Jean Todt , " Mosley said .
" Jean is unquestionably the outstanding motor sport manager of his generation .
" Teams run by him have won the world rally championship , cross country rallies , and in the last 15 years , one F1 championship after another .
" Finally , I must emphasise he would not in any way be a motor industry candidate .
He would have no special relationship with his former company , Ferrari .
" If he agrees to stand , I think he would be the ideal person to continue but also to extend the work of the past 16 years . "
Todt is understood to have already begun campaigning , flying out to chivvy support from member clubs across the globe .
His partner , actress Michelle Yeoh , has also started to work with the FIA on its road safety and environmental projects .
Todt and Vatanen worked together when the Frenchman was Vatanen 's team boss at the Peugeot world rally team .
The pair are now expected to go head - to - head for the FIA presidency on 23 October .

How to make a movement .
Lessons learned from dancing guy .
2009-06-06
Being an analytical learning - addict , I ca n’t help but distill some lessons from this “ Guy Starts Dance Party ” video taken last week .
You ca n’t help but smile .
First at the guy , then at the reaction .
It ’s so fun !
But this is also the most obvious , instant , and visual example of how to start a movement , that books like Tribes and The Tipping Point have covered so well .
For anyone interested in starting a movement , or hoping others start a movement around your company / mission / music , how can we describe what we see here ?
The leader has to be doing it for his own sake — not trying to start anything .
He has the guts to look a little ridiculous , but not care .
Most are too shy to stand out like that .
He ’s so clearly having fun that others think , “ He ’s having more fun than me .
Maybe I should join in . ”
What he ’s doing is so simple , it ’s almost instructional .
Even if you usually do n’t , you could do that .
The turning point is when he gets one follower .
Following the leader , and also clearly having fun doing it .
Following the leader , and also clearly having fun doing it .
But maybe they ’re just two freaks ?
Hmm ... better not get involved yet .
Tempting , though .
Wait and watch .
It ’s important that they were very public — seen by everyone .
Movements need to be visible .
Now comes the second follower .
It ’s almost a crowd .
If you were to join in now , you would n’t be a freak .
Hmm ... maybe ?
It ’s almost a crowd .
If you were to join in now , you would n’t be a freak .
Hmm ... maybe ?
The tipping point is the next two people that jump in .
Now it ’s a crowd !
Now it ’s a crowd !
Three more jump in immediately .
Momentum !
It ’s a movement !
No reason not to .
Let ’s go !
Every adventurous person in the crowd jumps in .
Finally , every non-adventurous person in the crowd jumps in , because they ’d be ridiculed if they do n’t .
So if you wanted to make a movement , what lessons would you take from this ?
If you want to be a starter , have the guts to stand out .
Make your actions easy to imitate .
Fun to follow .
Attract attention .
Show everyone what you ’re doing .
If you find a lone nut doing something great , have the guts to follow him / her .
You ’ll also stand out , but you ’re serving one of the most important roles in making this a movement .
Show everyone how to follow .
Found something cool that only a few freaks are doing ?
Get some friends and say , “ Let ’s go ! ” Jump in .
Doing something that needs followers ?
Help fan the flames of this process .
Football news is a little slow , but that does n’t mean the action here stops .
The Tour de France is in full swing , and while cycling is not the most popular of sports in the U.S. , it does n’t mean that it ’s not a big deal .
After today ’s stage 5 , Lance Armstrong stands in 2nd place overall , a mere second behind the 1st place leader .
The Tour is arguably one of the most grueling competitions in all of sports .
It lasts three weeks , covering distances of 100 + miles per day , or in the time trials , pushes riders as hard as they can go for a solid 20 minutes .
It ’s a sport with a lot of history and great competitors .
Bicycling.com has put together a list of the “ Top 20 Tour Riders ” to ever participate in the race .
I ’m going to share their list and descriptions of the riders from 10 down .
Then , I ’ll compare them to a mainstream sports athlete ( past or present )
Here goes :
10 . Laurent Jalabert
While he was never a contender for the yellow jersey , Frenchman Laurent Jalabert earned a reputation as one of the most versatile riders in modern cycling .
In unprecedented manner , Jalabert twice won the green points jersey , awarded to the best all - around sprinter and he twice won the polka - dot jersey for best climber .
So why did he never win the Tour you ask ?
No one –not even Jalabert — seems to know .
Athlete : Carl Yastrzemski ( Boston Red Sox )
Yastrzemski did it all for the Red Sox during his 23 year run with the team .
Too bad he played for them during their 80 + year Championship draught .
Yaz was an 18 time all star , earned 7 Gold Gloves , and is a member of 3,000 hit club .
So why did n’t he ever win the Championship ?
Oh yeah —
The Curse .
9. Frederico Bahamontes
This Spaniard defined the pure climber .
And for years he defined Spanish cycling .
Erratic and emotional , he could sprint to the top of a climb , simply so he ’d have time to stop for an ice cream .
Or he could drop out of the race , bored by flat stages .
But Bahomontes , who grabbed the best - climber award six times , finally struck it big by winning the Tour outright in 1959 .
Athlete : Brett Favre ( Packers / Jets / ? )
Like Bahomontes , Favre is very emotional and often time erratic on the field .
While Favre never physically quit , many have called him out for mentally quitting .
It was not unusual for him to throw 3 - 4 picks in one game even if he had 4 TDs and no INTs the week before .
Even though his play was unpredictable , he finally struck it big by winning Super Bowl XXXI .
8. Erick Zabel
Established in 1953 , the green points jersey is sometimes known as the sprinter ’s jersey , because to win this jersey riders sprint for points throughout the three - week Tour .
But quite often the fastest pure sprinters do not win this coveted prize because they are unable to contest any sprints on the mountain stages .
German rider Erik Zabel has proven to be the ideal rider for such a prize .
Not the fastest sprinter - that title generally went to Italy ’s Mario Cipollini - Zabel nevertheless is the most versatile sprinter , and such qualities won him the green points jersey six times , more than any other rider in the history of the event .
Athlete : Michael Phelps ( U.S. Olympic Swimmer )
Pretty much each race in the sport of swimming is a sprint and there ’s no question Phelps is the most versitile sprinter around .
He ’s won 14 gold medals in races of various distances and swimming styles .
7. Raymond Poulidor
“ The Eternal Second ” never won the Tour de France , and he never even wore the yellow jersey .
But he is remembered as one of its champions –its greatest loser – because he won the heart of French fans .
Always a contender , never a winner , Poulidor is remembered as the down home alter ego to city slick Jacques Anquetil .
And even at the end of his career he could be found giving Eddy Merckx a fight .
Great champions , it is said , are defined by those they beat .
And Poulidor always pushed them to a higher level .
Athlete : John Stockton ( Utah Jazz )
Despite going to the NBA Finals twice in his long career , Stockton came up just short of becoming a champion himself .
He became known as one of the greatest point guards to ever play the game , and won over the Mormons people of Utah with his work ethic and boyish charm .
He was the timeless classic , even wearing thigh high shorts until he retired in 2003 .
Even towards the end of his career he could be found giving Michael Jordan a fight .
6. Philippe Tys
The Belgian would likely have won many more Tours .
But he had to wait out World War I before he could return to win his third Tour de France in 1920 .
Known for his Herculean training routine , Thys defined the new kind of all - around rider , who could do a little of everything from climbing to sprinting to time trialing to rolling out big miles , that would win the Tour now that the high mountains of the Pyrenees and Alpes were a common feature .
Athlete : Derek Jeter ( N.Y. Yankees )
This Yankee can likely win many more titles , but he has to wait out the title “ draught ” that the Yankees are in .
Jeter is arguably one of the greatest all around ball players .
His fielding is always exciting , and he ’s clutch in the batters box .
He will win another one soon .
5. Miguel Indurain
Big Mig broke the mold in many ways .
In a country known for its great climbers , Indurain showed he could be an even better time trialer .
Using a strategy that essentially called for not losing time in the mountains , then crushing everyone in the time trials , he became the first consecutive five - time winner by rarely attacking .
His personality was as sedate , and unflappable , as his riding style .
Athlete : Tim Duncan ( San Antonio Spurs )
Duncan was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands .
In an area known for swimming , Duncan showed that he could be an even better basketball player .
Routinely using a strategy that calls for bank shots , Duncan has brought the fundamentals back to the game .
He ’s not the most physical center in the league and like Indurain , his personality is very sedate .
4. Bernard Hinault
After Jacques Anquetil and eddy Merckx , Frenchman Hinault became the third five - time winner in the Tour .
The volatile rider was a relentless fighter , earning himself the nickname , “ The Badger . ”
But Hinault was also a master time trialer , a master tactician , and a master of the mental game .
Athlete : Peyton Manning ( Indianapolis Colts )
Manning is a master of the huddle , a master behind center , and a master of the mental game .
Like Hinault , he ’s a true winner that is n’t afraid to get his hands dirty .
3. Jacques Anquetil
Master Jacques was the first five - time winner in the Tour .
Using his stellar time trialing skills , he steamrolled his competition , in particular Raymond Poulidor .
Anquetil represented the chic urban style of mod Paris ( little matter that he actually lived in Rouen ) and he reveled in his playboy image .
Athlete : Sean Avery ( New York Rangers )
Avery is a talented hockey player but I draw the comparison to Anquetil for his playboy image .
Avery took a summer internship with Vogue magazine because of his interest in fashion .
He has been linked to many high profile women , and pretty much defines the term “ urban chic ” for males .
2. Eddy Merckx
The Belgian was clearly the greatest champion of his generation .
From the moment he entered his first Tour , which he won in dominating fashion , he showed that he would be the man to beat for years to come .
He destroyed his competition in 1969 and continued to do so until 1975 — but unlike modern heroes such as Miguel Indurain and Lance Armstrong , the Tour was just one more race Merckx won throughout the entire year ; he raced a full calendar , from January to November , and won nearly every major race many times over .
They did not call him the Cannibal for nothing .
Athlete : Michael Jordan ( Chicago Bulls )
After winning his first NBA title , Jordan showed that he would dominate the league for years .
He won 6 titles during his career and is regarded as the greatest player to ever play the game .
There ’s a reason why his logo is on many Nike products , and there ’s a reason why there are Eddy Merckx bikes for sale .
1. Lance Armstrong
With seven
Tour titles , Armstrong is the race ’s ultimate champion .
The American transcended the Tour with the story first of his heroic comeback from cancer then of his outright refusal to lose until he decided it was time to retire — but he also understood that his career , and his comeback was defined by the Tour de France .
Attacking the race with unmatched discipline , he redefined how cyclists prepare for it .
Entire training camps were devoted to the Tour and the team built solely to support Armstrong in the chase for yellow .
He responded time and again , be it in the mountain or the time trials , by simply being the best , seven time running .
Athlete : Tiger Woods ( Golf )
With 68 PGA
Tour wins , Tiger is behind Sam Snead and Jack Nicklaus , respectively , for the most PGA Tour wins , and yet he ’s only been playing for 14 years .
When it ’s all said and done , Tiger will be the best golfer this world has seen just like Armstrong is the best cyclist this world has seen .
Tiger ’s father , Earl Woods , died after a battle with prostate cancer in 2006 .
Tiger took 9 weeks off and then returned to win the U.S. Open Championship .
Tiger has redefined what preparation is from a professional golfer ’s standpoint .
He spends countless hours on the course , studying his swing , working out ( ahem , John Daly ) , and seeking advice .

A Danish expert said on Friday that a 15th century Vinland Map , the first known map depicting part of America prior to Christopher Columbus ’ arrival on the continent , is almost certainly authentic .
The map has been surrounded by controversy since its discovery in 1950 , with many scholars suspecting it was merely part of a hoax intended to prove that Vikings were the first Europeans to land in North America ( a claim confirmed by an archaeological find in 1960 ) .
Doubts about the map remained even after carbon dating was established as a credible way of determining the age of an object .
“ All the tests that we have done over the past five years — on the materials and other aspects — do not show any signs of forgery , ” said Rene Larsen , rector of the School of Conservation under the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts , during an interview with Reuters .
The map shows both Greenland and a western Atlantic island “ Vinilanda Insula , ” the Vinland of the Icelandic sagas , now linked by scholars to Newfoundland , Canada , where Norsemen under Leif Eriksson settled around AD 1000 .
Larsen said his team studied the ink , writing , wormholes and parchment of the map , which is kept at Yale University .
They found that wormholes caused by wood beetles were consistent with those in the books in which the map was bound , he said .
Allegations that the ink was too recent because it contained a substance known as anatase titanium dioxide could be disproved because other medieval maps have been found with the same substance , which is likely derived from sand used to dry wet ink .
American scholars have carbon dated the map to about 1440 , about 50 years prior to Columbus ’ discovery of the New World in 1492 .
Experts believe the map was created for a 1440 church council at Basel , Switzerland .
The Vinland Map is not a “ Viking map ” , and does not change the historical understanding of who first sailed to North America .
However , if authentic , it confirms the New World was known not only to Norseman but also to other Europeans at least 50 years prior to Columbus ’s arrival .
An American purchased the map from a Swiss dealer after the British Museum turned it down in 1957 .
Paul Mellon , a wealthy
Yale alumni , later bought the map for the University , who published it in 1965 amid much fanfare .
The lack of proof of the map ’s origin has inspired a great deal of controversy and intrigue .
Indeed , details of the map ’s whereabouts and how it came into the possession of the Swiss dealer after WWII remain a mystery .
Larsen presented his team ’s findings at an international cartographers ’ conference in Copenhagen , Denmark on Friday .

They may also be distracted to the point that their engaged brains no longer process much of the information that falls on their retinas , which leads to slower reaction times and other driving problems .

At the University of Utah , Dr. Strayer and his colleagues use driving simulators to study the effects of cellphone conversations .
A simulator ’s interior looks like that of a Ford Crown Victoria , and a computer allows researchers to control driving conditions .
Study participants are asked to drive under a variety of conditions : while talking on a hand - held phone or a hands - free one , while chatting with a friend in the next seat , and even after consuming enough alcohol to make them legally drunk .
While in the simulator , drivers are asked to complete simple tasks , like driving for several miles along a highway and finding a particular exit , or navigating local streets where they must brake for traffic lights , change lanes and watch for pedestrians .
How fast they drive , how well they stay in their lane , driving speed and eye movement are closely monitored .
The Utah researchers have also placed electrodes on participants ’ scalps to gauge how they process information .
Similar studies , using brain imaging , have been done at Carnegie Mellon .
The studies show that cellphone conversations are highly distracting compared with other speaking and listening activities in the car .
One might think that listening to talk radio or an audio book would degrade driving skill ; it does not .
( A quiz after the driving test confirmed that the drivers were really paying attention to the programs . )
Likewise , it is easy to equate talking to a friend on a cellphone with talking to a friend in the passenger seat .
But a December report in The Journal of Experimental Psychology : Applied debunked that notion .
Utah researchers put 96 drivers in a simulator , instructing them to drive several miles down the road and pull off at a rest stop .
Sometimes the drivers were talking on a hands - free cell phone , and sometimes they were chatting with a friend in the next seat .
From there it was a 20 - minute drive to Dillman ’s Bay Resort in Lac du Flambeau , where I checked into Cabin 5 .
Back in the 1930s Ollie Catfish owned the cabin , but on a plot across the lake .
At some point after the raid , it was dragged across winter ice to its present site .
Escaping the Little Bohemia raid , Nelson had somehow run 18 miles through forest and marsh at night to find it , and locals say he held Mr. Catfish hostage .
Competing bootleggers were n’t the only things Chicago ’s rough crowd were fond of shooting .
Capone and another gang leader , Joe Saltis , enjoyed hunting game in Wisconsin , as well as fishing and a bit of backwoods golf .
Saltis , not nearly the name these days that Capone is , only reached No. 9 on Chicago ’s public enemies list , despite controlling the liquor trade on the city ’s southwest side .
In Winter , Wis. , is the Barker Lake Lodge , a two - story log structure next to a golf course , both built by Saltis in the late 1920s .
Today , the walls of the clubhouse are covered with old photos and articles about Saltis , who retired to the area around 1930 .
David and Brenda Palmer , current owners of the lodge , showed me a bullet hole above the fireplace , and around the property , Mr. Palmer has dug up .45 shell casings  the caliber of a Tommy gun .
The night I stayed there , Mr. Palmer shared stories and newspaper clippings .
He , in turn , occasionally receives visitors with stories of their own .
He once met the son of a man who rowed the boat when Capone visited Saltis to fish for sturgeon .
The six - to eight - foot fish can live up to 100 years .
“ Capone could have caught a 10 - year - old sturgeon , ” he said , “ thrown it back because it was too small , and today you could catch the same sturgeon Al Capone caught . ”
There ’s some evidence that no matter how heinous their actions elsewhere , the criminal element minded their manners in Wisconsin , perhaps tamed by the sense of solitude they found there .
In all his years at Barker Lake , Mr. Palmer said , Saltis apparently had only one run-in with the local law  when he was fined for fishing too close to a dam .
The Python release archive is a nice repository for archaeological findings .
My biggest surprise was the existence of an access statement and access keyword in the pre-history of Python 1.5.0 .
The syntax was already specified in release 1.0 with an accompanying accessobject.c and it began to fade in Python 1.4 .
The access statement
That is how the access statement was defined in 1.0
access_stmt : ' access ' ( '*' | NAME ( ' , ' NAME ) * ) ':' accesstype ( ' , ' accesstype ) * accesstype : NAME + # accesstype should be ( ' public ' | ' protected ' | ' private ' ) [ ' read ' ] [ ' write ' ] # but ca n't be because that would create undesirable reserved words !
The access_stmt was a small statement i.e. one that does n’t contain a block and could be used like print , del or exec .
So the proper use of the access statement would be like
class Point : access x , y , z : private write , public read
or more compact :
class Point : access *: private write , public read
The word public was n’t a language keyword which made it possible to use it in this way :
class AccessModifier : access public : public access private : public access protected : public
Note that the access statement was purely declarative even more so than Java ’s where you can write
public int x = 10 ;
x
read
write
How it never took off and gone away
and definewhile specifying its type and access modifier .
It was also more elaborated in terms of intended protections by means of differentiating betweenand
In the HISTORY file of Python 1.0 we find the notice
There ’s a new reserved word : “ access ” .
The syntax and semantics are still subject of of research and debate ( as well as undocumented ) , but the parser knows about the keyword so you must not use it as a variable , function , or attribute name .
In Python 1.4 the access statement was already uncommented from the Grammar .
The story ends with the following remark in the HISTORY of Python 1.5 :
‘ access ’ is no longer a reserved word , and all code related to its implementation is gone ( or at least # ifdef ’ed out ) .
This should make Python a little speedier too !

The screech of metal against wood was the moment I began to question the efficacy of miraculous - sounding contact lenses that correct impaired vision while you sleep .
I was not asleep , in fact I was reversing my car , but my vision was definitely still impaired because I had just reversed into a telegraph pole .
Perhaps I should have blamed my foolish decision to reverse down a dark country lane but I decided to berate my new i- GO contact lenses ( " sleep , see , go " ) .
One week into my trial and , by evening , everything was a bit of a blur .
If you have ever worn contact lenses , the idea of wearing them to sleep in is not just revolutionary , it is repulsive .
Ask any contact - lens wearer who has woken from a boozy night out to find their eyelids gummed up and lenses screaming to be removed from bloodshot eyes .
But i- GO lenses are deliberately popped in at night , and removed in the morning .
A new generation of gas - permeable lens , they allow oxygen into your eyes during wear , preventing your eyes from becoming dry and sore .
Crucially , however , they encourage movement of cells in the epithelium , the top level of your cornea , from the centre of your eye to the periphery .
These cells are gently shifted by the fluid - the tear film - between contact lens and cornea , temporarily creating a new structure to the eye .
This " overnight vision correction " treatment is called orthokeratology and the lenses are now available in ordinary opticians in major cities across England .
It sounds amazing , and means you can see during the day without the need for glasses , contact lenses or laser surgery .
When I meet Kieran Minshull , my optician for the trial , at LK Leon in central London , I wonder why he 's wearing glasses .
Minshull , it transpires , has even worse sight than me and i-GO lenses cannot correct short - sightedness worse than - 5.0 ( Mine hovers at - 4.0 ) .
And these lenses do not correct serious astigmatism .
Are they dangerous ?
" No more than with normal contact lenses , " says Minshull .
" Hygiene is important but there are n't any side effects . "
Unlike laser surgery , there are no permanent changes .
If you do n't keep wearing the lenses at night , your eyes readjust and your vision returns to how it was within a few days .
Minshull has treated 18 people since the i-GO lenses were launched in the UK but in the US , 50,000 people are using this technology .
The lenses cost from £ 200 for the initial appointments and fittings and £ 40 per month for lenses , checkups and solutions .
I begin with a sight test , then Minshull takes a topography of my eye , photographing the curvature of my cornea to obtain the measurements needed to make the lenses .
A week later , Minshull shows me how to put in and remove the lenses - easy if you are familiar with contact lenses .
And he tells me that I need to sleep regularly , for six hours , and wear them every night .
I have some solution to clean and store them in , and lubricant should they become stuck in my eyes ( urgh ) and that 's it .
Or so I thought .
These lenses , I am told , do not usually work instantly .
" We should achieve something like a 70 % change within the first night of wear , " says Minshull .
In the early days , most users find their eyesight deteriorates by the end of the day .
" You may notice a little bit of ghosting in the evening , " he says .
I am supplied with some - 1.50 daily disposable contact lenses in case my eyesight becomes less than perfect .
After the first night , I wake up and visit the opticians again , for a checkup , with the i-GO lenses still in my eyes .
Everything is blurred and very uncomfortable because I am unused to these hard , plastic gas - permeable lenses .
It turns out my vision is about 70 % better and I return to work wearing soft contact lenses to correct my improving vision .
Things are still rather blurry .
I accidentally blank people I know .
I am not enjoying blurred vision .
It makes you appreciate the miracle of sight .
After two nights in the lenses , I wake up and - hosanna ! - I can see .
Without lenses .
Almost perfectly .
The problem is at night : when it gets dark , I realise that while I can read car numberplates at a distance , my sight is distorted by electric lights , which are almost as blurry as if I had my normal vision .
Street lights and car headlights are fuzzy .
At my weekly checkup , Minshull explains that this " ghosting " or halo effect occurs because , while the lenses have corrected the centre of my pupils , they have not yet altered the periphery .
This means that in low light , when my pupils widen , I am seeing with the corrected zone and with a small uncorrected area .
With most clients , this passes in time .
After my very minor crash , though , I decide to wear my i- GO lenses when I am driving at night .
They are not as comfortable as my old soft contact lenses but are tolerable and I can see pin-sharply with them in .
At the end of the four - week trial , my eyesight only declines very slightly during the day but in the dark , bright lights are still distorted .
I return for my final checkup ready to give up the lenses but Minshull shows me the progress on reshaping my eye , and says that in some cases it can take longer than four weeks .
We continue for two more weeks but the i-GO lenses still leave me with blurred vision at night .
Minshull believes they have not worked because I have unusually large pupils .
Sean O'Sullivan , 44 , a business manager for a software company , has been using the lenses for three weeks .
His prescription ( - 3.75 ) is similar to mine and yet his right eye was perfect after one night and his vision in both eyes was perfectly corrected after two nights .
He , too , experienced blurry lights after dark but this has steadily lessened .
He can still see late at night and , if he has to travel to America , into the next day as well .
" It 's an amazing thing to think that by putting a plastic lens in your eye at night you can see for a day and a half , " he says .
" I 'm surprised more people are n't trying it .
It is very liberating .
It feels like a miracle cure .
If it works , it 's a great alternative to laser surgery . "
So far , only one other of Minshull 's patients has experienced a similar problem to mine and they loved days without lenses so much they persevered .
And I can see the attraction : it was wonderful to hurl myself into the ocean and not worry about contact lenses , do away with the dryness and red eyes from wearing ordinary contact lenses all day , and nice not to worry about treading on , or losing , my glasses again .
But I am letting my eyes return to their old prescription because of the blurring at night .
I could wear my i- GO lenses after dark , when I am awake , but that that seems little more convenient than using standard contact lenses .
I feel sorry for Minshull , who looks crushed when I tell him they are not working for me .
He has taken me through the trial with reassuring thoroughness and admirable patience .
But I 've had it with newfangled contact lenses .
On the way out of LK Leon , one of their swish pairs of frames catches my eye and I try them on : I can definitely see myself wearing glasses again .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has declined to defend the constitutionality of Proposition 8 , telling a San Francisco judge that the legality of the anti-gay marriage measure is for the courts to decide .
The governor ’s decision to remain neutral in a federal challenge to Proposition 8 means no statewide official will be defending the measure in federal court .
Proposition 8 resurrected a ban on same - sex marriage , receiving 52 % of the vote in the November election .
The California Supreme Court ruled 6 - 1 last month that the measure did not violate the state constitution .
Supporters of the measure said Wednesday they were disappointed but not surprised by the governor ’s stance .

Ron Prentice , chairman of the ProtectMarriage.com Coalition , said the group was “ fairly consistently disappointed with the governor ’s response to the will of the people in the case of marriage . ”
In declining to take sides in the suit , Schwarzenegger said the case “ presents important constitutional questions that require and warrant judicial determination . ”
“ In a constitutional democracy , it is the role of the courts to determine and resolve such questions .
. . . , ” the governor said late Tuesday in his legal reply to the suit .
“ The Administration encourages the Court to resolve the merits of this action expeditiously . ”
Two same - sex couples who were denied marriage licenses as a result of Proposition 8 filed the challenge in federal district court in San Francisco .
The suit charges that Proposition 8 violated federal due process and equal protection guarantees , issues that were not raised before the California Supreme Court .

California Atty . Gen. Jerry Brown , going farther than Schwarzenegger , said in his legal response to the suit last week that Proposition 8 violates the U.S. Constitution .
The positions of the governor and the state ’s top law enforcement officer may leave the defense of Proposition 8 to its campaign proponents , who have asked the court to intervene .
U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn R. Walker will consider that request and another to suspend the law pending a trial at a July 2 hearing .
The American Foundation for Equal Rights , a group formed by a Los Angeles - based political strategist to launch the lawsuit , praised the governor ’s action .
The “ filing by Gov. Schwarzenegger bolsters our call for a swift end to the constitutionally intolerable situation created by Proposition 8 , ” said Chad Griffin , the strategist who started the group .

Another E3 , another round of great quotes .
If anyone has any suggestions , post em !
So I present to you : the best E3 quotes so far .
Well I 'm glad that 's all cleared up then !
TTP secretly has this man 's picture framed over his bed , I bet .
Lots of ... interesting quotes in that blog ....
The worst meltdown of E3 , brought to you by lawblob and helpfully compiled by Durante ( lawblob has since apologized for this ) : That was during the Microsoft Press Conference .
Hoo boy .
So , anyone have some more quotes ?
By quotes I mean ones that stand on their own , or are interesting in their own way and even moreso once you know more about it ( like the Peter M. one ) .
TEGUCIGALPA , Honduras 
The head of Honduras ’s de facto government , Roberto Micheletti , has expressed support for a compromise that would allow the ousted president of his country to return to power , according to officials in the de facto government and diplomats from the region .
But the nation is so polarized over the possible return that Mr. Micheletti is reaching out to other regional leaders for help in building support for such a deal , especially among the country ’s elite , the officials said .
Mr. Micheletti has repeatedly refused to consider the reinstatement of the ousted president , Manuel Zelaya .
But on Wednesday , the officials said , Mr. Micheletti called President Óscar Arias of Costa Rica , who has tried to mediate a diplomatic solution to the Honduran political crisis , to express his support for a plan Mr. Arias presented .
The 12 - point plan , known as the San José Accord , would allow Mr. Zelaya to return as president , although with significantly limited powers .
The officials said Mr. Micheletti warned President Arias that he had not been able to persuade other parts of the Honduran government , or the leaders of the Honduran business community , to go along with the proposal .
So he asked Mr. Arias to consider sending a prominent international political figure to help him stem the fierce opposition .
Juress Kika , one of the three men who stabbed schoolboy Ben Kinsella , was recorded secretly in a police van describing the murder .
" See when it happened , yeah .
Like boom .
It was like a kinda quick ting .
Like Boom .
Went down the road , come back up .
Boom , boom .
Finished .
Boom .
Ghost .
You get what I 'm saying ? "
Somewhere here is the unconscious acknowledgement of the ease with which Ben 's life was snuffed out .
No expression of guilt ; not the slightest sense of regret or responsibility ; but an admission in the word " boom " and the word " madness " , used earlier , that a boy had passed from life to death in a flash .
Boom .
Ghost indeed .
No parent of a boy or young man can read this exchange without experiencing a chill ; for the coded street patois of Kika , Jade Braithwaite and Michael Alleyne , who , incidentally , should have received longer sentences than life with minimum terms of 19 years , reveals a near total lack of empathetic imagination .
" They have , " said Detective Chief Inspector John Macdonald after the verdicts were brought in , " no social abilities whatsoever to interact with people . "
This is the problem .
Young men so completely ill - equipped to express themselves , to register the feelings and lives of others , become , by default , sociopathic , a danger to everyone , not because of any innate evil , but the simple failure of parents and society to instil in them self - control and an understanding that violence is wrong , particularly this pursuit of a young man who had done nothing to them and who was , as his parents always advised , walking away from the incident .
Kika 's " boom " is blood lust , the babble in the head of someone who has never had a coherent conversation .
It is skunk - fuelled paranoia and a low self - esteem that demands respect .
" Boom " is the morbid lingo of gang culture .
Despite the tragedy of Ben Kinsella 's murder last year in north London and the many deaths of young people from stabbing , it is important to recognise crime is in fact down in England and Wales and has been on a downward path since 1995 .
The latest figures show that the number of the most serious violent crimes is down by 12 % and knife crime is down 16 % in the metropolitan area .
The risk of being a victim of crime is , astonishingly , at its lowest level since the British Crime Survey was begun in 1981 .
But when we read about Ben , we have a totally different impression , which is why six out of 10 of us are convinced that crime is rising .
We need to refine our thinking about crimes like Ben 's murder and see where they come from , rather than imagining that we 're all going to hell in a handcart .
In general , the crime story is encouraging : if the government was not so conflicted by its mission to keep crime and the fear of crime at the front of the news agenda , it would be able to boast about the continuing reduction .
Labour set out with a clear enough strategy , where the criminal justice system was used to bring about a more ordered society ; more offences were dealt with by formal sanction ; court procedures were speeded up and greater numbers were jailed - the prison population has risen by 30 % under Labour .
But this is not the whole picture .
An independent audit of criminal justice under Labour by Enver Solomon and others in 2007 suggested that the government was " placing too much emphasis on finding criminal justice solutions to complex social and economic problems " and they pointedly asked whether the government should be clearer about the limitations of its approach .
Which brings us to the causes of crime among young men .
More than one in 10 males aged 16 - 24 are likely to be victims of crime , while the majority of violent offences are committed by the same age group .
A key factor is alcohol , but another is the steady rise of chaotic violence , paranoia , drug dealing and drug use , in other words , the gang culture that spawned Ben Kinsella 's killers .
The police estimate that there are about 170 gangs in London and an equal number in Strathclyde .
There may be thousands in Britain - no one can say .
What we do know is that they have a dreadful power to disrupt communities and skew crime figures .
When 11 members of the Gooch gang in Manchester were given heavy prison sentences , including 39 and 35 years for the killers Colin Joyce and Lee Amos , the police revealed that gang - related violence went down 92 % in the city .
In London , the police were clearly after something of the same effect last week when they arrested 259 people in raids across the capital and seized drugs , weapons , money and dangerous dogs .
Though welcome , this is probably no more effective than the raids seen in The Wire TV series , which shows the ingrained gang culture of Baltimore as having an almost bacterial vigour .
Where government has failed is in the understanding of this gang culture , or at least in an intelligent reaction to the gangs , which may now include more than 20,000 young men ( 98 % of gang members are male ) and which are responsible for a vast proportion of drugs offences , theft and random violence .
This is , indeed , " a complex social and economic problem " , yet there is really no mystery about gangs .
All the research is available in the government 's Tackling Gangs programme and in an exhaustive report , " Dying to Belong " , from Iain Duncan Smith 's Centre for Social Justice .
We know that gangs form rapidly in inner-city areas , that the wealth gap is important , that the sale of drugs delineates territories as much as a feeling of local honour .
We know that very young boys are recruited because they are less likely to be caught and in exchange they are offered protection as well as a sense of belonging and self - worth that may not be available at home .
We know that many join because they have to , that they are soon lost to the gang mentality and end up with a chaotic , violent loop playing in their head , just like Kika .
To react to this problem with raids is not enough .
And to throw money blindly at it in the hope of alleviating the sense of grievance on some of Britain 's estates does n't work either .
The approach has to be better targeted if we are to get into the mind of an individual like Kika early on .
First , the gangs need to be decapitated , the main players pursued and arrested before the sort of mayhem created by the Gooch gang is allowed to become established .
Then you move lower down the hierarchy with policies of intervention and prevention and begin to address the lack of security on the streets , the absence of structure and good role models at home and the failure to understand that the currency of respect is consideration , not fear .
We need to spend much more on finding activities for these young men and supplementing the social skills that they do not learn at home or at an infrequently attended school .
That leaves drugs and here I think we have to dare to think about decriminalisation and how that may shrivel the criminality that accompanies every level of the drug trade .
I admit that this is probably a step too far for my friends at the Daily Mail , but we need to apply our intelligence to these problems in a way that we have n't before .
Labour 's approach to criminal justice had results of a sort , but it was a narrow and punitive policy which did nothing to prevent the senseless murder of Ben Kinsella .
The knives are still out there and so is the babble .
LA OROYA , Peru  Claudia Albino , a washerwoman who earns about $ 3 a day and lives in a one - room hovel with her family in this bleak town high in the Andes , might seem at first to have nothing to do with Ira Rennert , the reclusive New York billionaire who built one of the largest homes in the United States , an Italianate mansion sprawling over more than 66,000 square feet in the Hamptons .
But Mr. Rennert ’s privately held industrial empire includes the smelter with a towering smokestack that overlooks Ms. Albino ’s home , so the health and economic fate of her and thousands of others here rest on the corporate maneuvers he is carrying out .
La Oroya has been called one of the world ’s 10 most polluted places by the Blacksmith Institute , a nonprofit group that studies toxic sites .
But for several months , the Peruvian smelting company in Mr. Rennert ’s empire has claimed that low metals prices prevented it from completing a timely cleanup to lower the emissions that have given this town such an ignoble distinction .
The tensions here over the lead emissions and the smelter ’s financial meltdown is precisely the kind of dire mix of foreign investment and environmental contamination feared by indigenous groups elsewhere in Peru , particularly in the country ’s Amazon basin , where protests over similar issues left dozens dead this month .
Food for thought for USD bears .
We have a Cbank , lets call it the Fed , initiates quantitative easing , usually story , buyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s bonds etc. and then implies that it may implement an exit strategy when capital markets normalize and there is no more stimulus needed .
Now we introduce another Cbank , we will name that one the ECB , they too go to the market and buys bonds ( EUR 442 b 1 - year repo transaction with 1123 banks ! ) declares a fix exit point in 1 - years time when it will Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœexitÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ , by selling the said bonds back .
Now we all know when the ECB quantitative easing strategy ends .
There is no need to be in love with the EUR by then !
Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœSupposedlyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and there have been many covert ones of late , the SNB intervened again yesterday by buying USD vs. their own currency and not using their regular avenue of EUR / CHF .
Makes one wonder about wanting to own a short USD position !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 13 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s advance in US durable goods last month was much stronger than expected ( +1.8 % vs. - 0.6 % ) , even after the downward revisions for the previous month were taken into account .
Much of the strength was in the core - capital goods headline .
New orders for non-defense capital goods ex-aircraft jumped + 4.8 % !
The May data still leave the 3 - month annualized growth rate for core- orders at - 13.5 % vs. 1st Q decline of - 44 % .
Analysts note that a flat June reading would push 2nd Q growth into positive territory .
Digging deeper , core - shipments were down - 24 % over the last 3 - months .
For the naysayers , firstly , the upbeat headline may be driven by foreign orders rather than domestic strength .
Proof may be seen in MayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ISM manufacturing index foreign orders component which posted some improvement .
Secondly , markets continue to deal with Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœrabidÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ volatility off of a very low order mark and of course this will exaggerate any series of data .
Thirdly , the durable goods inventory - to - sales ratio now stands at its highest level in nearly 2 - decades ( manufactures are bullish on the future - but itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the consumer we are concerned about ) and finally , not for any bull to enjoy , aircraft orders are a huge headline factor in the report and could easily reversed next month !
Again yesterday US
New home sales disappoint .
With sales falling - 0.6 % , m / m ( 342 k vs. +344k ) , falling inventory levels have led to a decline in months ’ in MayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s supply .
Inventories are at 10.2 months and analysts believe it will take us into next year to Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœburn offÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ the current stock .
Of course this will not occur if sales aggressively advance , not much of a chance with the consumer lying dormant !
Do not expect US housing numbers in general to positively add to 2nd Q GDP .
Existing home sales have been up for 2 - consecutative months , but on low volumes , while new home sales remain flat .
Conclusion , purchasers want lower - priced re-sales and foreclosures .
Bernanke and Co. came and delivered what was expected .
No real surprises , the FOMC communiquÃƒÂ© was probably more on the hawkish side ( how else will they influence the most important variable - the consumer ) .
Positives , policy members believe that businesses have pared inventories to levels better Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœaligned with salesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Inventories have been the scourge of this recession .
Any drawdown of stocks must be seen as a positive !
On the inflation front , they mention commodity prices , however , the feeling is they are not that concerned ( bang goes the exit strategy ! ) .
One note , they said that will Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœmake adjustments to credit and liquidity programs as warranted Ã¢â‚¬â „¢ .
Analysts interpret this as an indication that they might raise the rate on TAF and perhaps the discount rate to encourage further wind down of these programs which could be the 1st - step for an exit strategy .
The USD $ currently is lower against the EUR +0.08 % and CHF +0.21 % and higher against GBP - 0.48 % and JPY - 0.11 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.21 % and AUD +0.26 % .
The loonie has weakened after the Fed left its bond - purchase program unchanged , thus boosting the appeal of the greenback as a refuge .
Despite what positive spin both OECD and the IMF are putting on things , it seems that Canadian domestic Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœgreen shootsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ are not rooting , which have a negative impact on commodities and eventually a negative impact on higher yielding commodity based currencies .
The euphoric rise of the loonie since March has hinged on Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœgreen shootÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ economic theory and the rampant rise of commodities .
In reality , the market has very much got ahead of itself and has easily squeezed weak long CAD positions out all week .
BOC governor Carney this week said that CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s recession is as deep as their southern trading partners .
He believes that Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœCanadian households are facing rising stresses because of increases in unemploymentÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , which will not be currency positive in the medium term .
On USD pull backs dealers will want to sell the CAD .
The AUD managed to rise for a 3rd- consecutive day on the back of a rebound in global equities combined with the IMF stating that the Australian economy will recover faster than previously estimated .
With the Fed remaining on hold yesterday , speculators continue to grab higher yielding assets like the AUD ( 0.7951 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 68.97 up +30 c ) .
Oil smallish bid , but not with the same enthusiasm we witnessed last week .
On Tuesday the API reported that gas stockpiles increased to +211.4 m barrels and crude supplies fell - 72 k barrels to +356.6 m .
The weekly EIA announcement yesterday supported the API findings .
However , with Japanese export numbers disappointing ( - 40.9 % , y/y ) , combined with a higher gas number , and despite a floundering Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœgreenbackÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ , the bulls should be concerned about future demand for the commodity .
Demand destruction remains commodities greatest nemesis and not volatile currency levels .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s now probably expected that OPEC in Sept. will not announce a further reduction in production , but , Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œwill ask for more compliance with existing quotasÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ( amongst members they have complied 77 % with last years production cuts ) .
It was a bearish report for commodity prices , despite the fall in crude , over the next couple of months expect the market to focus on the driving season that ends on US Labor Day .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ managed to appreciate on the back of a weaker greenback and on speculation by investors that with the Fed endorsing their treasury program could heighten inflation ( $ 935 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,796 up +205 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,805 down - 30 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,272 down - 7 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 4 bp yesterday ( 3.67 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
As to be expected , dealers cheapened up the US curve ahead of the record $ 37 b , 5 - year auction yesterday , an hour ahead of the FOMC decision .
The market was anticipating rates to remain on hold for some time .
What if not ?
Who would want expensive product on their books ?
Not much of a gamble really , as proven by the FOMC communiquÃƒÂ© , but a higher US durable headline had already pressurized prices in the morning session .

So I ’m giving the Robbins lectures in a couple of weeks , which means that I have to actually think a bit .
And one thing I ’ve been thinking about is the changing nature of recessions .
Here ’s one bit of that : looking at interest rates .
First , let ’s look at short - term interest rates in the first month of recessions , identified here by their starting year :
Second , let ’s look at the change in interest rates over the year prior to the recession :
What seems clear is that the nature of monetary policy leading up to recessions has changed dramatically .
Pre -Great Moderation , recessions were preceded by tightening policy , presumably to control inflation ; the combination of policy tightening and a high underlying inflation rate meant high rates going in , giving lots of room for policy loosening .
Increasingly , however , recessions have been the result of bursting bubbles , with monetary policy getting looser even before the recession begins .
Lots of implications , which I ’ll draw out on later occasions .
A British Columbia man found with $ 29,000 in plastic baggies in his car says he had the cash because he 's been collecting soda cans .
With a five - cent deposit on pop cans in the province , that works out to almost 600,000 aluminum cans .
Police in New Westminster were running a drunk - driving checkpoint last Friday night when a car approaching the officers made a U - turn , so they pulled it over .
A police news release says the car smelled of marijuana , so the officers searched the vehicle looking for drugs .
Instead , they found $ 29,000 in two plastic baggies , which they seized as they investigate where the money came from .
Police say the man , who was released , told the officers he was unemployed , but had so much disposable cash because he had been collection soda pop cans .

If you take the trouble to interrogate a large number of economists about the economic future of the country you will find that an overwhelming majority argues in the following way :
In about two years at the latest , rearmament will be completed and the amounts spent for this purpose will be negligible .
At about the same time the pent - up demand for investments will be largely satisfied .
The productive apparatus will be sufficiently enlarged , improved , and modernized to meet the needs of an increased population and all other reasonable requirements .
A depression — or at least a serious recession from the present high level of production and employment — must follow .
These predictions will awaken unpleasant memories in those who do not believe in the possibility of objective , " scientific " forecasts .
They will be reminded of the forecasts of a postwar depression so popular during the war .
At that time it was the general opinion of the experts , based especially on a study by Morris Livingston , " Markets After the War , " that the increase in population , the rising productivity and the inability of consumption to keep up with production would inevitably lead to unemployment of many millions of workers .
And the well - known Swedish economist , Gunnar Myrdal , impressed by this line of argument , propagated it in many articles in the Swedish and Swiss press .
I myself , in an article , " Do Not Predict Postwar Deflation — Prevent It , " tried to show the fallacies of the underlying mechanical approach to economic problems and of a forecast so astounding to anybody who knows from the study of history that inflations and not deflations have always been the aftermaths of wars .
All forecasts of postwar deflation turned out to be entirely wrong , as was to be expected .
Almost immediately after the end of hostilities a postwar boom began .
But the forecasters , in no way discouraged by their errors , stayed on the job .
Now they predicted the continuation of inflation .
Just when their forecasts became most articulate , in the spring of 1949 , the recession of that year set in .
Then deflation was considered here to stay ; government intervention was advocated .
The second postwar boom , not caused , I think , but accentuated by the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950 , led again to predictions of continued and even of runaway inflation .
But 1951 was basically a year of deflation , and of inflation only in the areas where it was governmentally fostered .
Clearly the regularity of these errors in forecasting cannot be pure chance .
Something like a Law of the Necessity of Errors in Forecasting must be at work .
It is seldom realized that belief in the possibility of " scientific " business forecasts , and the forecasting mania of our time , are comparatively new phenomena .
Until about 1930 serious economists were not so bold — or so naive — as to pretend to be able to calculate the coming of booms and depressions in advance .
It would not have fitted into their general view on the working of a free economy .
They considered the economic future as basically dependent on unpredictable price - cost relationships and on the equally unpredictable psychological reactions of entrepreneurs .
Predictions of future business conditions would have seemed to them mere charlatanry , just as predictions , say , regarding the resolutions of Congress two years from now .
The " Multiplier " and " Acceleration " Fallacies
The forecasting mania of our time is a natural concomitant of what is called Keynesian economics .
It constitutes an integral part of the world of " functional finance , " of the " multiplier effect " of the " acceleration principle " and similar concepts .
If one really believes , as the " inventors " of functional finance do , that a depression can be prevented and a boom prolonged ad libitum by government deficit spending , if one fails to see that the elimination of the maladjustments in the price - cost relationship created during the previous boom are necessary conditions of revival , then indeed the economic future appears no longer too uncertain .
And if one really believes in the working of the multiplier and the acceleration principle , then the more remote future also appears predictable .
For according to the multiplier theory a given amount of spending on investment leads in time to an immediately ascertainable stable amount of spending on consumption ; whereas a given amount of spending on consumption leads in time to an immediately ascertainable amount of spending on investment .
Pre-Keynesian economists would not , incidentally , have been seduced into forecasting and calculating such secondary and further effects of spending .
They would have considered a development of multiplier and acceleration theory as unrealistic toying with ideas rather than the scientific achievement it is considered nowadays .
For whether increased spending on consumption leads in time to increased investment is dependent on the unascertainable profit expectations of entrepreneurs .
The fact that inventories have been used up through increased consumption may or may not improve these expectations .
And whether spending on investment leads to a corresponding spending on consumption is dependent on the equally unascertainable presence or absence of buyers ' resistance — as the early New Deal experiences clearly showed .
Multiplier and acceleration theories thus do not answer but simply beg the question of what the long - run effects will be of single doses of spending .
The basic error of the whole approach lies in the fact that the causative link between objective data and the decision of the members of the community are treated as mechanical .
But men are still men and not automatons .
There does not even exist , as is sometimes maintained , a fixed correlation , for instance , between birth and marriage rates and the demand for housing ; or between the increased need for electric current and the investments of public utilities .
The investments can — and are — either speeded up or postponed according to whether entrepreneurs are optimistic or pessimistic regarding future demand , and prices — i.e. , regarding the prospect that the investments will be profitable .
If they are optimistic , a boom may develop ; if they are pessimistic , a depression .
Forecasting the economic future means forecasting decisions on investment and consumption that are as uncertain as the whole future .
The professional forecasters pretend that they have a sort of monopoly of clairvoyance in this respect .
They forget , however , that it is precisely the main occupation of entrepreneurs to predict future demand in order to adjust their production to it .
What leads to the maldistribution of demand — called the business cycle — is that the majority of entrepreneurs are at times too optimistic or too pessimistic ; that they either invest too much and too soon , or too little and too late .
Now there is not the slightest reason to assume that in the game of forecasting future demands correctly the theorists will be on the average more successful than the businessmen .
On the contrary , it can be assumed that the businessmen will on the average do better .
They are more responsible .
For businessmen suffer losses when they err , whereas the theorists can forecast with no risk — not even to their prestige , it seems .
Thus the world does not consist , on the one hand , of theorists who can calculate future investment and consumption , including their " accelerating " and " multiplying " effect , and , on the other hand , of businessmen for whom the future is uncertain and who are forced to " speculate . "
The tragic — not to say tragi-comic — consequence in the real world is that the forecasts of the great majority of theorists can never hold good .
If the businessmen in sensing future maldistribution of demand are at least as smart as the theorists , they will adjust to it by speeding up or postponing their investments — with the result that the predicted cycle will not materialize .
It is , one can say by definition , impossible to calculate depressions in advance .
Calculated depressions do not happen .
Nor , by the way , do calculated inflations — though it was so popular , just before the latest recession in commodity prices , to calculate a new inflation in advance .
A recession was clearly due the moment certain theorists began to speak of our age as the age of permanent inflation .
So do n't forecast a post - armament deflation .
It will not happen — whatever other depression , not yet recognized and recognizable either by you or the majority of businessmen , may materialize .
The Economic Isolationists
But why , it may be asked , are these simple and obvious ideas not widely accepted by American economists ?
To one outside the magic circle of the Keynesians the reason seems to be what can be called the isolationism of Anglo - American economics .
It is this isolationism that prevents economists from seeing the merits and weaknesses of their work in a detached and objective way and in the right perspective .
It prevents them from being aware that most economists in Germany , France , and Italy strongly oppose the Keynesian doctrines .
For example , to Professor Adolf Weber , the well - known economist of the University of Munich , the idea that full employment is mainly threatened by a lag of investment behind saving , sounds merely like a bad joke .
But the isolationism of Anglo - American economists is also historical .
They believe earnestly that their ideas are fundamentally new , unique , and a definite answer to the problems of a competitive economy .
Insufficiently educated in the history of economic thought , they do not realize that Keynesianism — down to the most technical details , like the concept of the foreign exchange multiplier — is mercantilism or , more precisely , John Lawism pure and simple .
Thus they do not recognize that the objections of the classical economists to mercantilism are valid also in respect to their own teachings .
Nor do they see that many concepts of the modern planners — fair prices , fair wages , fair profits , and so on — are nothing else than a new edition of the medieval scholastic concepts of justum pretium and justum salarium , which proved so detrimental to economic progress .
Reading , quoting , praising , and promoting each other , and only each other , will not liberate these economists from their voluntary isolationism .
They will remain in their dream world .
They will continue to predict the unpredictable .
Mac users -- are you tired of being taunted by your PC friends over their myriad GPU options / killer gaming rigs ?
Well , here 's one less front they can battle you on .
We 've just received a pic of this nasty piece of work in our inboxes with word that it 's due in June .

Choosing the Right Knife
Perhaps no other question will create a more energetic debate among outdoorsmen than " what 's the best knife ? "
And when asked , it 's likely to produce a lengthy discourse on metallurgy , blade design , blade size , handle materials and sheaths , not to mention more obscure details like edge geometry and choil size .
It 's easy to be overwhelmed with the overabundance of information .
But the question might better be stated as " What knife is the most safe and effective for me ? "
Choosing a knife , especially one for outdoor / survival use is a highly individualized decision .
And it 's a decision that should accommodate the user 's experience , knowledge , size , environment and type of activity .
To help you make an informed decision , we 've enlisted the insight of noted survival expert and knife designer Doug Ritter .
Doug is also the founder , publisher and editor of Equipped to Survive ( www.equipped.org), a highly respected survival information source .
What are the general characteristics of a good survival knife ?
Well certainly there 's truth in the old adage that the best knife is the one you have with you .
But generally speaking , you really want to have a proper fixed blade knife , one that is versatile enough to perform a diverse set of tasks and durable enough to withstand hard use .
It does n't have to be big and heavy , generally I think a 4 " - 6 " blade is appropriate for most situations .
The knife should have full tang construction -- that is , where the blade material extends through the handle .
This gives the knife strength .
I think the best overall blade design is a drop point blade .
It 's a versatile design that 's very effective for most common field tasks and offers a strong point .
A drop point blade is less likely to break at the point than the more common deep clip point design of Bowie style and traditional hunting style knives .
A short , straight clip can also provide the same strong point .
What type of blade steel works best ?
How the steel is treated is just as important as the type of steel .
The best steel improperly heat treated and tempered is likely to be worse than a lesser steel properly prepared .
1095 and similar carbon steels remain the classic favorite of survival knife aficionados because of their strength and edge retention characteristics .
But , because carbon steel is more likely to rust , these knives require extra care and attention many are unwilling to provide .
However , most current stainless steels like AUS 8 , VG - 10 , 440C , 154-CM , S30V and others will hold up just as well and require less maintenance and far less care .
Technically not a stainless steel , D2 steel is becoming more popular because of its increased corrosion resistance compared to other carbon steels , and the edge holding and toughness properties it offers .
How about the handle ?
The handle should be comfortable to hold in any position , which is why few well - designed knives have deep finger grooves .
The best handles are designed to provide a firm grip and to be slip - resistant , especially when wet .
If a handle is too grippy , or is textured too much , it can cause hot spots and blisters in heavy use .
With smaller knives , particularly folders , it sometimes requires a trade - off of more grippiness to ensure safety .
A lanyard hole is an important feature to prevent the loss of the knife .
You do n't need to accidentally lose your most valuable survival tool .
Always use a wrist lanyard while working with a knife over water or anywhere else where it might be dropped and lost .
And the sheath ?
Traditionally made of leather , sheaths are now also made of ballistic nylon with rigid inserts or are molded from Kydex or Concealex and are form fitted to the knife they support .
Regardless of the construction , a proper sheath should hold the knife securely and protect both you and the knife .
Many sheaths are not secure and it's too easy to lose the knife out of them .
Quite a few sheaths now have multiple options for mounting to a vest , pack , or belt , allowing you to place the your knife pretty much anywhere you wish .
Some sheaths have accessory pockets for storing sharpening stones , multitools or small outdoor essentials .
Do n't most people just carry a folding knife ?
A folding knife or pocketknife makes a good companion and back - up to your primary fixed blade knife .
However , for many it is going to be their primary knife because they cannot carry a fixed blade on their belt for various reasons .
It is not going to be as strong as a fixed blade , but since you have it with you , it will generally do the job , especially if it's a high quality knife .
A locking blade is a must .
Non-locking blades can cause serious injuries -- the last thing that you need in a survival situation .
One - handed opening is another must have .
You may have an injury to one hand or , even if that 's not the case , one hand may be occupied with an important task at the very time you need to deploy the knife .
Many knives have this feature and it's just common sense to take advantage of it .
In general , the same guidelines regarding blade design and steel apply to folders .
What about multi-tools ?
A multi-tool can be a great asset to someone trying to survive and is a good compliment to a fixed blade knife .
It is NOT a substitute for a good folder , however .
The blade is always a compromise and the ergonomics always suffer .
There are a great many to choose from with a host of features .
The usefulness of a multi-tool depends upon the type , number , size , and design of the blades and other implements .
The ideal multi-purpose tool being carried for survival purposes should incorporate , at a minimum , wire cutters capable of cutting moderately hard wire , a plain edge blade ( though there are those who will prefer a serrated or partially serrated blade and an argument could be made that as long as you carry a robust , plain edged folding knife , it really does n't much matter if the tool has a serrated blade ) , an effective saw blade , a file , and a selection of slotted and Phillips screwdrivers with maximum possible reach .
Beyond that , individual preferences take over .
In summary
A knife is one of the most important tools to have in the outdoors .
It 's the tool that helps you complete many of the tasks essential for survival - shelter construction , fire building , signaling , food gathering and preparation , and much more .
This is why folding knives are listed as an essential item by the National Park Service , The Boy Scouts and a host of other outdoor organizations , and why experienced outdoorsmen treat their knives as sacrosanct .
THE Force can be with anyone now .
Later this summer , anybody anywhere will have the ability to physically move stuff with their minds like characters do in “ Star Wars . ”
No joke .
A new toy that harnesses the same technology doctors use to monitor brain waves will arrive in stores in August .
The toy moves when it senses a change in the user ’s brain - wave patterns .
“ It ’s pretty cutting - edge , ” says , Frank Adler , executive vice president of Uncle Milton , the toy company that manufactures the “ Star Wars ” - branded Force Trainer .
“ It certainly appears to be where things are headed . ”
It will be if the reaction from 5 - year - old “ Star Wars ” fanatic Ryan Mogg is any indication .
Mogg tried out the Force Trainer at a recent “ Star Wars ” toy fair .
In less than a minute , he was controlling the rise and fall of a pingpong ball in a clear tube — with his brain waves .
“ It ’s like what Obi-Won Kenobi and Darth Maul do ! ” he said afterward with a big grin .
Scientists call the technology BCI , or Brain Computer Interface , and more sensitive , medical - grade versions are used to help amputees move artificial limbs and victims of paralysis communicate using a computer and software that reacts thought .
A recent episode of the medical drama “ House ” about a patient suffering from locked - in syndrome ( a condition in which the victim of a brain injury is aware and awake but cannot move or communicate ) featured a similar device .
The Force Trainer , expected to sell for about $ 120 , is not medical - grade hardware , but it uses a headset to monitor the brain , and then transmits a signal to a base that features a fan and a ball in a tube .
The headset is calibrated to sense beta waves , a specific type of brain waves associated with concentration .
When you focus , the headset reads the electrical pattern from inside your head and sends a signal to a microchip that switches on the fan in the base unit and levitates the pingpong in a clear tube .
The more intense the focus and concentration , the faster the fan spins and the quicker the ball rises .
When concentration is broken or weak , the ball drops .
A computer chip programmed with the voice of Yoda the Jedi master guides users through several increasingly different levels of control .
Another mind toy , Mattel ’s Mind Flex , uses the same mind - bending technology to guide a ball through a series of obstacles .
It will be available in the fall .
“ The mind sends signals to the body all the time , ” says Tansy Brook , spokeswoman for Neurosky , the company that simplified and shrunk the technology to fit inside the toys .
“ But for many people this is the first time you can see it sending a signal to things outside body , and it ’s really just a matter of learning what kind of feeling you need to have in your brain to make things happen .
“ The application and modification of the technology is cutting - edge , ” says Brook , “ but its history and roots are based in something very familiar — EEGs . ”
Scientists have been studying electroencephalography , or EEG — the recording of electrical activity along the scalp produced by the firing of neurons within the brain — since 1890 .
The technology has been used for medical applications for roughly 60 years , but this is the first time it ’s become widely available and affordable .
Congressional aides on both sides said they expected to meet on Tuesday to try to reach a compromise on the abortion issue , and so allow the bill to be sent to both houses for final approval .
The White House has strongly suggested that President Bush will sign the bill , with or without the Senate provision .
A similar bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton , who described it as unfair to debtors forced into bankruptcy through no fault of their own .
The bill would end the ability of millions of middle - income Americans to use Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy code to wipe out credit card bills and other loans unsecured by a house or other asset .
Instead , those debtors would be forced to file under Chapter 13 , which requires some repayment of the debts under a court - approved plan .
Banks and credit card companies , which have spent millions of dollars to lobby for the legislation , say the bill would end abuse of the system by debtors who have an income and can afford to pay some of their bills .
The proposal 's critics , including several prominent scholars on bankruptcy law , say the bill is a gift to the industry in exchange for campaign contributions to members of Congress .
They say it would do nothing to end abuses by lenders who flood the mail with offers of high - interest credit cards and loans that may encourage irresponsible spending and push people into bankruptcy .
Congressional officials say the debate over the abortion issue may eventually be resolved by limiting the definition of who could be barred from erasing their debts in bankruptcy .
In an interview , Mr. Hyde said he might be willing to accept a compromise that would deny the erasing of debt that results from '' willful and wanton '' misconduct or criminal violations .
What a difference a year makes .
In July 2008 , Texas billionaire T. Boone Pickens offered up the " Pickens Plan " to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil by producing more electricity from huge wind farms , and running vehicles on natural gas instead of gasoline .
To kick - start the transformation , Pickens announced that he would construct the biggest wind farm ever in Texas .
Pickens announced that his company , Mesa Power LP , would order 687 wind turbines , or 1,000 megawatts of capacity , from GE for about $ 2 billion .
By 2014 , he expected to expand the Panhandle wind farm to 4,000 megawatts .
That 's a massive amount of wind power .
One nuclear power reactor is typically about 1,000 megawatts of capacity .
Most wind farms offer only a few hundred megawatts [ Dallas Morning News ] .
Now , one year later , Pickens has declared that he 's canceling the enormous Texas wind farm for the foreseeable future , and is scrambling to figure out where to place the 687 wind turbines that he already ordered .
( He may end up establishing five or six small wind farms in the Midwest , Pickens suggested . )
The project was largely done in by major problems with
electricity transmission .
Wind farms and other forms of clean energy are usually located in remote locations and require huge new transmission lines to carry the electricity to cities .
Mr. Pickens initially hoped to finance the construction of his own transmission lines but was unable to secure funding [ The Wall Street Journal ] .
Pickens 's decision to pull the plug on his ambitious project highlights the troubles faced by the wind power industry in general of late .
With credit costlier and harder to come by , and oil and natural gas prices down sharply over the past year , the nation 's nascent wind industry may begin to focus on smaller projects that are closer to major population centers rather than massive developments like 81 - year - old Pickens envisioned , industry officials said .
" You 've got an industry that is kind of hanging on by its fingernails , " said Denise Bode , chief executive of the American Wind Energy Association [ Reuters ] .

( Bill Gurstelle is guest blogging here on Boing Boing .
He is the
author of several books including Backyard
Ballistics , and the recently published Absinthe
and Flamethrowers . )
My friend Christian Ristow was at Maker Faire with his giant pneumatically powered sculpture called Hand of Man .
It 's great .
It 's a highly interactive piece in which one puts on a glove with sensors and controls a multi- ton pneumatic hand capable of picking up and crushing a refrigerator .
Photo – Scott Beale at Laughing Squid
About a year or so ago , I worked on a TV pilot for Discovery Channel starring Christian .
He is perhaps the most gifted mechanical artist I 've ever met .
Ristow designed a machine gun potato cannon which was a true machine gun spud gun .
It had a gravity fed magazine that fed spuds into the firing chamber .
I 've built a lot of spud guns in my time , mostly like those in Backyard Ballistics .
This was a magnitude more powerful and complex .
There were four high pressure air tanks that could shoot potatoes continually and at high velocity until the magazine was emptied .
I dubbed it " the Quadra - tater . "
The airtanks were massive .
I calculated the muzzle velocity to be well in excess of 85 mph .
The rate of fire depended on the speed with which you turned a crank .
The crank controlled five pneumatic solenoid valves , one for the magazine loader and one for each of the air tanks .
It worked absolutely great .
We could get 20 or potatoes in the magazine and could empty the thing in much less than a minute .
For the finale , the Quadratater , along with a gatling gun that Dave Mathews built , destroyed a car .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
After more than two weeks of silence amid Iran 's violent election fallout , former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani -- a key Iranian cleric -- emerged Sunday to call out " suspicious sources " who are creating a rift between the public and the Islamic government .
Ex -President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , shown here voting in Iran on June 12 , says trust has been eroded .
He called the aftermath of the June 12 presidential election " a tangled mess , perpetrated by suspicious sources whose objectives are to create differences and separations between the people and the system and eroding the trust of the people in the Islamic system , " the Iranian Labor News Agency reported Sunday .
Rafsanjani was speaking to a gathering of family members related to the victims of a June 28 , 1981 , explosion , in which 70 people were killed at a bombing at the Islamic Republic party headquarters .
The explosion -- known as " Hafte Tir , " referring to the date on the Iranian calendar -- killed several prominent Islamic revolutionaries , including Chief Justice Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti .
Rafsanjani is chairman of Iran 's Assembly of Experts , which is responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader .
But despite the chaos that 's plagued the Islamic republic for the past two weeks -- even resulting in the brief detention of his daughter -- he remained silent and largely unseen until Sunday 's commemoration .
The last time the world saw Iran 's assembled leadership was June 19 , when at Friday prayers Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorsed the victory of hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the hotly contested June 12 election .
But Rafsanjani -- who supported opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi , a reformist and Ahmadinejad 's chief rival -- was missing among the group of Islamic powerbrokers .
On Sunday , referring to Khamenei 's backing of an extension granted by Iran 's election authority to address voting complaints , Rafsanjani said the decision is " valuable in order to gain the trust and conviction of the people in the electoral process , effectively , and I hope those involved in this matter can precisely observe fairness and justice and in cooperation with the candidates so that complaints can be addressed completely . "
He added , " Wrong actions must not renew hate and differences between the people and all of us must , with cooperation and with one heart , move forward , in order to eliminate obstacles and difficulties . "
Rafsanjani is a very influential figure in Khamenei 's circle , but he 's made " a real break with the supreme leader in this case , " Hooman Majd , an Iranian - American author , told CNN Saturday .
" Whether the leadership will come together again and say we have to solve all of these problems internally rather than have them be public for the sake and security of the government and the system is a question that is an open question , " Majd added .
All About Mahmoud Ahmadinejad • Ayatollah Ali Khamenei • Iran • Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
Blunderbuss - the name itself brings up all kinds of images .
It 's true , a blunderbuss can be defined as a person who blunders and fumbles with words .
The word is taken from anglicized version of the Dutch , " donderbuss " which translates to " thunder gun " .
It is the predecessor to the modern shotgun .
We associate this weapon with pirates ( the old kind ) and it is often seen depicted with a pilgrim carrying it .
This is a mistaken depiction as the blunderbuss was not introduced for almost 50 years after the pilgrims arrived .
In the late eighteenth century , British stagecoach mail carriers carried the blunderbuss and other weapons to ward off robbers .
The weapon proved quite effective .
The blunderbuss is a smooth - bore gun with a trumpet shaped muzzle .
Because of the shape of the muzzle , it is meant to be used at close range .
Accuracy was not it 's strong point , though later scientific theory proved that shot did not disperse as much as once thought .
The muzzle on some blunderbusses spanned four inches .
Lead shot was loaded through the muzzle .
Blunderbusses come in short and long muskets , pistols and swivel .
Though the romanticized image of the blunderbuss was its use by the swashbuckling pirate ( and they did use them ) , the weapon was also used by soldiers , sailors and civilians .
George Washington once considered the blunderbuss as an alternative to the carbine for the Continental Dragoons .
It was also used for ceremonal purposes as it was louder and gave off more smoke than other weapons .
The blunderbuss is still around .
It is a favorite in war reenactments , and stage play .
There are bands and beers named after this historical weapon .
I have even come across a man who has built a very fancy version of the blunderbuss ( see link ) .
Perhaps modern ships should keep the blunderbuss on board to ward off the pirates of today .

The 16 - year - old shot and killed by a sheriff ’s deputy Sunday afternoon in Compton was identified Monday as Avery Cody Jr .
Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Det. Steve Blagg said Cody had a loaded handgun when he was shot by a deputy on routine patrol .
But an attorney for Cody ’s family said the teen did not brandish a weapon and posed “ no threat ” to deputies or anyone else .
Attorney John E. Sweeney said Cody and a friend had just finished eating at a nearby McDonald ’s when they were stopped by officers in an unmarked vehicle near the intersection of Poinsettia Avenue and Alondra Boulevard in Compton .
The officers " asked them to stop , they complied .
They asked them to put their hands on the car , they complied , ” Sweeney said .
When officers asked Cody and his friend to pull up their T - shirts , Cody ran for an unknown reason , Sweeney said .
He said Cody ran about 20 or 25 feet and an officer shot him in the back .
The confrontation occurred around 3:45 p.m .
Sweeney said he believes a nearby security camera may have recorded the incident .
He said Cody was a student at Zinsmeyer Academy in Long Beach .
“ This boy posed no threat .
He was running away and he was gunned down in the streets of Compton .
It ’s just a horrible , horrible shooting .
I ’ve been doing these cases for over 25 years .
... and this is one of the most egregious officer - involved shootings I ’ve ever seen , ” Sweeney said .
Blagg said that he would not respond to Sweeney 's comments and that the shooting is still under investigation .

China 's national security concerns will take precedence over more usual diplomatic manoeuvrings in the case of detained Australian Stern Hu , a former Australian defence attache says .
Mr Hu , a Rio Tinto employee , has been accused of commercial espionage in relation to iron ore agreements and has been in custody in Shanghai for a week .
Russell Smith , formerly the Australian military attache in China , is now the regional director for strategic analysis firm IHS .
He says expectations that Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith can simply telephone his Chinese counterpart to sort out Mr Hu's release have to be balanced by Chinese political realities .
" A better reflection of the real state of the relationship is that we will dance to China 's tune , " he told Radio Australia 's Connect Asia program .
" You ... need to understand where the ministry of foreign affairs sits in the pecking order .
The ministry of state security is certainly a senior department and they 've got primacy on this particular case .
" So unfortunately the Chinese minister for foreign affairs may not necessarily be able to comment on it because it 's being led by another department . "
Mr Smith says in China , " diplomacy takes a back seat when you talk about national security " and " the Chinese are clearly saying this is a case of national security " .
The former attache says Mr Hu's past week " has been probably the most awful experience in his life " .
" [ He is ] being detained by the ministry of state security , where he would have been subjected to all sorts of , I guess , what people would consider to be Cold War interrogation techniques .
You know , sleep deprivation and so forth , " Mr Smith said .
He says Chinese authorities have made the point they have lots of evidence , " so I think he 's going to have a very , very difficult time and I 'd imagine he 's going to spend quite some time in jail " .
Mr Smith says any western view that Mr Hu had only been engaged in commercial dealings ran into China 's state - owned industry realities .
" Information that that particular state - owned enterprise has is state information , " in their view , he said .
" Therefore the collection of that state information is a breach of national security , so all of a sudden , very quickly , they put two and two together and we 're looking at an espionage case . "
Mr Smith says only time will tell what is in store for Mr Hu .
" I think it 's pretty much sealed for a period of time until both sides ... may be able to negotiate his release in quieter times , " he said .
Im Online - Archiv der „ New York Times “ findet sich die älteste Meldung zum Thema Musikpiraterie .
Sie stammt vom 13 .
Juni 1897 , aus der Gründerzeit der Phonoindustrie .
„ Kanadische Piraten “ verschickten Raubpressungen von Schallplatten über die Grenze und verkauften sie zu einem Zehntel des Originalpreises .
Zeitungen druckten Listen der verfügbaren Stücke – eine Art frühe Pirate Bay .
50 Prozent Umsatzeinbußen beklagte die Industrie und forderte , dass die Post die Sendungen filtere .
Eine vergleichsweise milde Maßnahme , gemessen am Internet - Ausschluss , den sich heute die Tonträgerindustrie für Filesharer wünscht
Die Politik reagiere nicht hart genug auf Internetpiraterie , begründete Dieter Gorny , Geschäftsführer des Bundesverbands der Musikindustrie , die Absage der Branchenmesse Popkomm in Berlin und sorgte allseits für Kopfschütteln .
Mark Chung vom Verband Unabhängiger Tonträgerunternehmen , der die Indie - Label vertritt , sagt : „ Starke Vereinfachungen helfen niemandem . “
Das Internet ist nämlich nicht der Feind der Musik .
Es ist nur der Feind der Tonträgerindustrie .
Nach Wachswalze , Schallplatte , Magnetband und CD hat sich Musik vom physischen
Träger gelöst und lässt sich mit geringem Aufwand beliebig oft kopieren .
Legale Musikdownloads machen zwar in Deutschland noch nicht 39 Prozent des Marktes aus wie in den USA ; doch sind die Erlöse im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres wieder um 16 Prozent gestiegen .
Bei allen Debatten um illegale Downloads geht es nicht um einen Konflikt zwischen Künstlern und Publikum , wie die Industrie ihn seit Jahren lautstark inszeniert .
Deren Interessen lassen sich im Netz wunderbar vereinen .
DIE DO-IT - YOURSELF -FRAU
Niemand führt die neuen Verhältnisse gerade selbstbewusster vor als die Amerikanerin Amanda Palmer , Sängerin des Cabaret - Rockduos Dresden Dolls .
Will Amanda Palmer ihr Publikum mobilisieren , braucht sie kein PR - Büro und keine Konzertagentur .
Über Twitter lädt sie zu Strandkonzerten mit Gruppenfoto oder zur Spontanparty in einer Stripbar .
Einen Pressetermin in einem leeren Kaufhaus verwandelte sie in ein Gratiskonzert für 350 Fans .
An einem Freitagabend im Mai entstand bei einem Massenchat ein T - Shirt - Spruch .
Palmer gestaltete direkt am Laptop die Druckvorlage , ein Freund setzte einen kleinen Online - Shop auf .
Am Ende der Nacht waren 200 T - Shirts verkauft .
Am Tag darauf weitere 200 .
In ihrem Blog zog die Sängerin Bilanz : „ Einnahmen durch Twitter in zwei Stunden : 11 000 Dollar .
Einnahmen durch mein Major - Soloalbum dieses Jahr : 0 Dollar . “
So klingt die Verzückung einer Künstlerin , die ihre Macht entdeckt – und vorführt , dass die Zeiten , in denen sich Künstler von Managern sagen lassen mussten , wo es langgeht , endgültig vorbei sind .
DER FAN ALS MANAGER
Im Prinzip lassen sich heute alle Aufgaben einer Plattenfirma – Aufnahme , Design , Booking , Buchhaltung – selbst erledigen oder an Freunde delegieren ; während Fans in Netzwerken wie last .
fm durch automatische Empfehlungen via Geschmacksprofil für Werbung sorgen oder über Fundraising - Foren gleich in die Rolle des Investors schlüpfen und Geld für Produktionen vorstrecken .
Zuletzt sammelte Patrick Wolf das Geld für sein viertes Studioalbum über die Website Bandstocks .
Auch die Kölner Band Angelika Express finanzierte ihr letztes Album mittels „ Angelika Aktien “ im Wert von 50 Euro , 80 Prozent der Einnahmen sollten zurück an die Fans fließen .
Es streckt ohnehin kaum noch ein Label Geld für Studioaufenthalt und Produktionskosten vor .
Lieber kauft man fertige Bänder .
Die vier verbliebenen Riesen Sony , Universal , EMI und Warner sehen ihre Zukunft im Lizenzhandel für Mode , Werbung , Filme und Computerspiele .
Sogenannte 360 - Grad-Verträge sichern das Mitverdienen an allen Aktivitäten der Künstler , vor allem an den Konzerteinnahmen .
Auch Bertelsmann spielt , nachdem sich der Konzern 2008 von Sony gelöst hatte , jetzt mit BMG Rights Management wieder auf dem brummenden Rechtemarkt mit .
Das Geschäft der erhabenen Alten : die Nachlassverwaltung .
So sind neue Künstler weitgehend sich selbst überlassen .
Es schießen Kleinstlabels aus dem Boden , die oft nicht mehr veröffentlichen als die Musik ihrer Gründer .
Der Berliner Pressungsdienstleister Handle With Care kann sich vor Aufträgen kaum retten – er hat sich auf Kleinstauflagen unter 1000 spezialisiert .
DER KÜNSTLER ALS UNTERNEHMER
Ein Musterbeispiel erfolgreicher Selbstvermarktung im Netz ist der Berliner DJ Alexander Ridha alias Boys Noize , der 2005 Boys Noize Records gründete .
Auf der Website Hype Machine , die Hörempfehlungen beliebter Musikblogs zusammenfasst , tauchen regelmäßig seine Remixe auf .
Während andere Labels ihre Musikdateien entfernen lassen , hat Alexander Ridha dafür gar nicht die Zeit .
Virales Marketing und kreatives Schaffen gehen bei ihm in eins und führen zu einem endlosen Strom aus Clubgigs , Studioaufenthalten und Myspace - Updates .
Seine Musik verkauft Ridha vorwiegend über beatport.com , das führende Downloadportal für elektronische Tanzmusik , das beweist , dass im Netz auch hohe Preise gezahlt werden , solange die Klangqualität stimmt .
Wer ein zahlungswilliges Publikum erreichen will , muss in den großen Online - Stores präsent sein : in iTunes , music load und Amazon Mp3 , das seit April aggressiv auf den deutschen Markt drängt .
Der Weg dorthin führt allerdings über Label und Zwischenhändler , sogenannte Content Aggregatoren .
Abkürzen lässt er sich über Quasilabels wie „ Artists without a Label “ , das mit einem einfachen Standardvertrag die Präsenz auf iTunes und hohe Anteile sichert ; Ausstieg jederzeit möglich .
Die Arctic Monkeys begannen hier , die Editors und Tina Dico .
In Deutschland bietet das Bandportal regioactive .de einen ähnlichen Zusatzservice , allerdings haben sich die 65 Euro Startgebühr bisher für kaum jemanden ausgezahlt – online sein alleine reicht eben nicht , um gehört zu werden .
LIEBER VERSCHENKEN ?
Der DJ Martin Juhls erhielt hingegen weltweit Aufträge , nachdem er seine Musik gratis unter einer Creative - Commons - Lizenz veröffentlichte , wie sie auch für freie Software üblich ist .
Sie erlaubt , das Werk für private Zwecke beliebig zu kopieren .
Das meistverkaufte Mp3 - Album 2008 bei Amazon war „ Ghosts “ von Nine Inch Nails – obwohl zuvor mit CC - Lizenz veröffentlicht .
In Deutschland könnten mehr Künstler diesen
Weg gehen , würde die GEMA hierfür Tantiemen einführen – nur ein Beispiel , wie ausbleibende politische Weichenstellungen die neuen Möglichkeiten behindern .
Dass das Internet alles von selbst regle , erweist sich ebenso als Aberglaube wie die Hoffnung , es ließe sich beliebig regulieren .
Die schönen Erfolgsbeispiele zeigen bislang vor allem , wie es gehen könnte – aber leider noch viel zu selten geht .
Für Stars ist es leicht , in den neuen Kanälen gut auszusehen .
Die große Frage ist , wie neue Künstler ihr Publikum finden .
Hier sieht Indie - Vertreter Mark Chung derzeit schwarz : „ Die neuen unter den fünf Millionen Künstlern , die ihre Myspace - Seiten eingerichtet haben , merken schnell , dass es niemanden gibt , der in sie investiert . “
Die gute Nachricht : Künstler dürfen in Zukunft wesentlich größere Stücke des Kuchens beanspruchen .
Die schlechte : Der Kuchen ist alleine schwer zu backen .
Andreas Gebhard von der Agentur „ newthinking communications “ sieht hier einen wachsenden Markt für Beratungs - und Software - Dienstleistungen .
Auch der Staat wäre gefragt , seine „ Initiative Musik “ auszubauen .
Was infrastrukturelle Förderung bringen kann , zeigt das Popmusterland Schweden .
Die Industrie bezichtigt die Internetpiraten gerne des Raubbaus .
Eine pikante Vereinfachung , denn nichts verschwindet , wenn man eine Datei kopiert , im Gegenteil : Hinterher hat man zwei .
Doch dafür waren die alten Vertriebsstrukturen nicht gemacht .
Neue bilden sich erst aus .
Es geht um nicht weniger als die Frage , wie die Gesellschaft in Zukunft ihre Künstler entlohnt und ihre kulturelle Erneuerung sichert .
„ Die Trias aus Schöpfern , Interpreten und Hörern driftet auseinander “ , beklagt Christian Höppner , Generalsekretär des Deutschen Musikrats .
„ Jeder verfolgt seine Interessen , anstatt einen gemeinsamen Lösungsweg zu suchen . “
Auf der einen Seite steht eine Industrie , die ihre Gewinne am liebsten eins zu eins ins neue Medium hinüberretten würde ; auf der anderen Seite eine große Hörerschaft , die nicht einsieht , warum sie für ein unbegrenzt kopierbares Datenbündel noch immer 10 Euro zahlen soll .
Und dazwischen die Künstler , auf sich selbst gestellt und ohne eigene Interessenvertretung , in der nicht auch die Verwerter mitsprechen würden .
Ein Zusammenschluss der Urheber ist eine der Chancen , die in einem öffentlich organisierten Vergütungssystem wie der Kulturflatrate liegen .
Es könnte erstmals eine exakte Abrechnung zwischen Künstler und Hörer schaffen und die Tauschbörsennutzer an die Kasse holen .
Industrie und CDU würden die Piraten lieber gleich vom Internet trennen .
Legalisierung oder Sanktionen – eine Frage für die nächste Legislaturperiode .
DIE DO-IT - YOURSELF -MESSE
Die Musikkonzerne verlieren den Anschluss an die Diskussion .
Die Berliner
Messe findet nun ohne sie statt : als offene Konferenz , bei der die Teilnehmer das Programm mitgestalten wie in einem Online - Forum .
Die Entstehung der „ all2gethernow “ erinnert stark an Amanda Palmers T - Shirt - Aktion : Gorny sagt die Popkomm ab , Internet - Experte Andreas Gebhard ruft Musikunternehmer Tim Renner an , der ruft das Radialsystem an , man setzt eine Website auf , gründet einen Verein und in wenigen Tagen ist die ganze Berliner Musikszene im Boot .
Es gibt Diskussionsbedarf , das zeigen auch die Rahmenprogramme der Kölner c/o Pop und des Hamburger Reeperbahnfestivals .
Zehn Jahre ist es her , dass die erste Tauschbörsensoftware Napster das Ende der CD einläutete .
Inzwischen sitzt der erste Internetpirat im Europaparlament .
Kulturpiraten , argumentiert der Musikjournalist Matt Mason in seinem gratis im Netz veröffentlichten Buch „ The Pirate ’s Dilemma “ , sind nicht der Feind .
Sie erfinden neue Stile , Technologien und Geschäftsmodelle .
Ohne ihre Innovationen wäre die heutige Kulturindustrie nicht denkbar .
Umgekehrt hieße das : Mit ihren Ideen wird die morgige denkbar .
Summary : Steps are taken by Russia to prevent abolishment of choice
YESTERDAY we wrote about Windows bundling and recently we wrote about what Microsoft was doing in Russia [ 1 , 2 ] .
The Russian authorities are finally closing in on Microsoft by exploring relationships with OEMs .
This is the right approach to take .
From the press release :
On 15th July 2009 , the Commission of the Federal Antimonopoly Service ( FAS Russia ) began proceedings in a case against « Асеr Inc. » , « ASUSTeK Computer Inc. » , « Toshiba Corporation » , « Hewlett - Packard Company » , « Samsung Electronics Co. , Ltd. » and « Dell Inc. » for the elements of violating the antimonopoly legislation .
In accordance with the Determination of 20th July 2009 , the FAS Russia ’s Commission , investigating the case , suspended the case until receiving additional evidence .
The case will continue on 10th September 2009 .
As noted here , this is a dangerous precedence to Microsoft .
Be sure Microsoft will put up a fight , because it will : 1 . Make clear to the customer what he pays for and how much he pays for it ;
2 . Make it virtually impossible to impose its terms to hardware manufacturers ;
3 . Give customers a real alternative , backed by a major company ;
4 . Expose the vulnerability of its business model in the 21st century to the shareholders in a way that cannot be misunderstood ;
5 . Create a dangerous precedent – if here , why not in the US ?
The Federal Antimonopoly Service ought to look at recent examples such as ASUS .
To name some posts on the subject :
There are many other sets of examples , but the links above refer to just one . █

The plant that can water itself
Matt Walker
Editor , Earth News
Desert rhubarb in bloom ( G. Ne'eman )
In the deserts of Israel , there is a plant that waters itself .
The plant , a type of rhubarb , has specially designed leaves that channel rain water to its roots .
It is the only known plant in the world able to self - irrigate .
The adaptation allows the rhubarb to flourish in extreme arid conditions by collecting up to 16 times more water than other plants in the region , say the scientists who published details of the discovery in Naturwissenschaften .
Simcha Lev-Yadun , Gadi Katzir and Gidi Ne'eman of the University of Haifa , Israel first noticed the desert rhubarb when studying plants in the country 's mountainous desert .
A rare but popular plant with nature lovers and ecologists , the researchers became curious about the possible advantages of the rhubarb 's exceptionally large rosette leaves , which markedly differ from the small leaves of most desert plants .
We know of no similar plant in other deserts of the world
Botanist Simcha Lev-Yadun
The morphology of the leaves looks similar to the mountainous region in which they grow , which drains water off the slopes and into the valleys .
" That ignited our imagination , " says Professor Simcha Lev-Yadun .
Water flows
Their study of desert rhubarb ( Rheum palaestinum ) growing in the Negev Desert showed that each plant typically harvests 4.2 litres of water each year , while the largest plant found harvested 43.8 litres .
Deep depressions in the rhubarb's leaves channel water along the leaves ' veins , which are orientated towards it base .
The leaves are also coated in a waxy cuticle , which repels water helping it flow over the leaves .
The topography of the leaves channels water to the roots ( S. Lev - Yadun ) Rain is so scarce in the area that an average of just 75 mm falls each year .
Yet even under the slightest rain , water flows down the rhubarbs ' leaves to the main root .
Further tests show this water then penetrates the soil to a depth of 10 cm , helping to irrigate the plant .
That 's 10 times deeper than rain landing on the desert soil .
" On average , the plant 's leaves allow it to collect 16 times more water than other desert plants in the region , " says Professor Lev-Yadun .
That means it gathers a similar amount of water as plants living in Mediterranean climates , the researchers report .
" We 're sure this is a unique plant in the deserts of the Middle - East , " says Professor Lev- Yadun .
" And we know of no similar plant in other deserts of the world . "

A former GP dubbed Doctor Death dared police to prosecute him today as he was questioned by officers for helping a terminally ill man pay for assisted suicide .
Dr Michael Irwin , 78 , vowed to highlight the " hypocritical British system " surrounding euthanasia as he was eventually taken to a station in south London .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Dr Irwin had expected to be taken to Shoreditch station in north London but , after media gathered in Hackney for his arrival , he was diverted elsewhere .
A Scotland Yard spokewoman said : " A 78 - year - old man was arrested this morning and taken to a south London station . "
Dr Irwin was being quizzed after writing a cheque for £ 1,500 towards the cost of 58 - year - old Raymond Cutkelvin 's procedure at Dignitas .
Before arriving at the police station , he said : " I am daring them to prosecute me .
It is a hypocritical British system that allows the rich to seek treatment but the poor to face prosecution . "
Mr Cutkelvin , of Hackney , east London , was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour of the pancreas in 2006 and died the following year at the clinic .
Dr Irwin was supported today by Mr Cutkelvin 's partner of 28 years , Alan Cutkelvin Rees , 57 .
Mr Cutkelvin Rees said : " I will do all I can to expose this absurd law .
" I have no trouble with the police , it 's the system which has stopped me from grieving . "
Dr Irwin insisted he would welcome a criminal trial , claiming he would be " open " with police about the role he played in Mr Cutkelvin 's death .
" The two individuals , Raymond who was dying and his partner Alan , were not very well off financially and I was willing to pay one - third of the total cost involved in making that journey .
" I think it is the height of hypocrisy in this country where if you have the money , you are terminally ill and you want to go to Switzerland , you can do so . "
Dr Irwin congratulated Debbie Purdy 's triumph at the High Court in seeking to clarify the law on assisted suicide .
But he said : " It remains to be seen whether this will have positive wider implications . "
The retired GP was struck off the medical register in 2005 by the General Medical Council ( GMC ) after he travelled to the Isle of Man with the intention of giving his friend , Patrick Kneen , about 60 Temazepam sleeping pills to help him die .
But Mr Kneen , who was in his late 70s and had prostate cancer , was too ill to take the class C drug and died a few days later while in a coma .
The GMC struck Dr Irwin off the medical register , saying his actions had been " unprofessional " , " inappropriate " and " irresponsible " .
Dr Irwin , of Cranleigh , Surrey , stood down as chairman of the then Voluntary Euthanasia Society , now renamed Dignity in Dying , after receiving a police caution over the incident .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - A U.S. service member was killed as the deadliest month for foreign troops in the Afghanistan war drew to a close , the U.S. military said on Friday , with commanders vowing to continue the fight despite the toll .
The death in southern Afghanistan brought to 40 the number of U.S. troops killed in July , by far the heaviest monthly toll in the 8 - year - old war .
The worst previous month for U.S. forces was in September 2008 , when 26 were killed .
The latest death occurred in a firefight with insurgents in southern Afghanistan on Thursday , the U.S. military said , without giving further details .
At least 70 foreign troops have been killed in July .
Britain has suffered its worst battlefield casualties since the 1980s Falklands War , with the 22 troops killed in the month taking its total losses in Afghanistan to 191 , 12 more than were killed in the Iraq war .
Casualties spiked after thousands of U.S. and British troops this month launched major operations in southern Helmand province , a Taliban stronghold and the center of Afghanistan ’s opium production .
“ We understood the return of security to these areas would not be achieved without sacrifice , ” said U.S. Rear Admiral Greg Smith , chief spokesman for U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan .
“ For some that has come at a high price , ” he told Reuters .
“ CLEAR , HOLD , BUILD ”
The Helmand operations are the first under U.S. President Barack Obama ’s new regional strategy to defeat the Taliban and its Islamist militant allies and stabilize Afghanistan .
They come before crucial presidential elections on August 20 .
They are also the first phase of a new “ clear , hold and build ” strategy introduced after criticism that previous strategies lacked cohesion and direction .
The operations are designed to clear areas of insurgents and then hold them , something that overstretched British - led NATO forces had been unable to do before this month .
“ It ’s too early to assess the true impact of operations in the south .
The clearing of insurgents continues and will for many more weeks to come , ” Smith said .
The United States has around 62,000 troops in Afghanistan , out of a total foreign force of about 101,000 .
U.S. forces are set to rise to some 68,000 by the end of the year .

The extra troops include 4,000 meant to help train Afghan security forces and will be followed by a “ civilian surge ” of several hundred meant to help Afghanistan rebuild institutions shattered by decades of war .
General Stanley McChrystal , the new commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan , has also introduced a new counter - insurgency strategy and issued a new tactical directive , which includes limiting the use of air strikes , aimed at reducing the number of civilian casualties in the war .
Civilian deaths have outraged many Afghans and caused friction between Washington and Afghan President Hamid Karzai ’s government .
A U.N. report released in Geneva on Friday found that 1,013 civilians had been killed between January and June this year , up from 818 in the same period last year , as the battlefield in Afghanistan increasingly moved into residential areas .
The deaths were largely caused by air strikes , car bombs and suicide attacks , with the Taliban blamed for 59 percent of the fatalities , the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said .
“ All parties involved in this conflict should take all measures to protect civilians , and to ensure the independent investigation of all civilian casualties , as well as justice and remedies for the victims , ” said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay .
Six civilians were killed or wounded by a roadside bomb in Jawzjan province in Afghanistan ’s north late on Thursday , the Interior Ministry said .
In southeastern Ghazni province , Afghan and NATO troops killed 11 Taliban insurgents on Thursday , local officials said .
“ Will Higher Education be the Next Bubble to Burst ? ”
So asks a recent op - ed in the Chronicle of Higher Education .
The question is powerful .
Data points :
• Over the past quarter - century , the average cost of higher education has risen at a rate four times faster than inflation — twice as fast as the cost of health care .
• Tuition , room , and board at private colleges can cost $ 50,000 per year or more .
• The market crash of 2008 inflicted terrible damage on college endowments .
The Commonfund Institute reports that endowments dropped by an average of 23 percent in the five months ending Nov. 30 , 2008 .
Authors Joseph Cronin and Howard Horton ( respectively a past Massachusetts secretary of Education and the president of the New England College of Business and Finance ) comment :
“ The middle class , which has paid for higher education in the past mainly by taking out loans , may now be precluded from doing so as the private student - loan market has all but dried up .
In addition , endowment cushions that allowed colleges to engage in steep tuition discounting are gone .
Declines in housing valuations are making it difficult for families to rely on home - equity loans for college financing .
Even when the equity is there , parents are reluctant to further leverage themselves into a future where job security is uncertain .
Consumers who have questioned whether it is worth spending $ 1,000 a square foot for a home are now asking whether it is worth spending $ 1,000 a week to send their kids to college . ”
Even this underestimates the severity of the situation , however .
The 2006 Economic Report of the President presents a remarkable fact : Between 2000 and 2005 , the average wages of college graduates declined after adjusting for inflation .
From an economic point of view , in other words , a college degree costs more and more and returns less and less .
Kind of like a hot stock with a price - to - earnings ratio of 32 , it ’s a prelude to a crash .
Why are the wages of the college - educated declining ?
A big part of the answer is that the pool of college graduates is rapidly expanding .
It ’s not surprising that as college becomes more universal , the return on a college education falls .
As the number of job applicants with degrees rises , employers become more sophisticated in assessing the value of any particular degree .
The degree itself matters less than the institution that granted it , the subject areas of concentration , and the grade point average earned .
A 4.0 math degree from Cal Tech is a very different thing from a 2.8 communications degree from San Francisco State University .
Now the next question is :
Will consumers become more sophisticated too ?
Tuition , room , and board at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill cost about half what they cost at nearby Duke .
Is a Duke education really twice as valuable as one from UNC ?
Yet economic benefits are not the sole measurement of value .
Intellectually , spiritually , and morally , American higher education is in crisis , with the worst damage manifested at the most expensive institutions .
At Duke , racial politics whooped up a faculty lynch mob against student lacrosse players who were falsely accused of rape .
It ’s often at the costliest universities that students are able to graduate with a degree in English without ever having read Shakespeare , a degree in history despite ignorance of the Civil War , or one in art history without ever having encountered the Renaissance .
In their own ways , universities indulge in some of the worst faults of the corporate sector , overcharging their customers in order to allow managers and staff to engage in wasteful or destructive activities that could never be justified on their own .
With the boom lowering , universities have begun feverishly looking for solutions to their problems .
Options include broad admissions of international students , many of whom attend U.S. universities less in hope of obtaining a U.S. degree than of gaining entry to the U.S. labor market .
Over the longer run , however , universities , like other troubled institutions , will have to rethink the fundamentals of their work .
Why does it take four years to complete a BA degree ?
Maybe liberal arts studies make more sense later in life ?
But this rethinking should not stop with the universities .
The entire American education establishment needs reform .
Maybe tough high school exit exams would serve the needs of employers who currently insist on a BA not for its own sake but as proof that a student was not too lazy or aimless to get one .
Indeed , it could be that when the job market attaches less value to a piece of parchment , universities will at last lay aside their often ugly political preoccupations and rediscover their true mission : the pursuit of knowledge as a good in itself .
** Correction :
An earlier version of this column said that Hampshire College had joined a financial boycott of Israel .
A Hampshire College spokesperson says the school holds investments in funds that include companies that do business in Israel and in at least three Israeli companies : Amdocs , Teva Pharmaceuticals , and Check Point Software .
LOS ANGELES 
To her neighbors , she was the kindly friend who delivered chocolate - covered cherries at Christmastime and passed hours in the garage building doors and cabinets .
To her colleagues , she was a basketball - crazed jokester who threw herself into work but delighted in pranks like kidnapping a stuffed bear for a candy “ ransom . ”
But to the police and prosecutors , Stephanie Lazarus , the 49 - year - old mother of a toddler whom friends and co-workers could not praise enough , is a killer .
Worse , she is one of their own .
She is a Los Angeles police detective , and she has been charged with killing the wife of a former lover more than 20 years ago .
Deputy Chief Charlie Beck , who supervises hundreds of detectives and has seen his share of sensational crimes in a 32 - year career here , is still shaking his head at the whirlwind turn of the case .
Only a few police officers in Chief Beck ’s career have been charged with deliberately killing someone off duty , and he never imagined investigating one of his own seasoned detectives for such a crime .
Note : I wrote this post 2 days before the launch of Opera Unite .
So read it from historical perspective – Where the world was without Opera Unite .
I am writing this post with a hope that Håkon Wium Lie ( CTO of Opera ) will get a chance to read this post .
I used Opera browser 3 years ago .
I do n’t really remember the reason why i have switched from Opera to Firefox .
But i still think it is a great browser .
Probably one of the under appreciated ones for the value it provides to the users .
I recently came across a blog post from Geek Technica ( http://www.geektechnica.com/2009/06/8-browser-innovations-started-by-opera/).
It is shocking to see a pioneer known for its innovations has only ~ 2.2 % market share in desktop browsers compared to IE6 ’s 14.2 % market share .
One can categorize the browser players into four major categories .
Microsoft ( IE ) , Apple ( Safari ) – Both OS and Web play
Google ( Chrome ) – Pure Web play with Google Native Client
Firefox – Pure Web play with extensible add - on architecture
Opera – Pure Web Play
Since Microsoft and Apple have operating system play they are not going to go in the direction of making operating system completely irrelevant .
But they do have the advantage of bundling their browsers with their operating systems .
So IE and safari are going to be around for the foreseeable future .
They are not going to go away easily .
The other leading browser Firefox commands immense loyalty with their user base .
Firefox ’s powerful add - ons and extensible architecture make the browser indispensable to its users and it will be hard for other players to poach the Firefox ’s committed user base .
The recent entry of Google chrome has made browser market much more competitive .
If you look at the chart Google Chrome has gained 5.5 % of market share in a short period of time .
With the introduction of Google native client its strategy is very clear .
Bring the power and speed of native applications to the web platform and make the underlying operating system irrelevant for the end users .
Google native client allows the developers to access the full computational power of underlying CPU and enables them to create rich dynamic internet applications .
Considering their past track record Google will be able to provide all the mainstream desktop applications in browser with the same functionality and features .
I will not be surprised if Google can gain at least 1/4th of total desktop browser market share in a year time .
So with the exception of Opera , all the browsers have one or other advantages ( bundling , native client , add - ons , etc . . ) .
The situation is precarious for Opera in the desktop segment .
Unless otherwise they do something groundbreaking or revolutionary they may not be able to increase the market share from current level and most probably will be delegated to obscure status .
So now coming to the core of the topic .
How Tonido can help Opera not only to gain the market share but also to win the the browser war ultimately .
For people who do n’t know what Tonido is :
It is a cross platform , peer - to - peer , personal web application platform .
Tonido Platform Features
Portable : Runs on x86 , ARM
Cross platform : Windows , Linux , Mac OSX
Small memory footprint : high performance
Small download : 5 MB download without applications
Open development platform that allows new applications to be built
1 - click seamless install of new apps from Tonido app store
Apps have Web based UI
Apps accessible locally , from intranet or internet http://mike.tonidoid.com
Apps can communicate via P2P
Apps run locally and store data locally
Apps can be used online or offline w/o internet connectivity
Rich , Interactive Web 2.0 style UI .
If you want to know more about Tonido Platform , please refer to our post How Tonido Platform Works
So How Tonido Platform can help Opera Browser ?
Tonido provides an development platform for Opera to create interesting rich internet applications .
Tonido development platform offers native OS access for Opera without limiting APIs to ones provided by Opera itself .
With the native access sky is the limit for number of interesting apps you can develop on Tonido platform .
All the popular desktop apps can be targeted for replacement with the help of Tonido Platform .
Tonido development platform offers an in - built http server and a p2 p stack to Opera .
Now users become not only the consumer of information provided by public online services , but also can become the producers of information .
This approach is a game changer and totally revolutionary .
Tonido Platform is light weight .
It can run happily on embedded systems .
So taking the Tonido platform to Opera ’s mobile forte is a cakewalk .
With Tonido ’s P2P stack , Opera browser will be able to create the largest private p2 p network mankind ever witnessed .
Later Opera can use this for content delivery .
Finally with the help of Tonido Platform , Opera can thwart the competitions from FireFox ( Extensible app and update architecture offered by Tonido ) , Google Chrome ( Native OS Access Offered by Tonido Platform ) , IE and Safari .
So all - in - all Tonido Platform is a great fit for Opera .
If anybody from Opera Top management reads this please do n’t hesitate to contact us . 🙂
— Original Blog Post Ends Here —
Note : Opera ’s Unite launch today closes the opportunity for us .
But Kudos to the Opera Team and we wish good luck with their endeavors .
For the naysayers , Opera ’s Unite launch completely validates the concept of Tonido .
We are happy about it !
But we are not going to sit idle as well .
This is a big space and Opera ’s Unite will raise awareness overall about solutions that respect privacy and freedom from thirdparty servers and it is a good thing .
And we are going to march steadfast until we reach our goal .
A question to the developer community : If Tonido decides to build a browser based on WebKit with a http and p2 p stack , will you be interested in it ?
Will you be able to develop applications for Tonido ?
Let us know .

Introduction
One of the great joys of working on Global Voices has been having the chance to work with people who are expressing themselves despite powerful forces working to keep them silent .
I ’ve worked with a number of authors who ’ve wanted to write about political or personal matters online , but who felt they could n’t write online unless they could ensure that their writing could n’t be traced to their identity .
These authors include human rights activists in dozens of nations , aid workers in repressive countries as well as whistleblowers within companies and governments .
I wrote a technical guide to anonymous blogging some months back and posted it on Global Voices , outlining several different methods for blogging anonymously .
Since then , I ’ve led workshops in different corners of the world and have gotten comfortable teaching a particular set of tools – Tor , WordPress and various free email accounts – which used in combination can provide a very high level of anonymity .
The guide that follows below does n’t offer you any options – it just walks you through one particular solution in detail .
You can feel free to ignore the “ why ” sections of the guide if you want a quicker read and if you ’re the sort of person who does n’t need to know why to do something .
I hope to format this more prettily at some point in the future , allowing the “ why ” sections to be expanded and compressed , making the whole document a lot shorter .
If I ’ve been unclear somewhere in the document or got something wrong , please let me know in the comments – this is a draft which I hope to clean up before posting it on Global Voices .
Should you find it useful and want to disseminate it further , feel free – like almost everything on this site , it ’s licensed under a Creative Commons 2.5 Attribution license , which means you ’re free to print it on coffee cups and sell them , if you think there ’s a market and money to be made .
Disclaimer
If you follow these directions exactly , you ’ll sharply reduce the chances that your identity will be linked to your online writing through technical means – i.e. , through a government or law enforcement agency obtaining records from an Internet Service Provider .
Unfortunately , I cannot guarantee that they work in all circumstances , including your circumstances , nor can I accept liability , criminal or civil , should use or misuse of these directions get you into legal , civil or personal trouble .
These directions do nothing to prevent you from being linked through other technical means , like keystroke logging ( the installation of a program on your computer to record your keystrokes ) or traditional surveillance ( watching the screen of your computer using a camera or telescope ) .
The truth is , most people get linked to their writing through non-technical means : they write something that leaves clues to their identity , or they share their identity with someone who turns out not to be trustworthy .
I ca n’t help you on those fronts except to tell you to be careful and smart .
For a better guide to the “ careful and smart ” side of things , I recommend EFF ’s “ How to Blog Safely ” guide .
Onto the geekery :
I – Writing from shared computers
If you ’re going to be writing primarily from shared computers ( like cybercafe computers ) or you ’re unable to install software on a computer , please follow the steps below to run Tor Browser Bundle without needing to install any software .
In case you 'll be blogging primarily from your personal computer , where you can install software , please refer to the chapter II .
Zero Install Bundle for Windows ( for any portable media drive )
We recommend that you download the Zero Install Bundle for Windows , a great pre-configured Tor bundle with self contained Mozilla Firefox browser for USB drives or any portable media ( SD Card , Hard Drives , Compact Flash Card ) .
Tor Browser is an open source version of a portable browser developed by Tor Project .
It is a highly customized version of the Firefox browser with Tor , Vidalia , caching http proxy called Polipo , Firefox , and Torbutton already installed .
It ’s designed to be placed on a USB key so that you can access
Tor from shared computers that do n’t permit you to install software .
a ) Download Tor Browser Bundle .
Download the package for your preferred language from the Tor project website onto a computer where you can save files .
Insert your USB key and copy the Tor Browser Bundle onto the key .
Using this USB key and any Windows computer where you can insert a USB key , you can access a Tor-protected browser .
On this shared computer , quit the existing web browser .
Insert the key , find the key ’s filesystem on the Desktop , and double - click the Start Tor Browser .exe .
The Vidalia window will shortly appear .
Remember that you can download Tor Browser Bundle from Tor project website or choose the package for your preferred language from Tor Browser Bundle download page .
b ) Extract the file in your USB key , open the “ Tor Browser ” folder and click on the “ Start Tor Browser ” .
After connecting to the Tor Network , Tor-enabled Firefox browser will start automatically by visiting the Tor Test page .
Make sure you get a “ Congratulations .
You are using Tor. ” message .
Otherwise you will get this message telling you that “ Sorry .
You are not using Tor .
If you are attempting to use a Tor client , please refer to the Tor website and specifically the instructions for configuring your Tor client . ”
Now , if you will be blogging primarily from your personal computer , where you can install software , please follow the steps below .
Step 1 : Disguise your IP .
Every computer on the internet has or shares an IP address .
These addresses are n’t the same thing as a physical address , but they can lead a smart system administrator to your physical address .
In particular , if you work for an ISP , you can often associate an IP address with the phone number that requested that IP at a specific time .
So before we do anything anonymous on the Internet , we need to disguise our IP .
What to do if you want to blog from your home or work machine :
a) Install Firefox .
Download it at the Mozilla site and install it on the main machine you blog from .
Why ?
Internet Explorer has some egregious security holes that can compromise your online security .
These holes tend to go unpatched for longer on IE than on other browsers .
( Do n’t believe me ?
Ask Bruce Schneier . )
It ’s the browser most vulnerable to spyware you might inadvertently download from a website .
And many of the privacy tools being released are being written specifically to work with Firefox , including Torbutton , which we ’ll be using in a future step .
b ) Install Tor. Download the program from the Tor site .
If access to Tor main website is blocked in your country , there are a few mirrors of it in other places where it can also be downloaded from .
You can also go to googl cache for viewing the mirrors page by googling for “ site:torproject.org mirrors “ .
Pick the “ latest stable release ” for your platform and download it onto your desktop .
Follow the instructions that are linked to the right of the release you downloaded .
You ’ll install two software packages and need to make some changes to the settings within your new installation of Firefox .
In case your internet connection blocks access to the Tor website , you can request a bundle by sending an email to the “ gettor ” robot at gettor [ AT ] torproject [ DOT ] org .
Remember that the emails to gettor@torproject.org has to come from Gmail , otherwise they wo n't get a response .
Select one of the following package names and put the package name anywhere in the body of your email :
tor - im - browser - bundle
windows - bundle
panther - bundle
tor - browser - bundle
source - bundle
tiger - bundle
Shortly after sending your email , you will receive an email from “ Gettor ” robot with the requested software as a zip file .
Unzip the package and verify the signature .
Why ?
Tor is a very sophisticated network of proxy servers .
Proxy servers request a web page on your behalf , which means that the web server does n’t see the IP address of the computer requesting the webpage .
When you access
Tor , you ’re using three different proxy servers to retrieve each webpage .
The pages are encrypted in transit between servers , and even if one or two of the servers in the chain were compromised , it would be very difficult to see what webpage you were retrieving or posting to .
Tor installs another piece of software , Privoxy , which increases the security settings on your browser , blocking cookies and other pieces of tracking software .
Conveniently , it also blocks many ads you encounter on webpages .
c ) The bundle installs also the Torbutton Firefox plugin for you .
It will simply ask you for permission to install itself from the downloaded package .
Click “ Install Now ” , restart your Firefox , and you 're all set :
Turning on Tor by hand means remembering to change your browser preferences to use a proxy server .
This is a muiltistep process , which people sometimes forget to do .
Torbutton makes the process a single mouse click and reminds you whether you ’re using Tor or not , which can be very helpful .
You may find that Tor slows down your web use – this is a result of the fact that Tor requests are routed through three proxies before reaching the webserver .
Some folks – me included – use
Tor only in situations where it ’s important to disguise identity and turn it off otherwise – Torbutton makes this very easy .
d) Turn on Tor in Firefox and test it out .
With Tor turned on , visit this URL ( https://check.torproject.org/).
After clicking , if you get this message telling you , “ Congratulations .
You are using Tor. Please refer to the Tor website for further information about using Tor safely . ” , then you ’ve got everything installed correctly and you ’re ready for the next step .
Otherwise you will get this message telling you “ Sorry .
You are not using Tor .
If you are attempting to use a Tor client , please refer to the Tor website and specifically the instructions for configuring your Tor client . ”
Why ?
It ’s always a good idea to see whether the software you ’ve installed works , especially when it ’s doing something as important as Tor is .
The page you ’re accessing is checking to see what IP address your request is coming from .
If it ’s from a known
Tor node , Tor is working correctly and your IP is disguised – if not , something ’s wrong and you should try to figure out why Tor is n’t working correctly .
What if Tor never connects ?
If you have problems connecting to the Tor network you should read the FAQ about problems with running Tor properly .
In case your internet connection blocks access to the Tor network and in case the Vidalia onion icon in the system tray is always yellow , you may consider using bridge relays .
This would be the next logical step to get you connected to the Tor network .
Bridge relays ( or “ bridges ” for short ) are Tor relays that are n't listed in the main Tor directory .
Since there is no complete public list of them , even if your ISP is filtering connections to all the known
Tor relays , they probably wo n't be able to block all the bridges .
If you suspect your access to the Tor network is being blocked , you may want to use the bridge feature of Tor . ”
You can get bridged by sending an email , from a gmail account , containing “ get bridges ” in the body of the email to the following email address bridges@torproject.org .
Shortly after , you will receive an automatic message with the bridges .
It is also possible to acquire bridges from the following url : https://bridges.torproject.org/
Open Vidalia 's conrol Panel , go to Settings >
Network and click “ My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network ” .
Add each bridge address one at a time by pasting it into the “ Add a Bridge ” window and then clicking the “ + ” sign .
Step 2 : Generate a new , hard to trace email account .
Most web services – including blog hosting services – require an email address so that they communicate with their users .
For our purposes , this email address can’t connect to any personally identifiable information , including the IP address we used to sign up for the service .
This means we need a new account which we sign up for using Tor , and we need to ensure that none of the data we use – name , address , etc. – can be linked to us .
You should NOT use an existing email account – it ’s very likely that you signed up for the account from an undisguised IP , and most webmail providers store the IP address you signed up under .
a ) Choose a webmail provider
- we recommend
Riseup.net
and
Gmail
, but as long as you ’re using Tor , you could use
Yahoo
or
Hotmail
as well .
Also , you can easily register a free and quick webmail account with
fastmail.fm
.
Why ?
Webmail is the best way to create a “ disposeable ” email address , one you can use to sign up for services and otherwise ignore .
But a lot of users also use webmail as their main email as well .
If you do this , it ’s important to understand some of the strengths and weaknesses of different mail providers .
Hotmail and Yahoo mail both have a “ security feature ” that makes privacy advocates very unhappy .
Both include the IP address of the computer used to send any email .
This is n’t relavent when you ’re accessing those services through Tor , since the IP address will be a Tor IP address , rather than your IP address .
Also , Hotmail and Yahoo do n’t offer secure HTTP ( https ) interfaces to webmail – again , this does n’t matter so long as you use
Tor every time you use these mail services .
But many users will want to check their mail in circumstances where they do n’t have Tor installed – for your main webmail account , it ’s worth choosing a provider that has an https interface to mail .
Riseup.net provides webmail with a very high degree of security .
They support PGP encryption ( Pretty Good Privacy ) - which is very useful if you correspond with people who also use PGP .
You can sign up for a free account at www.riseup.net and ask your correspondents ( recipients ) to register a free account as well .
Gmail , while it does n’t advertise itself as a secure mail service , has some nice security features built in .
If you visit this special URL ( https://mail.google.com/mail), your entire session with Gmail will be encrypted via https .
You can also visit https://mail.google.com/mail/h/
a secure SSL Gmail webmail that automatically load into Basic HTML interface .
( I recommend bookmarking that URL and using it for all your Gmail sessions . )
Gmail does n’t include the originating IP in mail headers , and you can add PGP support to Gmail by using the FireGPG , a Firefox extension that adds strong crypto to Gmail .
FireGPG brings an interface to encrypt , decrypt , sign or verify the signature of text in any web page using GnuPG .
A warning on all webmail accounts – you ’re trusting the company that runs the service with all your email .
If that company gets hacked , or if they are pressured by other governments to reveal information , they ’ve got access to the text of all the mails you ’ve received and sent .
The only way around this is to write your mails in a text editor , encrypt them on your own machine using PGP and send them to someone also using PGP .
This is way beyond the level of secrecy most of us want and need , but it ’s important to remember that you ’re trusting a company that might or might not have your best interests at heart .
Yahoo , in particular , has a nasty habit of turning over information to the Chinese government – Chinese dissidents are now suing the company for illegal release of their data .
Just something to think about when you decide who to trust …
b) Turn
Tor on in your browser , or start Tor Browser from your USB key .
Visit the mail site of your choice and sign up for a new account .
Do n’t use any personally identifiable information – consider becoming a boringly named individual in a country with a lot of web users , like the US or the UK .
Set a good , strong password ( at least eight characters , include at least one number or special character ) for the account and choose a username similar to what you ’re going to name your blog .
c ) Make sure you ’re able to log onto the mail service and send mail while Tor is enabled .
It is most likely that Tor changes its circuit every 10 minutes and this could disrupt your webmail operations , so you should consider limiting the process of writing a new email to 10 minutes .
Step 3 : Register your new anonymous blog
a) Turn
Tor on in your browser , or start start Tor Browser Bundle .
Visit WordPress.com and sign up for a new account by clicking the “ Get a New WordPress Blog ” link .
Use the email address you just created and create a username that will be part of your blog address : thenameyouchoose.wordpress.com
b ) WordPress will send an activation link to your webmail account .
Use your Tor-enabled browser to retrieve the mail and follow that activation link .
This lets WordPress know you ’ve used a live email account and that they can reach you with updates to their service – as a result , they ’ll make your blog publicly viewable and send you your password .
You ’ll need to check your webmail again to retrieve this password .
c ) Still using
Tor , log into your new blog using your username and password .
Click on “ My Dashboard ” , then on “ Update your profile or change your password . ”
Change your password to a strong password that you can remember .
Feel free to add information to your profile as well … just make sure none of that information is linked to you !
Step 4 : Post to your blog
a) Write your blog post offline .
Not only is this a good way to keep from losing a post if your browser crashes or your net connection goes down , it means you can compose your posts somewhere more private than a cybercafe .
A simple editor , like Wordpad for Windows , is usually the best to use .
Save your posts as text files ( After blogging , always remember to remove these files from your machine completely , using a tool like Eraser or Ccleaner which is is available in many languages and wipes temporary files automatically from all installed browsers and other applications ) .
) .
b) Turn on Tor , or use Tor Browser from your portable media drive , and log onto WordPress.com .
Click the “ write ” button to write a new post .
Cut and paste the post from your text file to the post window .
Give the post a title and put it into whatever categories you want to use .
c ) Before you hit “ Publish ” , there ’s one key step .
Click on the blue bar on the right of the screen that says “ Post Timestamp . ”
Click the checkbox that says “ Edit Timestamp ” .
Choose a time a few minutes in the future – ideally , pick a random interval and use a different number each time .
This will put a variable delay on the time your post will actually appear on the site – WordPress wo n’t put the post up until it reaches the time you ’ve specified .
Why ?
By editing the timestamp , we ’re protecting against a technique someone might use to try to determine your identity .
Imagine you ’re writing a blog called “ Down with Ethiopia Telecommunications Company ! ”
Someone at ETC might start following that blog closely and wonder whether one of their customers was writing the blog .
They start recording the times a post was made on downwithetc.wordpress.com and check these timestamps against their logs .
They discover that a few seconds before each post was made over the series of a month , one of their customers was accessing one or another Tor node .
They conclude that their user is using Tor to post to the blog and turn this information over to the police .
By changing the timestamp of the posts , we make this attack more difficult for the internet service provider .
Now they ’d need access to the logs of the WordPress server as well , which are much harder to get than their own logs .
It ’s a very easy step to take that increases your security .
Step 5 : Cover your tracks
a) Securely erase the rough drafts of the post you made from your laptop or home machine .
If you used a USB key to bring the post to the cybercafe , you ’ll need to erase that , too .
It ’s not sufficient to move the file to the trash and empty the trash – you need to use a secure erasing tool like Eraser or Ccleaner which overwrites the old file with data that makes it impossible to retrieve .
On a Macintosh , this functionality is built it – bring a file to the trash and choose “ Secure Empty Trash ” from the Finder Menu .
b ) Clear your browser history , cookies and passwords from Firefox .
Under the Tools menu , select “ Clear Private Data ” .
Check all the checkboxes and hit “ okay ” .
You might want to set up Firefox so that it automatically clears your data when you quit – you can do this under “ Firefox -> Preferences -> Privacy -> Settings ” .
Choose the checkbox that says “ Clear private data when closing Firefox ” .
In case you cannot install programs on the computer , use the IE Privacy Cleaner tool from the USB stick to wipe temp browser data .
Why ?
It ’s very easy for someone to view the websites you ’ve visited on a computer by reviewing your browser history .
More sophisticated snoops can find out your browsing history by checking your cache files , which include stored versions of webpages .
We want to clear all this data out from a public computer so that the next user does n’t find it .
And we want to eliminate it from our personal computer so that if that computer were lost , stolen or seized , we ca n’t be linked to the posts we ’ve made .
Some parting thoughts :
- It ’s not enough just to protect yourself when writing to your own blog .
If you ’re going to post comments on other blogs using your “ nom de blog ” , you need to use Tor when posting those comments as well .
Most blog software records the IP a comment came from – if you do n’t use Tor , you invite whoever runs that site to track your IP address back to your computer .
Tor ’s like a condom – do n’t practice unsafe blogging .
- Just because you ’re anonymous does n’t mean you should n’t make your blog pretty .
The “ Presentation ” tab in WordPress has lots of options to play with – you can pick different templates , even upload photos to customize some of them .
But be very , very careful in using your own photos – you give a lot of information about yourself in posting a photo ( if the photo was taken in Zambia , for instance , it ’s evidence that you are or were in Zambia . )
- If you ’re really worried about your security , you might want to go a step further in setting up your Firefox browser and turn off Java .
There ’s a nasty security bug in the most recent release of Java that allows a malicious script author to figure out what IP address your computer has been assigned EVEN IF YOU ARE USING TOR .
We do n’t worry too much about this because we do n’t think that WordPress.com or Google are running these malicious scripts … but it ’s something to seriously consider if you ’re using Tor for other reasons .
To turn off Java , go to “ Firefox -> Preferences -> Content ” and uncheck the box for Enable Java .
- If you ’re the only person in your country using Tor , it becomes pretty obvious – the same user is the only one who accesses the IP addresses associated with Tor nodes .
If you ’re going to use Tor and you ’re worried that an ISP might be investigating Tor use , you might want to encourage other friends to use
Tor – this creates what cryptographers call “ cover traffic ” .
You also might want to use
Tor to read various websites , not just to post to your blog .
In both cases , this means that Tor is being used for reasons other than just posting to your anonymous blog , which means that a user accessing Tor in an ISP ’s server logs does n’t automatically make the ISP think something bad is taking place .
A final thought on anonymity :
If you do n’t really need to be anonymous , do n’t be .
If your name is associated with your words , people are likely to take your words seriously .
But some people are going to need to be anonymous , and that ’s why this guide exists .
Just please do n’t use these techniques unless you really need to .
Show your support !
Previous versions of this guide :
Under pressure to pay for his ambitious reshaping of the nation ’s healthcare system , President Obama on Saturday outlined $ 313 billion in Medicare and Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade to help cover the cost of expanding coverage to tens of millions of America ’s uninsured .
The proposal comes on top of more than $ 634 billion in new revenue Obama suggested reserving for healthcare in his February budget plan .
The president , who increasingly is focusing on his healthcare agenda as Congress struggles to craft legislation , said his latest plan would help control the country ’s skyrocketing healthcare tab .
“ I know some question whether we can afford to act this year , ” Obama said in announcing the proposal in his weekly radio address .
“ But the unmistakable truth is that it would be irresponsible to not act .
We ca n’t keep shifting a growing burden to future generations . ”

Yet the proposal -- which includes potential cuts to hospitals , pharmaceutical companies and other providers -- also underscores the political delicacy of the administration ’s search for money for a massive healthcare overhaul that could cost more than $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade .
Among the proposed policy changes outlined by the president are :
* Reductions in payments to providers to reflect increased efficiencies in the system , which the White House estimates could save $ 110 billion over the next decade .
* Cuts in federal subsidies to hospitals that treat large populations of uninsured patients , estimated to save $ 106 billion in the next decade .
Advertisement
* Cuts in how much the federal government pays pharmaceutical companies to provide prescription drugs to seniors and others , estimated to save $ 75 billion over the next decade .
The president described the proposals as “ common sense changes ” that could make the system more efficient .
In briefing reporters , Peter R. Orszag , Obama ’s budget director and a leading architect of the president ’s healthcare policy , downplayed the potential lost revenue for healthcare providers , pointing to the millions of additional people who would get insurance under the plans being advanced by congressional Democrats .
“ This money is dedicated to financing , in a fiscally responsible way , expanded coverage , ” Orszag said .
“ That expanded coverage will generate benefits for some of those industry groups , including for hospitals . ”

Orszag said the spending cuts also could extend the solvency of the primary Medicare trust fund by seven years to 2024 .
But the effect of such changes on the healthcare industry remains unclear .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last year postulated that Medicare cuts could encourage hospitals and other providers to become more efficient .
But the office also concluded that the cuts could prompt some providers to lower the quality of the care they deliver .

What 's Good for Goldman is Bad for the Nation
We ’re attending a financial conference here in Vancouver .
Yesterday was actually the tenth anniversary of The Daily Reckoning .
A group of readers took your editor to dinner and roasted him .
He was flattered … and grateful for the attention .
But we ’re not kidding ourselves .
Readers come up to us at conferences and tell how much they enjoy reading the DR .
We wait for questions about Quantitative Easing , the Trade of the Decade , Empire of Debt or any of our other important themes .
Instead , what they want to know about is :
“ How ’s your gardener doing ?
What ’s Maria doing in Los Angeles ?
Did you ever figure out what happened to your missing cows… ? ”
Readers know what ’s important .
They want to know more about what really matters .
Still , we are foot soldiers in the lonely battle against economic claptrap ; we must march on !
Yesterday , came more evidence that the depression is over .
The Dow shot up 188 points .
From a technical point of view , if you believe that kind of thing , it looks as though the rally has farther to go .
We recall setting a target of Dow 10,000 .
Perhaps we will get there .
Oil traded at $ 67 yesterday .
Gold rose to $ 954 and bond yields on the 10 - year T - note rose to 3.7 % .
All of this sounds vaguely inflationary … and vaguely bullish .
Besides , Goldman stock is rising .
And as we all know , what ’s good for Goldman is good for the country .
Wait …we ’re kidding … right ?
Yes , we are kidding .
What ’s good for Goldman is generally bad for the country .
Goldman makes money by separating investors from their money .
Nothing wrong with that ; someone has to do it .
But the big banks are most profitable when speculation is rampant and debt is growing .
That is , when people are going further and further into debt … and speculating on rising asset prices .
We know you do n’t really prosper by borrowing and gambling .
But that does n’t make casinos unpopular , or lenders unlawful .
Bankers , like undertakers , benefit from human frailty .
At least , they benefit as long as the government bails them out .
Otherwise , they fall victim to their own human frailty .
But this is a minority opinion .
Most economists disagree with us .
And there are so many of them …if all the economists who disagreed with us were laid end - to - end … it would be a good thing .
They believe that the economy is stabilizing … and on its way back to normal .
Trouble is , ‘ normal ’ ai n’t what it used to be .
Wall Street banks are making money , ’tis true .
But they ’re not financing new businesses …or factories .
They ’re not aiding the process of capital formation nor allocating capital in ways that will result in new jobs and new industries .
Instead , they are refinancing old debts … and speculating on zombie assets .
This will not increase the real wealth of the planet .
Instead , money just changes pockets .
Which , of course , raises an interesting question ; where did all this money come from ?
If Goldman ’s pockets are fatter , whose are thinner ?
If the four biggest banks earned a combined $ 11 billion in the last quarter … who did they take the money from ?
Who ’s got that kind of money ?
Meanwhile , we found out this week that the feds have wagered an amount equal to 170 % of GDP in their attempt to bailout the world ( more below ) .
Part of that money was used to buy Wall Street out of the investments that they did n’t want .
Which ones were those ?
Well , the ones that did n’t work out .
No wonder the banks are making money .
But while the banks are making billions , cometh another report from another sector – manufacturing .
Caterpillar announced its results for the second quarter too .
Profits were down 66 % .
In other words , while the banks were making money speculating with taxpayer ’s money , Caterpillar was trying to make things and selling them to customers .
Caterpillar not only makes things ; it makes things that help other companies make things .
Things with motors … big things … things that make noise and give off exhaust … things you use to dig holes and move dirt … things you need if you ’re going to have a real economic recovery .
Unfortunately for CAT , these things are n’t selling .
So what does this tell us ?
Well … it suggests that there is no real economic recovery at all .
The real economy is suffering … sinking … and shutting down .
The banks are not earning their money helping Caterpillar expand .
They ’re making their money not because of a recovery , but because there is n’t one .
In other words , they ’re profiting from the financial stress of the early stages of a depression .
There ’s a post - crash bounce … and the government is sending a lot of money their way .
As for a real recovery – forget it .
There ’s no evidence of it .
Unemployment is getting worse .
Housing is still going down .
Profits are going down .
Those are n’t the things that presage a recovery … they herald a deeper , darker depression .
The depression darkens because people are not just being laid off – their jobs are disappearing .
They do not get called back to work .
Instead , they stay unemployed until they run out of unemployment benefits … and then the statisticians in Washington drop them off the unemployment rolls .
Currently , the first batch of those people to reach the end of their benefits came this week .
Last we looked , the Pennsylvania legislature was passing a law so they could continue drawing benefits for a few weeks more .
We ’ve mentioned John Williams and his excellent service called Shadow Government Statistics .
He looks at the numbers and figures out how they are twisted and tortured … and then figures out what they would be if they were treated properly .
Currently , the unemployment rate nationwide officially is almost 10 % .
But if you computed the unemployment numbers the way they did back in the Great Depression , Williams says one in five people are out of work .
In some places the figure is as high as one in four .
In other words , the unemployment numbers are already beginning to look like those of the Great Depression .
But that ’s true of almost all the numbers .
They ’ve all got a ’ 30s era look to them .
And if you stopped water boarding them , they ’d tell a similar story .
Almost all the indicators are worse than any we ’ve seen since WWII .
Unemployment , trade , defaults , foreclosures , bankruptcies , prices , manufacturing … you name it and you have to go back to the end of WWII to find similar numbers .
Of course , at the end of the war , the wartime economy shut down .
Millions of people who have been in uniform …or making tanks and airplanes … were suddenly out of work .
Economists thought the economy would go right back into the Great Depression .
Instead , it boomed .
Those soldiers and their families had savings .
They had pent up demand – they had n’t bought a new car in 10 years … they were young … they got married … they had children … they needed baby cribs and houses .
We remember going to look at one of the first major suburban developments as a child – Harundale – in Maryland , built by the Levitt Company .
It was a horrible place , but you could buy a house for peanuts … on credit .
And it set the pace for the suburban consumer credit expansion of the next half a century .
But what was normal for so many years is not normal any more .
Now , consumers are paying off debt faster than any time since 1952 .
The government , however , is making up for them .
Goldman may no longer be able to push more credit onto the public ; but it can push one heckuva lot of debt onto the public sector .
Wall Street firms helped households ruin themselves in the Bubble of 2003 - 2007 .
Now they ’re doing the same for the government , helping the feds raise money on a scale never seen before in human history .
As we said … no wonder they ’re making money .
Too bad .
Trailer for The Fantastic Mr. Fox .
The stop - motion film , marking Anderson 's first foray into animation , is an adaptation of Roald Dahl 's classic children 's story , centering on a clever fox who must outwit three mean , dimwitted farmers who try their hardest to hurt Mr. Fox and his family .
Clooney will voice Mr. Fox , while Blanchett voices his wife .
Fantastic Mr. Fox was the first book Wes Anderson owned .
His mom bought it for him at a book fair when he was seven years old and he has kept it ever since .
To make the voice recordings more authentic , Anderson made his cast record on location , including in a forest , in an attic , and in a cellar .
535 puppets were made for the film ; Mr. Fox has 17 different styles , each of which had to be made inn six different sizes .
His character has over 102 puppets .
Bean , one of the farmers , was created to bear a strong resemblance to Roald Dahl .
Fantastic Mr. Fox was a hit with the critics but did not fare well at the box office and was not popular with general audiences .
I was six when I first read Fantastic Mr. Fox , and I loved it from beginning to end .
To be fair , I have loved each and every one of Roald Dahl 's stories and he remains one of my favorite authors .
It should also be noted that I love and adore both George Clooney and Meryl Streep , and I always enjoy a Wes Anderson film ...
But I do not love Fantastic Mr. Fox .
Let me explain .
First of all , Dahl was a British author .
His stories are British through and through .
As you will gather from this trailer , Fantastic Mr. Fox is about the war between a fox and some farmers .
In the book , the farmers are all parodies of various British farmers that you will actually find in the countryside .
For real .
Mr. Fox and his animal friends are dapper chaps , proud of who they are , and noble , yet cunning .
This movie is American .
It does not work .
It has lost the very thing that makes this story so great .
The Americans have come in , taken a piece of classic British children 's literature , and ruined it .
Why ?
There is no need !
Steven Spielberg 's upcoming adaptation of The BFG is proof that you do n't need to Americanize a perfectly good story to make it work !
Clooney is entirely wrong for this role .
The stop - animation , while clever , is not a patch on the efforts of some other ( British ) companies , such as Aardman animations ( home of Wallace and Gromit ) .
Fantastic Mr. Fox is a movie that upsets me greatly , if you could n't already tell .
I sincerely hope that it will be remade at some point in the future , by a filmmaker of any nationality , who does n't seek to change the very essence of its story .

Home Secretary Alan Johnson has unveiled the final design of the controversial national identity card .
The card will be offered to members of the public in the Greater Manchester area from the end of this year .
Ministers plan to launch the £ 30 biometric ID card nationwide in 2011 or 2012 - but it will not be compulsory .
Opposition spokesmen said it was a " colossal waste of money " and civil liberty groups said it was " as costly to our pockets as to our privacy " .
Ministers say the card , which follows the launch of the foreign national ID card , will provide an easy way of safely proving identity .
They say this system , backed up by a national identity register , will help combat identity fraud , crime and terrorism .
How the card will look and work
The card is very similar in look to a UK driving licence but holds more data , including two fingerprints and a photograph encoded on a chip .
This chip and its unique number in turn links the card to a national identity register which , under current legislation , could hold more information about the identity of the individual .
PROPOSED TIMETABLE 2008 : Foreign National ID card launched 2009 : UK ID card offered in Greater Manchester 2010 : Scheme extended across NW England June 2010 : Last possible date for general election 2011 - 12 : Nationwide roll - out ?
If the scheme goes ahead , the card could be used as a travel document within Europe , separate to the passport , similar to arrangements between other EU member states .
Like the UK passport , the front of the card displays the royal crest as well as the thistle , the rose , the shamrock and the daffodil to represent the four parts of the UK .
The Home Office denied the union jack had been left off the card for fear of antagonising Northern Ireland 's nationalist community .
A spokeswoman said the card was based on the British passport , which did not have a flag on it .
' No brainer '
Unveiling the card , Mr Johnson said : " The introduction of ID cards today reaches another milestone , enabling the people of Manchester to prove and protect their identity in a quick , simple and secure way .
" Given the growing problem of identity fraud and the inconvenience of having to carry passports , coupled with gas bills or six months worth of bank statements to prove identity , I believe the ID card will be welcomed as an important addition to the many plastic cards that most people already carry . "
A designer piece of plastic is not going to combat identity fraud , crime or terrorism
Chris Huhne , Liberal Democrats
The Home Office has faced increasing pressure over the ID card programme in recent months .
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said the government had signed contracts worth £ 1bn before last month 's U - turn on the cards , which are no longer compulsory .
" Alan Johnson today launches a wing - and - a - prayer scheme based on the hope that people across the North West will sign up for a glossy ID card , and send a message to their counterparts in other parts of the country that the ID card is the hottest property since Susan Boyle , " said Mr Grayling .
" The government has already wasted £ 200 m that we can not afford .
" The scheme will cost hundreds of million pounds more , even if the cards are voluntary .
It is time this scheme was completely scrapped . "
And Chris Huhne of the Liberal Democrats said : " It does n't matter how fancy the packaging is when the product is a colossal waste of money that achieves nothing .
" A designer piece of plastic is not going to combat identity fraud , crime or terrorism .
This intrusive scheme should be scrapped immediately . "
But Mr Johnson said the card was a " no brainer " and that the opposition had initially supported the plans before changing their position .
Counter - campaign
Last month , the Home Office dropped plans to make the ID card compulsory for 200,000 airport workers amid widespread opposition from inside the industry that it would do nothing to improve the strict security procedures already in place .
That announcement means only some foreign nationals are currently obliged to hold a card , although the Home Office still wants to press ahead with an 18 - month trial at Manchester and London City airports .
When will the government realise there is dwindling public support for a scheme that is as costly to our pockets as to our privacy and race relations ?
Liberty No2ID , a national pressure group , is launching a counter - campaign across North - West England to derail the Home Office 's plan .
Dave Page , from the organisation , said : " Once you are on that database , you can never come off it .
" From the moment you 're registered you 'll have to tell the authorities of any change in your circumstances for the rest of your life - and pay whatever fees they ask for the ' service ' .
" You 'll never know who 's looking at your details .
It wo n't protect our safety .
It wo n't be convenient - except for Whitehall .
This scheme is an expensive and dangerous con . "
A poll of 1,731 adults across the UK , conducted by human rights campaign group Liberty , suggested six out of 10 people were unlikely to volunteer for a card .
Campaigns co-ordinator Sabina Frediani said the North West was being made an " ID card guinea pig " .
" How many times can you re-design and re-launch this tired old policy ? " she said .
" When will the government realise there is dwindling public support for a scheme that is as costly to our pockets as to our privacy and race relations ? "

The right uppercut is a very powerful and effective inside punch .
The target must be at short or medium range punch distance .
The uppercut is directed either high , towards the head under the chin , or low to the body , often in the solar plexus area .
The uppercut can be thrown effectively with either the right hand or the left hand , with the right uppercut being slightly more powerful .
To throw a right uppercut , start in the classic boxing stance with the back ( right ) knee bent .
Lower the right shoulder to drop the right side of the body in a semi-crouch position .
Remember to keep the left fist up by the chin to protect the head .
Now as you rotate the hips forward , push the ball of the back foot , ( the right foot ) , and punch the right fist up towards the target .
The right side of the back and the right shoulder will follow through with the rotation of the hips .
The hips finish being squared to the front .
The right arm always stays close to the body and moves upward in a semi-circle .
To throw the left uppercut from the classic boxing stance , start with squared off hips , left knee bent and the left shoulder lowered .
The body weight is then transferred to the ball of the left foot as the punch is delivered with a bent arm at a right angle and the hips will rotate into the classic boxing stance .
Remember when practicing this punch to stay close to the target .
If the punch is thrown from the outside , the opponent will be able to easily detect that the punch is coming and counter with an effective straight punch .
An uppercut from the outside also loses some of its power because the arm is no longer bent at the elbow and cannot effectively transfer the total bodys force in the upward movement .
To place his chief rival for the premiership in the Home Office , that graveyard of political careers , which has seen the unhappy departure from government of four out of five Labour home secretaries must have given Gordon Brown a rare moment of saturnine pleasure during the reshuffle .
But Alan Johnson will have more clout in the job than Jacqui Smith , and if Johnson is as resilient as his admirers claim , he will be able to use his short time at the Home Office to prove that he can lead the party .
So it is all to play for , but Johnson has to move quickly in several key areas .
On Monday he should announce a review of the government 's ID cards policy , an increasingly unpopular measure which is going to cost the taxpayer a minimum of £ 4.5 bn and probably cause every adult in the country irritation and substantial expense , and yet will produce none of the significant gains in security the government has claimed for the scheme .
Stepping back from ID cards will check the advances the opposition have made in this area , as well as signal a change of tone in Labour thinking ; moving away from New Labour 's emphasis on increasing the authority of the state , against the power and self determination of the individual .
Johnson should make a speech that underlines that crime has gone down overall and – apart from a recent slight rise due to the recession – remains on a downward path .
He can , without doubt , claim this as a Labour triumph , just as one former home secretary did to me the other day .
This would rebalance the Home Office 's thinking and would reduce the inflammatory power of the tabloid press .
Labour 's strategy has been to use newspapers ' obsession with crime and disorder for its own ends , resulting in the 3,500 new criminal offences and the 30 % rise in the prison population .
Johnson 's speech must tread a delicate path , for it must educate a public – which is more fearful of crime than at any time in the last 50 years – about the actual threats in our society , not the ones they read about in the Sun .
Johnson must declare that the police will not , under his stewardship at the Home Office , seek to retain DNA samples from innocent people , a practice that has been ruled illegal by the European Court of Human Rights .
He should assure us that police will end the practice of targeting young individuals who have done nothing wrong , but who have been fingered by their intelligence as likely criminals .
This is wrong .
Relations between the police and the public have deteriorated dramatically under Labour .
As a former union leader , Johnson should assert the British people 's right to assemble and protest without being photographed or harassed by aggressive police officers .
There should be a review of the stop and search quotas being enforced by most urban police forces under terror laws .
Guidance is also needed on the use of section 27 of the Violent Crimes Reduction Act .
This clause has been abused by regional police forces who have used it to stop football supporters attending games .
In the wake of recent shooting by police , Johnson should issue new regulations on the use of firearms by police and curb the deployment of Taser stun guns , recently questioned by a Scottish chief constable .
The Home Office 's suspicion of the public has in many ways come to represent the authoritarian state .
Each of the last five home secretaries has attempted to demonstrate strong , decisive leadership by moving up a couple of teeth on the ratchet .
Producing tougher laws does not make for safer or more content society ; in fact it does the opposite .
In his brief time , Johnson could interrupt the feed , back loop , and perhaps start a public discussion about the causes of crime .
It would take great courage , but we really do need a debate on the decriminalisation of drugs and the effect that this would have on society , crime figures and international crime syndicates .
Finally , he needs to address the problem of state surveillance .
Britain has become a world leader in the collection of personal data as well as a leader in security lapses .
Mass surveillance is undesirable in a free society because it places the average citizen at a disadvantage in relation to the state and creates an atmosphere of suspicion , which undermines the idea that civil servants are our servants .
The state does not need to collect 53 pieces of information from everyone who leaves or enters the country .
The state does not need access to the data from our all emails , internet connections , phone calls and text messages , certainly not a vast cost of £ 1.2 bn -£ 1.5 bn .
This scheme will not stop terrorism but it will give the state unprecedented powers to monitor such people as legitimate climate change protesters .
Mass interception of data is wrong and against the spirit of Britain 's unwritten constitution
There is much to do , but if Johnson is half the man his fans make him out to be , he could prove himself in this job and redeem so much that has gone wrong under successive Labour home secretaries .
The first job is to persuade the Home Office that it is working for the British people , not against them .
LONDON -- New calculations from the U.K.'s Department of Health suggest that , in the worst - case scenario , 63,000 people in the country could die after contracting the H1N1 flu virus in the first wave of the pandemic .
Officials said Thursday that 29 people had died thus far .
However , a health department report said a " reasonable worst case ...
One of the biggest barriers that prevents many mobile phone users from buying apps for their devices is the lack of payment options .
Blackberry is the worst with the only payment option being PayPal .
I hope they get enough from PayPal to make up for the sales missed .
Google has announced that it is adding new payment options to the Android Market for users .
A coming update will now offer support for multiple billing systems .
The biggest feature of the update is that it will allow users to buy applications and charge them to their monthly service bill .
That is a huge feature to be able to charge apps to a monthly service bill and will make it easy for everyone to purchase apps for Android devices .
The addition of direct billing by T - Mobile users can also forgo the Google Checkout signup process .

Dan Burke is sitting in the dingy office above the Velvet Underground .
It 's not his , but Burke will take a roof where he can get one .
" Do you want to see me fight The Hospitals ? " Burke asks .
Burke , 51 , is a concert booker and promoter .
He is also a drug addict with a short fuse .
In 2004 , he brought the two - piece San Francisco band The Hospitals into one of his clubs .
They showed up late .
Then , when their start time was delayed , they set up near a bathroom and began to play over the band on stage .
Burke has lived off the edge for a long time .
He 's immune to insults .
But he cannot bear to see someone else treated shabbily .
" It was so rude , what they did , " Burke says , rheumy eyes widening .
So he engaged what he calls " my full - on rock ' n ' roll psychopath thing . "
A fan taped the ensuing melee and posted it on YouTube ( warning : contains graphic content ) .
In the video , Burke first tries to grab a microphone stand .
Drummer Adam Stonehouse knocks Burke over .
Burke pops back up and starts swinging .
Back in the office , eyes locked on the screen , Burke begins to narrate .
" I 'm throwing pretty good .
See ? "
The pair trade blows .
Stonehouse runs out of steam , but Burke wants more .
As he lunges forward , the second Hospital smashes Burke over the head with his guitar .
Burke reels backward into a crowd .
" I was out on my feet .
I did n't go down though .
I 'm very proud of that . "
Burke is grinning absently .
Several of his teeth are missing .
Other nights .
Other fights .
" He kept hitting me .
I was thinking , ` Is this the bouncer ?
' Cause if not , where the f --- is he ? ' "
Burke recalls that at this point he is being dragged into the bathroom , concussed and bleeding .
" People see stars .
I was seeing a f--- ing supernova . "
The Hospitals are now whooping it up on the video .
The sonic backsplash from their instruments cuts out suddenly and the crowd can be heard .
Many of them are cheering .
" These people are f--- ing cheering and I got hit in the head that hard ? "
The fun is draining out of Burke 's voice .
Stonehouse yells out , " F - -- that old crackhead . "
More cheers and now some laughs .
Maybe he 's never seen this part before , but those laughs hit Burke like a slap .
His face drops .
He turns away from the screen and sways in place .
" That 's what life 's like today . "
Burke looks around , stunned .
" I 'm a lot at fault myself ... ( long pause ) but you 'd think somebody would have stepped in to help me .
Maybe just one guy . "
Formerly a journalist , Burke 's been fighting for more than a decade on the Toronto live - music scene .
He is feckless and untrustworthy and an admitted thief .
But he is a purist who lives harder than any of the acts he has helped thrust toward stardom .
And that makes him untouchable .
" This is a business full of people who feel aggrieved for all sorts of reasons , " says former foe and current business partner Michael Hollett , founder of the NXNE festival .
" Yet no one feels that way about Dan . "
Despite all the drugs and the booze , Burke retains the build of a boxer .
A once - handsome face is crumbling , though .
His mouth is a mess .
His blue eyes have faded to smudges .
Only a hint of the lady - killer remains .
He asks to meet at the Oak Leaf bathhouse on Bathurst at Queen West .
For $ 12 , he gets a locker and the right to stay for 24 hours .
It 's 1 p.m. Several customers are asleep on the divans spread around the room .
Burke is in the sauna doing sit-ups – his daily workout .
He 's still got swagger .
He squeezes his shoulders back and jacks out his chest – a brawler 's pose .
His voice is pebbly and he's a screamer , mainly because he 's deaf in his right ear .
" I 've gotta stay in shape , " Burke says .
" Y' know .
' Cause of all the other stuff I 'm doing to myself . "
Where does he live ?
" Downtown , " Burke says .
Downtown where ?
" No comment . "
No comment ?
" Uh , I 'll tell you later . "
Last night , he hung out in a nearby Vietnamese booze can till dawn , did a little Special K ( the hallucinogen ketamine ) .
He says he 's " under control " right now .
" Maybe next week I 'll do better , " he says .
Whatever states he 's in , he 's ready to work .
He wanders the streets taping up posters promoting the six showcases he 's got coming up at NXNE – the North by Northeast Music & Film Festival – which runs June 17 - 21 .
" It 's kind of embarrassing , putting up posters , " Burke says .
" I 'm 51 years old .
I 've interviewed CEOs , gangsters , cabinet ministers .
It 's embarrassing here in Toronto , where you are what you do . "
Toronto is the most frequent target of Burke 's scattershot rage .
He hates this city , almost compulsively .
" Toronto is world - class , " Burke says .
" But there 's a word missing there .
Third . "
The flip side of this animus is the Joycean bond he feels with his hometown , Montreal .
He left two decades ago .
He rarely goes back .
That way Montreal stays perfect .
Burke was raised in the city 's Notre - Dame - de - Grâce neighbourhood .
" He was tough , intensely loyal – classic black Irish , " says childhood friend Tony Wilson - Smith .
His father , Tim Burke , was a sports columnist at the Gazette .
He has a brother and a sister .
He 's never married or had children .
At 16 , Burke stumbled into the family business as a copy boy .
He tried journalism school , then worked his way through a few newspaper jobs .
By the mid-'80s , he was a magazine writer , specializing in crime .
" Some cop writers work it from the police angle , " says Wilson - Smith , who went on to become the editor of Maclean's .
" Dan came at it from the other side .
He was very comfortable with the thugs . "
Even as he honed his craft , Burke was already drifting away from the stability it promised .
He refused a staff job at Maclean's .
He was once invited to Ottawa to see if he could work Parliament Hill .
Burke spent six weeks in the capital .
He slept each night on the office couch .
" He would tell me he worried about becoming too conventional , " recalls Wilson - Smith .
Burke 's work caught the attention of CBC .
In 1991 , he was hired as a researcher at the fifth estate .
Using his connections in Montreal 's underworld , Burke worked on a landmark 1992 segment that traced corruption from the Irish West End Gang into the RCMP .
One of the targets of the investigation , Insp. Claude Savoie , fatally shot himself the day before the piece went to air .
" I still remember hearing that he'd done it , " Burke says .
" I started to shiver with excitement .
People ask if I felt bad .
F--- no , that was the game . "
At this point , Burke 's demons were varied .
He wanted to get it right , and could n't let it go until he did .
One former colleague says he was " a swashbuckling perfectionist .
There was an enormous capacity for frustration . "
Burke was also using drugs .
He went to work , but the daily seesaw was beginning to tilt toward his habit .
By 1994 , he was smoking crack and out of control .
In December , he stopped going to work .
His colleagues pulled him out of his apartment and checked him into a Toronto rehab clinic .
Burke left .
He was told that he would have to clean up if he wanted to keep his job .

" After that , I became a 24/7 crackhead , thief , criminal , " Burke says .
He drifted for two years , working at odd jobs , living rough and doing things " I 'd rather no longer discuss . "
By early 1997 , he 'd returned to Toronto .
He was running a scheme involving wholesale flowers .
While looking for a place to store his stock , he stumbled into a third - floor space in Chinatown .
The building 's owners were operating a pool hall overrun by hoodlums and were looking for a change .
A friend had told them that booking bands was lucrative .
They asked Burke , who had never before evinced any special interest in music , if he knew anything about the business .
And Club Shanghai was born .
Burke applied journalism principles to the new venture .
He began by calling pop critics and scouring the weeklies .
From every contact , he got two more .
Soon , he put together a show .
" I planned it for a long weekend .
I mean , long weekend , sounds great , right ?
Wrong .
Everybody leaves on a long weekend .
Disaster .
Rookie mistake . "
But he had found a new compulsion .
Whatever his troubles , Burke 's work ethic has never been anything less than Herculean .
That and his uncanny nose have made him a phenomenon .
Over 12 years , Burke has been among the first to see talent in the White Stripes , Death from Above , The Soundtrack of Our Lives , Sum 41 , The Dears and Peaches , among many other major local and international acts .
" The tragic part is that he does n't have his shit together enough to take it to the next level , " says Daniel Seligman , creative director of The Pop Montreal Music Festival .
" The bands end up at Massey Hall .
But Dan is n't following their development . "
One of the first groups Burke latched on to – his first musical crush – was a bunch of local kids called The Deadly Snakes .
Despite a 20 - year age difference , the band 's keyboardist , Max McCabe , bonded with Burke .
McCabe fed him , scolded him , tried to keep him straight .
For several months , Burke slept on a couch in McCabe 's backyard .
" He did that for a while , " says Snakes front man Andre Ethier .
" It went deep into the fall . "
At other points he slept on sofas , in a garage , in whatever workspace he could lay claim to .
A year after starting Shanghai , Burke moved up Spadina Ave. to the El Mocambo , a fading colossus leaning heavily on past glories .
" I wo n't say it was a nothing venue , but Dan turned it into a happening venue , " says Brendan Canning of Broken Social Scene .
Many of the nights Burke booked became legendary .
But Burke himself was the El Mo's in - house attraction .
He was at the centre of it every night – euphoric , high and heading over the edge .
He can't remember all the fights .
He does recall that one of them put him in a two - day coma .
Burke was always short of cash , mainly because a lot of it went up his nose .
He once tried to pay an act with stolen blue jeans .
Some got drugs .
Many got nothing at all .
" Bands of character will see that this is for a greater cause , " Burke says of payment in general .
The Deadly Snakes ' Ethier remembers watching Burke argue in the streets with several bandmates about how big a cut of the door they were owed following a show .
In frustration , Burke tore up all his cash and tossed it in the air .
" Getting paid is a byproduct of what Dan 's doing , " Ethier says .
" And he expects the same from bands . "
Burke 's professional idyll did n't last .
The El Mo was bought out and shuttered in November 2001 .
On the last night , Burke organized a blowout show .
Then he flicked his sunglasses at the new owner , was arrested and tried to kick off a brawl outside the club as he wrestled with the cops .
" You could n't close the El Mo without Dan Burke being led off in cuffs , " says record exec Richard Switzer .
Once the El Mo went down , Burke followed .
The next seven years were a narcotic blur .
He continued to work , but the rooms were n't the same .
He bounced from club to club .
" I extended myself into the outer limits of nightlife , " says Burke .
" I went on the worst losing streak . "
And he continued to pick fights .
The most successful was with NXNE .
Burke began counter - programming his own shows to compete with festival nights .
At a 2005 Christmas party , NXNE boss Hollett approached Burke and asked him " to stop working against us and start working with us . "
As quick as he is to raise his fists , Burke greeted the rapprochement with childish eagerness .
His eyes redden as he recalls Hollett 's olive branch .
" He really went out on a limb for me , " Burke says .
" I wo n't forget that . "
He means it .
Burke 's elephantine memory for small acts of kindness is as well known as his disposition to brawl .
He worked his way back up through a series of lesser venues .
Today , he 's booking four or five nights a week at the Silver Dollar Room , on Spadina , and the Velvet Underground , on Queen W .
He says he shrugged off the worst of his drug habit last year .
He 's been sober for as long as two months at a time .
The compulsive work ethic is still there .
Burke sits mesmerized behind a screen in the office , researching bands on MySpace .
" They got a lotta 18 - year - old friends , " Burke says worriedly of one act .
As a booker , he makes his money off a percentage of the bar take .
He also seems enormously weary .
Now that the buzz is wearing off , the years are setting in .
" I 'm tired of doing interesting things – all the risk , and the fear , " Burke says .
" I 've never been able to coast .
Partly due to circumstances .
Partly due to myself . "
On a nearby table is a page torn from a loose - leaf binder .
Burke has been scribbling on it – poetic observations mainly , about life and Montreal .
The line written in the largest looping letters is a quote from Pelagius .
" There is no worse death than the end of hope . "
It 's signed , Dan Burke .
A Californian man has sued Apple , accusing the company of conspiring with the Italian Mafia to track him down using his iPod .
He says they also inserted the word " herpes " into Mike Jones " Still Tippin " ( video NSFW ) .
Sounds reasonable :
The recording of death threats and other evidence , prove that APPLE INC .
conspired with the Mafia and other Defendants to manufacture , distribute , and sell illegally bugged iPods and other electronic equipment to Plaintiff [ Gregory McKenna ] to perpetuate the stalking , extortion , and torture .
All these are facts that do n't surprise me at all .
But McKenna added even more grave accusations to the lawsuit , accusing Apple of inserting the word " herpes " into Mike Jones ' Still Tippin ' :
Tippin ' on four fours , wrapped in four vogues , HERPES .
Tippin ' on four fours , wrapped in four vogues .
Tippin ' on four fours , wrapped in four vogues , AHH

Here I get a bit skeptical .
I 've reviewed the uncut video ( NSFW ) of this song again and again and again and again , but I 've yet for find the word herpes anywhere .
I mean , I kind of see where he is going with the accusation , but having gone through a full battery of tests just last week , I want to believe that all these ladies are all STD - free too , thank you very much :
But wait , there ' more , McKenna 's lawsuit also says that Apple and the Mafia threatened to kill him if he did n't become a fashion model in New York City :
We 're going to kill you if you do n't model for us in New York .
Media sources report that the modeling industry has an infamous " shadow Mafia " that forces models to work for pay after fraudulently putting them into excessive debt , coerces them into the illegal sex trade , and then disposes of them .

This is , by far , the best nutty lawsuit in the history of nutty lawsuits .
And they say lawyers can't do creative writing .

Changing priorities has seen BP move its focus away from its green branding
Environmental groups have accused BP of dropping its pledge to be green and replacing it with a commitment to be " responsible " .
The oil giant was widely recognised as the first oil company to both acknowledge and tackle climate change .
Also , its in - house carbon trading scheme - built with a little help from an unlikely ally , the US - based Environmental Defense Fund - was among the first of its kind .
However , a change of chief executive has led to an apparent change of policy .
In April , CEO Tony Hayward announced that safety was the company 's " number one priority " .
Some environmental groups saw this as an attempt to move away from " green " as a brand value , which was introduced by Mr Hayward 's predecessor , Lord Browne .
BP 's current logo ( top ) reflected the company 's move " beyond petroleum " Greenpeace said the oil giant had a lot to gain by dropping its promise to be green .
Charlie Kronick , Greenpeace 's senior climate change adviser , suggested that the pledge was the only thing holding it back from making further cuts to its green credentials .
" Now that BP is blissfully released from its pledge to invest in clean energy , it has a carte blanche to sell off its unprofitable green energy arm , " he told the BBC .
" It can get back to doing what it does best : being a 100 % fossil fuels train wreck , " Mr Kronick added .
" This is classic smoke and mirrors . "
BP denies that it is back - tracking on its commitments to climate change .
" The change represents an evolution and expansion of green as a brand value rather than a replacement , " said spokesman David Nicholas .
" The new brand value , ' Responsible ' , encompasses BP 's original aspirations towards the environment , in addition to other key areas such as safety and social welfare , " he explained .
" Our aspirations remain absolutely unchanged : no accidents , no harm to people and no damage to the environment . "
' Still committed ' Tom Woollard , a director at environmental consultancy ERM , which counts BP as one of its clients , is inclined to agree .
Lord Browne re-positioned BP as an energy , not petroleum , company " I do n't think BP has taken a step backwards on being green , " he told the BBC .
" The people I know who work at BP are still as committed as ever to upholding green values , despite the change . "
However , BP 's low - key roll - out of the new brand values does mark the end of an era .
Lord Browne 's re-branding in 2000 promised that the company would move " Beyond Petroleum " by finding cleaner ways to generate energy , and listed " performance - driven , innovative , progressive and green " as its brand attributes .
Britain 's green energy sector flourished , as Lord Browne 's shining for solar power went head - to - head with rival oil giant Shell 's investment in wind projects .
Both oil titans lavished huge quantities of money on slick green advertising campaigns .
But Rita Clifton , chief executive of brand specialists Interbrand , said high - profile promotions could be a double - edged sword .
" You can't promise in an advert what you are n't delivering on a day - to - day basis and not expect a backlash , " she told the BBC .
The company focused its attention on solar energy
And the backlash was fierce : campaigners demanded to know what exactly was green about being responsible for a massive oil spill on Alaska 's North Slope " ; investing in the extraction of oil from tar sands ( described by campaigners as " global warming 's greatest crime " ) , and spending less than 1.5 % of its budget on solar power .
BP 's environmental credentials suffered a further setback in 2008 when the company announced its intention of withdrawing financial support for a scheme that monitored mangroves next to a liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) plant it was constructing in Papua , South - East Asia .
" Withdrawal of BP 's support for the monitoring process goes against all the green rhetoric that is so prominent in BP 's public relations and marketing exercises , " campaigners at TAPOL , Down to Earth and a number of other human rights organisations wrote in a letter to BP CEO Tony Hayward .
Paul Barber , a TAPOL spokesperson , says that BP has also broken its promise to reinject the carbon dioxide which will escape into the atmosphere from the gas field .
" About 12 % of the gas field is carbon dioxide , which will now be vented directly into the atmosphere because BP has backtracked on its promise to institute carbon capture and storage at the Tangguh gas field , " Mr Barber told BBC News .
Shifting sands BP 's tone changed in 2008 when Tony Hayward , who replaced Lord Browne in 2007 , intimated that he was looking to " monetise BP's Alternative Energy Business " .
The company was unlikely to appease its fiercest critics
And BP recently pulled clean out of Britain 's green energy sector , cutting investment in renewable energy by 30 % , and cutting its solar power workforce by a quarter .
Time for a new look then ?
And if so , what ?
BP has rebranded itself as " responsible " in order to regain the trust it lost following the 2005 Texas City explosion , which killed 15 people and injured more than 170 others .
The incident was described as " one of the worst industrial accidents in the history of the US " by ERM's Tom Woollard .
It led to a record fine of more than $ 21 m by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
It also resulted to BP picking up the nickname " Big Problems " , and the episode " seriously shook BP 's bond of trust with investors " , says Rita Clifton .
Tony Hayward has worked hard to regain the public 's trust by improving the safety of BP 's operations .
In April , he announced that safety was the firm's " number one priority " .
" A new brand value is BP 's way of saying that safety is now a top priority , " Mr Woollard explained .
" It 's a promise to potential partners that another Texas City is not on the cards , " he added .
It would be easy to jeer at BP for casting off what many have always considered to be a half - heartedly green mantle .
But is it any wonder that BP is reverting to its old habits , given the scepticism with which campaigners greet the green shoots of green thinking in the senior management of oil companies ?
When confronted with the prospect of sneering green groups , it could well be that any oil company toying with the idea of experimenting with green initiatives - beyond the near term interests of their shareholders - will think twice .
And anyway , as Lord Browne outlined in a recent speech at Cardiff University , perhaps saving the world should not be left to the oil companies .
If the world could not incentivise green behaviours using good ol ' capitalism , Lord Browne noted , it had to be accomplished via legislation , if it can be done at all .

A man who stabbed his partner and friend after finding them having sex on a canal boat made a desperate attempt to save their lives , a court heard today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
William Cranston , 44 , discovered Kay Morton and Paul Wilkins in the living room of his narrowboat after hearing noises as he slept .
The Sky TV satellite engineer " lashed out " at the couple , not realising he had a six - inch kitchen knife in his hand , a jury at Reading Crown Court was told .
Cranston said his 39 - year - old partner and Mr Wilkins , 52 , collapsed to the floor , and that he only realised he had stabbed them when he saw blood .
He called an ambulance and threw the knife from the boat into the canal at Stoke Hammond , Buckinghamshire , before attempting to revive the pair with chest compressions and mouth - to - mouth resuscitation .
Neither regained consciousness .
Cranston admits manslaughter but denies murdering Ms Morton and Mr Wilkins .
He told police he and Ms Morton were still grieving the loss of their son when the incident happened in the early hours of September 7 , 2008 .
Cranston said : " We had been through a bad time this year after our son died . "
Referring to seeing his partner and friend together , he added : " To see that is just a big shock . "
The trio had been drinking with other friends at the nearby Three Locks pub the previous evening .
When they got back to the boat , they carried on drinking while Ms Morton made dinner .
Cranston went to bed between 10 pm and 11 pm , saying he felt " drunk and dizzy " , because he had to wake up early the next day to get to work in Stevenage .
He said he did not know what time it was when he awoke and entered the living room to find Mr Wilkins , a friend of more than four years , with his trousers around his ankles .

Speaking to officers hours after the stabbings , Cranston said : " I found Kay and Paul having sex on the sofa .
Paul jumped up and came towards me .
" I can't remember picking up the knife .
When he came towards me , I just sort of lashed out to find out what was going on .
" Literally five seconds later , they were both on the floor bleeding to death , and I 've got a knife in my hand .
" I do n't know what happened .
It 's just crazy . "
Cranston said he was " shocked " by the scene , and that when Mr Wilkins came towards him with his hands in the air he " digged " at him while swearing at the pair .
When Ms Morton stood up , he pushed her , making her stagger backwards and fall under a table .
Cranston , who was wearing his work clothes as he stabbed the lovers , said neither of them spoke to him , but that he believed Mr Wilkins ' raised hands gesture meant : " I 'm sorry mate . "
Describing the aftermath of the attack , he told police : " It 's all just a blur .
There was just so much blood . "
Obama ’s Justice Department Dismisses Case Against the Defense of Marriage Act ; Gay Activists are not Happy
During the campaign the president tried to play both sides of the gay marriage issue .
He claimed that he believes a marriage is between one man and one woman while at the same time promising to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) that was signed into law by President Clinton .
But now he is finding it hard to defend both positions at the same time and last week the administration filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that was filed against the Defense of Marriage Act .
This has infuriated some gay rights groups who consider this a flip - flop on one of his campaign promises .
The president made very explicit and emphatic campaign promises that he opposes DOMA and would provide leadership calling on Congress to repeal it , ” said Jennifer Pizer , marriage project director for Lambda Legal .
“ This brief is not consistent with that promise . ”
The United States Justice Department has said that DOMA is constitutional based on state ’s rights issues and as such the administration would not allow challenges to DOMA in the justice system .
Until Congress passes legislation repealing the law , the administration will continue to defend the statute when it is challenged in the justice system
The president is using stare decisis .
You remember the huge deal that was made about stare decisis in regards to abortion during the confirmation hearing of Chief Justice Roberts do n’t you ?
The left was petrified that if Roberts was confirmed as Chief Justice he would ignore stare decisis and that he would reverse Roe vs Wade .
Suddenly the left is no longer interested in stare decisis any more .
This does not mean that the president does not want to see DOMA repealed , he claims that he will support a bill to repeal the law if it is passed in congress but that is n’t good enough for the far left .
They want the court to impose their beliefs upon the rest of America .
The dismissal of this case does not go against his campaign promise to repeal DOMA .
A lawsuit is not the way to go about repealing a law .
The president will continue to try and please both sides on this issue .
He has always said that he opposes gay marriage yet he will support the repeal of DOMA .
These two positions are at odds with each other , we will not be able to hold these dueling positions for much longer .
He will have to take one position eventually and I think we know which side he will ultimately come down in favor of .
But do we ?
U.S. Department of Justice lawyers argued that the act — known informally as DOMA — is constitutional and contended that awarding federal marriage benefits to gays would infringe on the rights of taxpayers in the 30 states that specifically prohibit same - sex marriages .
If the administration truly believes the position stated above than would n’t a bill that repeals DOMA also “ infringe on the rights of the taxpayers ? ”
How could he then find a repeal of DOMA acceptable using the guideline stated above ?
The gay rights groups are not to blame for their anger at the president , nobody really knows where he stands on the issue of gay marriage because of his dueling positions during the campaign .
He was able to convince the right that he opposed gay marriage while at the same time convincing the left that he would repeal DOMA .
Both sides assumed that he was lying about the opposite position from which they held .
One side will be right , we just do n’t know which one yet .
If the president does sign a repeal of DOMA we know that he has been lying about his position on gay marriage all along .
If he refuses to sign a repeal of DOMA ( highly unlikely ) we will know that he lied about his position on that issue .
Either way there are going to be quite a few people upset with the president , this is a no win situation for him .
He should have just given us a clear position during the campaign and he would n’t be in this predicament , the American people would have voted him into office KNOWING his position , instead of seeing in him the position they wanted him to hold .
This is what happens when you try to be all things to all people .
But for now at least we have to give him just a little bit of credit for following stare decisis and for now bowing down to the extreme pressure of the far left by allowing the court create law .
( A position that seems at odds with his supreme court nominee who claims that the courts are where policy is created . )

Not listening , and not explaining the epidemic , 1989 - 2009 Informed opinion and active co-operation on the part of the public are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people .
– Constitution of the World Health Organization , 1946 [ i ]
One - way communication from health experts to the public has characterized and damaged the response to HIV in countries with generalized epidemics .
Researchers have not worked with HIV - positive adults to trace the source of their infections , and health experts have not believed HIV - positive adults who deny heterosexual risks .
From racial stereotype to hypothesis
Through the early 1990s , most AIDS experts supposed that the spread of HIV among the general population in Africa , but not in the US or Europe , was largely due to Africans having more sexual partners than Americans or Europeans .
In 1989 , one journal article described Africans as susceptible to AIDS because they are less cautious , more impulsive , less inhibited sexually , and less intelligent . [ iii ]
This unusually crude presentation resonated with widely held views of African sexual behavior .
Stillwagon attributes misunderstanding of Africa ’s AIDS epidemic to ‘ Centuries - old stereotypes that emphasize exotic and exceptional sexuality ’ in Africa . [ ii ]
As early as 1989 - 90 , surveys of sexual behavior coordinated by the Global Programme on AIDS in 12 African countries challenged stereotypes of African sexual behavior .
Findings from these surveys were ‘ totally incompatible with the view … that the HIV pandemic in Africa was fueled by extreme promiscuity …
The results from the African surveys do not portray a region with uniquely high levels of partner change . ’[ iv ]
Furthermore , these surveys showed big differences in sexual behavior from one African country to another – differences that did not correspond to differences in HIV prevalence .
In 1991 , Packard and Epstein criticized the ‘ premature closure of African AIDS research . ’[ v ] … [ A ] ssumptions about the importance of sexual promiscuity in the transmission of HIV in Africa were initially based on limited , and in some cases methodologically questionable data .
These assumptions , nonetheless , served to shape both the questions which AIDS researchers asked and the way in which they interpreted data .
This narrowing of research in turn discouraged serious consideration of the role of alternative avenues of transmission …
We are in fact much further from understanding the epidemiology of AIDS in Africa than some medical researchers , development officers , and social scientists would have us believe …

Note : Percentages of women and of HIV - positive women with 0 - 1 sex partners in the past year are calculated from published data from national surveys by subtracting the numbers of women and of HIV - positive women with two or more sex partners from totals for women .
Percentages for men are calculated in the same way .
Sources : See the Statistical Annex .
In national surveys in 20 African countries , Haiti , and the Dominican Republic during 2003 - 08 , over 90 percent of women reported 0 - 1 sexual partners in the past year , and these women accounted for 89 percent to 100 percent of HIV infections in women ( Table 7.1 ) .
Across the same 22 countries , men who reported 0 - 1 sexual partners in the past year accounted for 48 percent to 97 percent of HIV infections in men .
Similarly , surveys in Cambodia and India found little or no concentration of HIV infections in the small minority of adults reporting two or more sexual partners in the past year .
In 2006 , a prominent review of information on sexual behavior around the world reported a ‘ comparatively high prevalence of multiple partnerships in developed countries , compared with parts of the world with far higher rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV , such as African countries …’[ vi ]
Nevertheless , some experts have continued to argue that distinctive patterns of heterosexual behavior have been responsible for Africa ’s ferocious AIDS epidemics .
In recent years , the most common formulation of this argument has been that Africans have more concurrent partners ( more than one ongoing relationship ) .
For example , a book published in 2007 , relying on data selected from surveys in several countries during 1989 - 90 , generalized that ‘ From 20 % to 40 % of sexually active adults ( both males and females ) in many SSA [ sub- Saharan African ] populations ’ have ‘ unprotected sex with multiple and concurrent sex partners .’[ vii ]
Clearly , diverse views of African sexual behavior have survived findings from years of research , and continue to influence experts ’ explanations of Africa ’s HIV epidemics .
Unethical research : exposing and disrespecting participants
From the late 1980s and continuing into the 21st century , prominent research projects intended to study HIV transmission risks and HIV - related disease tested and followed HIV - positive and HIV - negative Africans without telling them the results of their HIV tests .
Researchers watched adults who did not know they were HIV - positive infect unsuspecting spouses , watched them sicken and die , watched HIV - positive women birth and infect children , and watched the children die .
Testing and not telling not only exposed research participants to unnecessary risk , but also showed disrespect for their ability to help researchers to identify risks .
Researchers who did not tell Africans they were infected were not able to work with them to trace the source of their infections .
Thus , testing and not telling not only kept Africans in the dark about their HIV infections , but also kept researchers in the dark about the factors that made Africa ’s HIV epidemics the worst in the world .
In such projects , researchers have characteristically offered participants a free additional HIV test with counseling at a nearby clinic .
Many participants did not go for additional tests .
From this , the researchers ’ defense for following people who did not know they were HIV - positive has been that they did not want to know .
But there is another way to approach the issue .
If someone does not want to receive the results of their HIV test , the researcher can refuse to enroll them in the study .
In 1988 , the US Office for Protection from Research Risks established a policy that ‘ Individuals may not be given the option “ not to know ” the result , either at the time of consenting to be tested or thereafter .’[ viii ]
One project that followed that policy in Kigali , Rwanda , from 1988 had no problem enrolling pregnant women in research : ‘… all but a handful of women wanted to know their test results and many requested that HIV testing and counseling be provided to their spouses as well .’[ ix ]
However , the US policy allowed exceptions .
From 1989 , researchers funded by the US government began a large study in Rakai , Uganda , testing and enrolling men and women without insisting they learn their HIV status .
The study followed and retested thousands of adults , and continued at least into 2006 .
During 1994 - 98 , the Rakai project followed hundreds of discordant couples .
In a large sub - sample of these couples , just over half the HIV - positive partners ‘ had requested and received HIV counseling , … 25 % stated that they had informed their partners , ’ and ‘ Condom use was low … ’ [ x ]
With many partners in discordant couples not knowing that they or their spouses were infected , the project observed 50 incident infections in men and 40 in women with HIV - positive partners . [ xi ]
Similarly , a project in Mwanza , Tanzania , during 1991 - 94 observed six incident infections in men and women with HIV - positive partners .
The study team noted : [ xii ]
In most prospective studies , intensive counseling of discordant couples has resulted in the adoption of safer sexual practices , and this has limited their capacity to examine risk factors and transmission rates .
In the Mwanza study …cohort members were only informed of their HIV status if they accessed a parallel voluntary counseling and testing service .
Only a small number of participants pursued this service .
During 1997 - 2000 , the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies ( ZVITAMBO ) study tested and followed over 4,400 HIV - positive women and their newborn children , observing HIV infections and deaths in the children .[ xiii ]
As the study was designed , [ xiv ]
Mothers could learn their [ HIV test ] results at any time during the study ... , but they were not required to do so .
This feature makes ZVITAMBO unique .
All other studies of infant feeding and HIV have been conducted among mothers who knew their HIV status .

Less than 20 percent of women chose to learn their HIV status .
Ninety - two percent of HIV - positive mothers were still breastfeeding at one year .[ xviii ]
With prolonged breastfeeding , the project observed 64 incident infections in children between the ages of 12 and 24 months .
If the project had told women they were HIV - positive and might infect their children , could the women have managed replacement feeding , or at least weaned children after 6 months ?
These were urban women , in one of the wealthier countries in Africa .
More than 80 percent of the women and more than 90 percent of their husbands had received at least 8 years of education .
Rich country governments and other prominent organizations funded these projects ( Table 7.2 ) , and institutional review boards approved them .
Even so , these and other similar projects in Africa compare unfavorably to the widely criticized Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male .
From 1932 to 1972 , the Tuskegee Study followed African - American men with syphilis , watching them sicken and die without treating their syphilis .
The men had tertiary syphilis , so they could not transmit to others , but they suffered heart disease , dementia , and other health damage .
Participants in HIV research in Africa who did not know they were HIV - positive not only sickened and died but also passed HIV to spouses and children .
Despite the Nuremberg Code , [ xix ] the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki , [ xx ] and other documents that provide ethical guidelines for medical research , it is a continuing challenge to recognize and to stop unethical research , particularly in Africa .
Disbelieving people who deny sexual exposures
Another manifestation of researchers and other AIDS experts devaluing and disrespecting people living with HIV , and what they have to teach others about the epidemic , is the common practice among AIDS experts of disbelieving HIV - positive people who deny sexual exposures to HIV .
From the 1980s , substantial numbers of HIV - positive men and women in countries with generalized epidemics have reported never having penetrative sex .
In a national survey of women aged 15 - 19 years in Zimbabwe during 2001 - 02 , 41 percent of 192 women who were HIV - positive reported having no sex partners ever .[ xxi ]
South Africa ’s 2005 national survey found 4.3 percent HIV prevalence and ( using special blood tests to differentiate new from old infections ) a rate of incidence of 1.5 percent per year among adults who reported no sexual partners ever .[ xxii ]
In national surveys in 24 countries with generalized epidemics during 2003 - 08 , HIV prevalence ranged from 0 percent to 5.2 percent in women who claimed to be virgins , and from 0 percent to 3.7 percent in men who claimed to be virgins ( Table 7.3 ) .
In addition , many studies in Africa have found HIV prevalence or incidence in adults who are not virgins , but who report no possible sexual exposure to HIV .
For example , a study in Zimbabwe during 1999 - 2003 followed more than 1,000 initially HIV - negative women .
After three years , another round of HIV tests found 48 women with new infections .
Twelve of these 48 women reported no sexual partners after their last HIV - negative test .
Surprisingly , women reporting no sexual partners acquired HIV faster than women who reported one or more sex partners ( 1.6 percent vs. 1.2 percent per year ) .[ xxiii ]
South Africa ’s 2005 national survey found the same rate of HIV incidence – 2.4 percent per year – in non-virgin adults who reported no sex partners in the past 12 months as in adults who reported one or more sex partners in that period .[ xxiv ]
Many researchers and other AIDS experts have routinely interpreted HIV infections in Africans who deny sexual exposures as evidence that they have misreported their sexual behavior . [ xxv ]
There is no doubt that people often lie and sometimes forget , and it is good science to question evidence .
However , it is not good science to reject unwelcome evidence for 20 years without doing what is necessary to collect ‘ solid ’ evidence that one trusts to test an hypothesis .

Examples of incomplete research with unreliable conclusions
As described in previous sections , researchers have often not told research participants that they are infected , and so have not been able to work with them to trace the source of their infections .
Researchers have also routinely disbelieved participants who deny sexual exposures , and they have seldom asked about blood exposures .
Here are several examples of research designed and implemented in ways that deny and ignore information on risks for HIV infection .
Example of faulty research among African women A study in Rakai , Uganda , during 1994 - 99 , observed much higher HIV incidence in unmarried pregnant women ( 9.9 percent per year ) than in married pregnant women ( 1.6 percent per year ) or in non-pregnant unmarried or married women ( 1.6 percent and 1.0 percent per year , respectively ) .
[ xxvi ]
Even though high incidence was strikingly concentrated in unmarried pregnant women , the study team proposed that hormonal changes during pregnancy increased women ’s susceptibility to acquire HIV from sexual partners .
This hypothesis did not agree with reported evidence .
Notably , among the subset of women whose partners were known to be HIV - positive , pregnant women acquired HIV infection less than twice as fast as non-pregnant women .
Furthermore , all pregnant women , married and unmarried , who acquired HIV infection reported no sexual partner other than the fetus ’ father in the past year .
The study did not consider that unmarried pregnant women were more likely to seek abortions than married pregnant women , and to contract HIV during abortions .
( Similarly , women who knew their husbands were HIV - positive might also seek abortions . )
Ignoring risks from abortions , the study team did not report available information on pregnancy loss , [ xxvii ] which they could have used to test this hypothesis .
This alternate hypothesis has obvious implications for HIV prevention .
Moreover , the study did not tell women their HIV status , and so did not benefit from their views about how they might have been infected , and did not work with them to trace the source of their infections .
Example of faulty research among African men During 2002 - 06 , three studies – in South Africa , [ xxviii ] Uganda , [ xxix ] and Kenya [ xxx ] – solicited men wanting to be circumcised , then on a random basis circumcised some men first , but told others to wait .
Following and retesting the men , the studies observed that circumcised men acquired HIV infection only 24 - 45 percent as fast as uncircumcised men .
All three study teams concluded that lower HIV incidence in circumcised men was due to less sexual acquisition of HIV .
That may be so .
But to reach that conclusion , the study teams rejected what the men reported about their sexual behavior and ignored information about non-sexual risks .
Consider a basic question :
What percentage of the incident infections in men in these three studies were acquired from sexual partners ?
In the South African trial , 23 ( of 69 ) infections occurred in men who reported no unprotected sex during the relevant observation interval ( the time from their last negative test to their first positive test ) .
Similarly , in Uganda , 16 ( of 67 ) infections occurred in men who reported no sex partners ( 6 infections ) or 100 percent condom use ( 10 infections ) .
The trial in Kenya did not report how sexual exposures related to HIV incidence – except for seven men infected in the first three months ( sensitive tests did not find HIV in the men ’s blood at the beginning of the trial ) .
Five of the seven men , including three of four who had been circumcised , reported no sexual exposures from the beginning of the trial until their first HIV - positive test .
If men with no sexual exposures acquired HIV from non-sexual risks , this no doubt occurred for some of the men with sexual exposures as well .
Thus , if one accepts the men ’s reported sexual behavior , standard epidemiological analyses ( see notes to Table 8.1 ) suggest that a majority of their infections came from non-sexual risks .
If the studies had been done correctly , and had traced sexual partners , that would settle the matter .
However , that was not done .
Although two of the three studies ( in Kenya and Uganda ) told men their HIV status , neither of these studies worked with men with incident infections to see if their sexual partners were the source of their infections .
Considering how few partners were involved in the Ugandan study – men reported more than one sexual partner during less than a third of the observation intervals , and 47 percent of the men were married – tracing and testing most of the men ’s partners would appear to have been feasible .
The South African study team was the only one that estimated HIV transmission per sexual exposure to HIV .
Because the study team did not trace and test the men ’s partners , the estimate was based on a model which assumed that some percentage of their sexual partners were HIV - positive .
This approach produced some surprising ( and unreliable ) results : for example , that condom use decreased HIV transmission per event by 10 percent only , while circumcision decreased it by 75 percent .[ xxxi ]
What about non-sexual risks ?
In the South African trial , men who reported an injection , blood transfusion , and / or hospitalization were 1.7 times more likely to become HIV - positive than men who did not report these risks .
This was the only one of the three trials to report blood exposures during follow - up .
Two studies reported that 30 - 43 percent of HIV infections occurred during intervals when men reported genital ulcers or other genital symptoms or problems , but neither study reported the associated skin- piercing tests and treatments .
In the Kenyan trial , circumcision might have infected four men whose infections were recognized one month later , but the study did not mention that possibility .
These studies , with their ignored evidence ( on sexual exposures ) and missing evidence ( on blood exposures and on HIV status of sexual partners ) , launched programs to circumcise millions of African men .
These programs may alleviate HIV epidemics , although information on HIV prevalence in circumcised and uncircumcised men from national surveys in 13 African countries ( see Table 7.4 ) suggests otherwise .
If one believes what the men reported about their sexual behavior , a lot of their infections came from blood exposures .
If so , programs to circumcise millions of men should be carried out with extreme caution , and ( other ) important initiatives to cut HIV incidence are to warn men about blood exposures , and to improve infection control in hospitals and clinics .
Failing to identify sexual factors responsible for generalized HIV epidemics
If heterosexual coitus accounts for most HIV infections in generalized epidemics , what factor or factors allow HIV to transmit so much more extensively through heterosexual sex in generalized vs. concentrated epidemics ?
From studies of discordant couples in the US , Europe , and Africa , widely quoted estimates of transmission per coital act range from 0.05 percent to 0.11 percent , or once every 900 to 2,000 events.[ xxxii ]
Similarly , most studies of HIV transmission between discordant couples – even when couples are not aware that one partner is HIV - positive – report that not more than 10 percent of the HIV - negative spouses contract HIV from their husbands or wives during a year .[ xxxiii ]
With observed low rates of transmission between spouses , how could sexual transmission create generalized epidemics , especially the terrible epidemics found in Southern Africa and in many cities in East and Central Africa ?
The first idea , that Africans were outrageously promiscuous , fell to evidence in the early 1990s .
Over the ensuing fifteen years , a host of other hypotheses supposed that one or more sex-related factors accelerate sexual transmission enough to create generalized epidemics .
Although many behaviors or physical conditions are personal risks to acquire or to transmit HIV through sex , studies have been unable to show that these factors explain differences in HIV prevalence between Africa and Europe , or across African countries .
For example , having a genital ulcer is a personal risk – people are more likely to acquire HIV infection from sexual partners if either has a genital ulcer than if neither does .
However , studies across Africa have found that communities in which more people have genital ulcers , gonorrhea , herpes simplex virus type 2 ( genital herpes ) , or other sexually transmitted diseases do not consistently have greater HIV prevalence or incidence than communities in which fewer people have these conditions .[ xxxiv ]
Similarly , some experts aver that higher HIV prevalence in Africa is due to Africans having more concurrent ( overlapping ) sexual partners than people in other continents .[ xxxv ]
Having two ongoing sexual partnerships may be a personal risk to acquire and to transmit HIV .
However , African communities in which more people have concurrent partners do not consistently have higher HIV prevalence than other African communities . [ xxxvi ]

These percentages are calculated from published data by subtracting data for men aged 15 - 19 years from data for all men .
Depending on the country , data are for men aged 20 to 49 , 54 , or 59 years .
The table includes all countries for which relevant data are available from published national surveys .
Sources : See the Statistical Annex .
From the late 1980s and continuing , some people have argued that lack of male circumcision – which may be a personal risk for men to acquire HIV infection – explains high HIV prevalence in some African communities .[ xxxvii ]
A lot of evidence is inconsistent with this hypothesis ( see Table 7.4 ) .
For example , Rwanda , with only 10 percent of men circumcised , has only 3 percent HIV prevalence in adults , and saw little epidemic growth from 1986 to 2005 .
Over the same period , adult HIV prevalence in Lesotho , with 59 percent of men circumcised , increased from 0 percent to 24 percent .
Although most men in India , China , and Western Europe are uncircumcised , their HIV prevalence – even including MSMs and IDUs – is less than 0.5 percent .
Finally , in 5 of 13 African countries with data from national surveys , HIV prevalence was higher in circumcised than in uncircumcised men ( see Table 7.4 ) .
Considering the often 100 - fold difference between HIV prevalence in non-IDU and non-MSM adults in generalized compared to concentrated epidemics , if sexual factors account for those differences , they should not be so hard to find .
Money for research has not been a problem , nor has access to Africans willing to participate in research .
From the mid-1980s to 2009 , researchers looking for the risks that cause Africa ’s HIV epidemics have followed tens of thousands of HIV - negative Africans for periods ranging from less than a year to more than 15 years , and have observed thousands of incident infections .
Even so , researchers have been unable to identify sexual behaviors or conditions which distinguish African countries with the worst HIV epidemics from other African countries or from European countries with concentrated epidemics .
Poor research methods -- notably , not working with research participants to trace the source of their infections -- have undermined efforts to explain generalized epidemics .
Failing to explain high HIV prevalence in women
In countries and communities with the worst generalized epidemics , HIV prevalence increases from low levels in women aged 15 years to reach a maximum in women in their late 20s to late 30s ( Figure 7.1 ) .
In young women , high rates of HIV incidence boost HIV prevalence .
However , high rates of incidence are also required to maintain high HIV prevalence in women aged over 25 years .
Figure 7.1 : HIV prevalence in women by age in Southern Africa Sources : See the Statistical Annex .
Consider what happens to women in Lesotho , where a national survey found HIV prevalence over 40 percent for women aged 25 to 39 years .
Without treatment , approximately 4 percent of Lesothan women aged 25 to 39 years die of AIDS each year ( calculating 10 percent annual mortality among the 40 percent who are HIV - positive ) .
To maintain 40 percent prevalence , another 4 percent of women ( or 7 percent of the 60 percent who are HIV - negative ) must be newly infected each year .
In other words , approximately 7 percent of susceptible ( HIV - negative ) women aged 25 to 39 years acquire HIV infections each year – a rate that may well be higher than for younger women .
In short , women in the worst generalized epidemics acquire HIV infections at high rates from their late teens at least through their 30s .
Moreover , appreciable levels of HIV prevalence – and incidence – continue in older women.[xxxviii ]
A recent study in Gondar , Ethiopia , found 4.7 percent HIV prevalence among women aged 50 to more than 70 years , including two HIV - positive women aged 70 years who had been widowed for 11 years .[ xxxix ]
HIV prevalence in older women in this study exceeded the 1.9 percent prevalence for women aged 15 to 49 years in Ethiopia ’s 2005 national survey .
Because there are a lot of HIV - positive men in generalized epidemics , many women acquire HIV from sexual partners .
But sex is not necessarily the whole story .
Limited sexual risks in young women Women ’s sexual risks vary over their lifetime .
Before they are married , women are at risk from casual partners , some of whom may become spouses or cohabiting partners .
In the worst generalized epidemics , young women who report few sexual partners are nevertheless at high risk for infection .
For example , in Carletonville , South Africa , in 1999 , sexually active women aged 16 - 18 years reported an average of 1.7 sexual partners in their life ( almost all casual ) , and few sexual contacts per partnership – yet 21 percent were HIV - positive . [ xl ]
Similarly , in Kisumu , Kenya , in 1997 - 98 , 20 percent of unmarried women less than 20 years old who reported only one lifetime sexual partner were HIV - positive .[ xli ]
Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the limited sexual activity reported by young women in many African communities could account for their observed high rates of HIV prevalence .
One is that women have sex with older men , who are more likely to be HIV - positive than younger men .
Another is that younger vs. older women have much greater biological susceptibility to sexual acquisition of HIV .
None of these hypotheses has been rigorously tested by tracing casual partners that are alleged to infect young women .
Also , the challenge to understand generalized epidemics is to explain high incidence in women at least through their 30s , not only in young women .
Limited sexual risks in older women Between the ages of 25 and 49 years , most women in Africa and in other countries with generalized epidemics are married , and most married women report no non-spousal partners .
Nevertheless , in 14 of 24 countries with generalized epidemics and with available data from national surveys , more than half of HIV - positive married women aged 15 to 49 years had HIV - negative husbands ( Table 7.5 ) .
Because HIV transmission can go both ways , some women with HIV - positive husbands no doubt infected their husbands , rather than the other way around .
Furthermore , even when both partners are HIV - positive , wives and husbands may have acquired their infections from different outside sources .
Studies in Uganda and Zambia that sequenced HIV from couples in which both partners were HIV - positive found dissimilar HIV and therefore unlinked infections in 9 percent and 13 percent of couples , respectively .
And a study in Malawi found that as many as 33 percent of concordant HIV - positive couples had dissimilar HIV and possibly unlinked infections .[ xlii ]

A recent World Bank paper interprets the high proportion of HIV - positive wives with HIV - negative husbands in national surveys in Africa as evidence that ‘ extramarital sexual activity among cohabiting women … is a substantial source of vulnerability to HIV , ’ and that ‘ self - reported sexual behaviors are not very reliable .’[ xliii ]
Some women no doubt misreport the number of their sexual partners .
But to simply assume and assert that HIV - positive women with HIV - negative partners acquired their infections from extramarital liaisons and then lied about it is not only bad science , but also dangerous for women .
What the World Bank has done in publishing such unsupported allegations is equivalent to the town gossip and troublemaker telling husbands – without evidence – that their wives are fooling around .
Both the popular and the scholarly AIDS literature are full of anecdotes of philandering HIV - positive husbands , poverty - driven sex work , and sugar - daddies .
But these anecdotes do not describe the reality for most HIV - positive women in generalized epidemics .
The ‘ average ’ HIV - positive woman has had few pre-marital partners and few or no extra-marital partners , has had a sufficiently high social status that she was not driven to trade sex for favors , and has – often – an HIV - negative husband .
What ’s missing ?
From hypothesis to stigma
In 1987 , Jonathan Mann distinguished three epidemics related to HIV .
The first was the spread of HIV infection .
The second was the spread of AIDS disease in persons infected with HIV .
The third epidemic was the ‘ denial , blame , stigmatization , prejudice and discrimination which the fear of AIDS brings out in individuals and societies .’[ xliv ]
In Africa and later in other countries with generalized epidemics , HIV prevention messages that attributed almost all HIV infections in adults to sex – messages which grew out of the hypothesis that African promiscuity caused generalized epidemics – spread this third epidemic .
Such messages ‘ educated ’ the public to see HIV infection as a sign – stigma – of sexual promiscuity .
In effect , these HIV prevention messages translated racial stereotypes of sexual behavior into stigma against HIV - positive men and women .
Stigma and limited testing obstruct public knowledge of the epidemic Until well into the 1990s , the AIDS epidemic was invisible to most Africans .
In the late 1980s , less than 1 percent of adults were HIV - positive in most communities .
Thus , even in communities where HIV prevalence soared over 10 percent in the 1990s , annual deaths from AIDS often did not reach 1 in 100 adults until the early 21st century .
Besides , many AIDS - related deaths could be attributed to other causes .
During the 1990s , testing to tell people if they were or were not HIV - positive was not a priority in international AIDS programs .
When an article in Lancet proposed home - based testing to make it easier for people in developing countries to learn their HIV status , [ xlv ]
WHO ’s experts objected , arguing that there was no evidence telling people their HIV status would reduce transmission , and that no care was available , so ‘ the only promise offered here is the potential rejection of the HIV - positive person .’[ xlvi ]
During the 1990s , getting an HIV test was onerous and / or expensive for most Africans .
In a review of HIV testing services in 21 African countries in 2001 , only seven countries reported more than 20 government testing sites , and only five reported any testing in the private sector .[ xlvii ]
As of 2000 , Piot , the executive director of UNAIDS , estimated that only 5 percent of HIV - positive people in developing countries were aware of their infection , and judged that ‘ In Africa there is basically only one country where access to testing and counselling is reasonable , and that is Uganda .’[ xlviii ]
For people in generalized epidemics , the best information they had during the 1990s that HIV was spreading through their communities were reports from sentinel surveys that tested pregnant women in antenatal clinics .
But because these surveys disconnected blood samples from names before testing for HIV , no one knew who was infected .
Thus , even as governments reported HIV prevalence soaring among women at antenatal clinics , people looked at their own and their spouses ’ sexual behavior , and supposed that others – sex workers , clients , bad people – were the ones who were infected .
For example , in a 2000 - 01 study among Zambian women who did not know their HIV status , more than half the women who were HIV - positive considered themselves to be at no or low risk for HIV infection . [ xlix ]
The belief that sexual exposures accounted for most HIV infections and the stigma that linked HIV to sexual misbehavior were mutually reinforcing .
People who had no sexual risks were unlikely to seek HIV tests .
Most people who found themselves to be HIV - positive – with or without sexual risks – tried to hide their infections .
However , people with recognized sexual risks , such as sex workers and widows of men who had died from AIDS , were less able to do so .
Public awareness of AIDS in people with recognized sexual risks supported the view that all HIV came from sex .
Even for counselors and doctors who saw and interviewed HIV - positive people , the belief that HIV infection in adults was a sign of sexual behavior often limited what they could see .
For example , doctors and counselors interviewed during a study in India in 2005 explained , ‘ Men are like that , they go out and then come home and infect their wives ; how can we believe when they tell us that they have not had sex outside marriage ? ’ and ‘ He is a truck driver , what can you expect ? ’[ l ]
Misinformation drives stigma Discrimination against HIV - positive people is due in part to mistaken fears that the disease may spread through casual contact – such as sharing eating utensils – and in part to aversion to serious illness from any cause .
But an important contributor to discrimination is the belief that almost all HIV infections in adults in countries with generalized epidemics come from sex .
Of course , people must be warned about sexual risks – the problem was the lack of attention to other risks , including especially risks in ‘ virtuous ’ behaviors such as seeking healthcare or dental care .
Because so few people knew they were infected , and because stigma discouraged even those few from talking about their condition , the public knew very little about what was happening from personal experience .
Even after tens of millions had been infected , and millions had died , the public ’s ideas about the presence of AIDS in their communities , and of how HIV was spreading , depended almost entirely on what public health authorities told them .
In this situation , if health authorities did not , either deliberately or inadvertently , provide full and accurate information , what people believed about HIV could wander far from reality .
Many organizations have tried to fight stigma by encouraging people not to be so critical of those who are promiscuous , which is both controversial and difficult .
Another more effective and accurate way to defuse stigma is to repeatedly and persistently draw attention to children and adults with HIV from unsafe healthcare , and to warn people about such risks .
In this way , people will come to see that an HIV infection is not a reliable sign of sexual exposure to HIV .
Some AIDS experts have obstructed such messages , arguing that public discussion of iatrogenic transmission will ‘ detract from prevention efforts aimed at reducing the sexual transmission of HIV ’ [ li ] and lead to ‘ behavioral disinhibition . ’[ lii ]
These arguments reflect negative perceptions of peoples ’ intelligence and sexual behavior – that they cannot keep two risks in mind at the same time , and that they will use any excuse to be sexually promiscuous without condoms .
For health experts , these arguments are also a self - serving excuse not to acknowledge nosocomial infections , and thereby to violate medical ethics by not warning people about risks in health care ( see Chapter 9 ) .
Extending a metaphor AIDS experts in Africa have been like traffic safety experts who persistently analyze accidents with the limiting assumption that all traffic on a two - way street comes exclusively from one direction .
After decades , such traffic safety experts are still arguing and hypothesizing about why some intersections are many times more dangerous than others , and are still refusing to take a good look at how much traffic might be coming from the other direction .
Single - minded attention to sex in HIV research contributes to single - minded attention to sex in HIV prevention messages .
These messages – supported by billions of dollars in foreign aid – promote the stigmatizing assumption that an adult ’s HIV infection is a reliable sign of sexual exposure . [ i ]

TORONTO ( Fortune ) --
Ask most wine hounds and sommeliers on either side of the Atlantic where the best chardonnay originates , and the answer will almost certainly be California or France .
But that may soon change , thanks to a blind tasting billed as the Judgment of Montreal .
Bragging rights for making the world 's best chardonnay now belong to Le Clos Jordanne , a small winery in the Niagara region of Canada , whose 2005 Claystone Terrace -- at $ 33.75 per bottle -- recently upset pedigree rivals from Napa and Burgundy previously considered unbeatable .
The result may redraw the global wine map , just as the Judgment of Paris did 33 years earlier .
At that storied showdown between France and the United States , the host country 's top palettes awarded the blue ribbon in a blind test of two categories -- cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay -- to Californian upstarts .
It was a verdict heard around the world , debunking the myth that Old World wines were superior to their New World counterparts .
French wine snobs and winemakers went ballistic , accusing the judges of betraying their country and criticizing the outcome as statistically meaningless .
But their case of sour grapes did n't stop the California wine industry :
The victory in Paris helped galvanize the loose alliance of wineries into a global powerhouse on par with France , Italy , and Spain .
Will the Judgment of Montreal have similar consequences for Canada -- a country better known for hockey , maple syrup , and oil from the Alberta tar sands ?
The Niagara Peninsula does n't have the scale to steamroll its competition -- it 's about one - tenth the size of Napa -- but there is plenty of room for growth .
And its recent high - profile success offers a rare opportunity to build brand recognition at home and abroad .
" I think we won in Montreal because of our unique terroir , " says Thomas Bachelder , winemaker at Clos Jordanne , referring to the clay - and limestone - rich soil of the Niagara Peninsula that gives the winery 's chardonnays their tricky mid-Atlantic character .
" It did n't offend any of the judges . "
The Judgment of Montreal was organized by the Soci�t� des alcools du Qu�bec , a provincially - owned alcohol retailer with more than $ 2 billion in annual sales .
It invited Quebec 's top wine writers and sommeliers , who tend to favor Old World wines , to revisit the historic Judgment of Paris .
But there was one important difference :
In addition to the French and American contenders , pirate wines -- from Canada , Australia , and New Zealand , in the case of the chardonnay category -- were also snuck into the blind tasting .
The resulting Canadian victory -- and less surprisingly , Australia 's third - place finish ( Rosemount Estate Roxburgh , $ 39.80 ) -- was another New World upset .
For the clubby wine world , the decision was tantamount to Belgium defeating the United States in baseball .
( In the cabernet sauvignon category , the top three spots all went to Bordeaux , France . )
" This means Canadian wines have to be taken seriously , " says Steven Spurrier , organizer of the Judgment of Paris in 1976 , from his home in London .
Spurrier , who is 68 , has revisited his original tasting several times over the years in New York , Napa , and London -- notably on the judgment 's 10th and 30th anniversaries .
The results have been much the same as the first installment , which Spurrier organized on a whim when he owned a wine shop in Paris as a young man .
( He had no idea it would make history , but a Time magazine correspondent -- the only reporter who bothered to attend the tasting at Paris 's Inter - Continental Hotel -- insured that it did . )
Spurrier is familiar with the Niagara Peninsula , and describes the Claystone Terrace chardonnay as " a very European version of a Canadian wine . "
That may be mixed praise from the elder statesman of wine , but winemaker Bachelder is n't likely to take offense .
The Canadian trained in Burgundy for years and retains close ties to what is arguably France 's top wine region .
But it 's Canada he 's celebrating now : " Sometimes we 're slow to react to our own success in Canada , " says Bachelder , a bearish viticulturist with a 6 - foot - 5 frame .
" I hope that does n't happen this time . "
Clos Jordanne , which has 75 acres under cultivation , is owned by Constellation Brands Inc. ( STZ ) of Victor , N.Y. , the world 's largest wine company with operations in more than 150 countries and annual revenue of $ 3.8 billion .
( It acquired the Niagara winery in its takeover of Vincor Canada in 2006 . )
" I wish Constellation would focus on wines of Clos Jordanne 's quality , " says Larry Paterson of the Ontario Viniculture Association , which represents 60 percent of the province 's wineries , referring to the wine giant 's tendency to focus on mass - market brands .
That could take a while -- if it happens at all -- but in the meantime , Clos Jordanne 's U.S. parent may have a more pressing task : Capitalizing on its newfound Canadian star power .
The first remake of the paranoid infiltration classic moves the setting for the invasion from a small town to the city of San Fransisco and starts as Matthew Bennell notices that several of his friends are complaining that their close relatives are in some way different .
When questioned later they themselves seem changed as they deny everything or make lame excuses .
As the invaders increase in number they become more open and Bennell , who has by now witnessed an attempted " replacement " realises that he and his friends must escape or suffer the same fate .
But who can he trust to help him and who has already been snatched ?

Iran 's supreme leader 's second son , Mojtaba Khamenei , has emerged as one of the driving forces behind the ­government 's crackdown , diplomats and observers said .
Mojtaba is an ally of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the disputed president , and was credited with winning his father 's endorsement for the then Tehran mayor in the 2005 elections , leading to Ahmadinejad 's shock second round victory .
Mojtaba is an austere figure , ­generally seen as more hardline than his father and has become a gatekeeper for access to the beit - e- rahbari , the supreme leader 's home , and the supreme leader himself .
According to some Iran analysts , Khamenei , 70 , is manoeuvring to position his son as his successor .
Formally , the position is supposed to be awarded by the assembly of experts , an elected group of clerics led by the most powerful rival to Khamenei and Ahmadinejad , Hashemi Rafsanjani .
But the first supreme leader , ­Ruhollah Khomeini , had a powerful say on who his successor should be .
Khamenei has been increasingly described in the official media as the " Ali of our times " , a reference to Ali , the Shia imam who passed on the position to his son Hassan .
" There has been a lot of talk lately that this is all about Mojtaba and the succession , " said Ali Ansari , an Iran analyst at St Andrews University .
" He may be securing the position for the long term , and protecting it .
The argument is that he is protecting his future . "
It is 40 years since the words , ' The Eagle has landed , ' sent a thrill around the world .
The Apollo moon missions were to herald a new dawn of space exploration , of lunar bases , manned missions to Mars , and more .
But in the decades since - and after the Shuttle disasters - America 's appetite for interplanetary flight dwindled .
The moon landings marked not the beginning , but the end , of our space dreams
It was the most audacious act of exploration ever carried out by a human being .
On 21 July , 1969 , astronaut Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface to become the first person in history to set foot on another world .
A quarter of a million miles away , in downtown bars , in neighbours ' homes , in village halls and in gathering places across the planet , men , women and children watched the world 's greatest TV spectacle unfold .
Grainy , black - and - white images showed the astronaut clamber outside the Eagle , Apollo 11 's lunar lander ; drop on to the soil of the Sea of Tranquillity ; and tell Earth that he had just taken " one small step for man ; one giant leap for mankind . "
Those words have become the most widely known botched phrase in modern times .
Armstrong - in missing out the indefinite article before " man " - made a tautological mess of his historic pronouncement , an understandable error given what must have been on his mind .
Over the following few hours , the astronauts would have to survive on a dead , airless world , collect soil samples , set up suites of instruments , switch them on , then blast off into space with fellow moonwalker Buzz Aldrin , on their spindly lunar module .
If its engine failed to burn for a minimum of seven minutes and 10 seconds , the pair would be marooned in space .
Faced with these prospects , who would care about the odd pronoun ?
In any case , Armstrong 's words still resonate - for they so neatly sum up the hopes of those heady days .
After all , in only eight years - the first manned space flight was in 1961 - humans had developed the means to journey from one world to another .
We had left our cradle and the universe awaited .
And that is the problem .
The universe is still waiting .
There has been no great leap .
Indeed , the United States , which next month celebrates Apollo 11's 40th anniversary , will soon have no way of putting men and women into space at all .
Its replacement for Apollo , the space shuttle , has turned out to be a death - trap that has so far claimed the lives of 14 astronauts , the crews of shuttles Challenger and Columbia , and is to be retired next year .
It is unclear whether President Barack Obama , who has shown little enthusiasm for manned space projects so far , will back Nasa 's plans for replacement spacecraft .
That is the real significance of next month 's moon landing anniversary .
The landing marked the end , not the beginning , of our dreams of space exploration .
The prospects of creating permanent lunar bases , sending manned missions to Mars and blasting astronauts round the solar system died the moment Armstrong set foot on the moon .
America had got there before the Russians and the nation could now forget the place .
" The great tragedy of the effort was that the best of American technology and billions of American dollars were devoted to a project of minuscule benefit to anyone , " says historian Gerard DeGroot , of St Andrew 's University .
" Armstrong 's small step did nothing for mankind . "
Indeed , the quest now " seems as strange as stuffing fraternity brothers into phone booths , swallowing goldfish or listening to the 1910 Fruitgum Company , " he states .
These are harsh words , but you can see DeGroot 's point .
America had been inspired by President Kennedy 's wish , announced in 1961 , of " achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth . "
After his assassination in 1963 , the idea became a homage to him , a way of showing the world what the United States would have achieved had he lived .
Within days of the Apollo 11 astronauts ' safe return to Earth , someone put a message on Kennedy 's grave : " Mr President , the Eagle has landed . "
Job done , in other words .
Certainly , the speed with which the US became tired of space flight after Apollo 11 was remarkable .
By April 1970 , TV coverage of the Apollo 13 mission was cancelled in favour of the Doris Day Show .
( It was quickly switched back once the mission went wrong , of course . )
The Soviet Union had been beaten and that was all that mattered .
Two years later , the axe fell .
Apollos 18 , 19 and 20 were cancelled and Apollo 17 astronauts Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt became the last men to walk on the Moon .
On 14 December , 1972 , after taking several lengthy tours round the Sea of Serenity in the mission 's lunar rover when they collected more than 100lb of rocks , they prepared for departure .
" We leave as we came and , God willing , as we shall return , with peace and hope for all mankind , ' announced Cernan .
Then he switched off his microphone and turned to Schmitt .
" OK , Jack , let 's get this mother outta here . "
Thus humans left the only other world they had ever conquered .
It all seemed so different on 16 July , 1969 .
More than a million people had gathered around Cape Canaveral to watch the giant Saturn V carry the Apollo 11 astronauts into space .
The Saturn V was the most powerful rocket ever built .
At lift - off its five giant engines burned more than 1,000 gallons of fuel a second and made the air vibrate so intensely that spectators could feel their skin shake .
Many were overcome by the experience .
" At lift - off , I cried for the first time in 20 years , and prayed for the first time in 40 , " Arthur C Clarke recalled .
Walter Cronkite , the urbane CBS anchorman , found himself , for the first time in his professional life , at a loss for words , a condition that was probably exacerbated by the rocket 's vibrations which had shaken the roof off his temporary office .
For the next three days , Armstrong , Aldrin and Michael Collins - who would pilot Apollo 11's command module while his two crewmates descended to the lunar surface - guided their craft using sextants , slide - rules and a computer that had less power than a modern mobile phone .
On 20 July , Armstrong and Aldrin climbed into the Lunar Module , a " tissue - paper spacecraft " as astronauts labelled the lightweight lander , and the real drama began .
The module , the Eagle , dropped slowly towards the moon as Armstrong fired its descent engines to control its velocity .
Then the capsule 's yellow master alarm started to flash .
For half a minute , as the lander burned precious fuel , the mission seemed doomed .
Then the alarm stopped and the Eagle continued to sweep over the moon .
With 60 seconds of fuel left , the Eagle had still not touched down as Armstrong , as ever icy - cool , picked his landing spot with care .
Finally , he selected his ground and the Eagle settled on a tiny corner of the Sea of Tranquillity with only seconds of fuel left in its tank .
" Our eyes met , " recalled Aldrin .
" I remember just patting him on the back . "
Oddly , Armstrong has a different memory .
" We shook hands , " he insisted on BBC TV recently .
" Maybe it was both , " added Aldrin .
In fact , the landing was so perfectly executed and so gentle that it failed to shake loose the Eagle 's external ladder to its full extension .
So Armstrong , after he left the craft , had to jump several feet down onto the lunar surface .
Thus he neither took a giant leap for mankind nor a small step for himself .
His achievement was stunning nevertheless : " the most mind - blowing theatre ever created , " according to Apollo astronaut biographer Andrew Smith .
After that , Armstrong and Aldrin spent a couple of hours of the moon , safely blasted their way back to the command module , and headed home in a spacecraft that offered less space , and worse toilet facilities , than a minivan .
When the capsule splashed down in the Pacific , the frogman who opened its door was sent reeling by the smell .
The job - of hatch - opening after touchdown - became the programme 's most dangerous .
Not that Richard Nixon , then US President , cared .
The mission was simply the greatest story since the Creation , he announced , while Werner von Braun , former V2 designer for Hitler and creator of those mighty Saturn V rockets , argued that the mission was as important as " the moment in evolution when aquatic life came crawling up on the land " .
Such inflated claims now look ludicrous .
The Apollo programme was a dead end , though it was certainly a stunning technological achievement and a testament to the bravery and skill of Armstrong , Aldrin and Collins .
It was also an extraordinarily expensive project , it should be noted .
The entire Apollo programme cost $ 24bn in 1960s money - around $ 1 trillion in today 's - and for several years was swallowing up almost 5 per cent of the US federal budget .
In addition , there was also a considerable emotional cost to the missions , a point stressed by Christopher Riley , co-producer of the 2007 documentary In the Shadow of the Moon .
" A great many Americans suffered premature heart attacks and strokes from their efforts in making the Apollo project succeed .
More than 400,000 workers were employed by private contractors to build capsules , rocket engines , space suits , and computers for Apollo and the vast majority worked flat out , over weekends and holidays , much of the time for free , for several years to make sure the programme succeeded . "
For example , at the Grumman factory in New Jersey , where the lunar module was built , staff would clock off at 5 pm , leave by the front door , walk round to the back and work for free until midnight .
Similarly , employees at the International Latex Corporation - which made the suits worn by the Apollo astronauts - worked with equally obsessive intensity .
In a recent documentary , the company 's senior seamstress , Eleanor Foraker , recalled working 80 - hour weeks without days off or holidays for three continuous years , suffering two nervous breakdowns in the process .
" I would leave the plant at five o'clock in the morning and be back by seven .
But it was worth it , it really was . "
This widespread public commitment has largely been forgotten and is all the more striking given the abruptness with which Americans turned their backs on the Apollo programme once it had achieved its primary goal .
So what , in the end , did the US get for all that money and effort ?
What was achieved ?
The list is intriguing but not lengthy .
Apollo astronauts flew nine missions to the moon , of which six landed on its surface .
A total of 24 astronauts took part in those missions , with three - Jim Lovell , Gene Cernan and John Young - flying twice .
A dozen men - of whom nine are still alive - landed , while the remainder flew over its surface .
Each of those 12 moonwalkers was American ; each flew between the Christmases of 1968 and 1972 ; and each was either an eldest sibling or an only son .
For good measure , three - quarters chose country - and - western tapes to listen to on their voyage .
As for the moon , it was left 118 tonnes heavier from its encounters with America thanks to the crashed robot probes , lander components , TV cameras , and lunar rover vehicles - not to mention the flags , footprints , old food trays and litter - that were dumped there .
Even valuable Hasselblad cameras were left behind to save weight and fuel .
Untouched by wind or rain or bacteria , these piles of detritus remain as they were left by humans 40 years ago .
One day they may even provide alien visitors with valuable clues about the strange species that stayed so briefly on this dead world .
To balance that lunar deposit , there was one major withdrawal : 842lb of rocks brought back to Earth by the Apollo moonwalkers .
Most of these remain in a pristine condition and are stored at the lunar sample building at the Johnson Space Centre in Texas in conditions that would do justice to Fort Knox - which is scarcely surprising considering the worth of lunar soil .
In 1993 , Russia , which had sent back tiny moon rock samples from its robot Luna lander - probes , auctioned three small fragments , that weighed 0.2g in total , for $ 442,000 .
Gold is cheap , by comparison .
These specimens - bits of breccia chipped from boulders and lumps of basalt lifted from the lunar terrain - are kept in elevated vaults to protect them from any flooding that might be triggered by hurricanes or tornadoes and are constantly purged with highly pure nitrogen to protect them from chemical reactions .
Surprisingly , this lunar detritus is still studied by scientists , although most agree that they long ago gave up their greatest secrets .
These studies indicate that the moon was created when an errant asteroid struck our planet billions of years ago , hurtling a vast blob of material into space .
This solidified to become the moon .
Then there are measurements carried out by scientists based at the McDonald Observatory in Texas .
Almost every day for the past 40 years , they have fired laser pulses at mirror targets on the moon .
One of those was left behind by Armstrong and Aldrin and from the reflected laser light received at the observatory astronomers , led by Peter Shelus , have studied the moon 's orbit with unprecedented precision .
" The moon pulls a body of water round the Earth that forms the ocean tides , " says Shelus .
" But that mass of water acts on the moon as well , slowing it down and causing the diameter of its orbit to lengthen .
Essentially , every year , the moon moves 2 ½ inches away from the Earth . "
Such work is intriguing but does not impress Nasa 's growing number of critics , including Professor Amitai Etzioni , of George Washington University .
" If you look at 100 - year - old maps of the moon in old encyclopedias , you can see they are not that different from the maps we have made after Apollo .
We have discovered a lot of very interesting nuggets about the moon but at an enormous cost .
It is time to stop .
If people want to do this sort of thing in future , they should pay private enterprise to do it , as Richard Branson is doing with his Virgin Galactic spacecraft . "
Alternatively , we could spend money on robot craft like the Hubble Space Telescope , or the Galileo and Cassini missions to Jupiter and Saturn , whose costs are a fraction of those of manned missions but which return far more important data , say other critics .
In the end , the real problem for Nasa is that it did the hardest thing first .
Kennedy 's pledge to fly to the moon within a decade was made when its astronauts had clocked up exactly 20 minutes ' experience of manned spaceflight .
" We wondered what the heck he was talking about , " recalls Nasa flight director Gene Kranz .
To get there before the Russians the agency was obliged to design craft that were highly specific to the task .
Hence the Saturn V , the Apollo capsule and the lunar module .
Unfortunately , these vehicles were fairly useless at anything else in space - such as building a space station - and Nasa , having nearly broken the bank with Apollo , had to start again on budgets that dwindled dramatically as the decades passed .
Now Nasa 's manned space programme hangs by a thread .
The US is to ground its shuttle fleet because they are now considered so dangerous .
New rockets are being designed to be ready for launch around 2016 and are intended to carry men , and this time women , to the moon before heading off to Mars , a programme announced by former president George W Bush several years ago .
But Bush offered no extra money for this programme - known as Constellation - and President Obama has asked for a review of its costs and goals .
White House officials , at Senate hearings last week , made reassuring noises about manned space - flight but given the US now has a budget deficit of around $ 1.7 trillion , there are not many expecting a thumbs - up .
The conclusion is therefore inescapable .
Kennedy 's great vision and Armstrong 's lunar footsteps killed off deep - space manned missions for 40 years - and probably for many decades to come .
As DeGroot says : " Hubris took America to the moon , a barren , soulless place where humans do not belong and cannot flourish .
If the voyage has had any positive benefit at all , it has reminded us that everything good resides here on Earth . "

Myths and moonshine
The Apollo moon landings have acquired their myths over the decades and key among these is the claim that the missions never occurred in the first place .
The Apollo astronauts only flew into Earth orbit , it is alleged , and those moon scenes of rock - collecting , playing golf and riding lunar rovers were filmed in studios on Earth .
According to one poll , carried out at the time of the 30th Apollo 11 anniversary , 6 % of Americans believe Nasa faked the whole business .
For evidence , believers point to misplaced shadows ( from studio lights ) , lack of stars in the background of lunar surface shots and claims that the flag planted by Armstrong and Aldrin can be seen flapping , even thought the moon is airless .
None of these claims stands up to scrutiny .
There are no misplaced shadows , the lunar landings all took place during daytime which explains the lack of stars and there is no sign of a flag flapping .
Nor do the allegations make sense .
As Charlie Duke , lunar module pilot for Apollo 16 , has pointed out , if Nasa faked the first landing , why did it bother to do it another five times ?
In 2002 , Buzz Aldrin showed exactly what he thought of the claims when he was confronted by film - maker Bart Sibrel who accused him of faking his lunar landing and of being " a thief , liar and coward " .
Buzz , who was 72 at the time , punched him in the face .
And then there are the other stories , including the glorious urban myth told about Neil Armstrong .
As he climbs on his Apollo 11 spaceship to return to Earth , he mutters : " This one 's for you , Jablonski . "
The message is taped and stored by Nasa .
Years later , a baffled space historian tries to make sense of it and fails .
So he contacts Armstrong .
" Ah , " says the astronaut , " It 's simple , really .
I grew up in Ohio .
Mr Jablonski lived next door and one night I heard his wife shout , ' Oral sex !
You want oral sex !
You 'll get oral sex on the day that the kid next door walks on the moon ! '
I just wanted to tell him the good news . "
Unfortunately , it , too , is untrue .
The 12 men who walked on the moon
Neil Armstrong
Apollo 11 , 1969
Born in 1930 , in Wapakoneta , Ohio , Armstrong was a navy pilot during the Korean war before becoming an astronaut .
He has since worked both in business and academia .
Since 1994 he has refused to give any autographs after discovering that his signature was being sold for thousands of dollars to collectors .
In 2005 he also sued his barber for selling his hair to space fans .
Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin
Apollo 11
Aldrin also fought in the Korean war as a fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut .
After his moon flight , he suffered bouts of severe depression and alcoholism which he chronicled in Return to Earth and in his latest memoir Magnificent Desolation .
Aldrin remains an ardent advocate of manned space flight .
Charles " Pete " Conrad
Apollo 12 , 1969
The third man on the moon , Conrad was a flight instructor for the US navy before becoming an astronaut .
He was killed in 1999 after a motorcycle accident in California .
He was 69 .
Alan Bean
Apollo 12
Like Armstrong , Bean claimed Scottish ancestry and even took a piece of the McBean tartan to the moon .
Bean quit Nasa to become an artist in Houston .
He paints only space scenes .
Alan Shepard
Apollo 14 , 1971
America 's first man in space , in 1961 , Shepard made front pages round the world after playing golf on the moon .
He was made a rear admiral before retiring , and died in 1998 of leukaemia .
Edgar Mitchell
Apollo 14
A former naval pilot , Mitchell conducted private psychic experiments while on the moon and later founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences to conduct experiments into consciousness and other paranormal events .
David Scott
Apollo 15 , 1971
After his mission , Nasa refused to let Scott fly again after it was discovered he had taken commemorative stamps to the moon which he later sold to dealers .
He also made headlines , in 2003 , when he became engaged , briefly , to British newsreader Anna Ford .
James Irwin
Apollo 15
After his moon flight , Irwin founded the High Flight Foundation , an evang elical organisation in Colorado Springs , and later led expeditions to Turkey 's Mount Ararat in search of Noah 's ark .
He died in 1991 , aged 61 .
John Young
Apollo 16 , 1972
Young flew on Gemini , Apollo and space shuttle missions .
He was openly critical of Nasa in the wake of the shuttle Challenger disaster but continued to work for the agency .
He retired in 2004 .
Charles Duke
Apollo 16
The youngest of the 12 men who walked on the moon , Duke will be 74 in October .
After he returned from his lunar journey , Duke discovered God and became involved in prison ministry .
Harrison " Jack " Schmitt
Apollo 17 , 1972
The only moonwalker who was never a member of the US armed forces , Schmitt - a geologist - turned to politics after his mission and was elected Republican senator for New Mexico .
He was defeated after one term in 1982 .
Eugene Cernan
Apollo 17
The last man to walk on the moon , Cernan was a naval pilot and then an astronaut , flying on Gemini and Apollo missions .
He later started his own consultation company , the Cernan Corporation , and became chairman of Johnson Engineering which handles flight crew systems development for Nasa 's Johnson Space Centre .
L'AQUILA , Italy ( CNN ) --
Leaders of the world 's most powerful economies pledged to seek huge cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions at a summit in Italy on Wednesday .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , center , and Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi , right , visit the quake zone .
The Group of Eight leaders said they would " join a global response to achieve a 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 and to a goal of an aggregate 80 percent or more reduction by developed countries by that date . "
The goal mirrors one adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives last month .
Despite the G - 8 leaders ' pledge to cut emissions , developing nations may not follow suit -- and G - 8 leaders stopped short of calling on them to set specific targets .
Instead , they " called upon major emerging economies to undertake quantifiable actions to collectively reduce emissions significantly below business - as - usual by a specified year , " the White House said .
U.S. President Obama joined the leaders of Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan and Russia in the mountain town of L'Aquila , which was devastated by a 6.3 - magnitude quake in April , for the meeting .
Chinese President Hu Jintao was expected to attend the summit but returned home Wednesday to deal with deadly ethnic clashes in China 's remote western Xinjiang province that have prompted a massive security clampdown .
Watch report from CNN's Ed Henry »
China 's problems add to a list of global concerns overshadowing the talks , including the recent political turmoil in Iran and North Korea 's nuclear ambitions , both of which have prompted renewed talk of major economic sanctions .
Though
Hu was forced to return home , representatives of the other " plus five " group of emerging economic giants , including Brazil , India , South Africa and Mexico , are to attend Thursday 's session , with discussions looking ahead to a major environmental summit in Copenhagen , Denmark .
A senior Chinese official , Dai Binnguo , is standing in for Hu in Italy .
After the summit's first session , Obama and other leaders toured the area damaged by the quake , which killed about 300 people and left 45,000 homeless .

Obama is expected to push for further international financial stimulus packages at the summit , reflecting continued concerns over the global economic crisis despite massive government spending to halt the downturn .
Watch what 's on agenda at G - 8 summit »
The summit's host , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , is probably hoping that the three - day event will help draw the spotlight away from recent scandals that have prompted questions over his suitability to lead .
Prone to gaffes and facing a divorce from his wife of 19 years , the Italian prime minister is being investigated over allegations that he paid for sex , claims that he has repeatedly denied .
Berlusconi has made a show of moving the summit from its original venue on the island of Sardinia to L'Aquila , in the mountains of central Italy , as a gesture of support for the region .
Watch Berlusconi talk to CNN about scandals he faces »
A massive security operation has been put in place around the town , which is still hit by regular aftershocks .
Italy claimed last week that it had arrested six members of a left - wing terrorist group who were plotting an attack on the summit .
Meanwhile , Pope Benedict XVI launched his own verbal assault on global capitalism ahead of the meeting , lambasting " grave deviations and failures " and calling for a " profoundly new way of understanding business enterprise . "
The pope , who is due to meet Obama on the summit 's sidelines , challenged bankers to turn away from the practices blamed for bringing about the global economic crisis and instead use their power to help the world create wealth and economic development .
" Above all , the intention to do good must not be considered incompatible with the effective capacity to produce goods , " Benedict said .
After a G - 20 summit of leading powers in London , England , in April that critics claim was little more than a photo opportunity despite pledges of global economic cooperation , some have questioned what tangible gains can be made from this week 's meeting .
Ahead of the summit , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned that the financial crisis is far from over , echoing White House calls for further economic stimulus -- something that is likely to meet resistance among European leaders .
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who is campaigning for greater environmental awareness , said Tuesday that the G - 8 was expected to set out a framework for tackling climate change that would be carried forward to the Copenhagen meeting .

All About L'Aquila • Nature and the Environment
Police will be urged to turn a blind eye to provocative acts by Muslim protest groups
Guidelines will tell forces to press for conviction only in cases of clear - cut criminal acts .
Officers will be advised not to proceed when evidence of lawbreaking is “ borderline ” .
Examples of crimes to which a blind eye may be turned include incitement to religious hatred or viewing extremist material on the internet .
Last night critics warned that the move could mean Islamic radicals being give the freedom to encourage violence .
Some saw the move as a politically correct attempt to appease extremists who hate Britain .
It could even mean officers tolerating many activities of Muslim preachers of hate like the hook - handed cleric Abu Hamza .
Tory MP David Davies said : “ This sounds like abject surrender .
Everyone should be equal in the eyes of the law .
“ It does n’t matter whether someone is suspected of incitement to hatred or shoplifting – they should all face the same risk of prosecution .
“ There should be no special favours or treatment for any section of the community . ”
Officials insist there is no suggestion that people who have clearly committed offences will avoid prosecution .
Instead , they want to avoid alienating Muslims on the fringes of extremism by dragging them to court over petty allegations unlikely to result in conviction .
One fear is that some young Muslims are falling under the influence of extremist preachers while serving prison sentences or on remand awaiting trial .
A senior Whitehall official said the guidance was being drawn up as part of a drive to use persuasion rather than the criminal justice system to fight extremism .
He added : “ The aim is to stop people being dragged into extremism .
“ We are not talking about letting someone off who has committed a clear offence , but where it is unclear if an offence has been committed .
“ For instance , where there has been incitement or someone has been on the internet there can be a grey area where there is some discretion and it would be more sensible to avoid going down the criminal route . ”
The Government ’s counter - terrorism board is drawing up the advice , which will be sent to all police forces , including the Metropolitan , later this year .
The move follows an updated Home Office counter - terrorism strategy announced earlier this year .
The new strategy urges preventative measures to win round potential extremists instead of arrest and prosecution .
“ We need to be able to provide support for individuals who are drawn into criminal activity , ” the document says .
Councils , community groups and the Government ’s youth justice board will be among organisations expected to identify those drawn into extremism or at risk .
Social workers , teachers and other professionals will be asked to try to work with some Muslim youths to reduce the likelihood of them turning into extremists .
But the new strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of prosecutions against Islamist extremists protesting against troops .
In Luton earlier this year , protesters displayed placards bearing the words “ butchers ” and “ animals ” at a homecoming parade for 2nd Battalion , The Royal Anglian Regiment .
There were no arrests for incitement .
A Home Office spokesman said : “ Preventing people becoming radicalised is a key priority for the Government .
The police response needs to be proportionate to deal with crimes people commit while reducing the risk to public safety . ”
The latest move represents a reversal of the policy introduced under Tony Blair in the wake of the terrorist attacks in London in 2005 , when as Prime Minister he called for an overhaul of the criminal justice system to root out and prosecute extremists .
HONG KONG  Banks in China and Hong Kong began wiring Chinese renminbi directly to one another on Monday to settle payments for imports and exports , as China took another step toward establishing the renminbi as a global currency  and , eventually , an international alternative to the dollar .
China has tempered its recent calls for a global reserve currency other than the dollar going into a meeting of the world ’s major industrialized countries and biggest emerging economies in Italy on Thursday .
He Yafei , China ’s vice foreign minister , said on Sunday that the dollar would remain the world ’s dominant currency for “ many years to come . ”
But the Chinese government is accelerating the process of making its own currency , the renminbi , more readily convertible into other currencies , which gives it the potential over the long term to be used widely for trade and as a reserve currency .
The day that the renminbi is fully convertible  more than a few years away , but perhaps less than a few decades  will most likely signal a huge shift in global economic power , and a day of reckoning of sorts not just for China but also for the United States , which will no longer be able to run up huge debt without economic consequences .

EU Observer [ 1 ]
EUOBSERVER / BRUSSELS -
New rules on public access to EU documents have prompted one of the European Commission 's key departments to circulate a memo warning officials to be careful about what they write in emails and advising them on how to narrowly interpret requests for information .
The 15 - page handbook was circulated in January to officials working in the commission directorate for trade , one of the EU 's most important policy areas affecting millions of people both within and beyond the bloc .
The instructions " make it easier to get reports out " and " avoid having to go through blanking out " documents , says the commission .
It reminds DG trade employees that all documents , including emails , are " in principle subject to disclosure " and asks them to think of the regulation when they are producing documents .
" Each official must be aware that all his / her documents , including meeting reports and e-mails can potentially be disclosed .
You should keep this in mind when writing such documents .
This is particularly the case for meeting reports and emails with third parties ( e.g. industry ) , which are favourite " targets " of requests for access to documents , especially by NGOs , " reads the memo .
It asks officials to draft documents " with the utmost care " while telling them to avoid making references to informal contacts , such as meals or drinks , with lobbyists .
" Do n't refer to the great lunch you have had with an industry representative privately or add a PS asking if he / she would like to meet for a drink . "
The document also tips off officials on how to narrow down the interpretation of a request for information .
It points to a past example where a request referred to DG trade meetings with individual companies , meaning the department could avoid making public its contacts with business lobbyists .
Separating the factual from the subjective
" Recent cases concern requests for information about meetings with ' individual companies ' on our FTAs [ Free Trade Agreements ] which have allowed us to exclude business federations on the same points , or about meetings with ' DG Trade officials ' which have allowed us to exclude meetings on the same point with the Commissioner or the cabinet , " it notes .
As a way of avoiding officials having to blank out parts of documents they release to the public , the transparency guide suggests writing two accounts of meetings , a " factual " or neutral one that can be released to the public and a more " personal / subjective " one with assessments and recommendations for follow up that need not be disclosed .
It also explains that briefings should not be made public if still considered " newsworthy " – a derogation allowed under the regulation for documents concerning a decision still in progress – with DG Trade working on a series of key issues including making free trade agreements with poor countries ( something NGOs are always keen to have an insight into ) and sensitive WTO decisions .
DG Trade 's take on the transparency regulation which MEPs recently voted to expand to cover all documents , including electronic ones , has come in for criticism .
Corporate Europe Observatory , a transparency NGO , said the instructions appear to " directly contravene the spirit and content of the regulation . "
Scandalous
It is a " scandalous " attempt to " legitimise DG Trade 's recurrent attempts to shield evidence of its liaisons with corporate lobbyists from information requests , " said CEO campaigner Pia Eberhardt .
For its part , the European Commission defended the memo .
A spokesperson told EUobserver : " Actually we think these are good instructions .
It makes clear that no category of documents is excluded [ from the regulation ] . "
The spokesperson also said that the instructions " make it easier to get reports out " and " avoid having to go through blanking out " documents .
The transparency regulation dates from 2001 but the commission recently proposed to overhaul it after complaints from the EU ombudsman and several court cases .
Following MEPs ' vote last month the regulation has gone back to committee for discussion on sensitive issues such as the extent to which commercial data can be excused from disclosure .
The updated law is expected to be approved in the second half of this year , under the Swedish EU presidency .

A new reservoir is filling in central China .
The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River — the world ’s largest dam — was completed in 2006 , and the river is filling up its valley behind the dam to form a narrow reservoir extending more than 600 kilometers .
This image from April 15 , 2009 , is one of the first images that astronauts on the International Space Station have been able to capture of the flooding behind the dam .
The main objective for the dam is to supply water for the largest hydroelectric plant in the world and to help control the devastating floods that plague the lowlands downstream from the dam .
The epic scale of the dam project is matched by the level of controversy it continues to generate .
Concerns about major environmental impacts , the relocation of 1.2 million people , and the flooding of 13 cities , more than 1300 villages , archeological locations , and hazardous waste dumps were raised throughout the planning and implementation .
Environmental concerns include increased seismicity from the loading of the water , landslides , changed ecosystems , accumulated pollution , increased chances for waterborne diseases , and salinity changes in the Yangtze estuary .

Feel free to ask Spy Blog questions about the use of Tor , or other technologies to help preserve your anonymity , and to circumvent internet censorship by repressive regimes , either in the comments or via email ( or via PGP encrypted email )
Some discussions about setting up Tor and other proxy servers , and other advice for Iranian election protestors :
Remember to read and understand the warnings about the ways in which you can still betray your real IP address , even if you are using Tor .
If you are desperate , here is a copy of the Tor / Vidalia / Tor Button / Privoxy bundle for Windows ( approximately 8 Mb ) - currently version 0.2.0.34 .
See also the Renesys blog , for details of the temporary outages and congestion of Iranian international internet connections : Iran and the Internet : Uneasy Standoff
There is evidence that Tor is being used in Iran , even though various internet ports may have been temporarily blocked by the Iranian regime .
You would be giving something back to the community , which you yourselves will increasingly have to make use of , in order to escape from the Labour Government 's " Eye of Sauron " Intercept Modernisation Programme / Communications Data Bill plans for retaining and snooping on your Communications Traffic Data etc. .
If you are not doing so already , then you could help Iranian democracy , and similarly repressed people in Burma , China , Tibet , Zimbabwe , Pakistan , Cuba etc. by running a Tor Relay or even a Tor Exit node .
What then , can the more than merely internet literate readers of Spy Blog do , to help ?
Others acknowledge that these have helped to spread the story in the West , but are a bit more sceptical about what is actually being used successfully in Iran at the moment , They are also rightly critical of the pointless attempts at Denial of Service attacks on Iranian government websites etc. - see Ethan Zuckerman : Iran , citizen media and media attention
The Twitterverse and the mainstream media seem to be convinced that Twitter and Facebook etc. are important in getting first hand reports and images and videoclips , past the Iranian government censors .
TOR Bridge relays
The current stable release of the Tor software does now support Tor Bridges i.e .
Tor relay nodes which are not advertised in public by the Directory servers periodically to every Tor client .
This can make it much harder to censor the Tor cloud by blocking all the publicly advertised IP addresses .
Obviously the IP addresses of secret
Tor bridge relays , are not something to be broadcast in public via RSS feeds or on Twitter .
Those of you with trusted contacts in Iran need to share these privately .
Bridge relays act as private entry points into the Tor cloud , but they are not really needed unless and until normal Tor links are blocked .
ADSL broadband Bandwidth issues
Running the Tor client takes up little bandwidth , only the periodic relay node descriptor updates every 10 minutes or so .
However , running a Tor relay can use up quite a lot of bandwidth , if you let it .
ADSL broadband internet connections in the UK , although very common , are rather overhyped when it comes to the actual speed and bandwidth which is actually delivered .
Very few people , i.e. those living very close tp the local telephone exchange , get close to the commonly advertised 8 Mega Bits Per Second ( 8 Mbs ) download speed .
Even they will get far less than this , if there are a lot of other people sharing the one Digital subscriber line access multiplexer ( DSLAM ) in the local telephone exchange at peak times ..
A " good " ADSL broadband internet connection is probably capable of 4 Mbs to 6 Mbs. download speed .
However , in order to run a Tor relay or exit node , or , even your own web server at home , you are limited by the available upload speed .
Uploading uses a different frequency band compared with downloading from the ISP , and is typically 450 to 488 Kilo Bits per Second ( Kbs ) , with a theoretical maximum usually of 512 Kbs.
Some ISPs offer 768 Kbs or a maximum of 1.2
Mbs upload speed , usually for more money .
The upload speed of , say , 488 Kbs seems to be common , regardless of whether the download speed is 512 Kbs , 1 Mbs , 2Mbs 8 Mbs or 20 Mbs .
A Tor relay or exit node needs at least 20 Kilo Bytes per Second bandwidth , i.e. a minimum of 160 Kilo Bits per Second , in both directions .
So a typical home or office broadband connection , which is used mainly for web browsing and email etc. , and is not running any other web server or continual peer to peer file transfers could easily run a Tor relay or exit node up to 60 KBs i.e. 480 Kbs , , without noticing any effect on " normal " internet use .
However , even such slow or medium speed
Tor relays will , if left active 24 / 7 , transfer tens of Gigabytes of data in a month , perhaps between 50 to 70 Gigabytes for a 450 Kbs connection , and probably around 30 Gigabytes per month for the minimum 160 Kbs bandwidth .
This could easily be a problem for ADSL users with data download caps , especially those using mobile 3G phone USB internet connections , which are typically limited to only 5 or 10 or 15 GB per month .
Tor software allows for fair degree of control over bandwidth see the Tor bandwidth shaping FAQ documentation
Allocating the normal and burst bandwidth is easily done through the Vidalia menus , but setting more advanced features like bandwidth accounting periods and the total amount of data transfer to be limited .
during such a period e.g. 1GB per day , requires editing of the torrc ( N.B. no file extension ) configuration file .
You should probably set your burst bandwidth to be no more than twice the normal bandwidth , to cope with sudden momentary peaks , and the periodic download of fresh data about new or expired or modified Tor relays and sessions etc.e.g. setting the BandwidthRate to 65536 i.e.
64 Kilo Bytes per second , limited by the uplink speed , with a BandwidthBurst of 131072 i.e. 128 Kbs typically produces an average throughput of , say 51947 i.e. about 51 Kbs which is about 1.5 GB per day , or 45 GB per month .
Tor relay exit policies
If you set your Tor relay to only talk to other Tor relays in the middle of the encrypted , anonymise Tor cloud , you will help the project overall by helping to mix up and anonymous the traffic .
If you are feeling braver , and more public spirited , then you can amend your Exit policy , to allow , for example , http:// World Wide Web traffic on port 80 , or https :// encrypted World Wide Web port 443 traffic to Exit from your Tor node .
This will make it easier for people in say , Iran or China to connect to , for example , a censored BBC foreign language news web page , or YouTube , or Twitter or Gmail etc. but runs the risk of perhaps also aiding criminals and foreign intelligence agents etc. who also use the Tor cloud to hide their activities .
Illegal or morally dubious use of your Tor Exit Node , may potentially cause you trouble , from ignorant law enforcement authorities , who are unaware that your Tor Exit Node , has no way of knowing where the traffic it has received from the Tor cloud is really coming from , or being forwarded on to .
All the connections randomly change every 10 minutes or so anyway , and , by default no log files are kept .

Since the appearance of the first video game console -- the Magnavox Odyssey - - in 1972 , dozens of companies have tried their hands at crafting successful and lucrative game platforms .
Each new machine brought with it the promise of a compelling , novel gaming experience , but the vast majority failed miserably to deliver .
For every blockbuster like the NES , the Atari 2600 , or the Sony PlayStation , there are a bunch of duds that never made it far in the marketplace .
And for good reasons :
Some of the consoles I 've listed here were ridiculously overpriced , some were woefully underpowered , some worked only with a stable of pathetically bad games .
And a special few possessed every one of those characteristics .
I do n't want to be uncharitable , though .
Even the worst console here had at least one redeeming quality ( well , maybe not the RCA Studio II ) , so I 've tried to point out the bright spots in this otherwise dark and melancholy history .
( Note : For this list , I 've only considered video game " systems , " which I define as platforms designed to play many different interchangeable games . )

So - called complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) – or what I think is best characterized as non-science - based medicine , is a common subject for the lay press .
It ’s counter - cultural , controversial , and can easily incorporate elements of fear and self - empowerment – all themes the media loves .
Articles on CAM often contain the same “ facts ” , whether quoted from some perceived expert or just asserted by the author , that in fact are wrong or grossly misleading .
In an interview with the SGU , Christopher Hitchens commented that lazy journalists simply tell the story that is being told and then they build the “ facts ” around that story – rather than investigating to determine what the story actually is .
This is very true in the world of CAM reporting .
Take this recent article from syracuse.com .
Actually , I will say right off that the author gets many things right .
I am always pleasantly surprised to see reasonable comments in these pieces .
Perhaps we are starting to get through .
So let me start with some praise for those points I was happy to see .
“ The key question should n’t be , ‘ Is this a traditional medicine my insurance plan will pay for or it this complementary ? ' ” said Dr. Lisa Kaufmann , a University Hospital internist .
“ The real question is , ‘ Does it work ? ' ”
That is absolutely the real question – everything else is an elaborate diversion – the flourishes and exaggerated movements of a stage magician meant to distract the audience from his or her slight - of - hand .
Of course , answering this question is often challenging , and proponents of treatments that do not work spend a great deal of time and effort trying to create the false impression that they do .
But at least occasionally we can see the proper focus on the true question , does it work ( and also , is it safe – or more accurately , do the benefits outweigh the risks ) .
Terms such as “ Western ” medicine , “ integrative ” medicine , holistic , natural , etc. are all meaningless diversions from the real question that should concern a health care consumer – the safety and efficacy of the proposed intervention .
( I say “ real ” and not “ only ” because questions of convenience and cost are legitimate , just separate from the question of effectiveness ) .
There is also this gem from Kaufman :
Kaufmann said there ’s a common misperception that all herbal medications are safe .
“ Herbs are quite often potent pharmaceuticals , ” she said .
Many of them have side effects and risks just like prescription drugs .
That ’s right – herbs are drugs .
It ’s as if Kaufmann has been reading this blog .
Actually , this is a reality that should be obvious to any medically trained person , so I hardly need to take credit for this realization .
Kaufmann adds that patients should tell their physicians about their use of herbs and supplements .
Very true .
But unfortunately that is where the goodness ends and the common CAM propaganda myths begin .
The title of the article , in fact , is a bit of CAM propaganda – “ More Americans choosing complementary or alternative medicines . ”
More than what ?
This is a mantra of the pro-CAM crowd ( and reflects a social - norming strategy – basically peer - pressure ) , but it is not backed by evidence .
I have discussed at length the National Health Interview Survey that shows that very few Americans are using hardcore CAM modalities – like acupuncture , homeopathy , and energy medicine – all in the single digits and not changing significantly .
Like the false autism epidemic , that CAM usage is increasingly mainstream is an artifact of definition .
If you include things like massage , prayer , taking vitamins , and exercising like yoga , then you can inflate the figures .
The article quotes the highly inflated 40 % figure for CAM use – but that figure is meaningless unless you define CAM , which has a slippery definition .
By the most liberal definition anyone who has ever prayed for a sick love - one , apparently , has used CAM .
The article also recommends the NCCAM as an objective source of information about CAM .
It does not even mention that the NCCAM is controversial in scientific circles , and is actually a political creature , forced on the NIH by senator Tom Harkin .
The NCCAM exists to promote CAM , and so far has wasted 2.5 billion dollars of taxpayer money without finding a single effective CAM treatment .
Follow the false balance approach , the article next interviews a pro-CAM physician to balance the common sense of Dr. Kaufmann .
Interest is growing in CAM because many people have become disillusioned with the way traditional medicine is practiced , said Dr. Scott Treatman , director of employee health services at Crouse Hospital .
He teaches mindful living and stress reduction through SUNY Upstate Medical University and provides acupuncture .
This is a common assertion – but it is simply made up by CAM advocates for propaganda purposes – it is a self - serving assumption without a basis in fact .
It is also a question that has been studied , although admittedly not much .
But what data we do have tells the opposite story .
This 1998 survey by Astin found that :
Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine did not predict use of alternative medicine .
Only 4.4 % of those surveyed reported relying primarily on alternative therapies .
Along with being more educated and reporting poorer health status , the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values , beliefs , and philosophical orientations toward health and life .
In this more recent survey of CAM use in the elderly – chronic health problems , especially chronic pain , and a desire for control were correlated with CAM use .
Dissatisfaction with mainstream medicine was not named .
Other surveys show the same thing – the profile of a CAM user is a person with disposable income who has a chronic painful condition and is ideologically aligned with a more spiritual approach to their health and desires a sense of control over their condition .
Dissatisfaction with mainstream medicine does not appear to be a significant factor .
But that is the answer I see reported in the media nearly 100 % of the time ( I cannot remember any counter examples , but I ca n’t rule them out by memory alone ) .
That ’s just lazy reporting – 10 minutes on the internet reveals that what evidence there is does not support the dissatisfaction claim .
The concept of CAM is completely artificial – it is a manufactured concept without a clear definition that is evolving into a modern myth propagated by a willing or just lazy media .
The real story is that the public is being sold a bill of goods – a collection of treatments that are highly implausible and generally do not work .
One approach to marketing is not to market the product but to market something intangible – you ’re not selling a car , you ’re selling excitement or prestige , or even better – sex .
CAM marketing often does not market the treatment itself – because the treatments are implausible and ineffective – they just do n’t hold up to scientific scrutiny .
So instead they market spirituality , control , and empowerment .
And the people who want those things , buy it .
They even use the common commercial ploys of the bandwagon phenomenon – everyone is doing it – and trumping up dissatisfaction with existing products .
But just like with that amazing new cleanser or incredibly absorbent towel , a savvy consumer should ask themselves about any specific “ CAM ” modality – does it really work .
Some artists just are not cool – your mom likes ABBA , so there ’s no way you are going to listen to them , even if you think Mamma Mia is rather catchy .
Likewise you may think High School Musical ’s ‘ Bop to the top ’ is mucho gusto , but you do n’t want anyone to know it .
Coolness is hard to quantify , ephemeral and transient ( and of course , very subjective ) ; some artists like Miles Davis and the Velvet Underground will always be totally cool – while some fade in and out of coolness ( Elvis , Stevie Wonder , Neil Diamond , Sting ) , and some artists – well , it is hard to tell if they were ever cool ( Miley Cyrus , Creed , and Nickeback come to mind ) .
Imagine if there was an objective measure for coolness – a number that could be attached to each artist that indicated how ‘ cool ’ the artist was .
We ’d be able to do all sorts of interesting things with such a ‘ coolness index ’ .
We could make a ‘ music makeover ’ playlist that would take you from Miley to Miles in 12 songs ( consider it a 12 - step taste recovery program ) or we could create a music rehab playlist that takes you from Amy Winehouse to Kate Nash .
But of course , the concept of cool is too hard to nail down .
Is Johnny Cash cool ?
Michael Jackson ?
Prince ?
Context , demographics , locale all play a role .
It may be too hard to tell whether an artist is cool , but we have all sorts of ways to tell that an artist is definitely not cool .
For instance , if lots of listeners really do n’t want people to know that they are listening to a particular artist , then that artist is probably not too cool .
Luckily , there ’s an interesting source for just this kind of data .
Recently , the researchers at Last .fm published a list of the ‘ most unwanted scrobbles ‘ .
This is a list of tracks that were most frequently deleted by the Last . fm community from their scrobbles in the last month .
These are the tracks that Last . fm listeners did n’t want people to know that the listened to .
Here ’s the first page of the most unwanted scrobbles :
Kudos to Last.fm for publishing this data .
It ’s a great source for the uncool .
Collecting all the artists from the pages we can build a list of artists that have frequently had their scrobbles deleted :
Lady GaGa
Britney Spears
Katy Perry
Rihanna
Paramore
Coldplay
Taylor Swift
Beyoncé
Avril Lavigne
Marc Seales , composer .
New Stories .
Ernie Watts , saxophone
Alexander Rybak
Black Eyed Peas
Kings of Leon
Muse
My Chemical Romance
Linkin Park
Korn
Miley Cyrus
Jason Mraz
Metro Station
Leona Lewis
Green Day
Evanescence
Amy Whinehouse
Oasis
Nelly Furtado
This list rings true as set of ‘ uncool ’ artists ( with the exception Marc Seales , who happens to have a piece of music , called ‘ Highway Blues ’ , that can be found in most ‘ Sample Music ’ folders on most Windows XP computers , and is likely frequently scrobbled because of this ) .
Ideally this list should be normalized for popularity – naturally artists that have more listeners will be scrobbled more and consequently be deleted more too .
but there ’s not enough data in this list to normalize properly so we ’ll make do with an unnormalize list .
I find it interesting how many female acts are on the list .
Is it not cool to listen to female artists ?
Another approach to find the uncool is to look for artists that have been tagged as ‘ guilty pleasure ’ on sites like Last.fm .
For these artists , by applying the ‘ guilty pleasure ’ tag people are identifying artists that they are embarrassed to be listening to .
Here ’s a list of the top 100 popular artists that have been frequently tagged with ‘ guilty pleasure ’ – for this list I ’m normalizing the data so popularity does n’t factor into the list order :
Katy Perry

There ’s overlap between the two lists : Avril , Britney , Katy , Nelly , Taylor , Rihanna , along with the Disney crowd .
Again , there seems to be an anti-female coolness bias on the list .
It is hard to be cool and female .
The ‘ most unwanted scrobbles ’ and the ‘ guilty + pleasure ’ approach to the coolness index only get us so far .
They can help us identify music that people are embarrassed to admit that they enjoy .
But they only give us one end of the coolness spectrum .
We can find what is not cool , but we ca n’t find out what is cool .
We have in effect an ‘ Uncoolness Index ’ .
Still , knowing which artists are uncool can be helpful for all sorts of things .
If we are building a playlist for that party , we can turn on the uncool filter to make sure that Ricky Martin or Robbie Williams wo n’t sneak into the mix .
Likewise , if we are building a recommender , we can use the Uncoolness index to decide how cool the user is and recommend music that ’s slightly less uncool than what they are used to listening to .
Next steps are to figure out how to learn not just what is uncool , but also what is cool , so we can build the true ‘ coolness index ’ and be able to tell how cool any artist is .
I think that is going to be a harder problem , but I have some ideas …
WHEN he took office as Mexico 's president in December 2006 , Felipe Calderón was faced with the unchecked and violent power of drug gangs and a corrupt and ineffective set of police forces .
So he turned to the army , sending some 45,000 troops to patrol the streets in the most troubled cities .
It was supposed to be an emergency measure .
But the troops are still there , and since they are not trained for policing duties , perhaps inevitably from time to time there are allegations that they abuse their powers .
What is less inevitable is that their crimes seem to be going unpunished .
Human Rights Watch , a New York - based group , has investigated 17 such incidents involving 70 victims .
Its allegations , contained in a report released this week , are backed by eyewitness accounts and forensic evidence .
They include gruesome tales of killings , torture and rape of people with no ties to the drug trade .
Many of these cases had already been documented by Mexico 's own government - backed human - rights commission , which has seen a fourfold rise in complaints against the army since Mr Calderón took office .
But that body has no power to act on its findings .
Nearly all criminal cases against soldiers are handled by military courts , where they are treated as disciplinary matters rather than crimes .
Military judges are appointed by the defence secretary , who can remove them at will .
Their verdicts are not made public and victims cannot appeal to civilian courts .
When asked by Human Rights Watch to provide details of any cases in which soldiers had been convicted of crimes , the defence ministry did not do so .
Mr Calderón has made reforming the judicial system a priority , winning approval for a constitutional amendment that makes the civilian courts more open and less cumbersome .
But he has not touched their military counterparts .
Polls show the army is popular and trusted .
“ Having military officers commit abuses is seen as the lesser evil , ” says Raúl Benítez , a defence specialist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico .
“ People just want the army to protect them from the narcos . ”
Since he is relying so heavily on the army , it is hard for Mr Calderón to force it to submit to the law .
But unless he does , he may face an overmighty force , and one that starts to lose the trust of Mexicans .
During a press conference promoting the documentary It Might Get Loud , legendary Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page and The White Stripes ' Jack
White had some harsh words for music - based video games .

It seems that the two famous guitarists , both starring in the documentary on the history of the electric guitar along with U2's The Edge , are n't too keen on people discovering new music through video games , which is sad , because that 's almost exclusively how I discover new music these days .
For Page , it seemed to be a question of oversimplifying an action that is better left to more skilled hands .
" You think of the drum part that John Bonham did on Led Zeppelin 's first track on the first album , Good Times Bad Times , " Page said .
" How many drummers in the world can play that part , let alone on Christmas morning ? "

Basically a variant of the old why not just play a real instrument argument .
White , on the other hand , seems a bit put off that some feel that bands have to be in a game like Guitar Hero or Rock Band to find their audience .
White went on to say that " It 's depressing to have a label come and tell you that [ Guitar Hero ] is how kids are learning about music and experiencing music . "
While he added that he does n't try to limit " which format people should get their music in …if you have to be in a video game to get in front of them , that 's a little sad . "

Syria says the al - Kibar site was a disused military building
The UN nuclear watchdog , the IAEA , says traces of undeclared man-made uranium have been found at a second site in Syria , at a reactor in Damascus .
The IAEA is investigating US claims that a Syrian site destroyed in a 2007 Israeli raid was a nuclear reactor that was not yet operational .
Separately , the agency says Iran is continuing to enrich uranium in defiance of the UN Security Council .
Both Iran and Syria deny allegations of illicit nuclear activities .
' Link unclear '
Last year , the IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) found particles of man-made uranium at the al - Kibar site in Syria , which was destroyed by Israeli missiles in September 2007 .
Now in a confidential report obtained by the BBC , it says it has discovered new traces of uranium of a type not included in Syria 's declared nuclear material .
The traces were found at a small reactor used for teaching in Damascus .
The IAEA says it is not clear whether there is a link between the particles found at the two sites .
In a separate report , the IAEA says Iran now has about 7,000 centrifuges - the machines used for enriching uranium .
The agency says that Tehran is running almost 5,000 of them .
It also says that Iran has boosted its stockpile of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) by 500kg to more than 1,300kg in the last six months .
David Albright of the Washington - based Institute for Science and International Security think - tank has said that Iran now had enough LEU to convert into high - enriched uranium ( HEU ) to make one atomic bomb .
However , he said Iran would need to overcome some technical hurdles to achieve this - a process that could take several years or more .
A senior official close to the IAEA says the agency has made little progress in its investigations in Iran and in Syria .
The agency has urged both countries to co-operate with its inspectors .

PHOENIX - Meghan McCain , the 24 - year - old daughter of Senator John McCain and Cindy McCain reports that she received a very lucrative six - figure book deal from The Lower Grand Canyon Publishing Company .
Meghan 's 493 page book is entitled , Gee Opie ( GOP ) - The Mayberry Republicans .
In her book she takes shots at every well - known Republican from Governor Sarah Palin to Ann Coulter and from Rudy Guliani to Donald Rumsfeld .
Meghan reveals some never before known factual secrets and secretive facts about the world of the GOPers that not even her mom and dad knew .
For example , in chapter 4 , she reveals that all throughout the 2008 presidential campaign Sarah Palin always wore her husband Todd 's underwear .
She said that by her wearing Todd 's boxer shorts that it gave her a sense of being able to think in a manly way .
" Snowflake " Sarah felt that it helped her to look at perspective male voters as good old boys ( like her ) instead of adversarial dudes like Joe Biden .
In chapter 9 , she tells about Ann Coulter opening up to her while sitting at a Starbucks in Toledo , Ohio , and confiding in her that she had not had a date ( with a guy ) since the seventh grade .
She also disclosed that everyone thinks that she ( Coulter ) weighs 87 pounds , but she actually only weighs 84 .
McCain states in chapter 11 , that ex-New York mayor Rudy Guliani has had a secret crush on the Speaker of The House Nancy Pelosi since Labor Day , 2008 .
He even confessed to her that he has an autographed 8 by 10 photo of Pelosi dressed in a skimpy bikini swimsuit that he keeps locked up in his lower left office desk drawer .
Meghan also talks about Glenn Beck and how he seems to think that he is the Brad Pitt of talk show hosts .
She said that this past Valentine 's Day he sent her thirteen red roses .
She was surprised as to why thirteen and then she read the card which said : My Dear Sweet Meg , I have sent you thirteen red roses .
If you take one away and toss it in the trash can , you will still have one dozen red roses .
( signed ) Glenn the Wreck .
One question that Meghan says she is asked more than any other is if Sarah Palin is really as manly and as masculine as she acts .
And Meghan replies that she knows " Snowplow " Palin very well and that little Sarah just wants to be one of the boys so bad that when she is off hunting moose in the wilderness of Alaska she actually wears a jock strap .
Meghan reveals in chapter 18 , that Sarah Palin , who loves being called " Saracuda " strangely and ersatzly takes on a masculine personality , once she is sitting in some deer blind waiting for an innocent caribou , elk , moose , or reindeer to saunter by .
Palin will spit on the floor , cuss like a sailor , and scratch her third base just as if she 's one of the good old boys .
In chapter 20 , Meghan talks candidly about the so - called weapons of mass destruction that Emperor Bush talked about .
She writes that the only weapons of mass destruction that existed were Georgy Bush , Dicky Cheney , and Donnie Rumsfeld .
Meghan will be starting a 96 - city book - signing tour beginning in early May .
She says that she is already negotiating with Paramount Pictures for the movie rights .
When Miss McCain was asked which is her favorite beer , she smiled and said , " Why it 's my mommy 's beer Budweiser . " *
* Cindy McCain owns one of the largest Budweiser Beer distributorships in the country .
And up until recently , Meghan McCain drove one of her mom's beer trucks .
What If Ahmadinejad Really Won ?
It ’s fast congealing into conventional wisdom that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stole re-election through fraud and that the so - called “ green revolution ” of Mir-Hossein Mousavi – which was based in the country ’s intelligentsia and middle class – got robbed .
Email
Printer friendly
But a strong case can be made that the large turnout , which was estimated at about 85 percent , was the key to a genuine landslide for Ahmadinejad , who is viewed as a friend of more traditional Iranians from the working classes and among the rural peasants .
That is the assessment expressed by Ken Ballen and Patrick Doherty in a Washington Post op - ed citing their findings from extensive polling across Iran in mid-May that detected roughly the same 2 - to - 1 margin in favor of Ahmadinejad that emerged from the final tallies .
Ballen and Doherty also knocked down one of the central arguments cited by analysts who are claiming that Ahmadinejad committed fraud .
That argument is that Mousavi , an Azeri , surely would have won Azeri - dominated districts which instead were recorded as going heavily for Ahmadinejad .
However , Ballen and Doherty reported that “ our survey indicated … that Azeris favored Ahmadinejad by 2 to 1 over Mousavi . ”
Their poll also undercut the widespread media assumption about Internet - savvy youth backing Mousavi .
They found that only 1 in 3 Iranians have access to the Internet and the “ 18 - to - 24 - year - olds comprised the strongest voting bloc for Ahmadinejad of all age groups . ”
Nevertheless , the rush to the “ fraud ” judgment among much of the U.S. news media is shaping the political realities that now confront both Washington and Tehran .
One of the snap media judgments has been that Ahmadinejad ’s “ theft ” of the election proves that hardliners in Israel and neoconservatives in the United States were right all along about the impossibility of dealing rationally with Iran , that President Barack Obama was the " big loser , " and that force is the only option to employ against Iran .
It also has been curious to see U.S. news organizations care suddenly about legitimate elections when most of them ignored , ridiculed or covered - up evidence that George W. Bush stole the U.S. presidential election in 2000 and possibly in 2004 as well .
In Election 2000 , Florida – a state controlled by Bush ’s brother Jeb and Jeb ’s cronies – was the scene of widespread election irregularities .
Then , when a recount was attempted , the Bush campaign sent well - dressed hooligans from Washington to Miami to stage a riot aimed at intimidating vote counters .
Finally , Bush got five partisan Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the counting of votes and award the White House to Bush .
Yet , the U.S. press corps was extraordinarily passive about this well - documented election theft .
Even when it became clear that Al Gore won the popular vote and would have carried Florida if all legal ballots had been counted , major U.S. news organizations , including the New York Times and CNN , misrepresented the facts to protect Bush ’s “ legitimacy . ”
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Gore ’s Victory . ” ]
Similarly , serious irregularities in Election 2004 , especially in the key state of Ohio , were never seriously investigated by the mainstream news media , which instead mocked Internet sites ( including ours ) and citizens groups as “ conspiracy theorists ” for citing some of the bizarre vote tallies favoring Bush .
[ For details , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
Yet , when an election occurs in another country and an “ unpopular ” leader appears to win , an opposite set of rules apply .
Anyone who does n’t immediately accept the assumption of voter fraud is naïve ; every “ conspiracy theory ” is cited respectfully while contrary evidence is downplayed or ignored , for instance the assumption about the Azeri vote that Ballen and Doherty debunked with their poll findings .
Another irony is that Iran 's religious leaders now have ordered an investigation of the fraud allegations in a country not known for its democratic institutions .
That is more than Americans got in 2000 and 2004 .
Robert Parry broke many of the Iran - Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek .

There would be very stiff competition indeed for the literary award of " Most Absurd Lies and Myths About Lincoln . "
In the running would be almost all of Harry Jaffa ’s writing , including the statement in his latest Lincoln book that " Lincoln opposed making voters or jurors of Negroes in the 1850s so that they could be voters and jurors today . "
Or Gabor Borit ’s statement that Lincoln ’s lifelong advocacy of " colonization , " or deportation of black people from America , is an example of " how honest people lie . "
But there is a new entry to the field : an article from the February 9 , 2009 issue of Newsmax.com by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen entitled " What Would He Say to Us Today ? "
It seems as though every time Newt Gingrich , who never served in the military himself , begins making the case for sending other peoples ’ children off to die in another unnecessary war , he starts quoting Lincoln .
A couple of years ago Gingrich wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal in which he advocated a military invasion and occupation of Iran , Syria , Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , and North Korea .
The title of the article was " Lincoln and Bush . "
President Bush should " be like Lincoln , " he said , and initiate five more wars simultaneously .
More recently , Gingrich has been calling for the nuking of North Korea , so it is not surprising to me that he is once again waxing eloquently about Dishonest Abe .
It is well known that the founding fathers feared democracy .
Indeed , in Federalist # 10 James Madison explained that the sole purpose of the Constitution was to create a constitutional republic that would hopefully " restrain the violence of faction , " by which he meant democracy .
Gingrich and Forstchen unwittingly admit that their hero literally destroyed the constitution of the founding fathers by describing the Lincoln Memorial as " his [ Lincoln ’s ] throne " that is " Modeled after Grecian temples " and is " our American temple to democracy . . . "
Greatest Emancipations ... Jim Powell Best Price : $ 3.00 Buy New $ 24.97 ( as of 10:15 EST - Details )
In reality , the Lincoln Memorial is a temple to the idea that government in America is not voluntary , and never will be as long as Lincoln is its primary symbol and as long as Lincoln mythology remains the state ’s cornerstone ideology .
Lincoln micromanaged the murder of some 350,000 fellow Americans , including more than 50,000 civilians , in order to " prove " his point that the central government is indeed not voluntary , the states were never sovereign ( so he said ) , and that any group of citizens who contemplate leaving it will be killed en masse , their cities and towns burned to the ground , and their wealth and personal belongings confiscated by the U.S. Army .
If we standardize for today ’s population , Lincoln ’s killing machine would lead to the death of more than 6 million Americans .
To Gingrich and Fortschen , this is how America became " united . "
To me , it sounds more like how Soviet Russia was " united " in its own " glorious union . "
Do these men really believe that Southerners in 1866 felt " united " with their fellow citizens in the North ?
The two people who were closest to Lincoln were his longtime law partner , William Herndon ( who he affectionately called " Billy " ) and his wife , Mary Todd .
In a biography of Lincoln Herndon wrote of how Lincoln was either an atheist or an agnostic .
As a young man , said Herndon , Lincoln even wrote a book that argued that the Bible was not the word of God and that Jesus was not the son of God .
When he decided to get into politics , the book was burned .
When Herndon was preparing his biography he asked Mrs. Lincoln to comment on Abe ’s " religious " views , and she told him that he never became a Christian .
" Mr. Lincoln , " she said , " had no faith . . . .
He never joined a church . . . he was never a technical Christian . "
( See Edgar Lee Masters , Lincoln the Man , p. 150 ) .
That Lincoln " had no faith " is no secret to the " Lincoln scholars . "
In her book Team of Rivals , the high priestess of the Lincoln Cult , Doris Kearns - Goodwin , acknowledges this fact but adds the usual spin :
We should all feel even more sorry for poor , poor Abe , she says , since he suffered from not believing in an afterlife .
Gingrich and Fortschen mislead us about this by writing that Lincoln " was a man of deep and abiding faith . "
They apparently write this on the basis of the fact that Lincoln , like Bill Clinton , was fond of quoting Scripture in political speeches .
( Recall how Clinton used to clutch that fifty - pound Bible in front of the television cameras every Sunday ? )
Indeed he was .
In his second inaugural address he blamed the whole bloody mess of the war on God , absolving himself of all responsibility by saying the war just " came , " as though he had nothing to do with it .
He also claimed to be able to read the mind of God by asserting that the war was God ’s punishment of all Americans , North and South , for slavery .
He did not attempt to explain why God would not also punish the British , Spanish , French , Dutch , Swedes , and others who were responsible for 96 % of all the slaves that were kidnapped and brought to the Western Hemisphere .
Unlike the Lincoln regime , these countries all ended slavery peacefully , as Jim Powell documents in his excellent book , Greatest Emancipations .

Lincoln is praised by " Lincoln scholars " for having been an obsessive micromanager of the war .
He knew everything .
He knew that Southern civilians were murdered and plundered from the very beginning , even before the Battle of First Manassas commenced .
He authorized the bombing of Southern cities and he was also apparently obsessed with experimenting with larger and larger weapons of mass destruction — to be used on fellow Americans .
He profusely thanked and rewarded officers like Sherman and Sheridan for waging war on civilians , as they did during Sherman ’s March , the burning of Atlanta and Columbia , South Carolina , and the burning of the Shenandoah Valley .
General Sherman wrote that Lincoln " especially enjoyed " his stories of how Southern women , children and old men were terrorized by Sherman ’s " bummers , " as his looting , pillaging , plundering , and raping " soldiers " were called .
But to Gingrich and Forstchen Lincoln had a " deep sense of love and compassion " for everyone .
He even knelt and prayed with a wounded Confederate soldier in a hospital , they claim ; his " eyes filled with pain over the suffering of others " ; and " was known for extreme gentleness to an injured animal . "
They list no sources or references when they write this , only saying that they come from " stories . "
Such stories are completely contradicted by Lincoln ’s actual sociopathological behavior .
Perhaps the most outrageous piece of propaganda in the Gingrich / Forstchen article is their statement that " Lincoln was the first president to invite and socially greet a delegation of African - Americans into the White House . "
They say this to give their readers the impression that Lincoln was enlightened on the issue of race .
He was not .
He was as much a white supremacist as any man alive .
Moreover , the purpose of the White House meeting with the delegation of African - Americans was not to meet and greet , but to urge these men to lead by example and self - deport themselves to Liberia in West Africa .
It is all explained in Lincoln ’s Selected Writings and Speeches , in the entry for August 14 , 1862 .
At this meeting Lincoln told the delegation of free black men that " You and we are different races .
We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races . . . .
This physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both . . . and affords a reason at least why we should be separated . . . .
It is better for us both , therefore , to be separate . "
He then made his sales pitch for the men to deport themselves to Liberia , an offer that they wisely declined .
One would never know about this by reading the Gingrich / Forstchen article .
( Besides , Professor Henry Louis Gates of Harvard has told me that this was not even the first time a black person had entered the White House ) .
Neocons will apparently never stop lying about Lincoln , but we can all stop believing their lies .

Clean - up crews are working to minimise the impact of an oil spill off the coast of Norway .
WWF
The substance is leaking from a freighter that ran aground on an island in the south - east of the country .
According to a local newspaper , the Chinese - owned “ Full City ” was carrying more than 1000 tonnes of oil , when it foundered during a storm .
The coastal area most at risk from the substance is a popular holiday region in summer .
The World Wildlife Fund says birds from a nearby sanctuary are also in danger .
Clean - up crews are placing a barrier around the vessel and in the bay to limit the amount of fuel reaching the shore .
But strong winds and waves of up to six meters are complicating their efforts .
And the substance has reached landfall in some locations .
According to the Coast guard operations centre , there is no immediate danger of the ship breaking up .
But earlier rescue officials called on the company operating the tanker , Hong Kong - based Cosco , to put pressure on the captain to abandon the vessel .
Thehas called for volunteers to help in the clean - up effort .
Meanwhile , the Swedish and Norwegian coast guard are still searching for the crew of a freighter that sank off the west coast of Sweden this morning .
The 2500 ton Norwegian freighter , “ Langeland ” put out distress calls this morning .
Life vests and rafts have been found but there are no signs of the six - man Russian / Ukrainian crew .
Baby boom to migrant mothers ' gloom
By Shan Juan ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-06-24 10:06
Liu Yurong has been ordered by officials to return to her hometown .
She has been told she must travel 1,600 km , put her job at risk and abandon her son .
Why ?
To prove she is not pregnant .
Migrant workers in Lanzhou , capital of northwestern Gansu province , receive free condoms during an AIDS awareness event in Dongfanghong Square .
[ China Daily ]
Like the many female migrant workers who have had children , she must undergo regular tests as part of China 's family planning policy , which was implemented in the 1970s to control the nation 's booming population .
For the past three years , Liu has been earning 1,000 yuan ( $ 145 ) a month at a textile factory in Taizhou , Zhejiang province , and has mailed her pregnancy test results back to the authorities in Lianyuan , a city in Hunan province .
But after a rise in the number of forged documents being reported by family planning offices nationwide , she was ordered to return to be examined in person .
" My boss is not going to allow me to leave , " said Liu , 28 , who lives with her truck driver husband and four - year - old son .
" I might lose my job if I go .
Also , who will take care of my son while I am away ?
" It would cost several hundred yuan to make the journey .
I can not afford to go back .
" My mother - in - law told me family planning officials had visited several times and demanded 2,000 yuan as a deposit , which they threatened to keep if I did n't return . "
The law states families in urban areas are allowed one child , barring special exceptions , while in the countryside mothers can have a second child if their first was a girl .
The policy has prevented 400 million births , the government said .
But for migrant workers , and the family planning officials charged with keeping track of them , it is a major headache .
According to the National Population and Family Planning Commission ( NPFPC ) , by early 2008 , China had 150 million migrant workers , including about 56 million women .
Of these women , at least 57 percent were of " childbearing age " , effectively between 20 , the legal age limit , and 45 years old .
And , due to their ever - mobile nature , the government , worried the rules are being flouted , is trying expanded support projects in areas with large migrant populations .
It follows findings by the NPFPC that , for the past 10 years , almost 65 percent of all " illegal " babies have been born to migrants .
However , they refused to reveal how many violations there had been .
" I ran a huge risk when I took my children to my home village in Anhui province for the Spring Festival , " said Wu Qingxia , one of the violators , who has a son , aged five , and an three - year - old daughter .
" I had to lie to my old neighbors the girl was a friend 's daughter because I was not allowed to have her as my first child was a boy . "
Wu and her husband moved to the city of Wenzhou , Zhejiang , six years ago in the search of a better life .
She explained : " As we were from outside the city , the control by local family planning authorities was relatively loose for us , so we got to have our little girl . "
Her story is not a unique one , according to Fan Yude , deputy director of Qinyuan county family planning bureau in Zhejiang .
" People like
Wu exist in every city in China with a large population of migrant workers , " he said .
" The family planning work situation and capacity varies from place to place , so migrants might actually not be covered or well controlled . "
Compared to the nation 's urban population , farmers tend to hold true to the traditional preference for a male heir .
They also make up a large proportion of the migrant population .
People who live in cities but whose hukou is registered in their hometowns or villages must obtain temporary residency permits in any new city from the local public security bureau .
This enables them to get a job , rent an apartment or start a company .
To have a child , they must then report their marital status to the local family planning administration , which checks the information against a national database to prevent any violations .
But due to gaps in the system , coupled with the frequent migratory habits of workers on short - term contracts , it is by no means foolproof .
Zhang Meijuan , a family planning official for Beijing 's Shijingshan district , said : " In my patch , there are 20 residential communities with large concentrations of migrant workers , and it takes us almost a week to finish collecting and confirming reproduction details in one community .
But when we go back a short time later , the people are already gone .
" This means the information on the database is often out of date .
Our recorded information changes every two to three months . "
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said on Tuesday he welcomes a public debate on proposals to legalize and tax marijuana , which some suggest could provide a lucrative new revenue source for the cash - strapped state .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is pictured during a town hall meeting at the Miguel Contreas Learning Complex in Los Angeles , California , March 19 , 2009 .

The Republican governor , whose term in office expires at the end of next year , was asked about the idea of treating pot like alcohol at an appearance in northern California to promote wildfire preparedness .
“ No , I do n’t think it ’s time for that , but I think it ’s time for a debate , ” he said .
“ And I think we ought to study very carefully what other countries are doing that have legalized marijuana and other drugs , what affect it had on those countries , and are they happy with that decision . ”
The former Hollywood actor , who has admitted smoking marijuana in the past , cited his native Austria as a country where “ they want to roll back some of the decisions that were made in European countries . ”
He said a decision to legalize marijuana , which has been outlawed in the United States since 1937 , should not be made on the basis of raising revenues alone .
Schwarzenegger ’s comments come days after a statewide Field Poll found that 56 percent of California voters support the idea of legalizing cannabis for recreational use and taxing its proceeds .
A bill introduced in the state Legislature by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , a Democrat from San Francisco , would do just that -- permitting taxed sales of marijuana to adults while barring sales to or possession by anyone under age 21 .
A similar regulatory structure already exists for alcoholic beverages .
Ammiano said his proposal would generate up to $ 1.3 billion in revenue for the state , which faces another multibillion - dollar budget shortfall just weeks after a landmark deal closing a $ 42 billion deficit .
He and others who support legalizing pot say such a move also would improve public safety by redirecting law enforcement efforts to more serious crimes and would end environmental damage to public lands used for illicit cannabis cultivation .
But in 2004 , Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that would have eased rules on how much medical marijuana patients can possess in California .
Voters in California , the nation ’s most populous state , became the first to approve the use of marijuana for medical purposes in 1996 , putting the state at odds with federal law .
Under the Bush administration federal agents stepped up raids against medical marijuana dispensaries in California and other states that have passed similar laws .
But U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in March that the Justice Department under President Barack Obama has no plans to prosecute such dispensaries in those states in the future .
However , Obama , who also has acknowledged smoking pot in his younger days , recently dismissed the idea of legalizing marijuana on a national level .
Autopsies have revealed fractures in the legs , hips and arms of Air France Flight 447 victims , injuries that — along with the large pieces of wreckage pulled from the Atlantic — strongly suggest the plane broke up in the air , experts say .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
With more than 400 pieces of debris recovered from the ocean 's surface , the top French investigator expressed optimism about eventually discovering what brought down the plane .
But he also called the search conditions — far from land in very deep water — " one of the worst situations ever known in an accident investigation . "
French investigators are beginning to form " an image that is progressively less fuzzy , " Paul - Louis Arslanian , who runs the French air accident investigation agency BEA , told a news conference Wednesday outside Paris .
" We are in a situation that is a bit more favorable than the first days , " Arslanian said .
" We can say there is a little less uncertainty , so there is a little more optimism .
... ( but ) it is premature for the time being to say what happened . "
A spokesman for Brazilian medical examiners told The Associated Press on Wednesday that fractures were found in autopsies on an undisclosed number of the 50 bodies recovered so far .
The official spoke on condition he not be named due to department rules .
" Typically , if you see intact bodies and multiple fractures — arm , leg , hip fractures — it 's a good indicator of a midflight break up , " said Frank Ciacco , a former forensic expert at the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board .
" Especially if you 're seeing large pieces of aircraft as well . "
The pattern of fractures was first reported yesterday by Brazil 's O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper , which cited unnamed investigators .
The paper also reported that some victims were found with little or no clothing , and had no signs of burns .
" In an in - air break up like we are supposing here , the clothes are just torn away , " said Jack Casey , an aviation safety consultant in Washington , D.C. and a former accident investigator .
Casey also said multiple fractures are consistent with a midair breakup of the plane , which was cruising at about 34,500 feet when it went down .

" Getting ejected into that kind of windstream is like hitting a brick wall — even if they stay in their seats , it is a crushing effect , " Casey said .
When a jet crashes into water mostly intact — such as the Egypt Air plane that hit the Atlantic Ocean after taking off from New York in 1999 — debris and bodies are generally broken into small pieces , Ciacco said .
Lack of burn evidence would not necessarily rule out an explosion , said John Goglia , a former member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board .
Searchers from Brazil , France , the United States and other countries are methodically scanning the surface and depths of the Atlantic for signs of the Airbus A330 that crashed May 31 after running into thunderstorms en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris .
All 228 people aboard were killed .
Brazilian Air Force Col .
Henry Munhoz told reporters Wednesday that several more body parts , as well as pieces of the plane and luggage , were found in the search area by the French amphibian ship Mistral .
Still missing are the plane 's flight data and voice recorders , thought to be deep under water .
French - chartered ships are trolling a search area with a radius of 50 miles , pulling US Navy underwater listening devices attached to 19,700 feet of cable .
The black boxes send out an electronic tapping sound that can be heard up to 1.25 miles away .
U.S. Air Force Col. Willie Berges , commander of the American military forces supporting the search , said the black boxes emit beacons at a unique frequency , virtually guaranteeing that any signal detected would be from the pingers .
" The question becomes if the black box is with the pinger , because they can get separated , " Berges said .
Without the black boxes to help explain what went wrong , the investigation has focused on a flurry of automated messages sent by the plane minutes before it lost contact ; one suggests external speed sensors had iced over , destabilizing the plane 's control systems .
Arslanian said most of the messages appear to be " linked to this loss of validity of speed information . "
He said when the speed information became " incoherent " it affected other systems on the plane .
The automated messages were not alarm calls and no distress call was picked up from the plane , he said .
Air France has replaced the sensors , called Pitot tubes , on all its A330 and A340 aircraft , under pressure from pilots who feared a link to the accident .
What kind of point guard is he ?
We hear it all the time .

But really , what makes a player a “ pass - first ” point guard ?
How carefree must he be with the ball to be considered “ turnover - prone ” ?
Taking an analytical approach to these questions , I decided to bust out an Excel spreadsheet and try to come up with some answers .
Below you ’ll see a graph that attempts to classify the top point guards in the league .
But first , a little background …
I chose to categorize each player based on two stats .
First , to determine if he ’s “ shoot - first ” or “ pass - first , ” I calculated the shot - to - assist ratio for each player .
The bigger the number , the more of a “ shoot - first ” mentality the player has .
Second , to determine whether or not a player is “ turnover - prone , ” I calculated each player ’s assist - to - turnover ratio .
I thought about using turnovers per 48 minutes , but I like the idea of including assists so that playmakers are rewarded for the positive as well as the negative .
Next , I calculated each player ’s Efficiency Per Minute ( EPM ) to see if there is any correlation between these other statistics and the overall efficiency of the player in question .
The last step was to plot each player based on the two ratios .
The graph is a little small , but if you click it , it will take you to a larger version .
Each player is indicated by a separate plot point with his name next to it .
( Duh . )
The blue diamonds represent the top 10 point guards in terms of EPM .
One point guard was chosen per team .
Usually , I went with the player that got the most starts at the position .
The further the player is to the right on the ( horizontal ) x- axis the higher his shot - to - assist ratio and the more of a “ shoot - first ” mentality he has .
Conversely , the further the player is to the left , the more of a “ pass - first ” point guard he is .
On the ( vertical ) y- axis , the further the player is towards the top , the better job he does of taking care of the ball ( in comparison to the number of assists he posts ) .
Players towards the bottom of the axis have poor assist - to - turnover ratios .
Each axis is set at the average of the 30 players included in the study .
The shot - to - assist ratio average is 2.12 , while the average assist - to - turnover ratio is 2.66 .
A few interesting things to note …
As a whole , the data set takes on a downward slope .
Intuitively , this makes sense .
“ Shoot - first ” point guards are generally that way because that is their strength – scoring the ball .
They are generally not as adept at being in the playmaker role , so they wo n’t have a good assist - to - turnover ratio .
Conversely , players that are “ pass - first ” are that way because playmaking is their specialty .
They handle the ball well and have good vision .
The sweet spot is in the second ( top - left ) quadrant .
Seven of the top EPM performers at the position – Jose Calderon , Jason Kidd , Chris Paul , Rajon Rondo , Deron Williams , Steve Nash and Chauncey Billups – all have a better - than - average assist - to - turnover ratio and a “ pass - first ” menality .
The other three top 10 EPM performers – Jameer Nelson , Tony Parker and Devin Harris – are reasonably close to that top - left quadrant .
The 10 point guards in the top - left quadrant play for teams that had a combined record of 471-349 ( .574 ) in the regular season and seven of those teams made the playoffs .
These facts are telling .
Jameer Nelson and Tony Parker are n’t in the ideal quadrant , but they are a good fit for their teams .
Think about it – Nelson and Parker play with two of the best big men in the game in Dwight Howard and Tim Duncan .
Point guards that play with a great big man will find that assists are a little tougher to come by .
Typically , when someone feeds Howard or Duncan , they take their time in the post before they make their move , so the player that passed them the ball does n’t necessarily get the assist .
Plus , anyone can feed the post – it does n’t have to be the point guard .
Think about those seven players in the top - left quadrant for a moment .
For the most part , they play with jump shooters ( and are therefore more likely to rack up assists ) .
The Magic are built in the Hakeem Olajuwon - era Rockets mold .
They have a dominant big man and the idea is to surround him with great jumpshooters to keep defenses honest .
Conversely , Parker oftentimes takes advantage of the amount of attention that defenses pay to Duncan to get to the rim .
When he attacks the hole , he ’s trying to score and will only pass if the defense forces him to .
Finally , it ’s no coincidence that Nelson and Parker are two of the most efficient scorers in this study .
In terms of FG % , Parker is first and Nelson is tied for third .
Both players shoot better than 50 % from the field , so it makes sense that they ’d have a “ shoot - first ” mentality .
Ramon Sessions is a keeper .
Luke Ridnour got more starts than Sessions , but I like Sessions more and the Bucks have to decide whether or not to sign the up - and - coming point guard to an extension this summer .
Here ’s my pitch :
He has the # 11 EPM ( just behind Chauncey Billups ) and is on the verge of becoming a very good point guard .
His Player Efficiency Rating ( PER ) of 17.65 is # 13 amongst qualified PGs .
Throw in the fact that the NBA is becoming increasingly dependent on good point guard play , and the 23 - year - old looks like a great ( and relatively cheap ) prospect .
GM John Hammond has to find a way to keep this kid .
Baron Davis is n’t a “ shoot - first ” point guard ?!?
Apparently not .
His career shot - to - assist ratio is 2.05 , so even when we consider his entire body of work , he ’s still leans “ pass - first . ”
This is underlined by his 2008 - 09 campaign , where he was even more “ pass - first . ”
Derrick
Rose turns the ball over too much .
I had n’t yet looked at his numbers , but I could tell this about Rose just watching the Bulls / Celtics series .
Every so often he throws a pass that might have made it in college , but is n’t going to make it in the NBA .
Most rookie point guards struggle with this , so I ’d assume that Rose will start to work his way into that top - left quadrant ( or at least the top - right quadrant ) in the next year or two .
In fact , his assist - to - turnover ratio rose from 2.52 before the All - Star break to 2.56 after .
I think he ’ll eventually settle in somewhere near Nelson and Parker .
He seems like more of a scorer than a pure playmaker , partly do to his incredible ability to finish at the rim .
Where would a healthy Gilbert Arenas fit in ?
Remember him ?
Agent Zero has only played 15 games in the last two years , so it ’s not really fair to judge him based on those numbers .
To get an idea of where he ’d land , I calculated his ratios for the 2006 - 07 season .
You ’ll find him bunched with Jamal Crawford , Mo Williams , Randy Foye and Aaron Brooks in the bottom - right quadrant , which makes sense because those are all “ shoot - first ” point guards .
Is Mo Williams ’ position on the chart due to his playing with LeBron ?
After plotting Arenas , it made me wonder about Mo . He was one of the top assist men in the league in his last year in Milwaukee .
How does the 2007 - 08 Mo Williams compare with the 2008 - 09 version ?
It turns out that the ’07 version of Mo Williams is a lot like the ’08 Devin Harris , which makes sense considering that both players are very capable scorers and playmakers , but at heart are “ shoot - first . ”
CONCLUSION
I think the big thing to take away from this is that it ’s generally better to have a “ pass - first ” point guard who takes care of the ball .
However , if you have a dominant big man ( or a superstar wing like LeBron or Kobe ) , a “ shoot - first ” point guard can be just as effective , especially if he can shoot it like Nelson or Williams , or get to the rim like Parker does .
Is there anything that I missed ?

In Haydn ’s commemorative year , it ’s still — mostly Mozart
Franz Josef Haydn , arguably Austria ’s greatest composer ( if not its best ) died 200 years ago today .
He was the biggest composer of his time , and he basically invented the symphony — and the symphony orchestra — as we know it today .
And yet , as the newspaper article above mentions , he ’s still an also - ran in his native land , where Mozart is still the number one tourist attraction .
If Mozart had never lived , the world would certainly be poorer , and the “ M ” section of the Classical bins in the record store would be a lot smaller .
But if Haydn had never lived , classical music as we know it would be radically different .
I ’m a huge Mozart fan , and I have no problem stating categorically that he had a genius that Haydn simply did n’t match ( Haydn himself had no problem saying so either ) .
But Mozart was n’t an innovator , let alone a revolutionary .
He was , simply , the very best at composing within the established style — the style largely established by Haydn .

As I get older , I find it fascinating how I remember some things from my past so vividly , while other seemingly important experiences have completely faded from my memory .
Eating my first scone as a child I remember it like it was yesterday .
We had flown to England to visit my grandparents who lived in Yeovil , and they had taken us on a day trip to explore Bath .
In the afternoon we stopped at a restaurant for tea and scones .
Small round scones were served on a pretty tiered cake stand , alongside pots of jam and a bowl of Devon cream .
I remember splitting my scone in half and spreading each half with jam and lots of clotted cream .
I could n't stop eating them .
The combination of a soft and flaky scone with sweet jam and the wonderful creamy richness of Devon Cream was delicious .
And forever after , I like to eat my scones with jam .
So I decided to make a scone that has the jam baked right inside the scone .
No more cutting the scones in half and spreading them with jam after they are baked .
They are great to eat on - the - go .
And of course , they are excellent with a dollop of Devon Cream on top .
Scones are easy to make .
I do n't use a mixer .
I simply mix the dry ingredients together , cut in the butter , and then stir in the wet ingredients .
It is important not to over mix the dough as you do n't want a tough scone .
Use cold butter and you can " cut " the butter into the flour mixture using a pastry blender , two knives , or even your fingertips .
You can fill the scones with any flavor of jam or preserves , and it can be homemade or store bought .
I have used my Homemade Raspberry Jam in this recipe which has a lovely tart and tangy raspberry flavor with just the right amount of sweetness .
It is so easy to make and since this is a Refrigerator Jam there is n't any canning involved .

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper .
In a large bowl , whisk together the flour , sugar , baking powder and salt .
Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives .
The mixture should look like coarse crumbs .
In a bowl whisk the cream with the beaten egg and vanilla .
Add this mixture to the flour mixture .
Stir until the flour mixture is moistened and a dough is starting to form .
Do not over mix .
Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead dough gently four or five times and then divide the dough in half ( about 290 grams for each half ) .
Pat or roll each half of the dough into a circle that is about 8 inches ( 20 cm ) round .
Egg Wash :
In a small bowl whisk the egg and cream .
Spread the jam on one round of the dough , leaving about a one inch ( 2.5 cm ) border .
Brush the border with the egg wash .
Then place the second round of dough on top of the jam , gently sealing the edges .
Crimp the edges of the dough with the tines of a fork .
Cut this circle in half , then cut each half into 4 pie-shaped wedges ( triangles ) .
Place the scones on the baking sheet .
Lightly brush the tops of the scones with the egg wash .
( This helps to brown the tops of the scones during baking . )
Bake for about 18 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a scone comes out clean .
Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool .
If desired , garnish with a dollop of Devon cream or softly whipped cream .
T hese scones are best the day they are made , but can be stored at room temperature for a couple of days or they can be frozen .
Makes 8 scones .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As complaints mount about President Obama 's foreclosure prevention program , the administration is ratcheting up the pressure on mortgage servicers .
Financial executives will meet with Treasury Department and administration housing officials on July 28 to discuss how the loan modification and refinancing plan has been implemented .
The administration plans to grill servicers that have done few modifications or have had many complaints .
Officials also want financial institutions to hire more people and train them better , expand their call centers , and send more mailings to eligible borrowers , according to a letter sent to servicers last week .
The government also said servicers need to establish a way for borrowers to contest their treatment or denial .
" There is a general need for servicers to devote substantially more resources to this program for it to fully succeed and achieve the objectives we all share , " according to the letter , signed by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan .
" We are asking all servicers expand their servicing capacity and improve the execution quality of loan modifications . "
Loan servicers ' efforts will be made public on Aug. 4 , when the Obama administration plans to start issuing monthly progress reports .
The updates will include data for each servicer participating Obama 's $ 75 billion program .
Specifically , they will feature the number of trial modification offers extended and underway by each institution , as well as the number of final modifications and the success of those adjustments .
So far , participating servicers have extended 325,000 loan modification offers and have 160,000 three - month trial adjustments underway , said Herbert Allison , who heads Treasury 's financial stability efforts , at a Senate Banking Committee hearing Thursday .
Under the plan , eligible borrowers who are in or at risk of default may be able to lower their monthly payments to no more than 31 % of their pre-tax income through a loan modification .
The modifications are made permanent after the homeowner makes three on - time payments .
Servicers have also refinanced 43,000 loans under the administration 's program that allows people with little or no equity in their home to refinance and take advantage of today 's low mortgage rates .
People can participate even if they have loans of up to 125 % of the value of their property , as long as they meet other criteria .
" Even though we are making rapid progress , we think we can do even more , " Allison told lawmakers .
Many industry insiders fear that the foreclosure crisis in outpacing efforts to help troubled borrowers .
Thursday 's hearing came on the same day as a report revealed a record 1.53 million properties were in the foreclosure process during the first half of 2009 , up 15 % more than the same period of 2008 .
One out of every 84 homes received at least one filing between January and June , according to RealtyTrac .
The Obama program has been plagued by problems since its February debut .
As soon as most servicers started processing applications in April and May , borrowers began reporting that their paperwork was being lost , their calls were going unreturned and decisions on their cases were being delayed .
" This is disgraceful , " said Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , head of the banking committee .
" Why am I still reading about lost files , under - staffed and under - trained servicers , and hours spent on hold on the phone ? "
When the president unveiled his program on Feb. 18 , he said it could help up to 9 million people .
Allison said that goal was still attainable by the end of 2012 .
To achieve those figures , the administration is trying to make sure borrowers in need know where to turn .
It is pressing banks to do more outreach , as well as holding its own educational events .
Among the issues holding up loan modifications are second liens , which are often owned by banks as opposed to investors .
The administration issued revised guidelines in April saying that participating servicers had to modify or extinguish second liens if they adjust the first .
But banks are waiting for additional information , which officials say will be available in coming weeks .
After lawmakers grilled administration officials , the committee heard from a borrower and consumer advocates reiterating problems with the program .
Mortgage executives from Wells Fargo and Bank of America also spoke , defended their efforts to assist troubled homeowners .
Wells Fargo was in the process of finalizing 52,000 loan modifications under the president 's program , as of June 30 , said Mary Coffin , head of mortgage servicing for the bank .
Only 55 % of its seriously delinquent borrowers are eligible for it .
During the first half of this year , it boosted its default team staff by 54 % to 11,500 .
Some 80,000 Bank of America customers , meanwhile , are in trial modifications or are responding to offers , said Allen Jones , the bank 's default management executive .
Bank of America also has funded nearly 40,000 refinances applications .
It has 7,400 people dedicated to home retention , double the number a year ago .
They respond to an average of 80,000 calls a day .
A new report released on June 25th shows that the calorie requirements of the human population as a whole will sore by about 40 percent until 2050 , at a rate that is completely unsustainable by existing agricultural practices and food production capabilities .
Planning and serious investment in agriculture is therefore a must for the world as a whole , moving past the petty bickering between nations .
Otherwise , billions of people living under the standard of poverty could die on account of lacking the basic necessities that keep each and every one of us alive today .
“ We are at a crossroads in terms of our investments in agriculture and what we will need to do to feed the world population by 2050 , ” the co-author of the new report , Nelson Institute 's Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment researcher David Zaks , explains .
The paper was produced by the Deutsche Bank , together with experts from the University of Wisconsin - Madison 's Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies .
It also underlines the fact that , over the next few decades , global demands for food , fiber and fuel will grow at an alarming rate , if predicted population raise patterns continue .
“ There will come a point in time when we will have difficulties feeding world population , ” Zaks adds .
The expert is a graduate student whose research focuses on global agriculture , in terms of visible patterns , trends and processes involved with feeding the Earth 's population .
According to estimates , the world 's population will exceed nine billion people by 2050 , a 2.5 - billion increase from the numbers today .
Additionally , the growing threats of climate change and global warming will further aggravate the situation , causing even more people to become poor and starve .
“ The solution is only going to come about by changing the way we use land , changing the things that we grow and changing the way that we grow them , ” Zaks believes .
New types of technologies , used on land that is now just marginally included in the crop planning , could represent a possible solution to the problem .
However , even these actions will only help us in the short term , the analyst says .
“ First , we have to improve yield .
Next , we have to bring in more land in agriculture while considering the environmental implications , and then we have to look at technology , ” he explains .
“ What is required to meet the challenge of feeding a growing population in a warming world is to boost yield through highly sophisticated land management with precision irrigation and fertilization methods .
Farmers , markets and governments will have to look at a host of options including increased irrigation , mechanization , fertilization and the potential benefits of biotech crops , ” Nelson Institute graduate Bruce Kahn , who is now a senior investment analyst at the Deutsche Bank , adds .

A team of journalists investigating the global electronic waste business has unearthed a security problem too .
In a Ghana market , they bought a computer hard drive containing sensitive documents belonging to U.S. government contractor Northrop Grumman .
The drive had belonged to a Fairfax , Virginia , employee who still works for the company and contained " hundreds and hundreds of documents about government contracts , " said Peter Klein , an associate professor with the University of British Columbia , who led the investigation for the Public Broadcasting Service show Frontline .
He would not disclose details of the documents , but he said that they were marked " competitive sensitive " and covered company contracts with the Defense Intelligence Agency , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Transportation Security Agency .
The data was unencrypted , Klein said in an interview .
The cost ? US $ 40 … " It was a wonderful , ironic twist , " Klein said .
" Here were these contracts being awarded based on their ability to keep the data safe . "
Off - camera , sources in Ghana told the reporters that data thieves routinely scour these hard drives for sensitive information , Klein said .

Comic
Con 2009 is nearing an end , and though I am sadly not in attendance , the majority of my Twitter feed ( and I ’m pretty sure about half of the Internet ) is busy partying down with what seems like every geek - friendly celebrity you can tick off on your fingers .
However , thanks to the joy of camera phones and YouTube , you too can get the Comic Con experience ( well , without the smell , something noted by Megan Fox & co. in one of the videos below ) .
There is obviously much more where this came from , so just pop into YouTube and type in “ comic con 2009 ” if you want more ( and if you ’re into Twilight , you ’ll be very happy with the search results ) .
But here were some things that I personally found interesting out of the crowd …
David Tennant Kisses John Barrowman .
Yes , they ’re plugging Doctor Who and Torchwood , and yes , it ’s wonderful that both are on BBC America ( including , as Tennant points out , the “ legal ” American premiere of “ Planet of the Dead ” ) , but nothing gets a room of fangirls screaming quite like an impromptu snog .
Cue it up to about 4:55 – and John ’s reaction is pretty hilarious .
Megan
Fox gets a little dirty and geeky .
Megan Fox ( and others involved with Jennifer ’s Body , like writer Diablo Cody ) are interviewed , and Megan talks frankly about virginity and Princess Leia costumes .
Apparently last year she went to the con just for the heck of it – and avoided being accosted by fans because she ’s so short .
Though I think her geek popularity has skyrocketed in the past year so I bet she could no longer manage that .
The cast of Family Guy love each other .
Really .
A lot .
Maybe a little too much .
Jim Parsons on Rock - Paper - Scissors - Lizard - Spock .
Parsons , who plays Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory , admits that Rock - Paper - Scissors - Lizard - Spock is even harder to master than complex physics explanations .
Wil Wheaton & Felicia Day on Twitter .
Wil Wheaton joins the cast of The Guild in talking about how Twitter used to be cooler before “ big deal ” celebrities got ahold of it .
By the way , since you ca n’t see it in the video , I feel obligated to link to Felicia ’s hot outfit ( pictured with Neil Gaiman , Wil Wheaton , and Amanda Palmer of The Dresden Dolls ) .
For our readers who were at the con , who was the coolest person you met ?

VANCOUVER – Marc Emery will stay on as president of the B.C. Marijuana Party while in a U.S. prison .
The pot activist announced earlier this week that he plans to plead guilty to one of three drug - related charges against him — one count of distributing marijuana — in a Seattle courtroom in August .
He likely will be sentenced in September or October .
Despite the possibility that he ’ll be in prison for anywhere for three to six years , Emery said he can continue to run the party .
“ It ’ll be affected by my absence but I ’ll still be president and party leader , ” Emery said .
He said the party will keep on as it has , supporting the Green Party at the provincial level and supporting Green and NDP candidates in the next federal election .
Gary Mauser , who has taught courses on marketing in politics at Simon Fraser University , said the media attention earned by Emery ’s incarceration could benefit the party .
“ Minor parties live and die by the headlines , ” Mauser said .
“ The more headlines they get , the more votes they get . ”
If Emery is in prison for an extended amount of time , however , it could hurt the party , Mauser said .
“ The fact that he ’s in jail means he ca n’t campaign and he ca n’t be flamboyant , ” he said .
Emery said his supporters — including his wife Jodie Emery — are disappointed by his plan to plead guilty but realize it was the best option .
Emery was facing extradition to the United States on the charges , which relate to a mail - order business selling marijuana seeds to people in the U.S. and Canada from 1998 to 2005 .
He said the prosecutor probably will ask for five to eight years but his lawyers will try to get a lower sentence .
He concedes that he will probably spend some time in a U.S. prison .
“ I ’m resigned , ” Emery said .
“ I ’m just prepping for everything . ”
That includes making sure Jodie is prepared to run their business , Cannabis Culture Magazine , which includes a website , a YouTube T.V. network called POT - TV and an online store .
Jodie faces a number of challenges , including struggles with the City of Vancouver over the business licence .
She said she is nervous because Marc has handled most of the business dealings up until now .
“ He understands all that , ” Jodie said .
“ Whereas I need a little encouragement to not get dismayed . ”
But mostly she is upset at the thought of losing her partner even though she understands why he intends to plead guilty .
“ I ’m spending a lot of time trying not to think about it , ” she said .
“ But I ’d rather have him back in five years than not seeing him again . ”
Jodie plans to run in the next federal election on behalf of the Green Party in Vancouver South , against current MP Ujjal Dosanjh .
She was the Green Party candidate for Vancouver - Fraserview in the B.C. provincial election of May 2009 , but lost to Liberal Kash Heed , who was appointed solicitor general Wednesday .

After Global Gaming Factory ( GGF ) announced its intention to buy The Pirate Bay , the public was left wondering what the site 's future would look like .
Today it was confirmed that sharing on the new site will come with a cost , as the new owners plan to charge the users of the site a monthly fee .
Thus far the plans revealed by GGF concerning the future of the site and tracker have been rather vague and uncertain .
However , today the freshly appointed Wayne Rosso – who has previous experience with failing P2P services – came out with a few crucial additional details on the site ’s future business model .
For years
The Pirate Bay ’s users have been able to share files without censorship or charges , but this is all about to change .
Rosso said that under the new management , the 3.7 million Pirate Bay users ( or whatever userbase remains ) will have to pay a monthly fee to access the site .
The money collected from user subscriptions and advertising revenue will then be used to pay off the copyright holders .
The exact monthly fee is yet to be decided , but Rosso did confirm that the more files people share , the lower it will be .
“ The more of your computer resources you contribute to the network , the less you pay down to zero , ” Rosso told Cnet .
“ The user is in control . ”
In addition , GGF hopes to cut deals with ISPs .
“ We hope to introduce a new BitTorrent technology that will optimize ISP traffic , ” Rosso said .
“ We can save ISPs up to 80 percent of their resources .
Half of the Internet traffic is file sharing and half of that traffic is Pirate Bay . ”
Rosso conveniently fails to mention that a Pirate Bay where users have to pay for access will not be generating much traffic at all , so this part of GGF ’s business model has to be rethought .
BitTorrent does not depend on The Pirate Bay , and new trackers have already lined up to take over its job .
Details about the actual acquisition of The Pirate Bay are still scarce .
Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak that GGF will get the domain names for thepiratebay ( under all the tlds they exist ) and a copy of the code and the database .
If all goes well the transfer of ownership will take place at the end of July .
GGF has to raise $ 7.8 million in funding in order to buy the site .
After that , the share holders – who ’ve seen a drop in the stock price after the announced buy - out – have to vote in favor of the deal .

Twenty - three - year - old Navy vet Joseph Christopher Rocha , who served in the Middle East , says rumors about him being gay led to humiliation and abuse , from being duct - taped and locked in a dog kennel to being forced to simulate oral sex with other men — where he was then criticized for not doing it well enough .
The whole scene was videotaped , he tells YouthRadio .
Three years after a Navy investigation into the conduct of other soldiers , Rocha was informed all charges would be dropped .
Do n’t Ask Don’t
Tell does n’t just force honorable gay men and women from hiding their sexuality — it creates an environment of tolerated harassment and torture of our servicemembers .
In a statement to the Navy about what happened , Rocha acknowledged he is gay .
He was discharged .
The men who assaulted him continue to serve our country .

Obama administration ’s new moves to block release of torture documents
By Tom Eley
12 June 2009
The Obama administration ’s efforts in court to suppress the release of evidence linking top Bush administration officials to the torture of “ terror ” detainees intensified this week .
On Thursday , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) launched a broad lawsuit it believes will establish a further link between the Bush White House and the torture of detainees .
The suit , filed in US District Court in Manhattan , demands the release of all documentation relating to the “ harsh interrogation ” techniques used on prisoners at US military and Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) prisons .
It names the CIA , Department of Defense , Department of State , and the Department of Justice as defendants .
Obama administration officials have not publicly commented on the lawsuit .
Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU ’s National Security Project , said the new court action was a response to recent revelations linking the Bush White House to torture .
Until recently , the ACLU “ did not consider the possibility that lawyers in the Justice Department and people at the highest levels of the Bush administration were engaged in developing and implementing a far - reaching and brutal torture program , ” Jaffer said .
“ That is something that was a shock to us , just like it was a shock to most other people . ”
On Monday , CIA Director Leon Panetta made a court filing in response to a separate ACLU lawsuit , in which he expressed the Obama administration ’s opposition to the release of documents related to 92 interrogation videotapes the agency ordered destroyed in 2005 .
The tapes depicted the use of the CIA ’s “ harsh interrogation ” methods , including waterboarding .
Panetta is requesting that about 580 documents remain classified .
Among these are cables from field agents to top CIA and perhaps White House officials describing interrogation sessions , e-mail communications discussing the legal implications and potential public reaction to the destruction of torture videotapes , as well as notes written after agents viewed the films .
The destroyed video tapes included footage of the torture of Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , accused of organizing the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 , and Abu Zubaydah , who the CIA claims was a senior Al Qaeda operative when he was abducted from Pakistan in 2002 .
Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times in one month at a secret “ black site ” prison in 2002 .
The tapes ’ destruction is the subject of a separate criminal investigation by federal prosecutor John H. Durham .
The CIA destroyed the tapes in violation of a court decision ordering it to release or identify all records related to its interrogation practices .
Last month the CIA said it could not comply with a court order demanding the release of the documents because to do so would compromise Durham ’s federal investigation .
When US District Court Judge Alvin Hellerstein then demanded that the Obama administration provide an affidavit from Durham stating that to be the case , the CIA dropped the argument , and a US government attorney said that a “ senior government official ” — Panetta — would soon provide the court a declaration explaining why the CIA could not release the documents .
In his 24 - page court filing , Panetta wrote that to make public any document related to the tapes and their destruction would cause “ exceptionally grave damage to the national security ” by giving “ ready - made ammunition for Al Qaeda propaganda . ”
In effect , Panetta is admitting that new revelations about the CIA ’s torture program would endanger American imperialism ’s efforts in the Middle East and Central Asia by further exposing before the world , and the American public , the criminal nature of that project .
Panetta also borrowed an argument from former Vice President Dick Cheney , claiming that the release of the documents would allow “ terrorists ” to prepare themselves for US interrogation techniques .
“ The information in these documents would provide future terrorists with a guidebook on how to evade such questioning , ” the CIA chief said .
Finally , Panetta claimed that exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act related to national security allow the CIA to suppress the extensive communications between agents in the field and CIA headquarters , regarding the torture of Zubaydah .
The agency had previously provided an index of the communications , but their content remains sealed .
Panetta ’s move to suppress the CIA torture documents is the latest in a series of interventions by the Obama administration aimed at continuing , or defending , the illegal practices of the Bush administration in “ the war on terror . ”
* On May 15 , Obama announced his decision to resume military commission trials for 13 Guantánamo Bay inmates .
The trials will start after Congress authorizes minor changes to the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , which gave legal sanction to the tribunal system that former President George W. Bush first put in place by executive fiat at the end of 2001 .
* On May 13 , Obama announced that he would attempt to maintain as classified dozens of photographs depicting the torture and abuse of prisoners at US facilities in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantánamo .
Obama had earlier indicated his consent for the photos ’ release , ordered by the US Court of Appeals .
In reversing himself , Obama explained that top generals had objected to the photos ’ publication , claiming that it would jeopardize ongoing US military operations .
Obama has since appealed the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court , and has also asked Congress to pass legislation that would legalize the photos ’ suppression .
Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have attached legislation to the supplemental war funding bills for Iraq and Afghanistan that would block the release of photos showing US personnel torturing prisoners .
* In April , Obama complied with a court order and released a series of Bush Justice Department memos that attempted to establish a pseudo - legal rationale for torture .
After elements close to the military - intelligence apparatus , including former Vice President Cheney , attacked the memos ’ release , Obama promised that there would be no investigation or prosecution of Bush administration officials or CIA agents who ordered or carried out torture .
Obama has even moved to block Congressional efforts to organize a “ truth commission ” whitewash .
* Since his inauguration , Obama officials have intervened in a number of court cases to block judicial scrutiny of Bush administration practices .
In early February , the Obama administration invoked the “ state secrets ” argument in an attempt to quash a lawsuit by five victims of extraordinary rendition against an airline subsidiary of Boeing , which had profited from the men ’s abduction .
Less than a week later , the Justice Department again invoked state secrets in San Francisco federal court when it filed papers to block an order by United States District Judge Vaughn R. Walker reinstating the claim of the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation that it was the target of government wiretapping .
In an effort to stop the Supreme Court from ruling on the Bush administration ’s practice of imprisoning US citizens and legal residents as “ enemy combatants ” without charge or trial , in late February the Obama Justice Department brought separate criminal charges against the last individual held in the US on this basis , Salehn Kahla al - Marri .

A family in Saudi Arabia has taken a genie to court , alleging theft and harassment , according to local media .
The lawsuit filed in Shariah court accuses the genie of leaving them threatening voicemails , stealing their cell phones and hurling rocks at them when they leave their house at night , said Al - Watan newspaper .
An investigation was under way , local court officials said .
" We have to verify the truthfulness of this case despite the difficulty of doing so , " Sheikh Amr Al Salmi , the head of the court , told Al - Watan .
" What makes this case and complaint more interesting is that it was n't filed by just one person .
Every member of the family is part of this case . "
The family , which has lived in the same house near the holy city of Medina for 15 years , said it became aware of the spirit in the past two years .
" We began hearing strange noises , " the head of the family , who requested anonymity , told Al - Watan .
" In the beginning , we did n't take it seriously , but after that , stranger things started happening and the children got really scared when the genie began throwing stones . "
A local charity has moved the family to a temporary residence while a court investigates , the newspaper said .
In Islamic cultures , a belief in genies , or jinns , is common .
Genies not only appear in pre-Islamic fiction such as " Arabian Nights , " but are also mentioned in the Quran .
Many Saudis believe invisible genies live among them and are capable of demonic possession and revenge .

All About Saudi Arabia
The State Department confirmed today that as many as 1,350 Iraqi Palestinians – once the well - treated guests of Saddam Hussein and now at outs with much of Iraqi society – will be resettled in the US , mostly in southern California , starting this fall .
It will be the largest - ever resettlement of Palestinian refugees into the US – and welcome news to the Palestinians who fled to Iraq after 1948 but who have had a tough time since Mr. Hussein was deposed in 2003 .
Targeted by Iraqi Shiites , the mostly - Sunni Palestinians have spent recent years in one of the region 's roughest refugee camps , Al Waleed , near Iraq 's border with Syria .
" Really for the first time , the United States is recognizing a Palestinian refugee population that could be admitted to the US as part of a resettlement program , " says Bill Frelick , refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch in Washington .
Given the US 's past reluctance to resettle Palestinians – it accepted just seven Palestinians in 2007 and nine in 2008 – the effort could ruffle some diplomatic feathers .
For many in the State Department and international community , the resettlement is part of a moral imperative the US has to clean up the refugee crisis created by invading Iraq .
The US has already stepped up resettlement of Iraqis , some who have struggled to adjust to life in America .
The resettlement of Iraqi Palestinians is " an important gesture for the United States to demonstrate that we 're not heartless , " says Alon Ben-Meir , a professor of international relations and Middle Eastern studies at New York University .
But some critics say the State Department is sloughing off its problems onto American cities , especially since in this case the Palestinians were sympathizers of Hussein , who was deposed by the US .
" This is politically a real hot potato , " says Mark Krikorian , director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies in Washington , adding , " [ A] merica has become a dumping ground for the State Department 's problems – they 're tossing their problems over their head into Harrisburg , Pa. , or Omaha , Neb . "
Saddam 's guests
Palestinian refugees came to Iraq in successive waves over several decades , first in 1948 , then in 1967 , and in 1991 .
They were treated well under Hussein but were also used to attack Israeli policies , and their presence was resented by many Iraqis .
After Hussein was deposed in 2003 , many of these Palestinians were driven out of their homes and now live " at the mercy of the weather " in rough camps along the Syrian and Jordanian border , says Mr. Ben-Meir .
The number of Palestinians in Iraq has fallen from around 34,000 to an estimated 15,000 , with about 2,773 living in camps , according to the State Department .
The US , which takes in about 80,000 refugees annually , hopes to bring 17,000 Iraqi refugees this year .
Categorized as Iraqi refugees
While the US generally does n't accept Palestinians , Todd Pierce , a spokesman for the State Department 's Bureau of Population , Refugees and Migration , says that the Iraqi population of Palestinians falls under a different category from those in Gaza and the West Bank .
Each applicant will be carefully scrutinized for terrorist ties , he adds .
The US reluctance to accept Palestinians is because it " does n't want the refugee program to become an issue in its relationship with Israel , " says a diplomat in the region , who requested anonymity because he is not cleared to talk to the press .
But these Palestinians , he says , will be processed as refugees from Iraq .
Mr. Krikorian says the US should be the last refuge for those fleeing persecution .
Only Jordan of all the Arab countries routinely grants citizenship to Palestinian refugees , he notes .
More recently , says Mr. Frelick , Jordan has also shut its borders to Palestinians coming from Iraq .
Frelick , who has visited a camp on the Jordanian border , said the Iraqi Palestinians are " apolitical , " and " basically desperate , scared , miserable , and ready to just get out of Iraq . "
Ancient Egyptians used to call it the gemstone of the rising sun .
This stone is quite well known for its mystical properties and also quite well known for its powers related to anxiety , speech articulation enhancement and to bring harmony in marriage and relationships .
The stone was widely used in jewelry by the Romans and Greek .
Egyptians have also been mining that stone nearly 1500 BC back .
The stone was mined in the areas around Red Sea .
Usually , the mining of this charming stone is done at night as it becomes more prominent because of its natural glow at night .
Egyptians miners also believed that peridot could be seen even in the natural sun rays .
Many renowned personalities throughout the history had quite an impressive collection of that stone .
Cleopatra and Sultans of Ottoman were quite well known for such collections .
In Himalayan mountain regions peridot was abundantly found and its powdered form was used to treat asthma and fever in these areas .
People of this region also believed that if something was drunk in a goblet made of peridot could enhance the potency of the drug taken with it .
Pirates also used peridot to keep themselves away from evil spirits .
Peridot is one of those stones that even men have been wearing in jewelry for quite some time , as they believe that this stone can be very effective for their vitality and strength .
Peridot is available in a wide range of colors including yellow green , sharp green and olive green .
It bends and splits rays in such a way that when light passes through it , it gets a sleepy and velvety appearance .
A rich glow with impressive luster could also be seen in this stone .
In Pakistan a really exciting new deposit of this stone has been found few years back .
These Pakistani Peridots are quite unique in their appearance and beauty and they are no doubt , the finest perditos that have ever been seen .
This new mine has been found in the Nanga Parbat region in that is located in west of Himalayan Mountains .
Medical personnel committed a " gross breach of medical ethics " by taking part in torture in Guantánamo , a leaked International Committee of the Red Cross document has revealed .
The 40 - page confidential report , written in 2007 , describes how medical staff working for the CIA monitored prisoners ' vital signs to make sure they did not drown while being subjected to waterboarding , during which water is poured over a cloth placed over a person 's nose and mouth .
Medical personnel were also said to be present when prisoners were shackled in a " stress standing position " .
The detainees were " monitored by health personnel who in some instances recommended stopping the method of ill - treatment , or recommended its continuation , but with adjustments " , according to the report .
The Red Cross concluded : " The alleged participation of health personnel in the interrogation process and , either directly or indirectly , in the infliction of ill - treatment constituted a gross breach of medical ethics and , in some cases , amounted to participation in torture and / or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment . "
As well as the monitoring of specific methods of ill - treatment , the report said , other health personnel were alleged to have directly participated in the interrogation process .
One detainee alleged that a health person threatened that medical care would be conditional upon cooperation with interrogation .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the self - confessed mastermind of the September 11 attacks , alleged to the ICRC that on several occasions the waterboarding was stopped " on the intervention of a health person who was present in the room each time this procedure was used " .
Mohammed , who pleaded guilty last year to the September 11 attacks , said he gave a lot of false information during the harshest period of his interrogation .
" Im sure that the false information I was forced to invent in order to make the ill - treatment stop wasted a lot of their time and led to several false red-alerts being placed in the US , " he told the Red Cross .
In another case , Encep Nuraman ( aka Hambali ) alleged that a medical person intervened to prevent further use of the prolonged stress standing position , but told him that " I look after your body only because we need you for information " .
Walid bin Attash , who had previously had a leg amputated , told the ICRC that when he was forced for days to stand with his arms shackled above his head and his feet touching the floor , a person he assumed to be a doctor would measure the swelling in his intact leg and eventually ordered that he be allowed to sit .
Florian Westphal , head of media at the Red Cross in Geneva , confirmed the authenticity of the document obtained by Mark Danner of New York Review of Books and posted on its website , but declined to comment on the contents of the report .
" It is a legitimate document .
It is extremely unusual for an ICRC document on detention procedures to be leaked publicly , " he said .
" We regret this as it is important for us to be able to discuss matters confidentially with governments , which gives us the credibility to influence them . "
Besides descriptions of how the men were tortured , the report conveys the impatience and frustration of the Red Cross in trying to extract information from the Bush administration .
The Red Cross made its first written interventions to the US authorities in 2002 , requesting information on the whereabouts of people allegedly held by the Americans in the context of the fight against terrorism .
" Despite repeated requests at various levels of the US government , the ICRC has not received a response to most of these written interventions , " the report said .
It took four years once the Red Cross first raised the issue with the Bush administration before it was given access to 14 detainees at Guantánamo , including Mohammed .
The report welcomed the decision to grant access to the men , but " deplores the fact that these persons were held in undisclosed detention during a prolonged period by the US authorities and the conditions of treatment to which they were subjected during the time " .
The methods of ill - treatment alleged to have been used , the report said , included waterboarding , standing naked with arms extended and chained above the head for periods of two three days continuously , beatings by the use of a collar held around the detainees ' neck to bang heads and bodies against the wall , prolonged nudity for weeks or months and prolonged shackling .
Those who were shackled " had to urinate and and defecate on themselves and remain standing in their own bodily fluids for periods of several days " .
While the report described practices that have been repudiated by the Obama administration , an Red Cross official who wished to remain anonymous said it was " important for today 's authorities to have this information from an independent source " .
Watch the translator not the main speaker - Hilarious .
Rip is a new package management system for Ruby from the GitHub guys .
It can handle various installation resources , like directories , files , Git repositories and RubyGems as well .
Another interesting new feature are Virtual Environments ( " ripenvs " ) .
Ripenvs can be used to install and manage multiple versions of a package , without getting conflicts .
Ripenvs can also be handy to make upgrading of dependencies safer , just create a new experimental environment , upgrade there , and you can still go back to the stable environment if something breaks .
But why a completely new package manager ?
What 's wrong with RubyGems ?
We asked one of Rip 's developers , Chris Wanstrath :
There 's no real problem with RubyGems .
I love RubyGems .
People seem to think that Rip was written to " fix " or supplant RubyGems .
That 's not it at all .
Rip was written to make installing , using , and managing packages awesome .
It 's written for the person installing the packages , not for the person distributing them .
It 's written for people who want to know exactly what versions of what libraries their application is using by typing a command , not by guesses and detective work .
It 's written for people who want to know about dependency conflicts when they 're installing packages , when they 're thinking about that stuff - not when they 're launching their app , thinking about other stuff .
Rip was written for people who do n't want to have to ask What version of X are you running ?
when trying to help you debug an issue .
It 's for people who want a guarantee that all their production machines are running the same libraries at the same versions .
It 's for people who want to test how upgrading a library will affect their environment before committing to the change .
Rip was n't written by looking at what 's wrong with other systems .
It was written by looking at what 's good with other systems .
Would n't it be easier to just adapt RubyGems ?
Rip and RubyGems are very different beasts : Rip plays with your $ LOAD_PATH while RubyGems overloads `require` .
Rip works with $ RUBYLIB while RubyGems necessitates a `require " rubygems " ` .
Rip manages multiple environments , each with a single version of each library , while RubyGems manages a single environment with different versions of each library .
Rip can ( theoretically ) install any package type while RubyGems can install .gem files .
So really , they 're different projects with different goals .
I do not believe it would have been easier ( nor appropriate ) to completely change the direction , core tenants , and underlying code of RubyGems .
The two systems can live side by side and compliment each other nicely .
Virtual Environments also seem to be perfect for managing packages for different versions of Ruby , like JRuby .
Absolutely .
This is the exact sort of thing Rip excels at – perhaps you 'd like to publish different ripenvs ( installable Rip Virtual Environments ) for different Rubies .
One for 1.9 , one for 1.8 , one for JRuby – with Rip it 's easy for both you and the consumer .
That 's just the way Rip works .
No special features needed .
Rip has just been released in version 0.0.1 , what have you planned for the future ?
We have n't even begun to promote or even discover the power of ripenvs .
Being able to share development environments with a single command ( e.g. `rip freeze | gist` ) , merge development environments without fear of version conflicts , and the power to deploy your applications using ripenvs are just some of the ideas we 'd like to focus on .
They help show where Rip shines .
We 'd also like to copy git 's `reflog` idea so you can easily view or undo any changes you 've made to any ripenv .
You should never worry about losing data or your setup when using Rip .
We also have some great ideas to help you find packages when you know the name but not the URL .
And , naturally , support for hg , svn , and bzr is planned .
You should be able to install from anywhere .
As far as Windows support goes , it 's a must for Rip 1.0 .
More on Rip as well as a short tutorial can be found on the Rip website .
More mutant fish have been found at a Noosa fish hatchery , including mullet embryos with two and three heads .
The discoveries come after seven mullet - four females and three males taken from the Noosa River , were given to the Sunland Freshwater Fish Hatchery at Boreen Point for breeding this month .
Two - headed fish eggs .
Fifty per cent of embryos found during two separate spawning events on July 5 and 6 had some form of cell abnormality , including some with two heads .
A single mullet fry was found with three heads .
Some of the mutant eggs and embryos have been preserved for scientific testing , while authorities will attempt to retrieve seven mullet and other abnormal material after Sunland staff disposed of them .
The contradiction and tragedy of communist - anarchism Part II Share This :
The contradiction and tragedy of communist - anarchism Part II
by Ken Knudsen
The obvious question again arises , " Who is to decide what another man needs ? "
Anarchists once more must leave that decision up to the individual involved .
To do otherwise would be to invite tyranny , for who can better determine a person 's needs than the person himself ?*
But if the individual is to decide for himself what he needs , what is to prevent him from " needing " a yacht and his own private airplane ?
If you think we 've got a consumer society now , what would it be like if everything was free for the needing ?
You may object that luxuries are n't needs .
But that is just begging the question : what is a luxury , after all ?
To millions of people in the world today food is a luxury .
To the English central heating is a luxury , while to the Americans it 's a necessity .
The Nazi concentration camps painfully demonstrated just how little man actually NEEDS .
But is that the criterion communists would use for determining need ?
I should hope ( and think ) not .
So it seems to me that this posses a definite dilemma for the communist - anarchist : what do you do about unreasonable , irrational , or extravagant " needs " ?
What about the man who " needs " a new pair of shoes every month ?
" Nonsense , " you may say , " no one needs new shoes that often . "
Well , how often then ?
Once a year ?
Every five years perhaps ?
And who will decide ?
Then what about me ?
I live in Switzerland and I 'm crazy about grape jam - but unfortunately the Swiss are n't .
I feel that a jam sandwich is n't a jam sandwich unless it 's made with GRAPE jam .
But tell that to the Swiss !
If Switzerland were a communist federation , there would n't be a single communal warehouse which would stock grape jam .
If I were to go up to the commissar - in - charge - of - jams and ask him to put in a requisition for a few cases , he would think I was nuts .
" Grapes are for wine , " he'd tell me with infallible logic , " and more people drink wine than eat grape jam . "
" But I 'm a vegetarian , " I plead , " and just think of all the money I 'm saving the commune by not eating any of that expensive meat . "
After which he would lecture me on the economics of jam making , tell me that a grape is more valuable in its liquid form , and chastise me for being a throwback to bourgeois decadence .
----------------------------------------------------------
* I 'm reminded here of the tale of the man who decided his mule did n't NEED any food .
He set out to demonstrate his theory and almost proved his point when , unfortunately , the beast died .
Authoritarian communism runs a similar risk when it attempts to determine the needs of others .
-----------------------------------------------------------
And what about you , dear reader ?
Have you no individual idiosyncrasies ?
Perhaps you 've got a thing about marshmallows .
What if the workers in the marshmallow factories decide ( under workers ' control , of course ) that marshmallows are bad for your health , too difficult to make , or just simply a capitalist plot ?
Are you to be denied the culinary delights that only marshmallows can offer , simply because some distant workers get it into their heads that a marshmallowless world would be a better world ?
Even today people are beginning to complain about the injustices of the ( relatively mild ) welfare state .
Theodore Roszak writes that in British schools there has been a " strong trend away from the sciences over the past four years " and that people are showing " annoyed concern " and " loudly observing that the country is not spending its money to produce poets and Egyptologists - and then demanding a sharp cut in university grants and stipends . " [ 27 ]
If people are upset NOW at the number of poets and Egyptologists that they are supporting , what would it be like if EVERYONE could simply take up his favourite hobby as his chosen profession ?
I suspect it would n't be long before our professional chess players and mountain climbers found the warehouse stocks dwindling to nothing .
Social unrest would surely increase in direct proportion to the height of the trash piling up on the doorsteps and the subsequent yearning for the " good old days " would bring about the inevitable counter - revolution .
Such would be the fate of the anarchist - communist utopia .

Peter Kropotkin opens his chapter on " Consumption and Production " in " The Conquest of Bread " with the following words :
" If you open the works of any economist you will find that he begins with PRODUCTION , the analysis of means employed nowadays for the creation of wealth ; division of labour , manufacture , machinery , accumulation of capital .
From Adam Smith to Marx , all have proceeded along these lines .
Only in the latter parts of their books do they treat of CONSUMPTION , that is to say , of the means necessary to satisfy the needs of individuals .... Perhaps you will say this is logical .
Before satisfying needs you must create the wherewithal to satisfy them .
But before producing anything , must you not feel the need of it ?
Is it not necessity that first drove man to hunt , to raise cattle , to cultivate land , to make implements , and later on to invent machinery ?
Is it not the study of needs that should govern production ? " [ 28 ]
When I first came upon these words , I must admit I was rather surprised .
" What have we here , " I thought , " is the prince of anarchist - communism actually going to come out in favour of the consumer ? "
It did n't take long to find out that he was n't .
Most communists try very hard to ignore the fact that the sole purpose of production is consumption .
But not Kropotkin ; he first recognises the fact - and THEN he ignores it .
It 's only a matter of three pages before he gets his head back into the sand and talks of " how to reorganise PRODUCTION so as to really satisfy all needs . "
[ My emphasis ]
Under communism it is not the consumer that counts ; it is the producer .
The consumer is looked upon with scorn - a loathsome , if necessary , evil .
The worker , on the other hand , is depicted as all that is good and heroic .
It is not by accident that the hammer and sickle find themselves as the symbols of the Russian " workers ' paradise . "
Can you honestly imagine a communist society raising the banner of bread and butter and declaring the advent of the " consumers ' paradise " ?
If you can , your imagination is much more vivid than mine .
But that 's exactly what individualist - anarchists would do .
Instead of the communist 's " workers ' control " ( i.e. a producers ' democracy ) , we advocate a consumers ' democracy .
Both democracies - like all democracies - would in fact be dictatorships .
The question for anarchists is which dictatorship is the least oppressive ?
The answer should be obvious .
But , judging from the ratio of communists to individualists in the anarchist movement , apparently it 's not .
So perhaps I 'd better explain .
The workers in some given industry decide that item A should no longer be produced and decide instead to manufacture item B .
Now consumer X , who never liked item A anyway , could n't care less ; but poor Y feels his life will never be the same without A . What can Y do ?
He 's just a lone consumer and consumers have no rights in this society .
But maybe other Y's agree with him .
A survey is taken and it is shown that only 3 % of all consumers regret the passing of A .
But ca n't some compromise be arrived at ?
How about letting just one tiny factory make A's ?
Perhaps the workers agree to this accommodation .
Perhaps not .
In any case the workers ' decision is final .
There is no appeal .
The Y's are totally at the mercy of the workers and if the decision is adverse , they 'll just have to swallow hard and hope that next week item C is n't taken away as well .
So much for the producers ' dictatorship .
Let 's now take a look at the consumers ' dictatorship .
Consumers are finicky people - they want the best possible product at the lowest possible price .
To achieve this end they will use ruthless means .
The fact that producer X asks more for his product than Y asks for his similar product is all that the consumer needs to know .
He will mercilessly buy Y's over X's .
The extenuating circumstances matter little to him .
X may have ten children and a mother - in - law to feed .
The consumer still buys from Y. Such is the nature of the consumers ' dictatorship over the producer .
Now there is a fundamental difference between these two dictatorships .
In the one the worker says to the consumer , " I will produce what I want and if you do n't like it you can lump it . "
In the other the consumer says to the worker , " You will produce what I want and if you do n't I will take my business elsewhere . "
It does n't take the sensitive antennae of an anarchist to see which of these two statements is the more authoritarian .
The first leaves no room for argument ; there are no exceptions , no loopholes for the dissident consumer to crawl through .
The second , on the other hand , leaves a loophole so big that it is limited only by the worker 's imagination and abilities .
If a producer is not doing as well as his competitor , there 's a reason for it .
He may not be suited for that particular work , in which case he will change jobs .
He may be charging too much for his goods or services , in which case he will have to lower his costs , profits , and / or overhead to meet the competition .
But one thing should be made clear : each worker is also a consumer and what the individual looses in his role as producer by having to cut his costs down to the competitive market level , he makes up in his role as consumer by being able to buy at the lowest possible prices .*
-----------------------------------
* The usual objection raised to a " consumers ' democracy " is that capitalists have used similar catch phrases in order to justify capitalism and keep the workers in a subjugated position .
Individualists sustain this objection but point out that capitalists are being inconsistent by not practicing what they preach .
If they did , they would no longer be in a position of privilege , living off the labour of others .
This point is made clear in the section on capitalism later in this article .
------------------------------------

Let us turn our attention now to the various philosophies used by communists to justify their social system .
The exponents of any social change invariably claim that people will be " happier " under their system than they now are under the status quo .
The big metaphysical question then becomes , " What is happiness ? "
Up until recently the communists - materialists par excellence - used to say it was material well - being .
The main gripe they had against capitalism was that the workers were NECESSARILY in a state of increasing poverty .
Bakunin , echoing Marx , said that " the situation of the proletariat ... by virtue of inevitable economic law , must and will become worse every year . " [ 29 ]
But since World War II this pillar of communist thought has become increasingly shaky - particularly in the United States where " hard hats " are now pulling in salaries upwards of four quid an hour .
This fact has created such acute embarrassment among the faithful that many communists are now seeking a new definition of happiness which has nothing to do with material comfort .
Very often what they do in discarding the Marxist happiness albatross is to saddle themselves with a Freudian one . *
The new definition of happiness our neo-Freudian communists arrive at is usually derived from what Otto Fenichel called the " Nirvana principle . "
The essence of this theory is that both life - enhancing behaviour ( e.g. sexual intercourse , eating ) and life - inhibiting behaviour ( e.g. war , suicide ) are alternative ways of escaping from tension .
Thus Freud 's life instinct and death instinct find their common ground in Nirvana where happiness means a secure and carefree existence .
This sounds to me very much like the Christian conception of heaven .
But with communism , unlike heaven , you do n't have to give up your life to get in - just your humanity .

Homer Lane used to have a little anecdote which illustrates the point I 'm trying to make about the communist idea of happiness :
" A dog and a rabbit are running down a field .
Both apparently are doing the same thing , running and using their capacity to the full .
Really there is a great difference between them .
Their motives are different .
One is happy , the other unhappy .
The dog is happy because he is trying to do something with the hope of achieving it .
The rabbit is unhappy because he is afraid .
A few minutes later the position is reversed ; the rabbit has reached his burrow and is inside panting , whilst the dog is sitting outside panting .
The rabbit is now happy because it is safe , and therefore no longer afraid .
The dog is unhappy because his hope has not been realised .
Here we have the two kinds of happiness of which each one of us is capable - happiness based on the escape from danger , and happiness based on the fulfillment of a hope , which is the only true happiness . " [ 30 ]
I leave it to the reader as an exercise in triviality to decide which of these two types of happiness is emphasised by communism .
While on the subject of analogies , I 'd like to indulge in one of my own .
Generally speaking there are two kinds of cats : the " lap cat " and the " mouser . "
The former leads a peaceful existence , leaving granny 's lap only long enough to make a discreet trip to its sandbox and to lap up a saucer of milk .
The latter lives by catching mice in the farmer 's barn and never goes near the inside of the farm house .
The former is normally fat and lazy ; the latter skinny and alert .
Despite the lap cat 's easier life , the mouser would n't exchange places with him if he could , while the lap cat COULDN 'T exchange places if he would .
Here we have two cats - perhaps even from the same litter - with two completely different attitudes toward life .
The one expects a clean sandbox and food twice a day - and he is rarely disappointed .
The other has to work for a living , but generally finds the reward worth while .
" Now what has this got to do with the subject at hand ? " I hear you cry .
Just this : the communists would make " lap cats " of us all .
" But what 's so bad about that ? " you may ask .
To which I would have to reply ( passing over the stinky problem of WHO will change the sandbox ) , " Have you ever tried to ' domesticate ' a mouser ? "
Communism , in its quest for a tranquil , tensionless world , inevitably harks back to the Middle Ages .
Scratch a communist and chances are pretty good you 'll find a mediaevalist underneath .
Paul Goodman , for example , derives his ideal " community of scholars " from Bologna and Paris models based in the eleventh and twelfth centuries . [ 31 ]
Erich Fromm writes longingly of " the sense of security which was characteristic of man in the Middle Ages ....
In having a distinct , unchangeable , and unquestionable place in the social world from the moment of birth , man was rooted in a structuralised whole , and thus life had a meaning which left no place , and no need , for doubt .
A person was identical with his role in society ; he was a peasant , an artisan , a knight , and not AN INDIVIDUAL who HAPPENED to have this or that occupation .
The social order was conceived as a natural order , and being a definite part of it gave man a feeling of security and of belonging .
There was comparatively little competition .
One was born into a certain economic position which guaranteed a livelihood determined by tradition . [ 32 ]
Kropotkin goes even further than Fromm .
I 'd like to examine his position in some detail because I think it is very instructive of how the communist mentality works .
In perhaps his best - known book , " Mutual Aid , " Kropotkin devotes two of its eight chapters to glorifying the Middle Ages , which he boldly claim were one of " the two greatest periods of [ mankind 's ] history . " [ 33 ]
( The other one being ancient Greece .
He does n't say how he reconciles this with the fact that Greece was based firmly on a foundation of slavery ) .
" No period of history could better illustrate the constructive powers of the popular masses than the tenth and eleventh centuries ... but , unhappily , this is a period about which historical information is especially scarce . " [ 34 ]
I wonder why ?
Could it be that everyone was having such a good time that no one found time to record it ?
Kropotkin writes of the mediaeval cities as " centres of liberty and enlightenment . " [ 35 ]
The mediaeval guilds , he says , answered " a deeply inrooted want of human nature , " [ 36 ] calling them " organisations for maintaining justice . " [ 37 ]
Let 's see what Kropotkin means here by " justice " : " If a brother 's house is burned , or he has lost his ship , or has suffered on a pilgrim 's voyage , all the brethren MUST come to his aid .
If a brother falls dangerously ill , two brethren MUST keep watch by his bed till he is out of danger , and if he dies , the brethren must bury him - a great affair in those times of pestilences [ Kropotkin must have been dozing to admit this in his Utopia ] - and follow him to the church and the grave .
After his death they MUST provide for his children ....
If a brother was involved in a quarrel with a stranger to the guild , they agreed to support him for bad and for good ; that is , whether he was unjustly accused of aggression , OR REALLY WAS THE AGGRESSOR , they HAD to support him .... They went to court to support by oath the truthfulness of his statements , and if he was found guilty they did not let him go to full ruin and become a slave through not paying the due compensation ; they all paid it .... Such were the leading ideas of those brotherhoods which gradually covered the whole of mediaeval life . " [ 38 ]
( My emphasis )
And such is Kropotkin 's conception of " justice , " which could better be described as a warped sense of solidarity .
He goes on to say , " It is evident that an institution so well suited to serve the need of union , without depriving the individual of his initiative , could but spread , grow , and fortify . " [ 39 ]
" We see not only merchants , craftsmen , hunters , and peasants united in guilds ; we also see guilds of priests , painters , teachers of primary schools and universities , guilds for performing the passion play , for building a church , for developing the ' mystery ' of a given school of art or craft , or for a special recreation - even guilds among beggars , executioners , and lost women , all organised on the same double principle of self - jurisdiction and mutual support . " [ 40 ]
It was such " unity of thought " which Kropotkin thinks " can but excite our admiration . " [ 41 ]
But where did the common labourer fit into all this ?
Kropotkin makes the remarkable generalisation that " at no time has labour enjoyed such conditions of prosperity and such respect . " [ 42 ]
As proof he cites the " glorious donations " [ 43 ] the workers gave to the cathedrals .
These , he says , " bear testimony of their relative well - being . " [ 44 ]
( Just as the Taj Mahal bears testimony of the relative well - being of the people of India , no doubt ) .
" Many aspirations of our modern radicals were already realised in the Middle Ages [ and ] much of what is described now as Utopian was accepted then as a matter of fact . " [ 45 ]
As for the material achievements of the Middle Ages , Kropotkin can't find a superlative super enough to describe them - but he tries : " The very face of Europe had been changed .
The land was dotted with rich cities , surrounded by immense thick walls [ i ] which were embellished by towers and gates , each of them a work of art in itself .
The cathedrals , conceived in a grand style and profusely decorated , lifted their bell - towers to the skies , displaying a purity of form and a boldness of imagination which we now vainly strive to attain ....
[ He displays a bit of ' boldness of imagination ' himself ( to be quite charitable ) when he goes on to say : ]
Over large tracts of land well - being had taken the place of misery ; learning had grown and spread .
The methods of science had been elaborated ; the basis of natural philosophy had been laid down ; and the way had been paved for all the mechanical inventions of which our own times are so proud .
Such were the magic [ sic ] changes accomplished in Europe in less than four hundred years . " [ 46 ]
Just what were these " magic changes " of which Kropotkin is so proud ?
He lists about a dozen . [ 47 ]
Among them are : printing ( neglecting to inform us that the Gutenberg press was invented in the middle of the 15th century , sometime after the mediaeval cities " degenerated into centralised states " ) ; steelmaking ( neglecting to inform us that steelmaking had been mentioned in the works of Homer and was used continuously since that time ) ; glassmaking ( neglecting to inform us that the Encyclopaedia Britannica - to which he contributed numerous articles - devotes to the Middle Ages all of two sentences of a 27 page article on the history of glassmaking ) ; the telescope ( neglecting to inform us that it was n't even invented until 1608 ) ; gunpowder and the compass ( neglecting to inform us that the Chinese lay earlier claims to both of these inventions ) ; algebra ( neglecting to inform us that algebra was in common use in ancient Babylonia and that , although being introduced to mediaeval Europe by the Arabs , no important contributions were made by Europeans until the Renaissance ) ; the decimal system ( neglecting to inform us that the Hindus invented the system about a thousand years before it gained any ground in Europe in the 17th century ) ; calendar reform ( neglecting to inform us that although Roger Bacon suggested such reform to the Pope in the 13th century , no action was taken until 300 years later under the reign of Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 ) ; chemistry ( neglecting to inform us of an earlier work of his where he said chemistry was " entirely a product of our [ 19th ] century . " [ 48 ] )
Indeed the only things he mentions as products of the Middle Ages which stand up under scrutiny are counterpoint and , paradoxically , the mechanical clock .
To top it all off , he then has the gall to cite Galileo and Copernicus as being " direct descendents " of mediaeval science [ 49 ] - somehow managing to ignore the fact that Galileo spent the last eight years of his life under house arrest for supporting the Copernican theory , thanks to that grand mediaeval institution , the Inquisition .
You may be wondering why the people of the Middle Ages let such a Utopia slip through their fingers .
Kropotkin cites foreign invasions - notably those of the Mongols , Turks , and Moors [ 50 ] - but makes it quite clear that the " greatest and most fatal error of most cities was to base their wealth upon commerce and industry . " [ 51 ]
So here we have it laid bare for all to see : Kropotkin 's ideal community would not only return us to the dark ages , but would take away the one thing that could bring us back - commerce and industry .
Rudolf Rocker , the darling of the anarcho - syndicalists , similarly eulogises the Middle Ages .
He , too , felt that mediaeval man led a " rich life " [ 52 ] which gave " wings to his spirit and prevent [ ed ] his mental stagnation . " [ 53 ]
But unlike Kropotkin - who chalked up mediaeval solidarity to man 's innate " nature " - Rocker ( correctly ) explains these " fraternal associations " by means of a most unanarchistic concept - Christianity :
" Mediaeval man felt himself to be bound up with a single , uniform culture , a member of a great community extending over all countries , in whose bosom all people found their place .
It was the community of Christendom which included all the scattered units of the Christian world and spiritually unified them .... The deeper the concept of Christianity took root in men , the easier they overcame all barriers between themselves and others , and the stronger lived in them the consciousness that all belonged to one great community and strove toward a common goal . " [ 54 ]
So we see that the glue that held these idyllic mediaeval communities together was not Kropotkin's " mutual aid , " but rather Christian mysticism .
Rocker was perceptive enough to see this ; Kropotkin apparently was not .
But what both of these men failed to see was that mysticism is the necessary glue of ANY communist society .
The mystical Garden of Eden is the ultimate goal of every church of the communist religion .
Unfortunately , as every good Christian will tell you , the only way you can stay in the Garden of Eden is to abstain from the " tree of knowledge . "
Communists are apparently willing to pay this price .
Individualists are not .
It is communism 's intention to carry religion to its ultimate absurdity : it would sacrifice man on the cross of altruism for the sake of - Man .
* * * * *
I 'd like to end my diatribe against communism by quoting another one .
This is what one prophetic Frenchman , Pierre - Joseph Proudhon , had to say about communism eight years before the " Communist Manifesto " appeared like a spectre to haunt Europe - and like a good French wine , his words seem to have improved with age :
" Communism - or association in a simple form - is the necessary object and original aspiration of the social nature , the spontaneous movement by which it manifests and establishes itself .
It is the first phase of human civilisation .
In this state of society , - which the jurists have called ' negative communism ' , - man draws near to man , and shares with him the fruits of the field and the milk and flesh of animals .
Little by little this communism - negative as long as man does not produce - tends to become positive and organic through the development of labour and industry .
But it is then that the sovereignty of thought , and the terrible faculty of reasoning logically or illogically , teach man that , if equality is the sine qua non of society , communism is the first species of slavery ....
The disadvantages of communism are so obvious that its critics never have needed to employ much eloquence to thoroughly disgust men with it .
The irreparability of the injustice which it causes , the violence which it does to attractions and repulsions , the yoke of iron which it fastens upon the will , the moral torture to which it subjects the conscience , the debilitating effect which it has upon society ; and , to sum it all up , the pious and stupid uniformity which it enforces upon the free , active , reasoning , unsubmissive personality of man , have shocked common sense , and condemned communism by an irrevocable decree .
The authorities and examples cited in its favour disprove it .
The communistic republic of Plato involved slavery ; that of Lycurgus employed Helots , whose duty it was to produce for their masters , thus enabling the latter to devote themselves exclusively to athletic sports and to war , Even J. J. Rousseau - confounding communism and equality - has said somewhere that , without slavery , he did not think equality of conditions possible .
The communities of the early Church did not last the first century out , and soon degenerated into monasteries .... The greatest danger to which society is exposed today is that of another shipwreck on this rock .
Singularly enough , systematic communism - the deliberate negation of property - is conceived under the direct influence of the proprietary prejudice ; and property is the basis of all communistic theories .
The members of a community , it is true , have no private property ; but the community is proprietor , and proprietor not only of the goods , but of the persons and wills .
In consequence of this principle of absolute property , labour , which should be only a condition imposed upon man by Nature , becomes in all communities a human commandment , and therefore odious .
Passive obedience , irreconcilable with a reflecting will , is strictly enforced .
Fidelity to regulations , which are always defective , however wise they may be thought , allows of no complaint .
Life , talent , and all the human faculties are the property of the State , which has the right to use them as it pleases for the common good .
Private associations are sternly prohibited , in spite of the likes and dislikes of different natures , because to tolerate them would be to introduce small communities within the large one , and consequently private property ; the strong work for the weak , although this ought to be left to benevolence , and not enforced , advised , or enjoined ; the industrious work for the lazy though this is unjust ; the clever work for the foolish , although this is absurd ; and , finally , man - casting aside his personality , his spontaneity , his genius , and his affections - humbly annihilates himself at the feet of the majestic and inflexible Commune !
Communism is inequality , but not as property is .
Property is the exploitation of the weak by the strong .*
Communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak .
In property , inequality of conditions is the result of force , under whatever name it be disguised : physical and mental force ; force of events , chance , FORTUNE ; force of accumulated property , etc .
In communism , inequality springs from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence .
This damaging equation is repellent to the conscience , and causes merit to complain ; for although it may be the duty of the strong to aid the weak , they prefer to do it out of generosity , - they never will endure a comparison .
Give them equal opportunities of labour , and equal wages , but never allow their jealousy to be awakened by mutual suspicion of unfaithfulness in the performance of the common task .
Communism is oppression and slavery .
Man is very willing to obey the law of duty , serve his country , and oblige his friends ; but he wishes to labour when he pleases , where he pleases , and as much as he pleases .
He wishes to dispose of his own time , to be governed only by necessity , to choose his friendships , his recreation , and his discipline ; to act from judgement , not by command ; to sacrifice himself through selfishness , not through servile obligation .
Communism is essentially opposed to the free exercise of our faculties , to our noblest desires , to our deepest feelings .
Any plan which could be devised for reconciling it with the demands of the individual reason and will would end only in changing the thing while preserving the name .
Now , if we are honest truth - seekers , we shall avoid disputes about words .
Thus , communism violates the sovereignty of the conscience and equality : the first , by restricting spontaneity of mind and heart , and freedom of thought and action ; the second , by placing labour and laziness , skill and stupidity , and even vice and virtue on an equality in point of comfort . " [ 55 ]

But , not only would distribution according to need hurt the consumer , it would be grossly unfair to the productive worker who actually makes the goods or performs the necessary services .
Suppose , for example , that hardworking farmer Brown goes to the communal warehouse with a load of freshly dug potatoes .
While there Brown decides he needs a new pair of boots .
Unfortunately there are only a few pairs in stock since Jones the shoemaker quit his job - preferring to spend his days living off Brown 's potatoes and writing sonnets about the good life .
So boots are rationed .
The boot commissar agrees that Brown 's boots are pretty shabby but , he points out , Smith the astrologer is in even greater need .
Could Brown come back in a month or so when BOTH soles have worn through ?
Brown walks away in disgust , resolved never again to sweat over his potato patch .
Even today people are beginning to complain about the injustices of the ( relatively mild ) welfare state .
Theodore Roszak writes that in British schools there has been a " strong trend away from the sciences over the past four years " and that people are showing " annoyed concern " and " loudly observing that the country is not spending its money to produce poets and Egyptologists - and then demanding a sharp cut in university grants and stipends . " [ 27 ]
If people are upset NOW at the number of poets and Egyptologists that they are supporting , what would it be like if EVERYONE could simply take up his favourite hobby as his chosen profession ?
I suspect it would n't be long before our professional chess players and mountain climbers found the warehouse stocks dwindling to nothing .
Social unrest would surely increase in direct proportion to the height of the trash piling up on the doorsteps and the subsequent yearning for the " good old days " would bring about the inevitable counter - revolution .
Such would be the fate of the anarchist - communist utopia .* * * * * Peter Kropotkin opens his chapter on " Consumption and Production " in " The Conquest of Bread " with the following words :
When I first came upon these words , I must admit I was rather surprised .
" What have we here , " I thought , " is the prince of anarchist - communism actually going to come out in favour of the consumer ? "
It did n't take long to find out that he was n't .
Most communists try very hard to ignore the fact that the sole purpose of production is consumption .
But not Kropotkin ; he first recognises the fact - and THEN he ignores it .
It 's only a matter of three pages before he gets his head back into the sand and talks of " how to reorganise PRODUCTION so as to really satisfy all needs . "
[ My emphasis ] Under communism it is not the consumer that counts ; it is the producer .
The consumer is looked upon with scorn - a loathsome , if necessary , evil .
The worker , on the other hand , is depicted as all that is good and heroic .
It is not by accident that the hammer and sickle find themselves as the symbols of the Russian " workers ' paradise . "
Can you honestly imagine a communist society raising the banner of bread and butter and declaring the advent of the " consumers ' paradise " ?
If you can , your imagination is much more vivid than mine .
But that 's exactly what individualist - anarchists would do .
Instead of the communist 's " workers ' control " ( i.e. a producers ' democracy ) , we advocate a consumers ' democracy .
Both democracies - like all democracies - would in fact be dictatorships .
The question for anarchists is which dictatorship is the least oppressive ?
The answer should be obvious .
But , judging from the ratio of communists to individualists in the anarchist movement , apparently it 's not .
So perhaps I 'd better explain .
The workers in some given industry decide that item A should no longer be produced and decide instead to manufacture item B .
Now consumer X , who never liked item A anyway , could n't care less ; but poor Y feels his life will never be the same without A . What can Y do ?
He 's just a lone consumer and consumers have no rights in this society .
But maybe other Y's agree with him .
A survey is taken and it is shown that only 3 % of all consumers regret the passing of A .
But ca n't some compromise be arrived at ?
How about letting just one tiny factory make A's ?
Perhaps the workers agree to this accommodation .
Perhaps not .
In any case the workers ' decision is final .
There is no appeal .
The Y's are totally at the mercy of the workers and if the decision is adverse , they 'll just have to swallow hard and hope that next week item C is n't taken away as well .
So much for the producers ' dictatorship .
Let 's now take a look at the consumers ' dictatorship .
Consumers are finicky people - they want the best possible product at the lowest possible price .
To achieve this end they will use ruthless means .
The fact that producer X asks more for his product than Y asks for his similar product is all that the consumer needs to know .
He will mercilessly buy Y's over X's .
The extenuating circumstances matter little to him .
X may have ten children and a mother - in - law to feed .
The consumer still buys from Y. Such is the nature of the consumers ' dictatorship over the producer .
Now there is a fundamental difference between these two dictatorships .
In the one the worker says to the consumer , " I will produce what I want and if you do n't like it you can lump it . "
In the other the consumer says to the worker , " You will produce what I want and if you do n't I will take my business elsewhere . "
It does n't take the sensitive antennae of an anarchist to see which of these two statements is the more authoritarian .
The first leaves no room for argument ; there are no exceptions , no loopholes for the dissident consumer to crawl through .
The second , on the other hand , leaves a loophole so big that it is limited only by the worker 's imagination and abilities .
If a producer is not doing as well as his competitor , there 's a reason for it .
He may not be suited for that particular work , in which case he will change jobs .
He may be charging too much for his goods or services , in which case he will have to lower his costs , profits , and / or overhead to meet the competition .
But one thing should be made clear : each worker is also a consumer and what the individual looses in his role as producer by having to cut his costs down to the competitive market level , he makes up in his role as consumer by being able to buy at the lowest possible prices .*-----------------------------------*
The usual objection raised to a " consumers ' democracy " is that capitalists have used similar catch phrases in order to justify capitalism and keep the workers in a subjugated position .
Individualists sustain this objection but point out that capitalists are being inconsistent by not practicing what they preach .
If they did , they would no longer be in a position of privilege , living off the labour of others .
This point is made clear in the section on capitalism later in this article .------------------------------------* * * * * Let us turn our attention now to the various philosophies used by communists to justify their social system .
The exponents of any social change invariably claim that people will be " happier " under their system than they now are under the status quo .
The big metaphysical question then becomes , " What is happiness ? "
Up until recently the communists - materialists par excellence - used to say it was material well - being .
The main gripe they had against capitalism was that the workers were NECESSARILY in a state of increasing poverty .
Bakunin , echoing Marx , said that " the situation of the proletariat ... by virtue of inevitable economic law , must and will become worse every year . " [ 29 ]
But since World War II this pillar of communist thought has become increasingly shaky - particularly in the United States where " hard hats " are now pulling in salaries upwards of four quid an hour .

Thus Freud 's life instinct and death instinct find their common ground in Nirvana where happiness means a secure and carefree existence .
This sounds to me very much like the Christian conception of heaven .
But with communism , unlike heaven , you do n't have to give up your life to get in - just your humanity .----------------------------------------------*

" We see not only merchants , craftsmen , hunters , and peasants united in guilds ; we also see guilds of priests , painters , teachers of primary schools and universities , guilds for performing the passion play , for building a church , for developing the ' mystery ' of a given school of art or craft , or for a special recreation - even guilds among beggars , executioners , and lost women , all organised on the same double principle of self - jurisdiction and mutual support . " [ 40 ]
It was such " unity of thought " which Kropotkin thinks " can but excite our admiration . " [ 41 ]
But where did the common labourer fit into all this ?
Kropotkin makes the remarkable generalisation that " at no time has labour enjoyed such conditions of prosperity and such respect . " [ 42 ]
As proof he cites the " glorious donations " [ 43 ] the workers gave to the cathedrals .
These , he says , " bear testimony of their relative well - being . " [ 44 ]
( Just as the Taj Mahal bears testimony of the relative well - being of the people of India , no doubt ) .
" Many aspirations of our modern radicals were already realised in the Middle Ages [ and ] much of what is described now as Utopian was accepted then as a matter of fact . " [ 45 ]
As for the material achievements of the Middle Ages , Kropotkin can't find a superlative super enough to describe them - but he tries : " The very face of Europe had been changed .
The land was dotted with rich cities , surrounded by immense thick walls [ i ] which were embellished by towers and gates , each of them a work of art in itself .
The cathedrals , conceived in a grand style and profusely decorated , lifted their bell - towers to the skies , displaying a purity of form and a boldness of imagination which we now vainly strive to attain ....
[ He displays a bit of ' boldness of imagination ' himself ( to be quite charitable ) when he goes on to say : ]
Over large tracts of land well - being had taken the place of misery ; learning had grown and spread .
The methods of science had been elaborated ; the basis of natural philosophy had been laid down ; and the way had been paved for all the mechanical inventions of which our own times are so proud .
Such were the magic [ sic ] changes accomplished in Europe in less than four hundred years . " [ 46 ] Just what were these " magic changes " of which Kropotkin is so proud ?
He lists about a dozen . [ 47 ]
Among them are : printing ( neglecting to inform us that the Gutenberg press was invented in the middle of the 15th century , sometime after the mediaeval cities " degenerated into centralised states " ) ; steelmaking ( neglecting to inform us that steelmaking had been mentioned in the works of Homer and was used continuously since that time ) ; glassmaking ( neglecting to inform us that the Encyclopaedia Britannica - to which he contributed numerous articles - devotes to the Middle Ages all of two sentences of a 27 page article on the history of glassmaking ) ; the telescope ( neglecting to inform us that it was n't even invented until 1608 ) ; gunpowder and the compass ( neglecting to inform us that the Chinese lay earlier claims to both of these inventions ) ; algebra ( neglecting to inform us that algebra was in common use in ancient Babylonia and that , although being introduced to mediaeval Europe by the Arabs , no important contributions were made by Europeans until the Renaissance ) ; the decimal system ( neglecting to inform us that the Hindus invented the system about a thousand years before it gained any ground in Europe in the 17th century ) ; calendar reform ( neglecting to inform us that although Roger Bacon suggested such reform to the Pope in the 13th century , no action was taken until 300 years later under the reign of Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 ) ; chemistry ( neglecting to inform us of an earlier work of his where he said chemistry was " entirely a product of our [ 19th ] century . " [ 48 ] )
Indeed the only things he mentions as products of the Middle Ages which stand up under scrutiny are counterpoint and , paradoxically , the mechanical clock .
To top it all off , he then has the gall to cite Galileo and Copernicus as being " direct descendents " of mediaeval science [ 49 ] - somehow managing to ignore the fact that Galileo spent the last eight years of his life under house arrest for supporting the Copernican theory , thanks to that grand mediaeval institution , the Inquisition .
You may be wondering why the people of the Middle Ages let such a Utopia slip through their fingers .
Kropotkin cites foreign invasions - notably those of the Mongols , Turks , and Moors [ 50 ] - but makes it quite clear that the " greatest and most fatal error of most cities was to base their wealth upon commerce and industry . " [ 51 ]
So here we have it laid bare for all to see : Kropotkin 's ideal community would not only return us to the dark ages , but would take away the one thing that could bring us back - commerce and industry .
Rudolf Rocker , the darling of the anarcho - syndicalists , similarly eulogises the Middle Ages .
He , too , felt that mediaeval man led a " rich life " [ 52 ] which gave " wings to his spirit and prevent [ ed ] his mental stagnation . " [ 53 ]
But unlike Kropotkin - who chalked up mediaeval solidarity to man 's innate " nature " - Rocker ( correctly ) explains these " fraternal associations " by means of a most unanarchistic concept - Christianity :
So we see that the glue that held these idyllic mediaeval communities together was not Kropotkin's " mutual aid , " but rather Christian mysticism .
Rocker was perceptive enough to see this ; Kropotkin apparently was not .
But what both of these men failed to see was that mysticism is the necessary glue of ANY communist society .
The mystical Garden of Eden is the ultimate goal of every church of the communist religion .
Unfortunately , as every good Christian will tell you , the only way you can stay in the Garden of Eden is to abstain from the " tree of knowledge . "
Communists are apparently willing to pay this price .
Individualists are not .
It is communism 's intention to carry religion to its ultimate absurdity : it would sacrifice man on the cross of altruism for the sake of - Man . * * * * * I 'd like to end my diatribe against communism by quoting another one .
This is what one prophetic Frenchman , Pierre - Joseph Proudhon , had to say about communism eight years before the " Communist Manifesto " appeared like a spectre to haunt Europe - and like a good French wine , his words seem to have improved with age : " Communism - or association in a simple form - is the necessary object and original aspiration of the social nature , the spontaneous movement by which it manifests and establishes itself .
It is the first phase of human civilisation .
In this state of society , - which the jurists have called ' negative communism ' , - man draws near to man , and shares with him the fruits of the field and the milk and flesh of animals .
Little by little this communism - negative as long as man does not produce - tends to become positive and organic through the development of labour and industry .
But it is then that the sovereignty of thought , and the terrible faculty of reasoning logically or illogically , teach man that , if equality is the sine qua non of society , communism is the first species of slavery ....
The disadvantages of communism are so obvious that its critics never have needed to employ much eloquence to thoroughly disgust men with it .
The irreparability of the injustice which it causes , the violence which it does to attractions and repulsions , the yoke of iron which it fastens upon the will , the moral torture to which it subjects the conscience , the debilitating effect which it has upon society ; and , to sum it all up , the pious and stupid uniformity which it enforces upon the free , active , reasoning , unsubmissive personality of man , have shocked common sense , and condemned communism by an irrevocable decree .
The authorities and examples cited in its favour disprove it .
The communistic republic of Plato involved slavery ; that of Lycurgus employed Helots , whose duty it was to produce for their masters , thus enabling the latter to devote themselves exclusively to athletic sports and to war , Even J. J. Rousseau - confounding communism and equality - has said somewhere that , without slavery , he did not think equality of conditions possible .
The communities of the early Church did not last the first century out , and soon degenerated into monasteries .... The greatest danger to which society is exposed today is that of another shipwreck on this rock .
Singularly enough , systematic communism - the deliberate negation of property - is conceived under the direct influence of the proprietary prejudice ; and property is the basis of all communistic theories .
The members of a community , it is true , have no private property ; but the community is proprietor , and proprietor not only of the goods , but of the persons and wills .
In consequence of this principle of absolute property , labour , which should be only a condition imposed upon man by Nature , becomes in all communities a human commandment , and therefore odious .
Passive obedience , irreconcilable with a reflecting will , is strictly enforced .
Fidelity to regulations , which are always defective , however wise they may be thought , allows of no complaint .
Life , talent , and all the human faculties are the property of the State , which has the right to use them as it pleases for the common good .
Private associations are sternly prohibited , in spite of the likes and dislikes of different natures , because to tolerate them would be to introduce small communities within the large one , and consequently private property ; the strong work for the weak , although this ought to be left to benevolence , and not enforced , advised , or enjoined ; the industrious work for the lazy though this is unjust ; the clever work for the foolish , although this is absurd ; and , finally , man - casting aside his personality , his spontaneity , his genius , and his affections - humbly annihilates himself at the feet of the majestic and inflexible Commune !
Communism is inequality , but not as property is .
Property is the exploitation of the weak by the strong .*
Communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak .
In property , inequality of conditions is the result of force , under whatever name it be disguised : physical and mental force ; force of events , chance , FORTUNE ; force of accumulated property , etc .
In communism , inequality springs from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence .
This damaging equation is repellent to the conscience , and causes merit to complain ; for although it may be the duty of the strong to aid the weak , they prefer to do it out of generosity , - they never will endure a comparison .
Give them equal opportunities of labour , and equal wages , but never allow their jealousy to be awakened by mutual suspicion of unfaithfulness in the performance of the common task .
Communism is oppression and slavery .
Man is very willing to obey the law of duty , serve his country , and oblige his friends ; but he wishes to labour when he pleases , where he pleases , and as much as he pleases .
He wishes to dispose of his own time , to be governed only by necessity , to choose his friendships , his recreation , and his discipline ; to act from judgement , not by command ; to sacrifice himself through selfishness , not through servile obligation .
Communism is essentially opposed to the free exercise of our faculties , to our noblest desires , to our deepest feelings .
Any plan which could be devised for reconciling it with the demands of the individual reason and will would end only in changing the thing while preserving the name .
Now , if we are honest truth - seekers , we shall avoid disputes about words .
Thus , communism violates the sovereignty of the conscience and equality : the first , by restricting spontaneity of mind and heart , and freedom of thought and action ; the second , by placing labour and laziness , skill and stupidity , and even vice and virtue on an equality in point of comfort .

Ken Knudsen 's essay continues with a section entitled " Revolution : the Road to Freedom " ?

I am delighted to publish an original essay by friend and Voluntaryist Ken Knudson on the intellectual contradiction that is " communist - anarchism " and the tragic debacle of trying to translate the contradiction into reality .
Wendymcelroy.com blog should be cited with a link back if the essay is quoted or reprinted .
Part I appeared yesterday ; published below is Part II .
Tomorrow Ken Knudson 's essay continues with a section entitled " Revolution : the Road to Freedom " ?
The author invites comments and feedback menckenfan©gmail.com by Ken Knudsen
The obvious question again arises , " Who is to decide what another man needs ? "
Anarchists once more must leave that decision up to the individual involved .
To do otherwise would be to invite tyranny , for who can better determine a person 's needs than the person himself ?*
But if the individual is to decide for himself what he needs , what is to prevent him from " needing " a yacht and his own private airplane ?
If you think we 've got a consumer society now , what would it be like if everything was free for the needing ?
You may object that luxuries are n't needs .
But that is just begging the question : what is a luxury , after all ?
To millions of people in the world today food is a luxury .
To the English central heating is a luxury , while to the Americans it 's a necessity .
The Nazi concentration camps painfully demonstrated just how little man actually NEEDS .
But is that the criterion communists would use for determining need ?
I should hope ( and think ) not .
So it seems to me that this posses a definite dilemma for the communist - anarchist : what do you do about unreasonable , irrational , or extravagant " needs " ?
What about the man who " needs " a new pair of shoes every month ?
" Nonsense , " you may say , " no one needs new shoes that often . "
Well , how often then ?
Once a year ?
Every five years perhaps ?
And who will decide ?
Then what about me ?
I live in Switzerland and I 'm crazy about grape jam - but unfortunately the Swiss are n't .
I feel that a jam sandwich is n't a jam sandwich unless it 's made with GRAPE jam .
But tell that to the Swiss !
If Switzerland were a communist federation , there would n't be a single communal warehouse which would stock grape jam .
If I were to go up to the commissar - in - charge - of - jams and ask him to put in a requisition for a few cases , he would think I was nuts .
" Grapes are for wine , " he'd tell me with infallible logic , " and more people drink wine than eat grape jam . "
" But I 'm a vegetarian , " I plead , " and just think of all the money I 'm saving the commune by not eating any of that expensive meat . "
After which he would lecture me on the economics of jam making , tell me that a grape is more valuable in its liquid form , and chastise me for being a throwback to bourgeois decadence .----------------------------------------------------------*
I 'm reminded here of the tale of the man who decided his mule did n't NEED any food .
He set out to demonstrate his theory and almost proved his point when , unfortunately , the beast died .
Authoritarian communism runs a similar risk when it attempts to determine the needs of others .-----------------------------------------------------------And what about you , dear reader ?
Have you no individual idiosyncrasies ?
Perhaps you 've got a thing about marshmallows .
What if the workers in the marshmallow factories decide ( under workers ' control , of course ) that marshmallows are bad for your health , too difficult to make , or just simply a capitalist plot ?
Are you to be denied the culinary delights that only marshmallows can offer , simply because some distant workers get it into their heads that a marshmallowless world would be a better world ?
50 - year mortgage hits the market
Lenders have begun offering a half - century home loan as incentive in face of record - high home prices , rising interest rates , report says .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -
As home prices and interest rates keep rising , lenders have figured out a way to keep the dream alive for millions of people who want to own their own home .
It 's called the 50 - year mortgage .
According to a report Wednesday in USA Today , a handful of small lenders have begun offering 50 - year adjustable - rate loans to buyers who need to keep payments low in the current economic environment .
Most banks already offer 40 - year mortgages , which account for about 5 percent of all home loans , the report said .
" One of the biggest things in California is the high costs of homes .
With rates going up , there 's demand from customers ( for ) longer loans , " Alex Diaz Jr. , with Statewide Bancorp in Rancho Cucamonga , Calif. , was quoted in the report as saying .
Statewide , which introduced its 50 - year loan in March , has already received about 220 applications , Diaz said , according to the report .
The 50 - year mortgage also signals that the cooling real estate market is heating up competition among lenders , the newspaper said .
" Mortgage lenders are getting craftier to get the attention of consumers , " Anthony Hsieh , CEO of LendingTree , told the newspaper .
But he added that consumers first need to understand the product .
Two issues to keep in mind : A borrower with the 50 - year mortgage builds equity very slowly .
And because rates on the loans are adjustable , a borrower 's monthly payments could rise , the report said .
Mortgage experts caution that the 50 - year mortgage is best - suited for those who plan to stay in their home for about five years , while the loan 's interest rate remains fixed , the report said .
" If you 're going to be there for more than five years , you 're gambling , " Marc Savitt of the consumer protection committee for the National Association of Mortgage Brokers told the newspaper .
" You do n't know what interest rates are going to be .
I would n't do it . "
The report of the new 50 - year loan comes as the signs mount that the nation 's real estate market is cooling .
