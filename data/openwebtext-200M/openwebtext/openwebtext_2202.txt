In a city with constant electricity shortages but no lack of sunshine , the new buzz is solar energy .
Teams of engineers have appeared along major Baghdad roadways , bolting panels and bulbs to rows of towering steel poles to make solar - powered streetlights .
The workers who turned up recently in the upscale Karada district approached the task with near - religious fervor .
“ We are lighting up the city with solar power , ” Sajad Hussein declared when queried by curious residents .
“ People say it is a gift from God . ”

Surging oil prices have fueled interest in solar power and other renewable energy sources in California and across the United States , where pressure also is building to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fend off global warming .
But Iraq ’s decision to embrace clean energy has little to do with cost cutting or the environment :
The country ’s policymakers want to improve security , and the national grid does n’t supply enough electricity to illuminate city streets .
For Iraqis , the lack of reliable power has been one of the biggest frustrations of the war .
The U.S. government has committed $ 4.91 billion to repairing the ravaged electricity infrastructure and bringing new generating units online .
But most Iraqis can count on just a few hours of power a day .
Faced with another long , hot summer without sufficient electricity , an Iraqi journalist confronted a U.S. general at a news conference in spring and demanded to know why the military was n’t harnessing the sun ’s rays for the national grid .

Brig .
Gen. Jeffrey Dorko , commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Iraq , said the cost was prohibitive .
“ A rough standard worldwide is it costs approximately $ 1 million to create a power plant to generate one megawatt of power , ” he said .
“ The cost per one megawatt for solar power is several times that , maybe $ 6 million or $ 7 million per megawatt . ”
But U.S. and Iraqi officials agree that solar energy can be useful on a more limited scale , such as powering a street lamp without having to rely on the dysfunctional electricity system .
Iraq ’s electricity grid was already in a state of disrepair after years of sanctions when U.S. - led forces invaded in March 2003 .
The U.S. efforts have added about 2,200 megawatts of daily generating capacity , which now stands at about 5,500 megawatts .

But the growth in demand has far outpaced supply .
Iraqis are snapping up the fridges , air conditioners and other energy - consuming devices that have come onto the market since the fall of Saddam Hussein .
U.S. reconstruction efforts have added to the pressure on the national grid as new hospitals , schools , water treatment plants and other facilities come online .
Essential services are guaranteed a near - continuous supply of electricity , which leaves little for business and residential consumers .
Although capacity has improved , production levels rarely achieve their potential .
Transmission towers are frequently attacked , causing disruptions throughout the network .
A severe drought has reduced output from hydroelectric plants by nearly 30 % .
The sector also is beset by fuel shortages .
Iraq sits atop the world ’s third - largest proven oil reserves .
But the country has limited refining capabilities and imports large quantities of diesel to keep its turbines spinning .

However , there is no shortage of sunshine , said Aziz Shimari , spokesman for the Electricity Ministry .
Iraq is a country of vast deserts where summer temperatures can top 120 degrees .
“ This offers us more possibility of producing power , ” Shimari said .
Light is “ an important condition for security , so people will go out at night . ”
The ministry plans to install 5,000 solar - powered streetlights in Baghdad at a cost of $ 1,800 to $ 2,000 apiece .
There also are plans to install 1,000 units in each of Iraq ’s 18 provinces .
The U.S. military has bought more than 1,000 additional lights for Baghdad and has funded similar projects in Fallouja , Ramadi and other cities .
The lights being installed by the military in Baghdad are bulletproof and cost about $ 6,200 each , officials said .

Grocer Mohammed Abbas was in a good mood as the city ’s municipal crews installed the new lights in front of his Karada store .
“ Light provides half our security , ” he said on a searing afternoon , reaching into a fridge to pull out an ice cream for a little girl in pigtails .
“ I stay open until 10 p.m .
Now that the lights are in , I can stay open even later . ”
At the dry cleaner next door , Basil Dawood was n’t so sure about the benefits of the system .
“ Even if the streets are lit , if there is no electricity and our store is dark , no one can see us , ” Dawood said .
“ What we really need is good national power . ”

Baghdad is averaging about 13 hours of power a day , but most of that power is consumed by government offices and essential services .
On a good day , Abbas and Dawood get six hours .
The two men said they spend up to half their profits on alternative sources of power .
Abbas pays the equivalent of about $ 180 a month for a feed from a privately run neighborhood generator , which supplies an additional eight to 10 hours a day .
Dawood has his own generator , but says it costs too much to run during the day .
When the lights flickered out for the umpteenth time that day , he settled into a chair in front of the silent washing machine , dabbing at beads of sweat with a tissue , to wait for the power to come back on .

Advocates say the solar - powered streetlights will reduce the load on the national grid and wo n’t be as vulnerable to attack because they operate independently .
But the hot , dry climate will present maintenance challenges .
Each pole is equipped with a panel of photovoltaic cells wired to a battery , which charges during the day and switches on automatically at night to power an orange bulb .
But the panels do n’t function well through the layers of dust and grime that can accumulate in a matter of days , officers say .
And extreme heat reduces the life span of the batteries .
A soldier who chronicled his deployment to Iraq in a blog called David ’s War Diary -- davidswardiary.blogspot.com -- commented on the “ scores of gorgeous solar - powered streetlights ” installed at Camp Virginia in Kuwait , where he stopped on his way home in November .
“ Being so closely spaced , they make superb road markers , ” he wrote .
“ Illumination , however , comes from the noisy , gas - powered generator light systems placed along each row of solar - powered streetlights . ”

Asked what she thought of the new lights going up in her neighborhood , Karada resident Menai Karim shrugged .
“ They ’re useless , ” she said as she filled a shopping basket at Abbas ’ store .
“ They are n’t very bright .
But it ’s better than nothing . ”

( CNN ) -- Despite Hillary Clinton 's landslide victory in Kentucky , Barack Obama has won a majority of pledged delegates in the race for the Democratic nomination .
Clinton won Kentucky by more than 30 points , but Obama 's share of the state 's 51 delegates was enough put him over the threshold , according to CNN estimates .
Obama is expected to pick up at least 14 delegates in Kentucky , and by CNN estimates , that will give him 1,627 of the 3,253 pledged delegates at stake in all of primaries and caucuses .
Obama will also pick up a win in Oregon , CNN projects , giving him the larger share of the state 's 52 delegates .
Obama 's top strategist , David Axelrod , said getting the pledged delegate majority was an " important milestone , " but not the end of the trail .
Neither candidate is expected to reach the 2,026 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination .
That means the race is likely to be settled by " superdelegates " -- party leaders and officials who will cast votes at the Democratic convention in August .
Speaking in Iowa , where he won the first - in - the - nation caucuses , Obama told supporters , " it was in this great state where we took the first steps of an unlikely journey to change America . "
Watch Obama say he's in reach of the nomination »
" The skeptics predicted we would n't get very far .
The cynics dismissed us as a lot of hype and a little too much hope .
And by the fall , the pundits in Washington had all but counted us out .
But the people of Iowa had a different idea , " he said .
Obama continued to look to the general election , focusing his attacks as he has for the past week on Sen.
John McCain , while commending Clinton for " her courage , her commitment and her perseverance . "
Obama said McCain 's policies do n't represent change .
" This year 's Republican primary was a contest to see which candidate could out - Bush the other , and that is the contest John McCain won , " he said .
McCain 's camp accused Obama of launching " the tired old political attacks of a typical politician , not the ' new politics ' he 's promised . "
" Without a doubt , Barack Obama is a talented political orator , but his naive plans for unconditional summits with rogue leaders and support for big tax hikes on hardworking families expose his bad judgment that Americans can ill - afford in our next president , " spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement .
After Kentucky 's results came in , Clinton thanked her supporters for handing her a win " even in the face of some pretty tough odds . "
" Tonight we have achieved an important victory , " she said in Louisville .
" It 's not just Kentucky bluegrass that 's music to my ears .
It 's the sound of your overwhelming vote of confidence even in the face of some pretty tough odds . "
Watch Clinton vow to keep going »
Clinton beat Obama across all age groups , income groups and education levels in Kentucky .
Eighty - nine percent of Tuesday 's voters in Kentucky were white , according to the exit polls .
Among them , Clinton won 72 - 22 percent .
Nine percent of the voters were African - American and they overwhelmingly broke for Obama , 87 - 7 percent .
The exit polls from Kentucky also suggest a deep division among Democrats .
Watch how Clinton 's win could affect the race »
Two - thirds of Clinton 's supporters there said they would vote Republican or not vote at all rather than for Obama , according to the polls .
Forty - one percent of Clinton supporters said they 'd cast their vote for McCain , and 23 percent said they would not vote at all .
Just 33 percent said they would back Obama in the general election , according to the polls .
Those numbers are even worse for Obama than in West Virginia one week ago , where 36 percent of Clinton voters said they would back him in the fall .
Obama on Tuesday downplayed the idea that his party will have trouble unifying once there is a nominee .
" Some may see the millions upon millions of votes cast for each of us as evidence that our party is divided , but I see it as proof that we have never been more energized and united in our desire to take this country in a new direction , " he said .
" More than anything , we need this unity and this energy in the months to come , because while our primary has been long and hard - fought , the hardest and most important part of our journey still lies ahead . "
Obama leads Clinton in the number of states won and in the popular vote in the primary and caucus contests this campaign season , but he has been careful not to declare victory in the Democratic contest .
Obama does n't have enough delegates to capture the nomination outright ; Clinton still has a chance , if a slight one , to win the nomination if enough of the roughly 800 superdelegates were to back her .
" I 'm going to make [ my case ] until we have a nominee , but we 're not going to have one today , and we 're not going to have one tomorrow , and we 're not going to have one the next day , " Clinton said Monday in Kentucky .
She argues that she leads in the popular vote , but her argument is debatable .
For Clinton to claim such a lead , primary states but not caucus states -- which Obama mostly won -- would only be counted , plus the popular vote totals in Florida and Michigan .
Florida and Michigan were stripped of their delegates for scheduling their primaries too early , in violation of Democratic Party rules .
Obama 's name was n't on the Michigan ballot , and he received no votes in that state 's contest .
Clinton also argues that she 's won the states that she contends would stack up stronger against McCain in the general election .
" The states I 've won total 300 electoral votes .
If we had the same rules as the Republicans , I would be nominee right now , " she said .
" We have different rules , so what we 've got to figure out is who can win 270 electoral votes .
My opponent has won states totaling 217 electoral votes . "
CNN 's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .

But still , some action heroes take the collateral damage ( and lack of concern for it ) to a level that blurs the line between hero and villain , and probably would n't have looked so good in a court of law .
There 's a reason action movies do n't zoom in on the awesome explosions close enough to see the dozens of innocent burn victims in the vicinity .
Nobody wants to get dragged down by the plight of these nobodies .
6 Neo from The Matrix
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
If you ask any Matrix fan about their favorite part of the film , their answer will invariably involve Keanu Reeves 's breathtaking performance as Neo .
From the inspiring " I know kung fu " speech to his tender and heartfelt " whoa " monologue , his brilliant and multifaceted portrayal made Neo a compelling symbol of humanity at its best , alive and vibrant in a world dominated by oppressive machines .
Also , it was totally awesome when he killed all those guys in slow - motion .
So What 's the Problem ?
So when Neo 's mentor Morpheus gets captured by the bad guys , Neo responds by arming himself with an arsenal larger than that of most developing nations , slaughtering a cluster of security guards before they can even draw their guns , before dropping a bomb on the ground floor of the building just in case there were a few errant cockroaches that were n't killed in the earlier carnage .

Wachowski brothers fans have noted the deliberate parallels between the messianic Neo and the Biblical story of the moneychangers in the temple , in which Christ pulled out a Beretta and killed about 50 security guards .
The thing is , it 's explained early in the movie that there are bad guys who are entirely computer - generated ( the " Agents " ) and then there are regular people who , when they get shot in the Matrix , die in real life .
And those security guards were the latter .
Yet , for some reason it 's played so that Neo is totally free from any guilt over killing a bunch of people , instead of just generating a helicopter and grabbing Morpheus from the top floor .
You know , like they wind up doing anyway .

Or , if that was n't an option , instead of walking in with machine guns , show up with canisters of gas that would render everyone unconscious .
Sure it would n't have looked nearly as awesome as the guns , but at least it would n't have felt as wasteful ( of both human life and ammo ) .
So at the end of the day the lesson is apparently that it does n't matter how many civilians you kill as long as you make sure that you look as cool as possible while doing it .
Of course , there 's also the rationale that Neo was fighting for the greater good of freeing humanity from the Matrix .
And thanks to the sacrifice he forced those security guards to make , their families could now be free to starve in a filthy underground city while being relentlessly pursued by killer robots .
A trio of super - Earths

Today , at an international conference , a team of European astronomers announced a remarkable breakthrough in the field of extra-solar planets .
Using the HARPS instrument at the ESO La Silla Observatory , they have found a triple system of super - Earths around the star HD 40307 .
Looking at their entire sample studied with HARPS , the astronomers count a total of 45 candidate planets with a mass below 30 Earth masses and an orbital period shorter than 50 days .
This implies that one solar - like star out of three harbours such planets .
" Does every single star harbour planets and , if yes , how many ? " wonders planet hunter Michel Mayor from Geneva Observatory .
" We may not yet know the answer but we are making huge progress towards it . "
Since the discovery in 1995 of a planet around the star 51 Pegasi by Mayor and Didier Queloz , more than 270 exoplanets have been found , mostly around solar - like stars .
Most of these planets are giants , such as Jupiter or Saturn , and current statistics show that about 1 out of 14 stars harbours this kind of planet .
" With the advent of much more precise instruments such as the HARPS spectrograph on ESO 's 3.6 - m telescope at La Silla , we can now discover smaller planets , with masses between 2 and 10 times the Earth 's mass , " says Stéphane Udry , one of Mayor 's colleagues .
Such planets are called super - Earths , as they are more massive than the Earth but less massive than Uranus and Neptune ( about 15 Earth masses ) .
The group of astronomers have now discovered a system of three super - Earths around a rather normal star , which is slightly less massive than our Sun , and is located 42 light - years away towards the southern Doradus and Pictor constellations .
" We have made very precise measurements of the velocity of the star HD 40307 over the last five years , which clearly reveal the presence of three planets , " says Mayor .
The planets , having 4.2 , 6.7 , and 9.4 times the mass of the Earth , orbit the star with periods of 4.3 , 9.6 , and 20.4 days , respectively .
" The perturbations induced by the planets are really tiny - the mass of the smallest planets is one hundred thousand times smaller than that of the star - and only the high sensitivity of HARPS made it possible to detect them , " says co-author François Bouchy , from the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris , France .
Indeed , each planet induces a motion of the star of only a few metres per second .
At the same conference , the team of astronomers announced the discovery of two other planetary systems , also with the HARPS spectrograph .
In one , a super - Earth ( 7.5 Earth masses ) orbits the star HD 181433 in 9.5 days .
This star also hosts a Jupiter - like planet with a period close to 3 years .
The second system contains a 22 Earth - mass planet having a period of 4 days and a Saturn - like planet with a 3 - year period as well .
" Clearly these planets are only the tip of the iceberg , " says Mayor .
" The analysis of all the stars studied with HARPS shows that about one third of all solar - like stars have either super - Earth or Neptune - like planets with orbital periods shorter than 50 days . "
A planet in a tight , short - period orbit is indeed easier to find than one in a wide , long - period orbit .
" It is most probable that there are many other planets present : not only super - Earth and Neptune - like planets with longer periods , but also Earth - like planets that we cannot detect yet .
Add to it the Jupiter - like planets already known , and you may well arrive at the conclusion that planets are ubiquitous , " concludes Udry .

CALCULATE YOUR GAS COSTS CALCULATE YOUR GAS COSTS Enlarge By Michael Chow for USA TODAY Louis Hudgin says he 's averaged 94.2 miles per gallon on his Honda Insight the last two years .
He fills the tank about once a month .
GILBERT , Ariz . 
After a 29 - mile jaunt from his Phoenix office to his home here , Louis Hudgin proclaimed his gas mileage " pitiful . "
He averaged just 88.3 miles per gallon .
MAXIMIZING MPG : What experts think of hypermiler techniques TELL US :
How do you squeeze the most miles out of every gallon ?
ACROSS THE USA : Drivers slow down as costs accelerate
Most drivers would take a victory lap if they managed to squeeze that kind of mileage out of increasingly precious gasoline .
Even on this , a bad day , Hudgin coaxed 28 mpg more out of his 2000 Honda Insight hybrid than its federal highway mpg rating .
Hudgin 's disappointment — he usually averages about 100 mpg this time of year — stems from his pride in being no ordinary driver .
He 's a hypermiler , part of a loose - knit legion of commuters who 've made racking up seemingly unattainable mpg an art .
And a sport .
Hypermilers practice such unorthodox techniques as coasting for blocks with their car 's engine turned off , driving far below speed limits on the freeway , pumping up tire pressure far beyond car and tire makers ' recommendations and carefully manipulating the gas pedal to avoid fuel - burning excess .
They endure not only occasional honks from other motorists angry at their slow - poke ways , but intentional discomforts , as well .
Like keeping the air conditioning off and windows barely cracked on a more than 90 - degree day .
Or parking in the boondocks at shopping centers so they can motor head - first toward the exit rather than backing out of a space .
Just about anything for an extra one , two , maybe even four mpg .
With their odd fixation and log - book scribbles obsessively tracking their mileage , the hypermiler community might in other times be typecast as tightwad eccentrics .
But in an era of $ 4 - plus - a - gallon gas , they 're garnering increasing attention as driving superstars , even saviors of the planet .
" More power to them if that 's important to them , and they are accomplishing a goal that also benefits society , " says Ron Cogan , publisher of Green Car Journal .
Automakers are taking notice .
Honda will install an instrument in a new hybrid it will roll out next year that cues drivers for gas - saving actions , such as when to ease off the accelerator , says spokesman Sage Marie .
Hypermilers share their triumphs and secrets on a handful of websites .
They also gather in some cities as a subset of clubs for hybrid - car owners , which many now are .
Driving safety advocates laud some of their habits — but heap scorn on others .
" Probably the most beneficial aspect of hypermiling is its emphasis on a less aggressive approach , " says Geoff Sundstrom , spokesman for AAA , formerly the American Automobile Association .
" The downside of hypermiling is some of the techniques can be extremely dangerous . "
Turning the engine off while coasting can , in some cars , leave the driver without power steering or brakes and allow the possibility that the steering wheel will lock up .
Drivers can endanger themselves and others if they go too slow for the pace of traffic .
How about that urge to " draft " trucks — follow close behind for less wind resistance — on the interstate ?
" There 's another term for that .
We call it tailgating , " Sundstrom deadpans .
Safety first Hudgin , a 56 - year - old professional pilot , says serious hypermilers always put safety before mileage .
Sure , he does n't mind using a truck as a windbreak — but only , he says , if he can stay at least three seconds back .
During the afternoon drive with a reporter , he observes all traffic laws in a mix of city and highway driving .
But having to make a stop at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport , grabbing a quick taco at a Mexican restaurant and getting stuck in rush - hour traffic on Interstate 10 take their toll on his usual mpg .
Normally , Hudgin says , he can roll up 100 mpg in warm weather , about 90 in the winter .
But on this day , the kiss of mileage death came when his hybrid 's battery started recharging , which causes the hybrid 's gasoline engine to work harder and burn more gas .
Those few minutes on the freeway slashed his mileage temporarily to a paltry 48 mpg , according to the car 's computer .
That 's 12 below the two - seat , three - cylinder Insight 's EPA mpg rating for highway driving .
Hudgin is not new to the mileage game .
When Hudgin was young , an uncle drove a 1955 Morris Minor , a small English car , to Canada and bragged about 50 mpg .
" I thought , ' That 's phenomenal . '
And it made an impression on me . "
Hudgin has owned a series of compact vehicles known for their little engines and big mpg , such as a Subaru Justy and Chevy Sprint .
He had a long commute , he says , and needed dependable and cheap cars .
Some mileage tricks he found himself .
" I started going the back way , slowed down from 55 to 45 miles per hour and saw an increase of 16 mpg , " says Hudgin , who flies executive planes for the state of Arizona .
Slow going on the byways tacked 19 minutes onto his commute , but he says he did n't mind .
In 2001 , he bought his then - slightly - used Insight , an odd - looking car that was the first hybrid sold in the USA , though in limited numbers .
It got the highest EPA mileage rating of any model until it was discontinued .
He got 59.6 mpg from his first tank of gas .
Not bad , he says , but around 2005 , he discovered the world of hypermiling , including Internet sites such as CleanMPG.com , Greenhybrid.com and several others where hypermilers share mileage tactics .
Finding miles online Hudgin says tips culled from the sites helped him improve until in 2006 , he averaged 112 mpg on a tankful while practicing to be part of a six - man team for the Insight Marathon , a mileage contest .
All the claims are unverified , but Hudgin and other hypermilers say the proof is the car 's own mileage computer .
Others claim similar triumphs .
Randall Burkholder of Blackwell , Okla. , whose Insight was used in the marathon , says the team got 164 mpg .
He says 100 mpg is pretty routine on his 82 - mile round - trip commute to work as a machine programmer .
" We know what the cars are capable of , " he says .
Another hypermiler , Sean Welch of Coon Rapids , Minn. , says he often gets more than a thousand miles out of the 10.6 - gallon gas tank on his Insight .
He says he uses the same techniques in his non -hybrid 2002 Hyundai Elantra and also gets astounding mileage .
" Hypermiling is a whole suite of tools .
It 's half science and the other half is art , knowing when to apply them , " says Welch , 31 .
Some of the science comes from a gauge hypermilers put into cars that do n't have one built in that offers a continuous reading of their gas mileage at any moment .
Without such gauges , it 's hard to figure out what works or what does n't .
" There 's no magic pill , " Hudgin says .
" You really need to change your driving style .
If you 're talking on your cellphone ( behind the wheel ) , it is n't going to happen .
You have to concentrate on your driving . "
Hypermilers have their own lexicon for their tricks .
There 's " pulse and glide , " in which the driver speeds up then shifts into neutral or turns off the engine to coast .
There is " ridge riding , " which is driving the car off center in a lane to keep its tires out of the tracks worn into pavement from years of traffic .
A natural result , of course , of all this intense study is competition for bragging rights as top hypermiler .
Many will gather in Madison , Wis. , on July 19 - 20 for Hybridfest , which will pit hybrid owners from Florida to California in a contest to see who can get the best gas mileage over a scenic , winding , 30 - mile loop .
The entry classes cover a wide range of hybrids , from tiny Insights to one for the guy bringing a new Chevy Tahoe full - size SUV hybrid that is government rated at 21 mpg .
" He 's pretty sure he can get 35 , " says Eric Powers , who is organizing the event as part of the Dane County Fair .
Adapting to road , weather
The strategy behind winning such rivalries is knowing which techniques to use at different times , based on weather and road conditions .
Not all work on any given day .
" If you leave some on the table , that 's fine , " says Wayne Gerdes , who runs hypermiling site CleanMPG.com and holds seminars .
Gerdes says he gets more than 40 mpg out of his 2003 Ford Ranger pickup .
Drivers do n't have to be as extreme as the top hypermilers , however , to get better mileage .
Slowing down and laying off the brakes has helped California Highway Patrol Officer Heather Hoglund get about 10 mpg more out of her private car , a Toyota Prius hybrid .
But she says she 's cautious about using hypermiling techniques : " Do n't get so hooked on your hypermiling you do n't put your foot on the brake when you need to . "
Using a little gas for comfort Hudgin 's wife , Laural says she happily uses her air conditioning and has stopped turning her engine off during stoplight waits " because it dragged down the battery . "
Yet , by driving smoothly in her diesel - powered 2004 Volkswagen Golf and carefully trying to time stop lights to avoid waits , she averages nearly 50 mpg , she says , about 10 mpg better than the car 's EPA rating .
" She 's a hypermiler in her own right , " Louis Hudgin says .
But like any spouse , he admits , " I have to bite my tongue while she 's driving . "

Dobson ’s quotes are so self - referential , it ’s rather amazing .
“ I think he ’s deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the Bible to fit his own worldview , his own confused theology , ” Dobson said . “…
He is dragging biblical understanding through the gutter . ”
Pot meet Kettle .
Now , what is truly interesting about all of this is that Dobson ca n’t stand McCain .
So it ’s rather interesting that Dobson is now attacking Obama , which in principle helps McCain .
Obama has made no secret that he ’s wooing people of faith , as a fellow Christian .
McCain ’s Christian bona fides are n’t that strong – he recently got his faith wrong , and he certainly does n’t talk about God and Christ in the real way that Obama does , in the real way that a real Christian recognizes as , well , real .
So Dobson appears to be worried that Obama is a real threat , not just to McCain , but to Dobson ’s own warped view of Christianity .
Of course , the real threat to Dobson is that nobody appears to care what he and his ilk have to say anymore .
At least not in politics , and that ’s Dobson ’s home turf .
He may have loads of red -state followers who are still willing to at least sip his Kool - Aid , but in Washington , he ’s not exactly the cock of the walk he once was .
And he knows it .

The way the media covers stem cell research controversies makes it seem like the public is seriously conflicted about this issue and generally dubious about the benefits that can be derived from science and innovation .
Yet a survey of public opinion suggests that the public has a clear view on stem cell research and is strongly positive about the promise of science and innovation .
The public , in short , wants to move forward ; they have little or no interest in curbing scientific advance to serve anyone ’s ideological agenda .
General Views on Science
Virginia Commonwealth University has , since 2001 ( the last survey was in 2007 ) , surveyed the public annually about science and science issues .
Since the surveys began , 85 to 90 percent of the public has agreed that , “ developments in science helped make society better . ”
A similar question about whether “ developments in new technology helped make society better ” returned positive responses ranging from 83 to 88 percent over the same period .
What ’s more , 87 to 92 percent of the public agreed that “ scientific research is essential for improving the quality of human lives , ” and 88 to 92 percent endorsed the idea that “ new technology used in medicine allows people to liver longer and better . ”
These levels of agreement indicate that there is an overwhelming public consensus that science and technology are positive forces in American society .
The public also generally believes that the benefits of scientific research outweigh any harmful results .
The 2006 General Social Survey found that 70 percent thought so , compared to just 6 percent who thought the harm from such research outweighed its benefits .
These benefits will likely continue to flow in the future , the public believes .
In the same survey , 90 percent thought that science and technology would provide “ more opportunities for the next generation . ”
The public also believes that the federal government should provide funding for scientific advances .
Since 1979 , around 80 percent of respondents to National Science Foundation surveys have said that , “ even if it brings no immediate benefits , scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the Federal Government . ”
In 2006 , the last year for which data are available , that figure rose to 87 percent .
A somewhat different question in the General Social Survey has asked respondents whether the government is spending too much , too little , or the about the right amount on scientific research .
Since 1981 , a much larger percent of the public has said that too little is being spent rather than too much — a gap that has grown steadily over time .
In 2006 , the last year for which data are available , 41 percent said too little is being spent on scientific research , compared to just 11 percent who said too much is being spent .
Trust in Science and Scientists
The public has a high degree of confidence in the scientific community .
In the 2006 General Social Survey , 41 percent expressed “ a great deal ” of confidence in the leadership of the scientific community .
This is a higher degree of confidence than the public had for the leadership of a wide range of other institutions , including the Supreme Court , banks , education , and organized religion .
In fact , the only institution whose leadership was rated higher was the military at 47 percent .
The public also believes scientists should have significantly more influence on the policy issues in their area than either business leaders , religious leaders , or elected officials .
On global warming , for example , 87 percent want environmental scientists to have a great deal ( 47 percent ) or a fair amount ( 40 percent ) of influence on decisions in this area .
By contrast , just 32 percent of the public wants business leaders to have a great deal ( 10 percent ) or a fair amount ( 22 percent ) of influence , and 50 percent want elected officials to have a great deal ( 17 percent ) or a fair amount ( 33 percent ) of influence .
Similarly , 80 percent of the public wants medical researchers to have significant influence ( 39 percent “ a great deal ” / 41 percent “ a fair amount ” ) on stem cell research decisions .
This compares to 29 percent ( 8/21 ) for religious leaders and 46 percent ( 11/35 ) for elected officials .
On genetically modified food decisions , 81 percent ( 41/40 ) of the public wants medical researchers to have significant influence , compared to 19 percent ( 3/16 ) for business leaders , and 37 percent ( 7/30 ) for elected officials .
One reason the public wants scientists and researchers to have significant influence on policy issues is because they think that scientists have by far the best understanding of policy issues in their areas .
On global warming , 66 percent give environmental scientists a “ 4 ” or “ 5 ” on a 5 - point scale of understanding , where 5 is very well and 1 is not at all .
Only 12 percent think that business leaders and elected officials have that level of understanding .
On the importance of stem cell research , 74 percent give medical researchers a 4 or 5 level of understanding , compared to just 14 percent for religious leaders , and 10 percent for elected officials .
And on the risks posed by genetically modified foods , 64 percent give medical researchers a 4 or 5 , compared to only 11 percent for business leaders and 10 percent for elected officials .
The public also believes that scientists are the most impartial about policy issues in their areas .
On global warming , 67 percent give environmental scientists a “ 4 ” or “ 5 ” on a 5 - point scale of impartiality , where 5 is supporting what ’s best for the interests of the country and 1 is supporting what serves their own narrow interests .
Only 10 and 19 percent respectively think that business leaders and elected officials have that level of impartiality .
On stem cell research , 59 percent give medical researchers a 4 or 5 level of impartiality , compared to just 25 percent for religious leaders and 15 percent for elected officials .
And on the risks posed by genetically modified foods , 63 percent give medical researchers a 4 or 5 on impartiality ; only 6 and 16 percent , respectively , give ratings that high to business leaders and elected officials .
Of course , the public is not without its qualms about science and scientists .
Perhaps the chief worry is that scientific research does n’t incorporate enough concern for society ’s moral values .
In the Virginia Commonwealth University survey , majorities ranging from 51 to 59 percent have agreed with this contention since 2001 .
Stem Cell Research
Of all the issues around scientific innovation , stem cell research has proved by far the most controversial .
It has been hotly debated inside the halls of Congress and throughout the country .
Because of the issue ’s high profile , there is a great deal of public opinion data about this specific issue and how views have evolved over time ( this is by and large not true about other contemporary scientific issues ) .
The first thing to note is that public support for stem cell research has increased substantially since 2002 .
In that year , according to the VCU survey , 35 percent favored “ medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos ” and 51 percent were opposed .
Support rose to 47 percent in favor and 44 percent opposed in 2003 .
Since then , all VCU surveys have showed majority support for stem cell research : 53 to 36 in 2004 ; 58 to 32 in 2005 ; 54 to 37 in 2006 ; and 54 to 39 in 2007 .
The proportion believing “ medical research using stem cells obtained from human embryos ” is morally acceptable has also risen steadily since 2002 .
Gallup conducts annual surveys on science issues , and found in 2002 that 52 percent of the public believed stem cell research was morally acceptable , and 39 percent believed it was morally wrong .
Since then the ratio has steadily shifted as more Americans believe it is morally acceptable and fewer believe it is morally unacceptable each year .
The split was 54 percent acceptable to 38 percent unacceptable in 2003 ; 54 to 37 in 2004 ; 60 to 22 in 2005 ; 61 to 30 in 2006 ; and 64 to 30 at the most recent reading in 2007 .
Other data confirm the public ’s basically favorable attitude toward embryonic stem cell research .
A mid-January 2007 CBS
News poll found that 65 percent said they approve of “ medical research using embryonic stem cells , ” compared to just 25 percent who disapproved .
And in an ABC News / Washington
Post poll around the same time , 61 percent said they support embryonic stem cell research , with only 31 percent in opposition .
If embryonic stem cell research is put in the context of the type of diseases it might help cure , support is even more overwhelming .
Here ’s how an NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll posed the question in late June 2004 :
There is a type of medical research that involves using special cells , called stem cells , that are obtained from human embryos .
These human embryo stem cells are then used to generate new cells and tissue that could help treat or cure many diseases .
I am now going to read you two statements about this type of research .
Statement A : Those OPPOSED to this type of research say that it crosses an ethical line by using cells from potentially viable human embryos , when this research can be done on animals or by using other types of cells .
Statement B : Those IN FAVOR of this research say that it could lead to breakthrough cures for many diseases , such as cancer , Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s , and spinal cord injuries , and this research uses only embryos that otherwise would be discarded .
Who do you agree with more : those opposed or those in favor ?
Posing the question this way produced a 71 to 22 split in favor of embryonic stem cell research .
The stem cell research debate has largely revolved around the level of government funding permitted for embryonic stem cell research .
Given the views summarized above , it should come as no surprise that the public generally favors funding embryonic stem cell research .
In early May 2007 , 53 percent said that the federal government should fund research using “ newly created stem cells obtained from human embryos , ” compared to 41 percent who opposed such funding .
A late October 2006 Newsweek poll found that 50 percent favored “ using federal tax dollars to fund medical research using stem cells obtained from human embryos , ” with only 37 percent opposed .
An early August 2005 CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll also found that 56 percent thought “ the federal government should …. fund research that would use newly created stem cells obtained from human embryos , ” while 40 percent disagreed .
Finally , in an early August 2004 Annenberg survey , the public , by 64 to 28 , favored “ federal funding of research on diseases like Alzheimer ’s using stem cells taken from human embryos . ”
The Bush administration has , of course , taken quite a different position , seeking to restrict such funding as much as possible .
The public , however , consistently favors easing these restrictions and expanding current funding .
In a mid-April 2007 CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll , 60 percent said they favored either no restrictions ( 22 percent ) or easing restrictions ( 38 percent ) on embryonic stem cell research , compared to 36 percent who favored the current restrictions ( 20 percent ) or no funding at all ( 16 percent ) .
A mid-January 2007 Los Angeles
Times poll found that 59 percent supported “ increasing federal funding for embryonic stem cell research , ” while just 32 percent opposed such increased funding .
In an ABC News / Washington Post poll around the same time , the public , by 55 to 38 , supported “ loosening the current restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research . ”
An AP poll in mid-December 2006 found that a 56 to 41 majority favored easing restrictions on using federal money for embryonic stem cell research .
And by a 68 to 27 majority in a late July 2006 NBC News / Wall Street Journal survey , the public endorsed “ expanding federal funding for embryonic stem cell research , which is the practice of conducting scientific research on cells extracted from human embryos in an attempt to find cures or treatments for diseases . ”
Indeed , the public appears ready to see a very substantial increase in financial support for stem cell research .
When queried about whether other states should follow California ’s lead — the state approved raising “ $ 3 billion in state money for stem cell research , including developing more lines of embryonic stem cells ” in 2004 — 53 percent in a late May 2005
Time poll said they should , compared to 37 percent who thought they should not .
This could n’t be farther from President Bush ’s stance .
He has actively opposed attempts by Congress to expand federal funding , vetoing two separate bills that would have done so in July 2006 and June 2007 .
The public vigorously opposed both of these vetoes .
In mid-May 2007 , a CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll found 64 to 31 in opposition to Bush ’s veto of the second expanded funding bill .
In a late July 2006 NBC / Wall Street Journal poll , the public , by 63 to 31 , opposed Bush ’s veto of the first expanded funding bill .
Around the same time , a 58 to 36 majority in a CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll disapproved of Bush ’s veto of that bill .
Recent scientific advances have indicated that some useful stem cell research can be conducted using stem cells that are not from human embryos .
The public supports such research very strongly — by 75 percent to 17 percent in the 2007 Virginia Commonwealth University survey .
But the public does not believe that this development means embryonic stem cell research is now unnecessary .
In the same survey , 63 percent thought both kinds of stem cell research are still needed , compared to just 22 percent who thought embryonic stem cell research is now unnecessary .
This review of public opinion data indicates that the public , despite the best efforts of President Bush and his conservative allies , is very much committed to moving forward on science and innovation in general and on stem cell research in particular .
Attempts by this administration to turn back the clock and substitute ideology for science have not won the public over and , on the evidence presented here , are unlikely to do so in the future .

If you ’ve always wanted to build a computer from the ground up but never really had the time to find the necessary parts online , a coupon - centered blog called Coupon Codes Mall has done all the work for you .
We think their choices lead to a pretty solid build , and all the coupon / sale links are current , but let ’s just say this straight - up :
You should temper your expectations right now .
It ’s a simple bare bones PC and it probably wo n’t win any real tough benchmark contests .
But it ’s hard to argue with useful and efficient cheapness .
The CCM PC includes some of the cheapest parts available on the net .
Here ’s the full kit ( keep in mind that this does not include a keyboard , a mouse or a monitor ) :
Motherboard : Intel ’s D201GLY2 with CPU .
Price : $ 67.24 at Buy.com , with free shipping .
This ‘ sub- value market ’ chip includes the average 10/100 LAN , plus support up to six USB 2.0 ports and 2 SATA ( 1.5 GB/s ) –- quality Intel chip for a good value .
RAM : Crucial Technology ’s 512MB 240 - Pin PC2-4200 533 Mhz DDR2 RAM .
Price : $ 10 ( used ) at Amazon.com , plus $ 5 shipping .
( You can also buy a new one for $ 16.72 if you want to go over the price limit by a bit ) .
Plug this one in and your PC is on its way .
Who says you need to get Kingston or Corsair RAM for your PC to work ?
Hard Drive : Seagate ’s ST380215 AS 80 GB Hard Drive
Price : $ 49.24 , at Buy.com , plus free shipping .
Very little compromise here .
You usually ca n’t go wrong with a Seagate drive .
There are more expensive options at Amazon.com , including the exact same drive for $ 20 more .
CCM recommends using a new Google Checkout account to get an extra $ 10 coupon off , but you can also just use a discount from the Buy.com account to get that off your price line .
CD - ROM ( internal ) Drive : Asus ’ CD - S520 / A5 52x CD -ROM
Drive – EIDE / ATAPI
Price : $ 9.90 , at Buy.com
If you ’re looking for a Blu-ray drive on this super - cheap rig , you ’re in the wrong place my friend .
The CCM build gives you 3 different options , but the Asus one is the best .
This is a harmless , safe drive .
Remember , Asus built parts ( and some whole builds ) for American manufacturers before selling its products direct , so this is a good one .
Case ( body ) : Unnamed , colorless box .
Price : $ 10 , bought at unnamed , colorless brick - and - mortar store .
So the coupon blog went offline and found a colorless case for $ 15 in a random local store .
These are the hard choices you have to make –- no
beautiful cherry - red casing in here .
But if you look for cases at second hand computer stores , do expect to find the similar deals , or better , and we ’re not against this strategy at all .
But if you do n’t want to venture from your lair , there are plenty of other options for a few more bucks .
Plus , it ’ll save you the embarrassment of asking for a
$ 5 computer case .
Operating System : Linux OS
Price : $ 0 .
Linux is free and that ’s a beautiful thing .
( That one ’s for the Michael
Bolton fans in the audience .
Thank you , sir .
You can sit down now . )
If you need to use Microsoft Office for word processing or Excel worksheets , you can download the ‘ international open standard format ’
at OpenOffice.org for , you guessed it , zero dollars .
( You can also rely entirely on the online software options of Google Docs or Zoho ) .
So that ’s the basic set - up needed .
Add it up , and it should come out to
$ 141.35 or so , with some extra money for one or two books about putting it all together .
These two will help even the greenest n00bs :
How - To Book : Building a PC For Dummies
Price : $ 16.49 ( new ) or $ 7.45 ( used - low ) .
The Absolute Beginner ’s Guide to Upgrading and Fixing Your PC ( Absolute Beginner ’s Guide )
Price : $ 14.78 ( new ) or $ 1.99 ( used ) .
DIY Postcript :
One of the interesting issues that come up with a DIY project like this one is that tough choices usually lead to expensive results .
When faced with a choice between a well - known manufacturer and one that ’s a bit more obscure , the user will almost always choose the most expensive " name " part .
In the example above , the CCM choice for the RAM was
Crucial Technology ’s RAM kit over the better - rated Kingston .
But if you know anything about the difference between these two , you know that it ’s not that big and that you ’ll likely enjoy a fair performance from the cheapy Crucial one .
Just like with any other product , buying the " name " means buying an insurance for your machine — the more expensive , newest option is likely the best one , but the other parts have to match that performance as well , and sometimes , maximum performance is n’t completely necessary .
Other parts ( or even slightly older ones ) are usually serviceable .
Hey , if you want a cheaper product , you ’re bound to sacrifice something .

Thanks to Wired reader Carlos Aldana for the tip !
In 1953 , Dr. James McConell began performing labyrinthine experiments with planarian worm s ( ) at the University of Michigan , training them , using the punishment operand of classical conditioning , to learn over a period of months to consistently follow the most effective route through a maze .
This is all old hat .
Planarian worms are cheaper to buy and keep alive than lab rats .
Nothing new .
But it was what he did next which raised a few eyebrows .
Keeping track of how long it had taken the entire first group of worms to successfully learn how to run the maze , he killed them all and fed the remains to a second group of hitherto untrained worms .
Keeping this second group and a third control group of planarians ( on a normal , non-cannibalistic diet ) isolated , they were all trained to run the same maze using the same method as with the first group of worms .
The control group of worms took roughly the same amount of time to learn to run the maze as the first batch had , but the group which had eaten the first , educated bunch learned to run the maze considerably faster than both the control group and the original group on which they had dined .
It was as though by eating the first group of learned worms , they had in some small way attained a not insignificant glimmer of the knowledge which had been previously imparted unto their dinners .
" That maybe explains the custom among cannibal tribes of eating the wise man after his death in order to recieve his wisdom .
General , you could go into a delicatessen and order Einstein on pumpernickel ... " - Alan Moore , The Anatomy Lesson
Similar results were later got when unschooled worms were injected with the RNA of successful maze - runners , leading to a controversial theory of the relation between RNA and memory , and later similar experiments produced further similar results in rats , goldfish and canaries .
There are some problems with this almost - 50 - year - old experiment , some of which I am more qualified to effectively communicate than others , but I will attempt to present them all :
1 ) In natural conditions , flatworms will react to light by elongating and to shock by contracting , while in this experiment they were apparently trained in a completely topsy - turvy manner - contracting in response to light and elongating when exposed to shock , thus not only were they being trained to run a maze but to do so in complete opposition to their instincts .
That raises questions and variables which were n't taken into account during the course of the original experiment , and could quite conceivably have skewed the results ;
2 ) The propensity of planarian worms is to choose to follow a path coated in the mucous or slime trail left by a previous worm rather than to slither off in new directions .
Some believe that rather than training the worms to run mazes at all , the researchers were merely establishing a slime highway that eventually all the worms figured out the onramp to .
Would the subsequent dietary results indicate then that the cannibal worms would have had their natural inclinations towards following slimy paths reinforced ?
What exactly would the scientists have been measuring ?
3 ) ( This one is my favourite . )
The most common objection to the whole experiment I 've heard is that the cannibal worms were better fed , being provided the nourishing bodies of their predecessors rather than the typical merely - sustaining lab wormfood !
It is widely accepted that malnutrition impedes learning in human beings - thus school lunch programs - so why not in worms as well ?
This objection fails to account for results attained by the RNA injections .
If anyone can explain further ( or better explain the ones I have here ) reasons why these experiments are not presently looked upon as tremendously scientific , I would be pleased for you to share in the subsequent writeups or to /msg me .
On a tangent to this subject matter , it was also discovered in experimentation that the regenerative abilities of planarian worms did n't just extend to physical organs but memories as well !
If you cut the head off of a trained planarian worm , once it grows back the worm will be able to run mazes as effectively as before , yet if a worm is cut in half ( so that each half grows back another half - worm , resulting in two worms ) only one of the resultant worms will have retained the training .
This shows that memory in worms is located somewhere other than its head .
Dutch artist M.C. Escher produced a lithograph in 1959 named Flat worms ( Platwormen ) ( viewable online at http://www.tabletoptelephone.com/~hopspage/Flatworm.jpg) , depicting a structure formed from alternating tetrahedronal and octahedronal bricks with cute l'il flatworms slithering all over them .
He noted that such a structure would be impractical for humans as the resulting surfaces produce neither vertical walls nor horizontal floors , but if it filled with water it would work dandy as a home for flatworms .
Kibo ( of Usenet infamy ) points out the unutilised possibility here - Escher using worms in his works prior to the scientific establishment of both their regenerative and maze - running abilities - and hypothesizes that if only he'd known , Escher would have depicted planarian worms regenerating in the forms of moebius strips while running geometrically impossible labyrinths .
Anyone with a passing familiarity with Escher 's work can agree that this would n't be atypical for the Dutch mindbender .
For a time , experimenters in this field published a special - interest newsletter / scientific journal entitled Worm Runners Digest .
The names of two articles from scientific journals dealing with the phenomena described above follow :
Pat J. Dixon , 58 , a nurse in Atlanta , takes five medications to lower her blood pressure .
In many ways , Ms. Dixon is typical of a patient who develops resistant hypertension .
At 5 feet and 172 pounds , she is obese , and her weight gain has caused mild Type 2 diabetes , for which she takes yet another drug .
The diabetes is an extra strain on the kidneys , in turn worsening her blood pressure .
Ms. Dixon said that she did not use much salt when she cooked but that she did like to snack on potato chips .
“ My doctor tells me about every week that I ’m going to eat myself to death , ” she said .
“ You do kind of get worn out and depressed every morning that you have to take five or six pills . ”
The new report is one of the first to help doctors recognize and manage this growing group of difficult cases .
Because so few studies have focused on resistance , the authors say , the number of drug - resistant patients is unclear .
By reviewing studies of patients with at least some hypertension , the panel estimated that 20 to 30 percent could not control their blood pressure with three or more drugs , even when taking them exactly as prescribed .
The 20 to 30 percent cohort appears to be growing .
A large study in 2006 from Stanford found that the number of blood - pressure patients who were prescribed three or more drugs had increased over 12 years , to 24 percent from 14 percent .
If patients need that many drugs , experts say , they are likely to be at greater risk for illness even if they lower their blood pressure to normal .
These patients have usually had high blood pressure for some time and , as a result , have more organ damage .
“ It ’s a critically important issue , ” said Dr. Sheldon Hirsch , chief of nephrology at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago .
“ One of the biggest failings in medicine is that as we increasingly realize the importance of treating hypertension , that lower numbers are better than higher numbers , we have increasing trouble reaching those goals . ”
After 5 years , the popular BitTorrent client Azureus is no more .
The Vuze team has officially abandoned the Azureus name and the new " social " BitTorrent client is now completely integrated into the Vuze content distribution platform .
The first version of the Java based BitTorrent client Azureus was released in June 2003 , and soon became popular among the early adopters of BitTorrent .
Over the years , Azureus turned into one of the most feature - rich clients , backed by a dedicated team of developers and an active community .
Things changed in 2006 when Azureus launched the content distribution platform it called ‘ Vuze ’ ( aka Zudeo ) , backed up by a total of $ 34 million venture capital .
For a while , they kept releasing a no-Vuze version of Azureus ( when Vuze / Zudeo was in Beta ) , but Vuze CEO , Gilles BianRosa told Torrent Freak that this only caused confusion among their users .
“ We started to change our name from Azureus to Vuze over a year ago , but we did not make the change in a clear or consistent manner , ” Gilles said .
“ This has caused a great deal of confusion amongst our users .
We want to rectify this situation by changing our name to Vuze consistently . ”
“ Whilst we recognize the strength of the Azureus name and the frog , it is only associated with our original BitTorrent application .
As we move towards creating an all - in - one application for finding , playing and sharing great content , that goes beyond the realm of just a BitTorrent client , we wanted to change our name to reflect that , but bring with us the frog who is such a part of our heritage , ” Gilles added .
Today , Vuze comes with a brand new release of their client ( v3.1 ) , introducing several new features .
One of the most drastic changes is the new social layer that has been added to the client .
Vuze users are now able to add friends , share torrents with friends , and give friends a speed boost when you are downloading the same torrent .
The new client also includes a meta - search engine that allows you to search across several popular BitTorrent sites , in addition to content from Vuze.com .
The search functionality is completely customizable , so you can add you personal favorite if it ’s not already included .
Unfortunately , there will not be a Vuze client available without the Vuze platform integrated .
Gilles told TorrentFreak : “ We are focusing our efforts on delivering against our vision of creating an all - in - one application that enables users to find , download , play and share in one streamlined application . ”
“ We have started on a path of creating an all - in - one application that enables users to find , play and share torrents .
In particular , we believe that by enabling users to share content and bandwidth through the “ Friends ” feature we are adding a completely new dimension to peer - to - peer – a new social dimension , or what we call ‘ social P2 P ’ , ” Gilles said .
Azureus is no more , the name change is permanent .
On the one hand this is a step forward , as the new interface and functionality will appeal to new users .
However , it has also caused quite a heated debate among both developers and users who were happy with the classic UI .
Although , it ’s a bit hidden , the original interface still remains accessible with the UI switcher .
Time will tell if it is the right move .

Solar shades wo n't reverse global warming
A proposal to place mirrors in the sky to reflect sunlight away from earth wo n't give back the climate we had before , says a new study .
Researchers at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom applied global climate models to predict the effect of using reflective sunshades to reduce the amount of sunlight that enters the earth 's atmosphere back .
They compared two future scenarios , both with CO2 levels four times the pre-industrial baseline .
In one scenario nothing was done , and in the other , sunlight intensity was reduced to a level that would reduce the global average temperature to pre-industrial levels
The second scenario simulated the use of sunshades , which reduced sunlight by about 4.2 % .
" Although we managed to cancel out warming on a global average , what you end up with is some areas that warm up and some that cool down , " says Dr Dan Lunt , who led the study , published in Geophysical Research Letters .
Warmer poles
" We found warming in the Arctic and Antarctic regions , and a cooling in the equatorial regions , " Lunt says .
" We got a decrease in rainfall in a lot of places in the world , decreases in sea ice , and some changes in the El Niño phenomenon . "
These changes resulted because the mirrors reduce sunlight more at the equators than near the poles , while CO2 has a warming effect that 's more equally distributed , Lunt says .
The sunshades also do nothing to prevent changes caused by increased CO2 , such as ocean acidification or changes to plant growth .
Although the sunshade approach wo n't bring back the same climate as reducing CO2 emissions , " it is highly successful compared to doing nothing , " Lunt adds .
Lunt 's team 's work was not the first to try to understand the effects of sunshades using a climate model .
Work by Dr Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution in Stanford , California , also modelled a ' sunshade world ' , but with a less complex model that did not include complete accounting for ocean circulation and sea ice .
" The study confirms our earlier findings with a better model , " Caldeira says .
Other solutions
Although Lunt 's model suggests sunshades are better than nothing , he would rather see efforts focused elsewhere .
" My personal opinion is that we should be focusing our time and money on actually reducing emissions , " he says , " rather than some manmade monstrosity in space . "
" The biggest problem I have with geoengineering discussions now is that the prospect of it working will reduce efforts to mitigate the problem by reducing fossil fuel emissions , " says climatologist Professor Alan Robock of Rutgers University in New Brunswick .
" The solution to the climate problem is mitigation , not geoengineering , " he says .
" These things are not perfect and there 's the potential for unintended consequences . "
The Ohio man caught on camera having sex with a picnic table has been jailed for six months , NBC reports .
Art Price Jr , 40 , of Bellvue , molested the round metal table on four occasions .
The last garden furniture liaison was on 12 March , a day before an unnamed informant dropped off DVD video evidence with cops , showing the hardened perp on the job .
NBC explains : " Price is seen naked and masturbating in the rear room near the open doorway ; he then comes out to the deck .
He tilts the metal round picnic table on its side and lays up against it and has sexual intercourse with the table .
Afterwards he cleans the table and the deck . "
While sex with picnic tables is normally considered a misdemeanour , Price 's proximity to Ridge Elementary School upped the outrage to a felony .
Price was cuffed on 20 March , and during questioning " admitted he had sex with the picnic table " and " confirmed the incidents caught on the DVD " .
He also " admitted to having sex with the table inside his home " .
On 18 June , Price pleaded no contest to " disseminating harmful material to juveniles and public indecency " .
The Huron County Department of Corrections confirmed he was sentenced to six months ' jail . ®
Bootnote
Those of you who require technical details of how to make " the beast with one back and six legs " , Police Captain Matt Johnson explained back in March : " He would use the hole from the umbrella and have sex with the table . "
Our recent post about the future of historic preservation in New York City elicited a fascinating comment from Dr. Mark Klein * who offered this intriguing recollection :
Anybody know if people are still fishing in Manhattan basements in buildings constructed over still flowing streams ?
Recall a story about that in the NYT some 30 - 35 years ago .
Such is the magic of The New York Times a story like that remains alive in mind so many years later .
Well , with flattery like that , we could n’t help but look into this .
Our intrepid reporter Andy Newman , of the Brooklyn bureau , wrote back to Dr. Klein yesterday to report the bad news :
My editors asked me to look into whether people still fish under Manhattan .
Alas , I think the answer is probably no .
The piece in The Times you recalled was probably a letter published in 1971 , which I ’ve attached here .
In it , the author , Jack Gasnick , reminisces about the day 15 or so years before , when he caught ( and later ate ) an almost - three - pound carp in the basement of his hardware supply house at Second Avenue and 53rd Street .
Mr. Gasnick concludes his letter by noting , “ But this is all in the past .
My little stream is no more !
The Corning Glass Building at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue has used up all the water …. ”
I ca n’t find anything else in our archives about fishing beneath the city .
Sorry to be the bearer of sad tidings .
In a telephone interview today , John Waldman , an aquatic biologist at Queens College and the author of “ Heartbeats in the Muck : The History , Sea Life and Environment of New York Harbor , ” said he found the 1971 article “ very interesting . ”
He called the account very detailed and added , “ It is possible , but it would have taken very peculiar and unlikely circumstances for this to have happened . ”
But asked whether any carp could be found swimming under Manhattan today , Dr. Waldman said it was virtually impossible : “ Fish do n’t live in the dark for generations .
It just does n’t happen . ”
He told us :
There is this famous brook that bubbles up in the lobby of a building in Lower Manhattan .
It ’s kind of everyone ’s last sad memory of the streams that one covered the island .
Apparently you can walk to the fountain and see a device that allows water to trickle through .
But there ’s no way it ’s supporting any kind of vertebrate life .
There might be some microbes in it .
There ’s no way carps are living underground .
We have our famous alligators living in the sewers – but that ’s a myth .
It ’s possible that if there were a surface connection – say , a pond in its path – than organisms might get sucked through and end in strange places .
Update : Dr. Waldman , in response to the comment by C. Murphy ( see No. 9 in the comments below ) , writes :
Cave fish adapted over thousands of years to cave life , losing their eyes and pigmentation in the process .
They exist in low densities in only a few cave systems worldwide that flush through edible organic matter from surface waters .
I did not know about the carp in Istanbul .
But they either must be receiving food in the same way true cavefish do , from scraps derived from the photosynthetic - based ecology of surface waters , or , someone is feeding them .
Food must be exported to subterannean waters in the absence of photosynthesis .
Concerning our Manhattan carp from 1971 , I believe it possible that these long - lived and hardy creatures survived in this unlikely habitat after having been spawned much earlier under more classic conditions prior to the complete landfilling of the stream .
It also is possible that someone dumped them into this underground rivulet at a later point .
The least likely scenario is that they were maintaining an ongoing population in those circumstances .
But regardless of how they got there , I wonder what food sources could have sustained them ?

Note to the powers that be at Giz : Since Friday seems to be the flameoutofftopicthreadjackingn ... day , maybe Giz could set up a post about nothing , mark it NSFW and just let the folks rant / blow off steam .
Give the kids some play time so they can play nice the rest of the time .
I am trying to be mindful of the recent request to behave , and I note others are as well , so maybe a little recess is in order .

It makes me feel like a traitor to write this .
The Second World War was my religion for most of my life .
Brave , alone , bombed , defiant , we , the British , had won it on our own against the most evil and powerful enemy imaginable .
Born six years after it was over , I felt almost as if I had lived through it , as my parents most emphatically had , with some bravery and much hardship in both cases .
What do you think ?

Heroism : Tommies commandeer a German machine gun during battle for Caen in 1944
With my toy soldiers , tanks and field - guns , I defeated the Nazis daily on my bedroom floor .
I lost myself in books with unembarrassed titles like Men Of Glory , with their crisp , moving accounts of acts of incredible bravery by otherwise ordinary people who might have been my next - door neighbours .
I read the fictional adventures of RAF bomber ace Matt Braddock in the belief that the stories were true , and not caring in the slightest about what happened when his bombs hit the ground .
I do now .
After this came all those patriotic films that enriched the picture of decency , quiet courage and self - mocking humour that I came to think of as being the essence of Britishness .
To this day I can't watch them without a catch in the throat .
This was our finest hour .
It was the measure against which everything else must be set .
So it has been very hard for me since the doubts set in .
I did n't really want to know if it was n't exactly like that .
But it has rather forced itself on me .
When I lived in Russia at the end of the Soviet era , I found a country that made even more of the war than we did .
I even employed a splendid old Red Army war veteran to help me set up my office there : an upright , totally reliable old gentleman just like my father 's generation , except that he was Russian and a convinced Stalinist who did odd jobs for the KGB .
They had their war films , too .
And their honourable scars .
And they were just as convinced they had won the war single - handed as we were .
They regarded D - Day as a minor event and had never heard of El Alamein .
Once I caught myself thinking : " They 're using the war as a way of comforting themselves over their national decline , and over the way they 're clearly losing in their contest with America . "
And then it came to me that this could be a description of my own country .
When I lived in America itself , where I discovered that the Second World War , in their view , took place mainly in the Pacific , and in any case did n't matter half as much as the Civil War and the Vietnam War , I got a second harsh , unwanted history lesson .
Now here comes another .
On a recent visit to the USA I picked up two new books that are going to make a lot of people in Britain very angry .
I read them , unable to look away , much as it is hard to look away from a scene of disaster , in a sort of cloud of dispirited darkness .
They are a reaction to the use - in my view , abuse - of the Second World War to justify the Iraq War .
We were told that the 1939 - 45 war was a good war , fought to overthrow a wicked tyrant , that the war in Iraq would be the same , and that those who opposed it were like the discredited appeasers of 1938 .
Well , I did n't feel much like Neville Chamberlain ( a man I still despise ) when I argued against the Iraq War .
And I still do n't .
Some of those who opposed the Iraq War ask a very disturbing question .
The people who sold us Iraq did so as if they were today 's Churchills .
They were wrong .
In that case , how can we be sure that Churchill 's war was a good war ?
What if the Men of Glory did n't need to die or risk their lives ?
What if the whole thing was a miscalculated waste of life and wealth that destroyed Britain as a major power and turned her into a bankrupt pensioner of the USA ?
Funnily enough , these questions echo equally uncomfortable ones I 'm often asked by readers here .
The milder version is : " Who really won the war , since Britain is now subject to a German - run European Union ? "
The other is one I hear from an ever - growing number of war veterans contemplating modern Britain 's landscape of loutishness and disorder and recalling the sacrifices they made for it : " Why did we bother ? "
Do n't read on if these questions rock your universe .
The two books , out in this country very soon , are Patrick Buchanan 's Churchill , Hitler And The Unnecessary War and Nicholson Baker 's Human Smoke .
I know Pat Buchanan and respect him , but I have never liked his sympathy for " America First " , the movement that tried to keep the USA out of the Second World War .
As for Nicholson Baker , he has become famous only because his phone - sex novel , Vox , was given as a present to Bill Clinton by Monica Lewinsky .
Human Smoke is not a novel but a series of brief factual items deliberately arranged to undermine the accepted story of the war , and it has received generous treatment from the American mainstream , especially the New York Times .
Baker is a pacifist , a silly position open only to citizens of free countries with large navies .
He has selected with care to suit his position , but many of the facts here , especially about Winston Churchill and Britain 's early enthusiasm for bombing civilian targets , badly upset the standard view .
In his element : Churchill preferred war to peace .
claims U.S. author Patrick Buchanan
Here is Churchill , in a 1920 newspaper article , allegedly railing against the " sinister confederacy " of international Jewry .
I say " allegedly " because I have not seen the original .
I also say it because I am reluctant to believe it , as I am reluctant to believe another Baker snippet which suggests that Franklin Roosevelt was involved in a scheme to limit the number of Jews at Harvard University .
Such things today would end a political career in an instant .
Many believe the 1939 - 45 war was fought to save the Jews from Hitler .
No facts support this fond belief .
If the war saved any Jews , it was by accident .
Its outbreak halted the " Kindertransport " trains rescuing Jewish children from the Third Reich .
We ignored credible reports from Auschwitz and refused to bomb the railway tracks leading to it .
Baker is also keen to show that Hitler 's decision to exterminate the Jews of Europe came only after the war was fully launched , and that before then , although his treatment of the Jews was disgusting and homicidal , it stopped well short of industrialised mass murder .
The implication of this , that the Holocaust was a result of the war , not a cause of it , is specially disturbing .
A lot of people will have trouble , also , with the knowledge that Churchill said of Hitler in 1937 , when the nature of his regime was well known : " A highly competent , cool , well informed functionary with an agreeable manner , a disarming smile , and few have been unaffected by a subtle personal magnetism . "
Three years later , the semi-official view , still pretty much believed , was that Hitler was the devil in human form and more or less insane .
Buchanan is , in a way , more damaging .
He portrays Churchill as a man who loved war for its own sake , and preferred it to peace .
As the First World War began in 1914 , two observers , Margot Asquith and David Lloyd George , described Churchill as " radiant , his face bright , his manner keen ... you could see he was a really happy man " .
Churchill also ( rightly ) gets it in the neck from Buchanan for running down British armed forces between the wars .
It was Churchill who , as Chancellor of the Exchequer , demanded deep cuts in the Royal Navy in 1925 , so when he adopted rearmament as his cause ten years later , it was his own folly he was railing against .
Well , every country needs men who like war , if it is to stand and fight when it has to .
And we all make mistakes , which are forgotten if we then get one thing spectacularly right , as Churchill did .
Americans may take or leave Mr Buchanan 's views about whether they should have stayed out , but the USA did very well out of a war in which Britain and Russia did most of the fighting , while Washington pocketed ( and still keeps ) most of the benefits .
Surveying Buchanan 's chilly summary , I found myself distressed by several questions .
The First and Second World Wars , as Buchanan says , are really one conflict .
We went to war with the Kaiser in 1914 mainly because we feared being overtaken by Germany as the world 's greatest naval power .
Yet one of the main results of the war was that we were so weakened we were overtaken instead by the USA .
We were also forced , by American pressure , to end our naval alliance with Japan , which had protected our Far Eastern Empire throughout the 1914 - 18 war .
This decision , more than any other , cost us that Empire .
By turning Japan from an ally into an enemy , but without the military or naval strength to guard our possessions , we ensured that we would be easy meat in 1941 .
After the fall of Singapore in 1942 , our strength and reputation in Asia were finished for good and our hurried scuttle from India unavoidable .
Worse still is Buchanan 's analysis of how we went to war .
I had always thought the moment we might have stopped Hitler was when he reoccupied the Rhineland on March 7 , 1936 .
But Buchanan records that nobody was interested in such action at the time .
Nobody ?
Yes .
That includes Churchill , who said fatuously on March 13 : " Instead of retaliating by armed force , as would have been done in a previous generation , France has taken the proper and prescribed course of appealing to the League of Nations . "
He then even more wetly urged " Herr Hitler " to do the decent thing and withdraw .
Buchanan does n't think that Britain and France could have saved Czechoslovakia in 1938 , and I suspect he is right .
But this is a minor issue beside his surgical examination of Britain 's guarantee to help Poland in March 1939 .
Hitler saw our " stand " as an empty bluff , and called it .
The Poles were crushed and murdered , and their country erased from the map .
Hitler 's eventual defeat left Poland under the Soviet heel for two generations .
We then embarked on a war which cost us our Empire , many of our best export markets , what was left of our naval supremacy , and most of our national wealth - gleefully stripped from us by Roosevelt in return for Lend - Lease supplies .
As a direct result we sought membership of a Common Market that has since bled away our national independence .
Would we not have been wiser to behave as the USA did , staying out of it and waiting for Hitler and Stalin to rip out each other 's bowels ?
Was Hitler really set on a war with Britain or on smashing the British Empire ?
The country most interested in dismantling our Empire was the USA .
Hitler never built a surface navy truly capable of challenging ours and , luckily for us , he left it too late to build enough submarines to starve us out .
He was very narrowly defeated in the Battle of Britain , but how would we have fared if , a year later , he had used the forces he flung at Russia to attack us instead ?
But he did n't .
His " plan " to invade Britain , the famous Operation Sealion , was only a sketchy afterthought , quickly abandoned .
Can it be true that he was n't very interested in fighting or invading us ?
His aides were always baffled by his admiration for the British Empire , about which he would drone for hours .
Of course he was an evil dictator .
But so was Joseph Stalin , who would later become our honoured ally , supplied with British weapons , fawned on by our Press and politicians , including Churchill himself .
By Christmas 1940 , Stalin had in fact murdered many more people than Hitler and had invaded nearly as many countries .
We almost declared war on him in 1940 and he ordered British communists to subvert our war effort against the Nazis during the Battle of Britain .
And , in alliance with Hitler , he was supplying the Luftwaffe with much of the fuel and resources it needed to bomb London .
Not so simple , is it ?
Survey the 20th Century and you see Britain repeatedly fighting Germany , at colossal expense .
No one can doubt the valour and sacrifice involved .
But at the end of it all , Germany dominates Europe behind the smokescreen of the EU ; our Empire and our rule of the seas have gone , we struggle with all the problems of a great civilisation in decline , and our special friend , the USA , has smilingly supplanted us for ever .
But we won the war .

List of Troubled Banks Worries Wall Street , DC ABC
News has obtained privately prepared lists of troubled banks .
July 15 , 2008  -- Banks in Colorado , Maryland , Georgia and California top privately - prepared lists of troubled banks being circulated on Wall Street and in Washington .
While the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) is keeping secret its official list of 90 troubled banks , ABC News has obtained other lists prepared by several research groups and financial analysts .
The lists use versions of the so - called " Texas ratio " which compare a bank 's assets and reserves to its non-performing loans , based on financial data made public by the FDIC in March .
Analysts say banks with a ratio over 100 per cent would be the most likely to fail , based on what happened to Texas savings and loans during the 1980's .
" That a fair measure , " said Hal Scott , a Harvard law school professor specializing in banking law .
" It does n't mean every one of those banks is going to become insolvent , but if you have more bad loans than assets , it 's not a bad way to judge what could happen , " Scott told ABC News .
One list prepared by Research Associates of America , a non-profit group in Washington , D.C. funded by labor unions , reported 10 banks with a ratio over 100 .
( click here to see the list )
" This is information that the FDIC essentially hides in plain sight , " said Jeff Fiedler , president of Research Associates of America .
At the top of the list was ANB Financial National Association of Bentonville , AR , with a 344 ratio .
The bank failed earlier this year and was later taken over by a Louisiana bank .
The Colorado Federal Savings Bank of Greenwood Village , CO , was listed as having a bad loan to asset ratio of 244.82 .
Late today , Colorado Federal 's president and CEO , Randy Ilich , reported that a new owner bought the bank two weeks ago , adding more than $ 10 million in capital .
" The previous owners were in serious trouble , but we are now in a very good place , " Ilich told ABC News .
Ilich said Colorado Federal had suffered from " fraudulent transactions " and speculative home buyers who could not make their payments .
" We now have more than enough reserves in place to go forward , " said Ilich .
The Eastern Savings Bank of Hunt Valley , MD was listed as having a Texas ratio of 222.74 , meaning it had twice as many bad loans as assets and surplus .
Repeated calls seeking comment from Eastern were not returned .
The Integrity Bank of Alpharetta , GA was listed with a 191 ratio .
Calls from ABC News to Integrity Bank were not returned , but the Atlanta Constitution quoted the bank 's president and chief executive , Patrick Frawley , as saying the Texas ratio is " a little misleading . "
Frawley said the Texas ratio does n't count all of the bank 's reserves for losses and fails to reflect that the loans are secured with real estate collateral .
Jan Schultz , chairman of the First National Bank of Brookville in Illinois , also said the numbers do n't tell the whole story .
While his bank has many nonperforming loans , they are secured by real estate whose value remains high , even with the slumping market , he said .
" We do n't anticipate significant loan losses at all , " Schultz told ABC News .
With a ratio just under 100 , at 96 , the $ 13 - billion Downey Savings and Loan of Newport Beach , California is the biggest financial institution with a high ratio of bad loans .
Tom Prince , Downey 's chief operating officer , said many of the bank 's non-performing loans in March have since become current and that the Texas ratio " is only a statistic . "
" I do n't think there is any one number you can point to and say that will predict what will happen going forward , " Prince said .
" We feel good about our situation , " he said .
The banks on the list are FDIC - insured , meaning that depositors with less than $ 100,000 would be covered should their banks go under .

It 's perfectly fitting that what is billed as the most in - depth exposition of artefacts related to Charles Darwin 's development of the theory that man descended from other , earlier life forms – called Darwin : The Evolution Revolution – will find its temporary home in the Royal Ontario Museum beginning March 8 , for that has traditionally been the type of setting where human beings and their prehistoric ancestors actually come face to face .
All other encounters , especially between homo sapiens and the giant lizards that predated them by untold millennia , are pure fantasy .
Much , that is , to the chagrin of generations of young boys .
The fact is , there comes a time in the formative development of any young nerd when the crushing truth about dinosaurs sets in .
Irresistibly cool as the idea may be , they never met people .
Or so science insists .
Dinosaurs and people were separated by millions of years , and they would only be brought together in the comics , cartoons and pulp novels that fed the imagination , and – as technology permitted – in movies like King Kong , One Million B.C. , and – surely this is why God created computers – Jurassic Park .
It was a case of popular culture providing what science could not .
Since the very idea of men roaming the same planet as giant reptiles was just too good to resist – who can imagine Fred without Dino ?
– a virtual subgenre of fantasy entertainment has specialized in that very spectacle .
It 's a spectacle that Charles Darwin made necessary .
With the publication of his On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , Or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life in 1859 , the controversy - averse , socially shy British naturalist ( described by one biographer as " a reclusive biologist who wrote books " ) almost single - handedly upended the prevailing paradigm concerning the relationship between man , God and Nature .
Where a concept of divine design in nature had prevailed for centuries , Darwin – a non-religious scientific materialist – offered something radically , startlingly and heretically different : a vision of nature processing change in life forms by force of circumstance , a process of constant situational adaptation that saw survival as the only `design ' at work .
Ergo , dinosaurs go when they can no longer cut it , and man only comes along when natural circumstances permit .
Small wonder Darwin himself sat on the revelation for years before publishing it .
He knew what was coming .
As he wrote in a letter , he felt like he was " committing murder . "
While there remains much dispute as to just what Darwin killed or how effectively he did so , at the very least he strangled the notion that history might have contained that fabulously dramatic moment when men went spear to talon with T - rex .
Never happened .
At least not in nature .
But who needs nature ( or Charles Darwin ) when you 've got movies ?
Yet there may be no country in the world other than America where a movie featuring both dinosaurs and people would be regarded as the truth .
Consider the statistics .
According to Susan Jacoby 's recent book The Age of American Unreason , which singles out certain anti-Darwinian strains in American culture as an especially egregious example of the country 's drift away from rationalism , " Fewer than half of Americans – 48 per cent – accept any form of evolution ( even guided by God ) , and just 26 per cent accept Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection .
Fully 42 per cent say that all living beings , including humans , have existed in their present form since the beginning of time . "
Jacoby is quoting data from a 2005 survey conducted by the PEW Forum on Religion and Life , and the figures show up once again in David Quammen 's The Reluctant Mr. Darwin , a book that attempts to put both Darwin and his theories in some kind of clear , rational context .
Noble though Quammen 's intentions may be , they might also be quixotic , especially considering just how many Americans seem to be willing to express their views on evolution and natural selection without having much idea what they are .
As Kevin Phillips points out in American Theocracy , a volume addressing the hugely consequential convergence of religious fundamentalism and politics in Bush's U.S.A. , " In 1993 , an international social survey ranked Americans last – behind Bulgaria and Slovenia – in knowledge of the basic facts of evolution . "
To quote Groucho : " Whatever it is , I 'm against it . "
But does this ignorance of the specifics of Darwin 's theories actually prevent the controversy from being even more explosive ?
Quammen , for one , thinks so .
Pointing out that the idea of evolution – wherein life forms change over time – is profoundly less theologically threatening than the idea of natural selection – wherein evolution is determined solely by an organism 's situational response to natural circumstances , and thus utterly bereft of divine design – the author raises the notion that it may actually be a good thing that people think they know more about Darwin than they actually do .
" His biggest idea , bigger than mere evolution , " writes Quammen , " was just too big , too harsh and threatening .
It was called `natural selection ' and identified as the primary mechanism of evolutionary change . "
If you 're looking for the God - hole in Darwin , this is it : " ( Natural selection ) embodies a deep chanciness , " Quammen notes , " that is contradictory to the notion that Earth 's living creatures , their capacities ( including human capacities ) , their histories , their indigenousness to particular locales , and their interrelations all reflect some sort of divinely preordained plan .
Creationist proselytizers pursuing Christian political agendas are therefore right to regard it with loathing and alarm . "
A year before the PEW survey was taken , the Gallup organization interviewed more than 1,000 Americans over the phone .
Among the statements presented for response was : " God created human beings pretty much in their present form at some time within the last 10,000 years or so . "
As Quammen notes in the introduction to The Reluctant Mr. Darwin , 45 per cent of those surveyed agreed .
Thirty - eight per cent of the respondents agreed that human beings " have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life , but God guided this process . "
Only 13 per cent agreed with what might be called Darwin 's original principle : that humans have evolved over time from other life forms with nature – and not God – as their only guide .
Clearly , there 's something about ( to borrow the title of a 2001 documentary ) Darwin's Dangerous Idea that continues to meet aggressive and even mounting resistance more than a century and a half after they were first published .
As Quammen notes : " Certainly those Gallup results – combined with the continuing political offensive against teaching evolutionary biology in public schools – testify that Charles Darwin is n't just perennially significant .
He 's also urgently relevant to education and governance . "
Urgent is the word .
If anything , Darwin 's ideas are only becoming more dangerous as we approach the 200th anniversary of his birth .
As Jacoby notes , there is actually more resistance , especially in America , today than there was one , two , three or even six generations ago .
Why is this happening ?
Why , despite the fact that creationism , along with its uptown cousin " intelligent design , " keeps getting expelled ( as recently as 2005 's Kitzmiller v. Dover ruling ) as non-science from science classrooms by some of America 's highest courts , while Darwin's " theory " has not only never been disproved but has actually accumulated only more supporting evidence over the decades ?
Why , nearly 200 years after his birth , are people so afraid of Charles Darwin ?
To understand this , you need to understand not only Darwin and his theories but America itself .
As fundamentalism ( a term which first came into being after the widely - covered Scopes trial of the 1920s ) has risen in power and influence in the United States , so has the resistance to the notion of evolution , let alone natural selection .
For if one accepts the ideas of Darwin , one cannot subscribe to a fundamentalist notion of God .
One cannot accept the idea of Genesis as a literal rendering of the creation of man and the universe , and one must accept the idea that the only " guiding " force in nature is adaptation to circumstance in order to survive .
This is not to say that there is no God ( and Darwin never suggested so ) , only that the idea of God itself must be rethought in a post - Darwinian world .
To survive Darwin 's dangerous ideas , even the almighty is compelled to adapt .

According to a poll I conducted , just over 1 out of 10 people do n’t think SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ) is mandatory as a designer ; and what really surprised me is about 24 % do n’t even know what SEO is !
If you ’re among the quarter of people who do n’t know what SEO is or understand how it can help you , you should really read this article .
This is an SEO guide for designers who want to learn about making it easier for websites or blogs to be found by search engines .
I ’ll explain the common mistakes made by designers and developers .
Then I ’ll provide some basic tips that you should be practicing to optimize your site for search engines .
[ poll=7 ]
Why Should You Learn About SEO ?
SEO is n’t only for online marketers .
As a web designer or frontend developer , most on - site SEO is your responsibility .
If your site is not search engine friendly , you might be losing a lot of traffic that you ’re not even aware of .
Remember , besides visitors typing in " www.yourwebsite.com " and backlink referrals ; search engines are the only way people can find your site .
There are many benefits of getting a high ranking site .
Let ’s use ndesign - studio.com for example .
I have , on average , about 14,000 visitors a day .
About 40 – 45 % of that traffic comes from search engines ( about 6000 + referrals a day ) .
Imagine , without search engine referrals , I would be losing thousands of visitors everyday .
That means , I ’m risking losing potential clients too .
SEO is also a value - added service .
As a web designer / developer you can sell your SEO skills as an extended service .
The Basics : How Search Engines Work ?
First , let ’s look at how crawler - based search engines work ( both Google and Yahoo fall in this category ) .
Each search engine has its own automated program called a " web spider " or " web crawler " that crawls the web .
The main purpose of the spider is to crawl web pages , read and collect the content , and follow the links ( both internal and external ) .
The spider then deposits the information collected into the search engine ’s database called the index .
When searchers enter a query in the search box of a search engine , the search engine ’s job is to find the most relevant results to the query by matching the search query to the information in its index .
What makes or breaks a search engine is how well it answers your question when you perform a search .
That ’s based on what ’s called the search engine algorithm which is basically a bunch of factors that the search engine uses to say “ hey is this page RELEVANT or NOT ? ” .
The higher your page ranks for these factors ( yes some factors are more important than others ) than the higher your page will get displayed in the search engine result pages .
Your Job As a Search Engine Optimizer
Each search engine has its own algorithm in ranking web pages .
Understanding the general factors that influence the algorithm can affect your search result position , and this is what SEO experts are hired for .
An SEO ’s job has two aspects : On - Site and Off - Site .
On - Site SEO : are the things that you can do on your site , such as : HTML markups , target keywords , internal linking , site structure , etc .
Off - Site SEO : are the things that you have much less control of , such as : how many backlinks you get and how people link to your site .
This is a guide for designers and developers .
The main concern is the On - Site aspects .
Secretly though , if you do your job right … and design a beautiful site … and / or produce useful content … you ’ll get Off - Site backlinks and social bookmarks without even lifting a finger .
Top 9 SEO Mistakes Made by Designers and Developers
1. Splash Page
I ’ve seen this mistake many times where people put up just a big banner image and a link " Click here to enter " on their homepage .
The worst case — the " enter " link is embedded in the Flash object , which makes it impossible for the spiders to follow the link .
This is fine if you do n’t care about what a search engine knows about your site ; otherwise , you ’re making a BIG mistake .
Your homepage is probably your website ’s highest ranking page and gets crawled frequently by web spiders .
Your internal pages will not appear in the search engine index without the proper linking structure to internal pages for the spider to follow .
Your homepage should include ( at minimum ) target keywords and links to important pages .
2. Non-spiderable Flash Menus
Many designers make this mistake by using Flash menus such as those fade - in and animated menus .
They might look cool to you but they ca n’t be seen by the search engines ; and thus the links in the Flash menu will not be followed .
3. Image and Flash Content
Web spiders are like a text - based browser , they ca n’t read the text embedded in the graphic image or Flash .
Most designers make this mistake by embedding the important content ( such as target keywords ) in Flash and image .
4. Overuse of Ajax
A lot of developers are trying to impress their visitor by implementing massive Ajax features ( particularly for navigation purposes ) , but did you know that it is a big SEO mistake ?
Because Ajax content is loaded dynamically , so it is not spiderable or indexable by search engines .
Another disadvantage of Ajax — since the address URL does n’t reload , your visitor can not send the current page to their friends .
5. Versioning of Theme Design
For some reason , some designers love to version their theme design into sub level folders ( ie. domain.com / v2 , v3 , v4 ) and redirect to the new folder .
Constantly changing the main root location may cause you to lose backlink counts and ranking .
6. “ Click Here ” Link Anchor Text
You probably see this a lot where people use " Click here " or " Learn more " as the linking text .
This is great if you want to be ranked high for " Click Here " .
But if you want to tell the search engine that your page is important for a topic , than use that topic / keyword in your link anchor text .
It ’s much more descriptive ( and relevant ) to say “ learn more about {keyword topic} ”
Warning : Do n’t use the EXACT same anchor text everywhere on your website .
This can sometimes be seen as search engine spam too .
7. Common Title Tag Mistakes
Same or similar title text :
Every page on your site should have a unique < title > tag with the target keywords in it .
Many developers make the mistake of having the same or similar title tags throughout the entire site .
That ’s like telling the search engine that EVERY page on your site refers to the same topic and one is n’t any more unique than the other .
One good example of bad Title Tag use would be the default WordPress theme .
In case you did n’t know , the title tag of the default WordPress theme is n’t
that useful : Site Name > Blog Archive >
Post Title .
Why is n’t this search engine friendly ?
Because every single blog post will have the same text " Site Name > Blog Archive > " at the beginning of the title tag .
If you really want to include the site name in the title tag , it
should be at the end : Post Title | Site Name .
Exceeding the 65 character limit :
Many bloggers write very long post titles .
So what ?
In search engine result pages , your title tag is used as the link heading .
You have about 65 characters ( including
spaces ) to get your message across or risk it getting cutoff .
Keyword stuffing the title :
Another common mistake people tend to make is overfilling the title tag with keywords .
Saying the same thing 3 times does n’t make you more relevant .
Keyword stuffing in the Title Tag is looked at as search engine spam ( not good ) .
But it might be smart to repeat the same word in different ways :
" Photo Tips & Photography Techniques for Great Pictures "
“ Photo ” and “ Photography ” are the same word repeated twice but in different ways because your audience might use either one when performing a search query .
8. Empty Image Alt Attribute
You should always describe your image in the alt attribute .
The alt attribute is what describes your image to a blind web user .
Guess what ?
Search engines can’t see images so your alt attribute is a factor in illustrating what your page is relevant for .
Hint : Properly describing your images can help your ranking in the image search results .
For example , Google image search brings me hundreds of referrals everyday for the search terms " abstract " and " dj " .
9. Unfriendly URLs
Most blog or CMS platforms have a friendly URL feature built - in , however , not every blogger is taking advantage of this .
Friendly URL ’s are good for both your human audience and the search engines .
The URL is also an important spot where your keywords should appear .
Example of Friendly URL : domain.com / page- title
Example of Dynamic URL : domain.com/?p=12356
General SEO Do ’s and Don’ts
Let me tell you WHAT TO DO by telling you WHAT NOT TO DO :
Do n’t Ignore Your Audience
Write about topics your audience cares about .
Like what ?
Find out , by conducting a poll ( like I did ) , scan some relevant bulletin boards or forums , look for common topics in customer emails , or do some keyword research .
There are great free keyword tools like the Google Keyword Tool or SEO Book ’s Keyword Tool and loads more .
The plan is not to spend your life doing keyword research but just to get a general idea of what your visitors are interested in .
Do n’t Be Dense About Keyword Density
Once you have a topic for readers ; help search engines find it .
Keyword Density is the number of times a keyword appears in a page compared to the total number of words .
You want to make sure your keywords are included in the crucial areas :
the Title Tag
the Page URL ( friendly URL )
the Main Heading ( H1 or H2 )
the first paragraph of content .
at least 3 times in the body content ( more or less depending on amount of content and if and only if it makes sense ) .
Most people aim for a keyword density of 2 % ( i.e. use the keyword 2 times for every 100 words ) .
But what if your keyword phrase is “ SEO for Web Designers and Web Developers ” how many times can you repeat that before it sounds just plain unnatural ?
Write for your readers not for search engines .
If you follow the tips
in this article you ’ll be writing naturally for your readers ; which works for the search engines too .
Warning :
Do not over fill your page with the same keywords or you might be penalized by search engines for keyword stuffing .
Do n’t Ignore Relatives
In this article , it makes sense to mention topics like “ keyword research ” , “ search engine crawlers ” and “ title tag use ” , but what if I mentioned a highly trafficked term like “ cell phone plans ” … kind of out of context right ?
So use other keywords and topics that make sense to your audience , the search engine measures keyword relations to determine relevancy too .
Cars and Tires ( yes )
Web Design and Flying Monkeys ( no…well sometimes )
Do n’t Be Afraid of Internal Linking
Do you want the search engine to see every page on your website ?
Help the search engine spider do its job .
There should be a page ( like a sitemap or
blog archives ) that links to all the pages on your site .
Tip :
You can promote the more important pages by inserting text links within body content .
Make sure you use relevant linking text and avoid using " click here " ( as mentioned earlier ) .
Do n’t Ignore Broken Links
You should always search for and fix the broken links on your site .
If you ’ve removed a page or section , you can use the robot.
txt to prevent the spiders crawling and indexing the broken links .
If you have moved a page or your entire website , you can use the 301 .htaccess to redirect to a new URL .
Tips :
You can use the Google Webmaster Tool to find broken links and your 404 Not Found errors .
Do n’t Be Inconsistent With Your Domain URL
To search engines , a www and a non -www URL are considered two different URLs .
You should always keep your domain and URL structure consistent .
If you start promoting your site without the " www " , stick with it .
Do n’t Be Scared of Semantic Coding
Semantic and standard coding not only can make your site cleaner , but it also allows the search engines to read your page better .
Search Result Position
Coding and setting up your site to be SEO friendly can improve how well a search engine can access your website , it does n’t guarantee you ’ll end up at the top of the search engine result page ( SERP ) .
There are many factors in determining the search result position , but here are the basics :
PageRank
Some professional SEO ’s pay attention to Google ’s PageRank and some do n’t .
In my experience it does n’t hurt to have a high Google PageRank .
It ’s a nice little benchmark to let you know how important Google sees your web page as .
You can improve your PageRank by following the tips above and building - up quality backlinks .
If you want to learn how PageRank works , Smashing Magazine has a very good article .
Domain Age Before Beauty
You might be surprised to learn that domain age is also a factor in the search engine algorithm .
Older domains have a history , and their content is looked at as more credible than the website that got started last week .
Older domains sometimes get the edge in search results .
Be Patient
You may have done every single thing right . , but your site is still not showing up in the search engines for your target keywords .
Why ?
Because everything takes time .
It takes time for the search engines to index and rank your site ( especially for new domains ) .
So , be patient .
Another reason — it could be the keywords that you ’re trying to target are very competitive .
Try altering the keywords on the page and you may have different results .
Remember , you are competing with millions of web pages on the internet .

CPI leaps to 8.7 % in February , 11 - year high
( chinadaily.com.cn )
Updated : 2008-03-11 11:33
Inflation in February rose 8.7 percent year on year , the fastest monthly rise in more than a decade , China 's National Bureau of Statistics reported on its website on Tuesday .
The accelerating price hikes , mostly contributed by skyrocketing food prices , have hardened the life of wage - earners and pensioners , Chinese analysts say , and will pressure China 's central bank , the People 's Bank of China , to increase benchmark interest rates , in the short run .
A customer buys vegetable at a market in Nanjing , Jiangsu province February 19 , 2008 .
China 's consumer price index ( CPI ) , the major gauge of inflation , hit a new 11 - year high of 8.7 percent in February on the back of skyrocketing food prices , announced the National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) Tuesday .
[ Agencies ]
The 8.7 - percent rise , as compared with 7.1 percent going - up reported for January , is the most precipitous hike witnessed in more than 11 years .
Xinhua News Agency said that the country 's major inflationary index once rose by 14.1 percent from 1992 to 1996 .
The steep price rises came after the worst snowstorms hitting southern and central China in five decades disrupted the economy and worsened food shortages .
The statistical agency reported the prices of food rose more than 23 percent in February , with those of meat , eggs , vegetables , cooking oil and fruits increasing about 50 percent .
In addition to interest rate rise , the authorities are also expected to take other macro control measures to cool a surge in inflation that has been building since early 2007 , triggered by a housing buzz and stock market boom .
Worrying about an ever increasing control on credit and other monetary instruments , China 's stock market index has lost some 20 per cent since the beginning of the year .
The Shanghai stock index plummeted more than 3 percent on Monday .
Housing prices also stagnated in most of China 's largest cities including Shanghai , Guangzhou and Beijing .
China 's central bank has raised interest rates five times last year , trying to rein in money supply and curb inflation .
However , the piecemeal rises , at 0.27 percentage points each time , have failed to make a dent on CPI .
" There is definitely room for further rate increases , " said Zhou Xiaochuan , the central bank chief during a press conference on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People 's Congress now in session in Beijing .
" The timing and the scale of any ( rate ) adjustment are critical factors to consider , " Zhou was quoted as saying .
The bank chief , however , admitted that the recent aggressive rate cuts , by the United States Federal Reserve to prevent a likely economic contraction in the world 's biggest economy , are restricting China 's ability in raising the cost of capital .
The two countries ' interest rates moving in opposite directions is expected to attract more hot money into China , complicating the country 's efforts to keep its economy from overheating and tame inflation .
Or , how George W. Bush has been just awful enough

Many liberals argue that George W. Bush ’s presidency has been an unmitigated disaster ; most libertarians see George W. Bush as the worst thing to happen to America since our government interned hundreds of thousands of Americans purely based on race and expanded government involvement in the economy at the same time .
Even many conservatives now see George Bush ’s tenure as a series of betrayals .
The past eight years have been a dark time – with the specter of terrorism hanging over our lives – with an economy that has only benefited the elites – with America ’s standing and influence in the world dropping precipitously – and with a government flailing about in attempts to prevent the next attack , attempts that have primarily succeeded in undermining our inherent liberties .
There is clearly a broad consensus that the Bush presidency has been a failure .
A recent poll of historians recently ranked George W. Bush ’s presidency as the worst in history ; late last year , The Atlantic ran a cover story asking what lessons we can learn from Bush ’s failed presidency ; the American people have given George W. Bush the lowest approval ratings for a president since polls have been taken ; and recent news reports have shown that over three quarters of Americans believe our country is on the wrong track .
The consensus clearly is that Bush ’s presidency has failed .
It ’s true that a number of conservatives have tried to defend Bush – Ross Douthat for example pointed out that Bush ’s disasters do not rival the catastrophes of Civil War or Great Depression yet .
But even the group considered the architect of many of Bush ’s policies – the neo- conservatives , have begun to argue – as have failed ideologues again and again throughout history – that it was not that their ideas that failed – rather their ideas were never truly tried .
Bush must know he is in trouble when even the neoconservatives are attacking him as weak and ineffective – or to use the term they use , “ liberal ” .
Having a somewhat contrary nature , I ’m not so sure this almost universal consensus is true .
While I do see Bush ’s presidency as a disaster , I believe a kind of redemption can be found in this disaster because Bush ’s presidency : ( a ) could have been much worse ; and ( b ) has created a unique historical opportunity .
My postulate is that George W. Bush ’s presidency has been just bad enough to avoid destroying the core institutions that form the backbone of our society while creating a virtuous backlash that will strengthen these institutions in the long term .
Bush has abused his power just enough , and aggravated festering issues just enough , and presided over a decline that was so sudden that he has created near ideal conditions to move the country in a positive direction .
Throughout history , the price of radicalism has been steep and the chances of reversing deep - seated trends has been long .
Conservatives who opposed the social welfare programs of the New Deal tried and failed for a generation to rollback the programs that Franklin Delano Rooselvelt instituted in the wake of a Republican - abetted disaster .
Unsuccessful and marginalized , these conservatives finally settled on a strategy of indirection .
They called this strategy “ starve - the - beast . ”
Seeing that they could not win by attacking the institutions of the New Deal directly , they decided to deliberately increase government spending to irresponsible levels while cutting taxes – which would leave no choice for a hypothetical future administration but to raise taxes massively or to reduce the size of government .
These conservatives realized that the only way to achieve the ends they sought was to create a set of circumstances that proved their opponents wrong , to discredit , through their actions , the basis of liberalism and create a virtuous backlash against excessive governance .
They had seen that effective change throughout history had only occurred when the reigning ideology was proved bankrupt by circumstances .
These conservatives believed that if they could undermine the credibility of government enough , their ideology would be the only alternative .
Unfortunately for these conservatives , whatever George W. Bush ’s intentions were , his administration has been the most effective proponent of liberalism in modern times – as it demonstrated the bankruptcy of contemporary conservatism , undermined the credibility of the Republican Party , and created precisely opposite virtuous backlash than which they intended .
Bush ’s effectiveness in advancing the goals he stood against comes has taken several interrelated forms :
Theoretical extremism : Although Bush has asserted virtually unlimited power – to torture , to detain anyone without charges , to engage in military action and wiretap without congressional approval – he has been relatively modest in his use of what he asserts are near unlimited powers .
This has allowed significant forces to grow in opposition to this power grab without the widespread societal chaos that would have arisen out of a president fully exerting the powers he has claimed .
( If Bush used the powers he asserts are his on a greater scale in America , our society would clearly be a totalitarian one .
Instead , we remain a fragile liberal democracy until either Bush ’s assertions of power are repudiated or are fully asserted . )

Overuse of a single method : Karl Rove directed three national campaigns – using national security , patriotism , and September 11 as partisan tools to bludgeon the Democrats .
In each successive election dominated by these themes though , they lost effectiveness until 2006 when finally , they ceased being the controlling factor as the people – fooled for some of the time – handed an historic loss to the Republican Party .
( If Karl Rove had n’t used these themes so promiscously and shamelessly , more people might have put stock in the current smear campaign and fear - mongering being used against Obama and the Democrats . )

( Karl Rove had n’t used these themes so promiscously and shamelessly , more people might have put stock in the current smear campaign and fear - mongering being used against Obama and the Democrats . )
Exacerbating existing conditions : Bush has accelerated a number of longstanding trends : towards domestic inequality and the stratification of Americans into a class - like system ; towards the decline in America ’s power in the world ; towards the government ’s fiscal insolvency ; towards the expansion of executive power ; and towards the increase in the price of oil .
This acceleration has exacerbated these issues so as to make them more noticeable .
A lobster will not realize it is being cooked if it placed in a pot of water at room temperature and gradually boiled to death .
In the same way , many Americans did not realize the dangers and the extent of the changes to American society that have been ongoing since at least the 1970s .
The Bush administration – in a number of areas – raised the temperature fast enough and carelessly enough that many people have begun to notice .
( If the price of oil had increased more regularly , people would be less worried about how it would be affecting them – and less attention would be paid to the largest transfer of wealth in human history that is currently taking place .
If Iraq had n’t demonstrated the limits to American power , it might have taken much longer for policy - makers to realize that we no longer live in a unipolar world . )

Suddenness :
The suddenness of America ’s decline in relevancy has led to a widespread desire for America to re-assume some leadership role with the next president – a desire reflected most significantly in the worldwide and domestic support for Barack Obama .
Bush has – in almost every respect – pointed America in the direction it needs to go .
He has demonstrated what not to do .
It is hard to imagine the libertarian or the progressive movements achieving their widespread support and strength if not for Bush ’s presidency .
This election cycle has already demonstrated the strength of two responses to the Bush administration ’s legacy – the libertarian response as embodied in the unlikely success of Ron Paul and the progressive response as embodied in the progressive netroots which powered Obama ’s campaign .
As a card - carrying civil libertarian and a lifelong progressive , Barack Obama has an opportunity to synthesize these two competing movements – to create a rough political consensus of the next steps we need to take .
( I ’ve written before both about how the libertarian movement and liberalism seem to be converging and about how Obama represents some part of this . )
However , Obama ’s vote for the FISA Amendments
Act was a poor start to the creation of this alliance – as he took a position in defiance of both of these movements .
In a very real sense George W. Bush ’s legacy depends on how well the next president is able to capitalize on the opportunity given to him – in this campaign and in his potential presidency .
The final judgment on Bush will not be knowable when he leaves office .
Rather , some years later we will be able to make a definitive judgment – after we see how intractable the problems he leaves for his successor are and when we see what precedents the next president will reject and which he will build upon .
Bush may be forgiven for his disrespect for the Constitution if the next president repudiates these precedents .
( After all , Washington was forgiven for Hamilton ’s army ; Lincoln was forgiven for becoming a tyrant for several weeks ; and FDR was forgiven for trying to pack the Supreme Court . )
But while I argue that Bush ’s primary legacy is that of a uniter - not - a - divider whose presidency set America on a better path , this rosy evaluation of Bush ’s legacy still leaves three areas uncovered – areas in which Bush created unique problems rather than exacerbating existing ones : Iraq , the War on Terror , and global climate change .
Complications
Iraq
It is hard to imagine another president invading Iraq under the circumstances that George W. Bush did .
The many American and the far more Iraqi dead that resulted from this foolish gamble , this dumb war , will surely burden his soul and must undermine any positive legacy he leaves behind .
Even assuming the best of intentions , the Iraq war has proved to be a strategic blunder that has empowered Iran , destabilized the region , inspired more extremism , degraded our military , and only achieved the removal of minor antagonist .
Making this strategic error worse was the hubris and idiocy that dogged every step of the occupation .
Although our alliance of convenience with the Sunni extremists who were fighting us just a few months ago has helped to stabilize Iraq and even given the recent show of independence by the Iraqi president in his call for us to set a firm date of withdrawl , Iraq still has a long way to go before we can get out of this quagmire .
Until we get out , the Iraq war will continue to eat our resources , undermine our global position , and strengthen our enemies .
The War on Terror
Domestically , the Bush administration has done virtually nothing to harden potential targets of terrorism – allowing the use of the funds appropriated for this purpose to be pissed away on pork barrel spending .
The main steps it has taken within America seem designed primarily to expand executive power rather than to achieve any particular goals related to terrorism – asserting the power to crush the testicles of a potential terrorist ’s child , to detain individuals without charges for indefinite periods of time , to torture , and to ignore any laws that limit the president ’s power .
Abroad , the Bush administration squandered our best opportunity to destroy Al Qaeda when it began to shift resources to Iraq and away from those who attacked us .
The nexus of world terrorism shifted as a result of the War on Terror from the center of Afghanistan to the lawless areas of the Afghani - Pakistani border – where Chechnyan islamists , the remants of Al Qaeda and the Taliban , veterans of the Zaraqawi ’s Iraqi campaign , and other terrorists from around the world are now working together and with greater freedom than at any time since the attacks on September 11 .
The successes we have had in the War on Terror seem largely to be the fruits of our failures – as the islamist ideology has proven to be an unattractive one once it begins to rule any territory .
Global Climate Change
It is hard to imagine another president ignoring the growing signs and consensus of global climate change so steadfastly .
The eight years the world ’s largest producer of greenhouse gases has wasted ignoring the problem – despite the near universal consensus of the scientific community – have made more drastic steps necessary to correct the problem before it is too late .
What other president – with a legacy on climate change such as this – would have bragged at a recent G8 summit about being the “ world ’s biggest polluter “ ?
Conclusions
Lincoln Chafee , the Republican Senator from Rhode Island , observed upon first meeting Bush that Bush did not seem up to the job of being president .
The past several years have proved this observation prescient .
I cannot argue that Bush ’s actions have been wise , although I do generally think that they have been well - intentioned .
But while George W. Bush and his administration have committed petty crimes , war crimes , and constitutional violations , attacked liberties , advocated the preemptive surrender of American values , usurped independent branches of the government for partisan ends , and caused the injury and death of thousands of Americans citizens and citizens of the world – it is Bush who created this moment – this moment for renewal that has traditionally been what sets America apart .
While Ron Paul believed we needed a revoliution to begin to reverse the growing encroachment of government ( even if that required the exploitation of poisonous racial resentments ) – all we really needed was George W. Bush .
If America truly is a great nation – and in order to redeem the vision of the Constitution of the Founding Fathers , of that great address of Abraham Lincoln , of the square deal of Teddy Roosevelt and the four freedoms of his cousin , of the city on the hill that an old Hollywood actor once invoked – we must take advantage of this opportunity .
The American moment is now – as all of us , feeling the fierce urgency of now , must work to restore the America that we grew up believing in – to restore the ideal and to form a more perfect union .
Throughout the dark times in American history , Americans have believed and fought for this idea of America – to make this idea a reality and to protect this idea from the encroachments of tyranny and totalitarianism .
Change does n’t come easy – but the greatest legacy of George W. Bush is that he has made it easier – and given us this opportunity to create a more perfect union .
There will be obstacles and compomises in the days ahead – but ( yes ) we can achieve real change .
Bush , more than anyone , deserves responsibility for that .

In April 1968 I was a Columbia University freshman , restless , raw and clinging to fond illusions .
So when I saw three men with blackjacks pummel a Spanish - language instructor on the sidewalk and dump his semiconscious body over a hedge in front of Low Library at the center of the campus late one night , my first instinct was to run to the police for help .
It was sometime after midnight on the morning of Tuesday , April 30 , and uniformed policemen were n’t hard to find .
Hundreds of them were taking positions around the campus preparing to evict student demonstrators who had been occupying the university president ’s office and four other buildings for a week to protest the Vietnam War and other sundry matters .
One unit of the leather - jacketed Tactical Police Force , New York City ’s toughest and tallest officers , was lining up in a neat double row outside one of the entrances to Low .
I dashed up to the officer in charge , a silver - haired sergeant who stood a good six inches taller than me .
“ You ’ve got to send some men over there ! ” I pleaded , pointing to the nearby hedge .
“ Some thugs are beating the crap out of my Spanish teacher ! ”
He did n’t move a muscle , did n’t say a word , did n’t even glance down at me , but just the hint of a smile grazed his lips .
He must have thought I was either a particularly sardonic campus comic or just plain stupid .
Because everyone else but me seemed to know very well what I was only beginning to realize — — those three thugs , and dozens of others roaming the campus that night , were plainclothes officers sent to soften up the area by eliminating protesters and bystanders from the scene to make it easier for the uniformed men to carry out their mission with a minimum of witnesses and resistance .
Within hours hundreds of officers evicted the protesters and pacified the campus in their own special way , using clubs , flashlights , and handcuffs to administer beatings like furious parents lashing out at recalcitrant children .
About 150 people went to the hospital to be treated for bloody heads and broken arms , and some 700 were arrested .
I watched much of it in horror and fascination until someone whacked me on the back of the head with a nightstick and two plainclothesmen grabbed me by the arms and threw me down a slope into a wrought - iron fence bordering Amsterdam Avenue .
I staggered back to my dorm room with a sore head and a deep sense of anger at the administrators who ’d invited the police on campus to restore order by beating my classmates and me .
This April marks the 40th anniversary of that particular teachable moment .
It will no doubt provide an opportunity for some aging baby boomers to renew the old culture wars with their dying elders and each other and brag about their exploits , real and imagined .
I plan on doing neither .
I was a wide - eyed witness to events I barely understood and only marginally participated in , and I ’m still embarrassed and amazed at the arrogance and ineptitude on all sides — students , teachers , administrators , cops — in that long - ago struggle .
There were more than 100 student university protests in the United States that spring , but none got more publicity than Columbia’s .
For the university , it was a terrible rupture that provoked years of soul - searching and institutional reform .
For me personally the damage was slight — a nagging headache for a day and a permanently disrupted spring semester — but the lesson was unforgettable .
What I first recall about my arrival at Columbia the previous fall was the decrepitude of the dorms .
Livingston
Hall , where I was assigned , was dark , dingy , and overcrowded .
Most rooms were designed for single occupancy but had been fitted with bunk beds .
They were so small students stacked the ancient wooden dressers atop each other and bookshelves atop desks to create enough space to get to the bed .
There was no room for even the smallest refrigerator ; in winter we would balance cartoons of milk and orange juice on the outside windowsill to keep them cool .
Everyone ’s experience was different , of course , but for me and the few friends I made the chill extended to the classrooms .
Our teachers could be brilliant , but most had little interest in freshmen , and no one encouraged us to approach him outside of the classroom .
I recall meeting with my academic adviser once in four years .
Barnard , the women ’s college , was a distant fortress across Broadway , off - limits and out of sight .
On most weekends I wandered the unruly , decaying urban canyons of Manhattan on foot and alone .
It was my true education .
Meanwhile , the draft was hanging over our head , forcing many young men to stay in school despite their abiding discontent .
Opposition to the Vietnam War was hardening ; that October , protesters staged the first mass rally in Washington .
One campus group that seemed interested in us was the Students for a Democratic Society .
Members organized an orientation session for freshmen and arranged one - on - one meetings .
I recall my roommate John and I going for coffee at the College Inn on Broadway with Ted Gold , one of SDS ’s leaders .
We were n’t exactly prime recruiting material for a radical student group .
John , who joined the crew team and pledged a fraternity , was a conservative Democrat from Worcester , Massachusetts , who aspired to become a lawyer .
I was an inchoate liberal with a soft spot for Robert F. Kennedy .
I admired Columbia , felt lucky to have been accepted at such a prestigious Ivy League school .
Still , for me Gold was logical , insistent , and amiable .
Even John had to admit he was interesting .
There were various skirmishes between SDS and the administration during the school year .
The group focused on two campus issues : Columbia ’s plan to build a new gym on city land in nearby Morningside Park , which bordered on Harlem , and its membership in the Institute for Defense Analyses , a federally funded national security research and development center .
The two issues were stand - ins for broader questions :
The gym was about racial justice , the IDA Vietnam .
After an indoor demonstration in late March led to the proposed suspension of a half - dozen SDS leaders , the group added another demand : amnesty for the protesters .
Demonstrators on Tuesday afternoon , April 23 , sought to march on Low Library but were blocked by student opponents and campus police .
Some protesters tramped over to Morningside Park , where they confronted police at the gym construction site , then wandered back to campus .
Running out of steam and options , they turned their focus to Hamilton Hall , the main undergraduate classroom building .
Acting college dean Henry Coleman refused to vacate his office , so they sat down outside his door , blocking his freedom of movement .
The standoff continued into the night until early the next morning when black students among the protesters seized control of Hamilton Hall and ordered out the whites .
The evictees proceeded to smash their way into Low Library and seize the office of university president Grayson Kirk .
Over the next two days , three more classroom buildings were occupied .
The siege had begun .
Most of us were stunned to find our classroom buildings suddenly off - limits .
Many of us simply wanted to be left alone to continue our studies .
But large minorities on both sides took a stand .
It was an Ivy League version of West Side Story .
On one side were the jocks — athletes and nerds , many of whom dressed like they came from a previous era .
They were furious that a handful of leftist agitators had succeeded in paralyzing their beloved institution while a weak - broth collection of teachers and administrators stood by passively .
On the other side were the pukes , named for their scruffy hair and attire .
Some were true radicals , but most were fed up and suspicious of a dysfunctional university that failed to practice the liberal values it preached .
My roommate John was a jock — he wore a white shirt and blue blazer to a gathering outside Hamilton Hall where the newly formed Students for a Free Campus sought to seal off the building and isolate the demonstrators inside .
I was an aspiring puke — I had the unkempt long hair , flannel shirt , and denims for the role , but lacked the conviction .
John and I found ourselves on opposite sides of the line that morning , although neither wanted to confront the other .
Then , to our mutual surprise , our favorite instructor , a sociology professor named Martin Wenglinksy , joined a small cordon of concerned teachers who positioned themselves between us .
It was the first time I ’d ever seen him outside of class .
The radicals were an arrogant crew .
A few weeks earlier Mark Rudd , the newly elected SDS leader , had confronted university vice president David Truman , one of the more respected figures on campus .
Truman had tried to get by a group of protesters to enter a classroom building , saying , “ I have an appointment . ”
Rudd ’s retort : “ Adolf Eichmann had appointments too . ”
The siege was a windfall for Rudd , and he used it as a publicity and recruiting tool .
His stated goal was to bring the university to its knees and he made no effort to hide his agenda .
His sole saving grace , in my view then , was that he freely applied his withering disdain .
A few days into the crisis , folk singer Phil Ochs arrived at Ferris Booth Hall , the student union , to cheer us on .
He sang a half - dozen protest songs to great applause .
Then someone announced that a hat would be passed to pay for Phil ’s cab fare and thank him for the free performance .
Rudd grabbed the microphone .
Do n’t bother giving your money to Phil Ochs because he does n’t need it , Rudd told us .
If you ’ve got any spare change , contribute it to the committee supplying food to the strikers occupying the buildings .
Ochs left empty - handed .
Dean Coleman was allowed to leave his office after 26 hours , while the siege dragged on for a week .
An ad hoc faculty group futilely sought to negotiate a compromise between administrators and the protesting students .
The campus became a magnet for anarchists , Maoists , bohemians , Trotskyites , and angry young blacks from Harlem .
Celebrity radicals like H. Rap Brown , Stokely Carmichael , and Tom Hayden made guest appearances .
( Hayden stayed to join the “ commune ” occupying the mathematics building . )
Nearly 300 journalists , TV cameramen and reporters , photographers set up shop on campus to watch the spectacle unfold .
One inspired couple in Fayerweather Hall got married late on Sunday night ; the Episcopal priest who presided pronounced them “ children of the new age . ”
I gravitated to Avery , the loosest and least radical of the five occupied zones , although I never spent the night away from my dorm room for fear of the police bust that everyone knew was coming .
The administration , led by Kirk and Truman , seemed aloof and clueless .
The deeply divided faculty shuttled from one side to the other with lists of conditions and demands , as if they were mediating a labor dispute instead of playing the role of hapless liberals in a moment of political theater .
The faculty overwhelmingly opposed amnesty but almost as strongly feared police action .
Students on both sides seethed with discontent .
Each side accused the other of fascism .
Finally , after seven nights of chaos and ineptitude , Kirk and Truman called in the cops .
They first obtained assurances that the campus would not be cleared wholesale and that the demonstrators would have sufficient warning to leave peacefully .
They planned for the bust to occur at 4 a.m. , when the campus would presumably be nearly deserted .
It did n’t happen that way .
The 88 black students occupying Hamilton Hall were escorted out through a tunnel to Amsterdam Avenue with dignity and calm to awaiting paddy wagons .
But the administration and the police had sorely underestimated the number of white demonstrators in the other buildings , plus the 1,500 people — many of them undergraduates — milling around campus .
The police were outnumbered and caught by surprise .
They changed their tactics without warning or consultation , turning their fury first on the bystanders to get us out of the way , then hauling the protesters from the buildings into paddy wagons .
Kirk ’s office was left a shambles .
His personal photos and private possessions were smashed , his files looted , slogans and obscenities daubed on the walls .
New York Times reporter A.M. Rosenthal , who accompanied the president , watched as Kirk wandered the suite in a trance .
“ How could civilized human beings act this way ? ” he asked .
David Truman , devastated by the violence , walked home to his Riverside Drive apartment and wept .
The next day I pulled myself out of bed and signed up for strike duty , my anger and alienation now focused on the university administration .
The plainclothes cops who had beaten the Spanish instructor and many others still stalked the campus in small groups .
They wore colored pins in their jackets to identify themselves to each other .
They seemed as arrogant and smug as Rudd and his SDS comrades .
I recall one of the cops eyeing me with a smirk , as if to say , “ I know your face , and I ’ll be looking for you next time . ”
I felt intimidated — and bitter .
I was hardly alone .
The police tactics shocked and radicalized many students , creating massive support for the strike .
SDS members refused to report for disciplinary hearings .
The pressure was on the administration , not the students .
Columbia became the new popular front in the Age of Aquarius .
Allen Ginsburg , Herbert Marcuse , and the Grateful Dead arrived to admire and entertain us .
With formal classes suspended , students signed up for liberation courses like “ Sexual Intercourse as a Political and Human Reality , ” “ Motorcycle Mechanics , ” “ Moderately Liberated Talmud , ” and “ Imperialism and National Liberation Movements . ”
A second round of confrontation was inevitable .
On May 21 , SDS led another occupation of Hamilton Hall .
Vandals lit fires in some of the buildings , and by early the next morning we had built makeshift barricades on both ends of Campus Walk bordering both the Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue .
I stood against the Broadway barricade as the police on the other side described with great relish what they planned to do to us when they got the order to move in .
“ It ’s my campus ! ” I yelled back at them .
It was a dialogue of the deaf .
Just before 5 a.m. the cops broke through , nightsticks flailing .
This time the violence was mutual — students threw rocks , bottles , and paving stones .
My friends and I retreated to the safety of our dorm .
But not everyone made it .
The police pursued some students as high as fourth - floor stairwells .
There were 171 arrests .
Nearly 17 police and 51 protesters were injured .
School was closed until fall .
Grayson Kirk retired in August .
The university dropped plans to build the gym and quit the IDA .
Columbia ’s $ 200 million fundraising campaign suffered a major setback .
A special commission led by Harvard law professor Archibald Cox concluded that “ the seizure of the buildings was not simply the work of a few radicals ” but had “ involved a significant portion of the student body who had become disenchanted with the operation of their university . ”
David Truman , the talented vice president and provost whom everyone had tagged as the next president , resigned the following January to become president of Mount Holyoke College , a much smaller institution .
I still recall the press release announcing his departure :
It said he had always been extremely interested in higher education in the Connecticut River Valley .
The leaders of SDS followed the logic of their ideology and descended into the violence of the Weather Underground .
Nearly two years after the Columbia strike , Ted Gold and two others were killed in an explosion in a Greenwich Village town house .
They were building a bomb that they planned to use at a military dance at Fort Dix .
The line between idealism and terrorism had been obliterated .
Mark Rudd spent seven years in hiding and emerged still committed to radical change but renouncing violence .
I suspect I ’d like him a lot better now .
The men who took over running Columbia were less rigid and more creative than Kirk and Truman .
They scrapped all of the bunk beds in Livingston and reconverted the narrow rooms to singles , knocked out the walls between two small rooms in the middle of each floor and turned them into lounges with couches , arm chairs , and color television .
Cable TV became the opiate of the undergraduate masses — we learned to care more about the fate of the New York Knicks than the Cuban masses .
The rules strictly governing when women were allowed upstairs were at first eased , then abolished .
After a year of living in an apartment , I returned to Livingston Hall as a dorm counselor — a collaborator in the system I richly despised .
The administration had bought us off with a lounge and a television and the prospect of sex .
Too bad for them they had n’t thought of it sooner .
After graduation I eventually became a journalist , and a series of lucky breaks got me in 1979 to the Washington Post , still basking in post - Watergate glory .
Journalism was a good fit for my ambivalence and my slowly melting alienation — I could be an insider and an outsider at the same time , learn the inner workings of institutions and the people who powered them yet at the same time be a critic .
Surely the seeds of that stance were planted at Columbia , where I had embraced neither the institution nor the radicals who sought to destroy it .
In the 1980s I became a foreign correspondent and did tours in Southern Africa , Jerusalem , and London .
Those are the places where I rediscovered deeper lessons from Columbia .
Kirk and Truman had been reluctant to use state power — once they called in the police , they accomplished their immediate goal but alienated their allies , radicalized the uncommitted , and destroyed themselves in the bargain .
Over and over again I saw the same process take place in the countries I covered .
Even in apartheid South Africa , the rulers of the white - minority regime were slow to use police violence to regain control of the black townships , realizing they could n’t control its consequences .
They were much more comfortable with so - called surgical strikes like assassinations and “ disappearances ” than with large - scale repression .
The same was true in Israel during the first Palestinian uprising , where the proud Israeli Defense Forces rebelled against its despised role as riot police in the occupied territories and helped drive its civilian leaders to the bargaining table with its vanquished Palestinian foe .
And in Northern Ireland leaders of both the British forces and the Irish Republican Army found that violence became a double - edged weapon they could no longer wield without permanently damaging themselves .
“ Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent , ” wrote Isaac Asimov .
That ’s the real lesson I learned in front of Low Library that April night 40 years ago .
This article was first published in 2006 , then updated in 2015 .
HTML email newsletters have come a long way since this article was first published back in 2006 .
HTML email is still a very successful communications medium for both publishers and readers .
Publishers can track rates for email opens , forwards , and clickthroughs , and measure reader interest in products and topics ; readers are presented with information that ’s laid out like a web page , in a way that ’s more visually appealing , and much easier to scan and navigate , than plain text email .
Coding an HTML email is a fun , practical problem for programmers to solve .
Unlike coding a web page , HTML emails need to display well on old email software — think Outlook or Mac Mail , as well as adapt to phone and tablet screens .
I ’ll show you how to create HTML emails that display well on any device , plus ideas to adapt your current HTML email code to display on phones and tablets .
HTML Email Fundamentals
The biggest pain when coding HTML email is that so many different software tools are available to read email , from desktop software such as Eudora , Outlook , AOL , Thunderbird , and Lotus Notes , to web - based email services such as Yahoo ! , Hotmail , and Google Mail , to email apps on phones and tablets .
The software used to render HTML for each email software tool determines what HTML and CSS code works and does n’t work .
If you thought it was difficult to ensure the cross - browser compatibility of your web sites , be aware that this is a whole new game — each of these email software tools can display the same email in vastly different ways .
And even when these tools do display an HTML email properly , accounting for variances in , for example , the widths at which readers size their windows when reading emails makes things even trickier .
Whether you choose to code your HTML email by hand ( my personal preference ) or to use an existing template , there are two fundamental concepts to keep in mind when creating HTML email :
Use HTML tables to control the design layout and some presentation .
You may be used to using pure CSS layouts for your web pages , but that approach just wo n’t hold up in an email environment .
Use inline CSS to control other presentation elements within your email , such as background colors and fonts .
The quickest and easiest way to see how HTML tables and inline CSS interact within an HTML email is to download some templates from Campaign Monitor and MailChimp .
When you open up one of these templates , you ’ll notice a few things we ’ll discuss in more detail later :
CSS style declarations appear below the body tag , not between the head tags .
tag , not between the tags .
No CSS shorthand is used : instead of using the abbreviated style rule font : 12px /16px Arial , Helvetica , you should instead break this shorthand into its individual properties : font - family , font - size , and line - height .
, you should instead break this shorthand into its individual properties : , , and .
span s and div s are used sparingly to achieve specific effects , while HTML tables do the bulk of the layout work .

CSS style declarations are very basic , and do not make use of any CSS files .
My Code HTML
Email site also has actual HTML emails I ’ve downloaded and formatted so you can study to see how others created email .
Step 1 : Use HTML Tables for Layout
That ’s right : tables are back , big time !
Web standards may have become the norm for coding pages for display in web browsers , but this is n’t the Web , baby .
A few email software clients are light years behind the eight - ball in terms of CSS support , which means we must resort to using tables for layout if we really want our newsletters to display consistently for every reader ( see the reading list at the end of this article for some excellent resources on CSS support in mail clients ) .
So put your standards - compliant best practices and lean markup skills aside : we ’re about to get our hands dirty !
The first step in creating an HTML email is to decide what kind of layout you want to use .
For newsletters , single column and two - column layouts work best , because they control the natural chaos that results when a large amount of content is pushed into such a small space as an email .
Single column email designs also make it easy to display well on phones and tablets .
A single - column layout typically consists of :
a header , containing a logo and some ( or all ) of the navigation links from the parent web site to reinforce the branding and provide familiarity for site visitors intra-email links to stories that appear further down in the email followed by the stories and content a footer at the bottom of the email , which often contains links that are identical to the top navigation , as well as instructions for unsubscribing
Two - column emails also use a header and footer .
Like a two - column web page , they typically use a narrow , side column to house features and links to more information , while the wider column holds the body content of the email .
To get a two - column email layout to display well on a phone or tablet requires some code - fu , as you ’ll see later in this article .
Promotional emails follow similar rules but contain much less in the way of content and links .
They often include one or two messages , and sometimes make use of one big image with small explanatory text and some links below the image .
All of these email layout possibilities can be created easily , using HTML tables to divide up the space into rows and columns .
In fact , using HTML tables is the only way to achieve a layout that will render consistently across different mail clients .
No matter how your email is designed , it ’s important to remember the most important content should appear at or near the top of the email , so it is visible immediately when a reader opens your email .
The top left of an email message is often the first place people look when they open an email .
This is the approach that I use to create HTML emails :
For a two - column layout , create one table each for the header , the two center content columns , and the footer — that ’s three tables in all .
Wrap these tables into another container table .
Use the same approach for single - column layouts , but give the content table one column .
This approach is especially suitable if the design of your email contains images that are broken up over multiple table cells .
Otherwise , a single table with td rows for its header ( with colspan= " 2 " if the design uses two columns ) , content , and footer should display fine in all but Lotus Notes email software .
rows for its header ( with if the design uses two columns ) , content , and footer should display fine in all but Lotus Notes email software .
Use the attributes within the table and td tags to control the table ’s display .
For example , setting border= " 0 " , valign = " top " , align = " left " ( or center , if that suits the design ) , cellpadding = " 0 " , cellspacing = " 0 " , and so on .
This primarily helps older email clients to display the email in a ( barely ) acceptable way .
tags to control the table ’s display .
For example , setting , , ( or , if that suits the design ) , , , and so on .
This primarily helps older email clients to display the email in a ( barely ) acceptable way .
Even if the design of your email does n’t include a border around your table , you might find it helpful during development to set border = " 1 " to help with the debugging of any problems that arise with the internal alignment of tr and td tags .
Change it back to border= " 0 " for testing and production .
While this approach might offend purists who prefer to code using the latest standards , it is the only viable approach at this point .
But the fact that we ’re using tables for layout does n’t mean we need to resort to old - school methods entirely .
For example , no matter how poorly Lotus Notes displays HTML email , you should never have to resort to using the font tag .
And while Outlook 2007 ’s HTML rendering engine is less than perfect , it does display basic HTML tables just fine .
There are some caveats , though ; let ’s take a look at styling our text next .
Step 2 : Add CSS Styles
Did I say CSS support was poor in mail clients ?
Well , it is .
But you can ( and should ) still utilize CSS for the styles in your email once your nested table layout is in place .
There are just a few things to watch out for .
Here are the steps that I use .
First , use inline styles to store all of your style information , as shown here :
< p style = " color : red ; " > </ p >
This includes table , td , p , a , and so on .
Do not use the CSS style declaration in the HTML head tag , as you might when authoring web pages .
Instead , place your style declaration right below the body tag —
Google Mail , however , looks for any style declaration in the email and ( helpfully ) deletes it .
Also , do n’t bother using the link element to reference an external style sheet : Google Mail , Hotmail , and other email software will ignore , modify , or delete these external references to a style sheet .
For your container table — the one that houses the header , content , and footer tables — set the table width to 98 % .
It turns out that Yahoo !
mail needs that 1 % cushion on either side in order to display the email properly .
If side gutters are critical to your email ’s design , set the width to 95 % or even 90 % to avoid potential problems .
Of course , the tables inside the container table should be set to 100 % .
Put general font style information in the table td closest to the content .
Yes , this can result in repetitive style declarations within multiple td cells .
Put font style definitions into heading ( e.g. h1 , h2 ) , p , or a tags only when necessary .
Use div s sparingly to float small boxes of content and links to the right or left inside a table ’s td cell .
Google Mail , for one , seems to ignore the CSS float declaration ( yet Yahoo ! and Hotmail cope with it just fine ) .
Sometimes it ’s better to code a more complex table layout than to rely on the float declaration .
Or , since it ’s all too easy to clutter up an email , ask your designer to put the floated content in the narrow side column instead .
Flaky support for floats is one issue that may cause an email design to be reworked .
While div s appear to be barely useful , span s appear to work almost every time , because they ’re inline elements .
In some cases , span s can be used for more than just coloring or sizing text : they can be used to position text above or below content .
Note that some email delivery services will unpack style definitions to make them more explicit and , therefore , more readable by all email software .
For example , the CSS shorthand style = " margin : 10 px 5 px 10px 0 ; " may be expanded into the long style declaration shown earlier .
Test each email and look to see what happens to the email code .
Start with CSS shorthand because , in the worst case , it appears to work well with all email software .
If you ’ve downloaded and studied the email templates from Campaign Monitor and MailChimp , you ’ll see that they treat the container table as if it were the html body tag .
The Campaign Monitor team refer to this table as the “ BodyImposter , ” which is a great way to think about the frame or wrapper table .
From a CSS perspective , the container table does what the html body element would do if services like Google Mail did n’t disable or ignore the body tag .
Step 3 : Adopt Best Practices
Knowing that you ’ve created valid HTML email using the guidelines I ’ve suggested is only part of the solution — there are several best practices that you should follow to ensure that your email is well received .
The next step is to test your HTML email in a variety of email clients .
Often this will identify problems that require workarounds .
The first test tools to use are the Firefox and Internet Explorer web browsers .
If the email displays well or perfectly in both browsers , there ’s a good chance testing the email in Outlook , Yahoo ! , Google Mail , and other services will reveal only minor problems .
If possible , I ’d also recommend testing your email in Internet Explorer 6 — this should give you a good indication of how your email will render in Outlook 2003 ( refer to the list of resources at the end of this article for information on running Internet Explorer 6 ) .
Finally , to test how email will look on an iPhone or iPad , check your HTML email in a Safari web browser .
Once the email appears fine in those two web browsers , use an email delivery service to send the email to a range of test email accounts .
Ideally , this should include accounts with the Yahoo ! , Hotmail , and Google Mail services .
The test accounts you use should , of course , be determined by the domain names in the mailing list of people who will receive the email .
For example , if there are no AOL subscribers on this list , it ’s probably a waste of time and money to set up , and test with , an AOL email account .
Here are the most common code tweaks that I ’ve found necessary during this test phase :
Sometimes , a switch from percentage widths to fixed widths is needed .
While this is not ideal — because readers can and do resize their email windows while reading — sometimes , using a fixed width is the only way to have a layout display properly in multiple email clients .
If there ’s a spacing issue with the columns in the email design , first tweak the cellpadding and cellspacing attributes of the HTML tables .
If that does n’t work , apply CSS margin and padding attributes .
HTML spacing works better with older email software .
and attributes of the HTML tables .
If that does n’t work , apply CSS and attributes .
HTML spacing works better with older email software .
Image displacement can occur when a td cell is closed right below an img tag .
This is an ancient HTML problem .
Putting the < /td > tag right after ( on the same line as ) the img tag eliminates the annoying and mystifying 1 - pixel gap .
In addition , the following best practices are recommended :
Avoid using JavaScript .
Most email software will disable it anyway .
If an image is sliced up and spread across several HTML table cells , test the email using many test accounts .
Sometimes , it might look great in Outlook but be shifted by one or more pixels in Hotmail and other services .
Also consider making the image a background image on a new HTML table that encases all of the table rows and columns that would display parts of your background image ; this often achieves the same effect as slicing an image up , but uses less code and can provide better results ( see below ) .
Note that Outlook 2007 does not display background images ; be sure to test your email code with your target email software .
For background images , use the table ’s background attribute instead of using CSS .
This works more consistently across email software than other potential solutions .

Store the email images on a web server — preferably in a folder that ’s separate from your web site ’s images ( for example , in a folder called / images / email ) , and do n’t delete them .
Some people open emails weeks or months later , the same way people use bookmarks to return to web sites .

Be sure all your images use the alt , height , and width attributes .
Setting values for these attributes improves results in Google Mail , as well as maintaining your layout when a reader has their images turned off .
Note , however , that Outlook 2007 does not recognize the alt attribute .

attribute for the a tags , so that people who read with webmail services do n’t have the requested page appear within their webmail interface .
While a 1×1 - pixel image can be used to force spacing to create a precise email layout , spammers often use 1×1 - pixel images to determine if their email has been opened .
Using this practice will increase the likelihood that your email is classified as spam .
Similarly , avoid using a large image “ above the fold ” in the email .
This is another classic spammer practice and may cause your email to be interpreted as spam .
It ’s important to make sure your HTML email displays acceptably with images turned off .
Many email applications set the display of images to “ off ” by default .
For example , if you use a background image to provide a background color with white font color over it , make sure the default background color for that part of the HTML table is dark , not white .
When I ’m testing how an email displays with images off , I usually use my text editor to replace each image ’s src attribute with a unique combination of characters such as “ xsrcx ” , and then revert it back again after the test .
Once the HTML email has been tweaked so that it displays well in your test email accounts , the next step is to go through a checklist .
For example , verify the following :
Does the From address display properly ( as a name , not a bare email address ) ?
Is the subject line correct ?
Is the contact information correct and visually obvious ?
Does the top of the email display the text , “ You received this email because … Unsubscribe instructions are at the bottom of this email . ” ?
Does your email contain text asking readers to add your From address to their email address book ?
Does the top of your email include a link to the web version of the message ?
Many email delivery services include the ability to see how your HTML email displays in a wide range of email software .
It helps you identify what code tweaks are needed before sending .
Step 4 : Code for Google Mail , Lotus Notes , and Outlook 2007
Google Mail , Lotus Notes , and Outlook 2007 present their own unique coding challenges .
Outlook 2007 , believe it or not , has significantly less support for CSS than previous versions of Outlook !
Google Mail ’s lack of support is a little more forgiveable — because the application runs in a browser , it cannot control the contents of the emails it displays .
Consequently , Google ’s engineers have had to take steps to ensure their application displays properly regardless of the quality of the HTML or CSS in which emails are written .
As a result , Google Mail acts like an artifact of the early 1990s , when web standards were primitive .
It takes some work , but it is possible to crack open a Google Mail page and see just how convoluted their approach to rendering HTML email actually is .
For one thing , Google Mail deletes the CSS styles contained between any style tags , no matter where they appear in the email .
And fonts displayed within HTML tables — the only alternative to using styles — have the odd habit of appearing larger than intended , no matter how the HTML email is structured .
The good news , however , is that if you code to account for the oddities of these three email applications , your HTML email code is likely to display well in most , if not all , email clients .
Here are some techniques that appear to work well in Google Mail and other older email software :
Define the background color in a td cell with the bgcolor attribute , not the CSS style .
cell with the attribute , not the CSS style .
As noted above , use the background attribute in the td cell for background images instead of using CSS .
One side - effect of this approach is that the background image can be made as tall as needed — if the content used in your email template is likely to vary in size , using an extra - tall background image in this way allows the height of the email shrink or expand , depending on the height of the copy , from one email to the next .
Remember , though , that Outlook 2007 ignores background images completely .

Remember , though , that Outlook 2007 ignores background images completely .
If it works better , use the padding declaration to control margins within a td cell .
The margin style does not work in these cells , but padding does .
style does not work in these cells , but does .
If you need a border around a td cell , keep in mind that Google Mail displays a border around a td cell when it ’s defined in a div , but not when it ’s defined as a border style in a td tag .

If you need a light - colored link against a dark background color , put the font definition in the td cell ( so it applies to p and a tags equally ) then add a color : style to the a tag .
cell ( so it applies to and tags equally ) then add a style to the a tag .
If the p and a fonts appear to be different sizes , wrap the a tag in a p tag .
and fonts appear to be different sizes , wrap the tag in a tag .
Google Mail aggressively uses the right - hand column of the Google Mail user interface , which squeezes the HTML email into the center panel .
Be sure the padding style in the content tds is set to 10 pixels all round , so that text does not hit against the left and right edges .
When testing an HTML email with a Google Mail account , it ’s likely that you ’ll find that one or more font styles are missing in the td , h1 , h2 , p , a , and other tags .
Inspect every font carefully to make sure Google Mail displays the fonts correctly .
Besides Google Mail , there ’s another , less obvious hazard a programmer faces when creating HTML email : Lotus Notes .
Many large corporations continue to support and upgrade their Notes installations .
Unfortunately , it ’s impossible to tell which companies use Notes .
The best approach is to follow the guidelines described in this article — the more primitive the code , the more likely it will work well , if not perfectly , with Notes .
That said , it ’s quite possible Lotus Notes will introduce to your HTML email quirks that are almost beyond belief .
For example , older versions of Notes can convert images to their proprietary formats , or simply ignore flawless basic HTML in one email , but display other HTML fine in another email .
Here are a few tips that will help you convince Notes to display your HTML email properly :
As we discussed previously , use a container table that contains all the internal layout tables ( for example , for the header , content , and footer ) .
This keeps the email together in one chunk of HTML , so pieces of the layout are less likely to wander when displayed in Notes .
Create a gutter around the container table by setting the width to a percentage and / or using a cellpadding of at least 5 .
As I mentioned earlier , avoid using a style declaration in your email ’s head tag .
It might be the approach that adheres to web standards , but Notes ( like Google Mail ) might delete your styles .
Rely , instead , on inline styles within the table , td , h1 , h2 , p , a , and other tags .

Use absolute URLs to images stored on a web server .
You ca n’t do much about Notes converting images , but using remote images might help .
Intra-email links , using named anchors , rarely ( if ever ) work in Notes .
It ’s simply best to avoid links that jump down the email to a specific piece of content .
Avoid colspan s in your HTML tables .
Notes — especially its earlier versions — can deal only with basic table layouts .

Using these techniques to achieve a successful render in Google Mail and Lotus Notes will ensure that your emails also display fine in Outlook 2007 , which uses an older HTML rendering engine .
Microsoft has published details about what their email software will and wo n’t display properly ; more details can be found in the Resources section at the end of this article ) .
Campaign Monitor , an email delivery service , has a comprehensive list of CSS elements support for every popular mobile , web and desktop email client .
Step 5 : Coding for Phones and Tablets
An amazing number of people read HTML email on their smart phones and tablets , as well as their desktop email software .
Adapting your HTML tables to display well on these devices turns out to be somewhat easy .
It helps CSS support is very good for the HTML rendering engines used on new phones and tablets .
The solution is to use the CSS @media definition to target the HTML table TD cells and boost the font sizes needed to display well .
For example , fonts on an iPhone need to be 13 pixels to be legible .
The best part ?
Webmail and desktop email software will either strip out or ignore your @media definitions while your phone and tablet will read the code and display everything perfectly .
Here ’s a sample set of @media definitions to display a one - column layout HTML table for phones and tablets :
@media only screen and ( max - width : 480 px ) { /* mobile - specific CSS styles go here */ table[ class=email ] , table[class=email - content ] { clear : both ; width : 320 px ! important ; font - size : 13 px ! important ; } }
Place this @media code directly below your body tag class = " email " to your table definition and class = " email - content " to your TD cells .
When your HTML email is viewed with a device ( or web browser horizontally re-sized ) less than 480 pixels , these definitions will activate .
The secret to coding a two - column HTML email to adapt to small phone and tablet screens ?
Put each column into its own table .
Next , for each HTML table , use inline CSS to float : left and HTML align = " left " to float and align each content column table to the left .
Then add class = " email " to your table definition and class = " email - content " to your TD cells .
With the @media code above , for screens less than 480 pixels wide , this will set the column tables , your left and right columns , the same width as the left content column and slides under the main column .
This approach can be used to target any layout design changes to work with phones and / or tablets .
This solution comes from an excellent guide from Campaign Monitor , Responsive Email Design , which has even more details and ideas about how to make HTML email responsive to different screen sizes .

Years ago , when William Miller talked about being in the Vietnam War  if he talked about being in the Vietnam War  he would tell people he served on a Swift boat .
At least now they have heard of it .
But not in the way he would like .
“ I was proud of what I did , and all the guys I was with , ” Mr. Miller said .
“ Now somebody says ‘ Swift boat ’ and it ’s a whole different meaning .
They do n’t associate it with the guys we lost .
That ’s a shame . ”
“ Swift boat ” has become the synonym for the nastiest of campaign smears , a shadow that hangs over the presidential race as pundits wait to proclaim that the Swiftboating has begun and candidates declare that they will not be Swiftboated .
Swift boat veterans  especially those who had nothing to do with the group that attacked Senator John Kerry ’s military record in the 2004 election  want their good name back , and the good names of the men not lucky enough to come home alive .

It is a perfect time for the Israeli government to commit a war crime on the miserable civilians of the Gaza Strip .
The US primary season has created a news blackout on US television about foreign news ( apparently the public of the world ’s sole superpower is not estimated by corporate news executives to be able to handle more than one story ) .
So most Americans will never even know that the Israelis have cut off fuel to Gaza ’s power plant , depriving tens of thousands of people of electricity .
I sympathize with Israeli civilians who have been subjected to illegal bombardment by Hamas .
( That bombardment has not recently resulted in loss of life , but it is traumatizing , especially for children . )
But one has to ask whether the Olmert government has behaved toward Gazans in such a way as to try to achieve peace .
( The unilateral withdrawal of colonists has been followed by frequent bombardments and incursions and arrests , political meddling and a placing of the whole Strip in a kind of geo-penitentiary . )
Israeli deployment of excessive force in recent weeks has resulted in dozens of deaths in Gaza .
Even if military action were justified , it is only legitimate for the Israelis to punish Hamas fighters doing the firing , and big bombs should not be dropped near civilian apartment buildings .
Do n’t they , like , have SWAT teams ?
Just a reminder that electricity is life and death for some people .
The low is 48 degrees F. tonight ; it is cold without electricity .
And another reminder that the children of Gaza , who I suspect are 2/3s of the population , have n’t done anything wrong , to be punished by this blockade :
‘ Health Ministry official Dr. Moaiya Hassanain warned that the fuel cutoff would cause a health catastrophe .
“ We have the choice to either cut electricity on babies in the maternity ward or heart surgery patients or stop operating rooms , ” he said . ’
Here is what wikipedia has to say about the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 .
Note that “ protected persons ” are just non-combatants , i.e. innocent civilians such as children , women and unarmed or injured men :
‘ Article 33 .
No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed .
Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited .
Pillage is prohibited .
Reprisals against protected persons and their property are prohibited .
Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions collective punishments are a war crime .
Article 33 states : “ No protected person may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed , ” and “ collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited . ”
By collective punishment , the drafters of the Geneva Conventions had in mind the reprisal killings of World Wars I and II .
In the First World War , Germans executed Belgian villagers in mass retribution for resistance activity .
In World War II , Nazis carried out a form of collective punishment to suppress resistance .
Entire villages or towns or districts were held responsible for any resistance activity that took place there .
The conventions , to counter this , reiterated the principle of individual responsibility .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) Commentary to the conventions states that parties to a conflict often would resort to “ intimidatory measures to terrorize the population ” in hopes of preventing hostile acts , but such practices “ strike at guilty and innocent alike .
They are opposed to all principles based on humanity and justice . ”
Additional Protocol II of 1977 explicitly forbids collective punishment .
. . ‘
Wikipedia is just the common sense of the blogosphere .
The Geneva Conventions were intended to avoid a repeat of the atrocities of WW II .
The Israelis are going to have to live in the midst of the Palestinian people for the rest of the century .
The Palestinians are not going away .
The Israelis cannot wish them away or intimidate them into accepting statelessness , dire poverty , foreign domination and a condition analogous to slavery .
Moreover , Israel itself requires , in order to flourish , extensive economic and other relations with the outside world .
If it is going to behave like this , the outside world will become less and less willing to have those relations .
The Israeli Right is their country ’s own worst enemy .
No , the purple heart is for being wounded .
This one is for getting turned into a squirrel .

Never let it be said that I never “ gave back ” to the genre .
Here are ten tips for fledgling horror writers who want to see their work go far and be appreciated :
1 ) Drink .
It was good enough for Edgar Allen Poe and Stephen King , but somehow you ’re too good for the bottom of a bottle ?
Amateur .
2 ) Claws and Tentacles .
Or better yet , claws WITH tentacles .
No , wait , that ’s backwards …
3 ) Profanity .
When confronted with unspeakable horror from the depths of time , the last words your character speaks before parting ways with his sanity will NOT be “ Golly , that thing ’s gonna bite off my buttocks and swallow my gosh - darn soul ! ”
4 ) Unspeakable horrors from the depths of time .
Yeah .
That ’s good for starters .
5 ) Drama .
Skip it .
If readers wanted a love story they ’d go watch Lifetime .
6 ) Violence .
It ’s quality vs. quantity .
If you ca n’t manage both , then pick one , crank it up to eleven , and rip the knob off .
Then add more .
7 ) Pacing .
If there ’s a slow , boring part in the story … fill it with zombies and set it on fire .
8 ) Survival instinct .
If all your characters do when confronted with horror is run and scream … you need to go outside more .
Anything that crawls out of the sewers in MY neighborhood is going to get shot twice before it gets to the other side of the street .
9 ) Hope .
Characters need it .
Readers need it .
Give it to them .
Then fill it with zombies and set it on fire .
10 ) Borderline insanity .
Not the characters …
YOU .
If you ’ve never considered the idea that , at the very least , you might be “ slightly disturbed ” … pick another genre .
Britain and other European governments should break from the US over the international embargo on Gaza , former US president Jimmy Carter told the Guardian yesterday .
Carter , visiting the Welsh border town of Hay for the Guardian literary festival , described the EU 's position on the Israeli - Palestinian dispute as " supine " and its failure to criticise the Israeli blockade of Gaza as " embarrassing " .
Referring to the possibility of Europe breaking with the US in an interview with the Guardian , he said : " Why not ?
They 're not our vassals .
They occupy an equal position with the US . "
The blockade on Hamas - ruled Gaza , imposed by the US , EU , UN and Russia - the so - called Quartet - after the organisation 's election victory in 2006 , was " one of the greatest human rights crimes on Earth , " since it meant the " imprisonment of 1.6 million people , 1 million of whom are refugees " .
" Most families in Gaza are eating only one meal per day .
To see Europeans going along with this is embarrassing , " Carter said .
He called on the EU to reassess its stance if Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza .
" Let the Europeans lift the embargo and say we will protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza , and even send observers to Rafah gate [ Gaza 's crossing into Egypt ] to ensure the Palestinians do n't violate it . "
Although it is 27 years since he left the White House , Carter recently met Hamas leaders in Damascus .
He declared a breakthrough in persuading the organisation to offer a Gaza ceasefire and a halt to Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel if Israel stopped its air and ground strikes on the territory .
Carter described western governments ' self - imposed ban on talking to Hamas as unrealistic and said everyone knew Israel was negotiating with the organisation through an Egyptian mediator , Omar Suleiman .
Suleiman took the Hamas ceasefire offer to Jerusalem last week .
Israel was still hesitating over the ceasefire , Carter confirmed yesterday .
" I talked to Mr Suleiman the day before yesterday .
I hope the Israelis will accept , " he said .
While being scrupulously polite to the Palestinian Authority president , Mahmoud Abbas , and prime minister , Salam Fayyad , who represent the Fatah movement , he was scathing about their exclusion of Hamas .
He described the Fatah - only government as a " subterfuge " aimed at getting round Hamas 's election victory two years ago .
" The top opinion pollster in Ramallah told me the other day that opinion on the West Bank is shifting to Hamas , because people believe Fatah has sold out to Israel and the US , " he said .
Carter said the Quartet 's policy of not talking to Hamas unless it recognised Israel and fulfilled two other conditions had been drafted by Elliot Abrams , an official in the national security council at the White House .
He called Abrams " a very militant supporter of Israel " .
The ex-president , whose election - monitoring Carter Centre had just certified Hamas 's election victory as free and fair , addressed the Quartet for 12 minutes at its session in London in 2006 .
He urged it to talk to Hamas , which had offered to form a unity government with Fatah , the losers .
" The Quartet 's final document had been drafted in Washington in advance , and not a line was changed , " he said .
Earlier , Carter , told Sky News that Hillary Clinton should abandon her battle to become Democratic presidential candidate after the last round of primaries in early June .
Like many superdelegates , he has yet to declare his support for either Clinton or Barack Obama , but he suggested the outcome of the race was a foregone conclusion .
" I think that a lot of us superdelegates will make a decision ... quite rapidly , after the final primary on June 3 , " he said .
" I think at that point it will be time for her to give it up . "
Last night , before a packed crowd at Hay , Carter spoke of his " horror " at America 's involvement in torturing prisoners , saying he wanted the next US president to promise never to do so again .
He left an intriguing hint that George Bush might even face prosecution on war crimes charges once he left office .
When pressed by Philippe Sands QC on Bush 's recent admission that he had authorised interrogation procedures widely seen as amounting to torture , Carter replied that he was sure Bush would be able to live a peaceful , " productive life - in our country " .
Sands , an international legal expert , said afterwards that he understood that to be " clear confirmation " that while Bush would face no challenge in his own country , " what happened outside the country was another matter entirely " .
The America We Love
The America We Love
Independence , Missouri
On a spring morning in April of 1775 , a simple band of colonists - farmers and merchants , blacksmiths and printers , men and boys - left their homes and families in Lexington and Concord to take up arms against the tyranny of an Empire .
The odds against them were long and the risks enormous - for even if they survived the battle , any ultimate failure would bring charges of treason , and death by hanging .
And yet they took that chance .
They did so not on behalf of a particular tribe or lineage , but on behalf of a larger idea .
The idea of liberty .
The idea of God - given , inalienable rights .
And with the first shot of that fateful day - a shot heard round the world - the American Revolution , and America 's experiment with democracy , began .
Those men of Lexington and Concord were among our first patriots .
And at the beginning of a week when we celebrate the birth of our nation , I think it is fitting to pause for a moment and reflect on the meaning of patriotism - theirs , and ours .
We do so in part because we are in the midst of war - more than one and a half million of our finest young men and women have now fought in Iraq and Afghanistan ; over 60,000 have been wounded , and over 4,600 have been laid to rest .
The costs of war have been great , and the debate surrounding our mission in Iraq has been fierce .
It is natural , in light of such sacrifice by so many , to think more deeply about the commitments that bind us to our nation , and to each other .
We reflect on these questions as well because we are in the midst of a presidential election , perhaps the most consequential in generations ; a contest that will determine the course of this nation for years , perhaps decades , to come .
Not only is it a debate about big issues - health care , jobs , energy , education , and retirement security - but it is also a debate about values .
How do we keep ourselves safe and secure while preserving our liberties ?
How do we restore trust in a government that seems increasingly removed from its people and dominated by special interests ?
How do we ensure that in an increasingly global economy , the winners maintain allegiance to the less fortunate ?
And how do we resolve our differences at a time of increasing diversity ?
Finally , it is worth considering the meaning of patriotism because the question of who is - or is not - a patriot all too often poisons our political debates , in ways that divide us rather than bringing us together .
I have come to know this from my own experience on the campaign trail .
Throughout my life , I have always taken my deep and abiding love for this country as a given .
It was how I was raised ; it is what propelled me into public service ; it is why I am running for President .
And yet , at certain times over the last sixteen months , I have found , for the first time , my patriotism challenged - at times as a result of my own carelessness , more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears about who I am and what I stand for .
So let me say at this at outset of my remarks .
I will never question the patriotism of others in this campaign .
And I will not stand idly by when I hear others question mine .
My concerns here are n't simply personal , however .
After all , throughout our history , men and women of far greater stature and significance than me have had their patriotism questioned in the midst of momentous debates .
Thomas Jefferson was accused by the Federalists of selling out to the French .
The anti-Federalists were just as convinced that John Adams was in cahoots with the British and intent on restoring monarchal rule .
Likewise , even our wisest Presidents have sought to justify questionable policies on the basis of patriotism .
Adams ' Alien and Sedition Act , Lincoln 's suspension of habeas corpus , Roosevelt 's internment of Japanese Americans - all were defended as expressions of patriotism , and those who disagreed with their policies were sometimes labeled as unpatriotic .
In other words , the use of patriotism as a political sword or a political shield is as old as the Republic .
Still , what is striking about today 's patriotism debate is the degree to which it remains rooted in the culture wars of the 1960s - in arguments that go back forty years or more .
In the early years of the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War , defenders of the status quo often accused anybody who questioned the wisdom of government policies of being unpatriotic .
Meanwhile , some of those in the so - called counter - culture of the Sixties reacted not merely by criticizing particular government policies , but by attacking the symbols , and in extreme cases , the very idea , of America itself - by burning flags ; by blaming America for all that was wrong with the world ; and perhaps most tragically , by failing to honor those veterans coming home from Vietnam , something that remains a national shame to this day .
Most Americans never bought into these simplistic world - views - these caricatures of left and right .
Most Americans understood that dissent does not make one unpatriotic , and that there is nothing smart or sophisticated about a cynical disregard for America 's traditions and institutions .
And yet the anger and turmoil of that period never entirely drained away .
All too often our politics still seems trapped in these old , threadbare arguments - a fact most evident during our recent debates about the war in Iraq , when those who opposed administration policy were tagged by some as unpatriotic , and a general providing his best counsel on how to move forward in Iraq was accused of betrayal .
Given the enormous challenges that lie before us , we can no longer afford these sorts of divisions .
None of us expect that arguments about patriotism will , or should , vanish entirely ; after all , when we argue about patriotism , we are arguing about who we are as a country , and more importantly , who we should be .
But surely we can agree that no party or political philosophy has a monopoly on patriotism .
And surely we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that , however rough and imperfect , captures the best of America 's common spirit .
What would such a definition look like ?
For me , as for most Americans , patriotism starts as a gut instinct , a loyalty and love for country rooted in my earliest memories .
I 'm not just talking about the recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance or the Thanksgiving pageants at school or the fireworks on the Fourth of July , as wonderful as those things may be .
Rather , I 'm referring to the way the American ideal wove its way throughout the lessons my family taught me as a child .
One of my earliest memories is of sitting on my grandfather 's shoulders and watching the astronauts come to shore in Hawaii .
I remember the cheers and small flags that people waved , and my grandfather explaining how we Americans could do anything we set our minds to do .
That 's my idea of America .
I remember listening to my grandmother telling stories about her work on a bomber assembly - line during World War II .
I remember my grandfather handing me his dog-tags from his time in Patton 's Army , and understanding that his defense of this country marked one of his greatest sources of pride .
That 's my idea of America .
I remember , when living for four years in Indonesia as a child , listening to my mother reading me the first lines of the Declaration of Independence - " We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal .
That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . "
I remember her explaining how this declaration applied to every American , black and white and brown alike ; how those words , and words of the United States Constitution , protected us from the injustices that we witnessed other people suffering during those years abroad .
That 's my idea of America .
As I got older , that gut instinct - that America is the greatest country on earth - would survive my growing awareness of our nation 's imperfections : it 's ongoing racial strife ; the perversion of our political system laid bare during the Watergate hearings ; the wrenching poverty of the Mississippi Delta and the hills of Appalachia .
Not only because , in my mind , the joys of American life and culture , its vitality , its variety and its freedom , always outweighed its imperfections , but because I learned that what makes America great has never been its perfection but the belief that it can be made better .
I came to understand that our revolution was waged for the sake of that belief - that we could be governed by laws , not men ; that we could be equal in the eyes of those laws ; that we could be free to say what we want and assemble with whomever we want and worship as we please ; that we could have the right to pursue our individual dreams but the obligation to help our fellow citizens pursue theirs .
For a young man of mixed race , without firm anchor in any particular community , without even a father 's steadying hand , it is this essential American idea - that we are not constrained by the accident of birth but can make of our lives what we will - that has defined my life , just as it has defined the life of so many other Americans .
That is why , for me , patriotism is always more than just loyalty to a place on a map or a certain kind of people .
Instead , it is also loyalty to America 's ideals - ideals for which anyone can sacrifice , or defend , or give their last full measure of devotion .
I believe it is this loyalty that allows a country teeming with different races and ethnicities , religions and customs , to come together as one .
It is the application of these ideals that separate us from Zimbabwe , where the opposition party and their supporters have been silently hunted , tortured or killed ; or Burma , where tens of thousands continue to struggle for basic food and shelter in the wake of a monstrous storm because a military junta fears opening up the country to outsiders ; or Iraq , where despite the heroic efforts of our military , and the courage of many ordinary Iraqis , even limited cooperation between various factions remains far too elusive .
I believe those who attack America 's flaws without acknowledging the singular greatness of our ideals , and their proven capacity to inspire a better world , do not truly understand America .
Of course , precisely because America is n't perfect , precisely because our ideals constantly demand more from us , patriotism can never be defined as loyalty to any particular leader or government or policy .
As Mark Twain , that greatest of American satirists and proud son of Missouri , once wrote , " Patriotism is supporting your country all the time , and your government when it deserves it . "
We may hope that our leaders and our government stand up for our ideals , and there are many times in our history when that 's occurred .
But when our laws , our leaders or our government are out of alignment with our ideals , then the dissent of ordinary Americans may prove to be one of the truest expression of patriotism .
The young preacher from Georgia , Martin Luther King , Jr. , who led a movement to help America confront our tragic history of racial injustice and live up to the meaning of our creed - he was a patriot .
The young soldier who first spoke about the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib - he is a patriot .
Recognizing a wrong being committed in this country 's name ; insisting that we deliver on the promise of our Constitution - these are the acts of patriots , men and women who are defending that which is best in America .
And we should never forget that - especially when we disagree with them ; especially when they make us uncomfortable with their words .
Beyond a loyalty to America 's ideals , beyond a willingness to dissent on behalf of those ideals , I also believe that patriotism must , if it is to mean anything , involve the willingness to sacrifice - to give up something we value on behalf of a larger cause .
For those who have fought under the flag of this nation - for the young veterans I meet when I visit Walter Reed ; for those like John McCain who have endured physical torment in service to our country - no further proof of such sacrifice is necessary .
And let me also add that no one should ever devalue that service , especially for the sake of a political campaign , and that goes for supporters on both sides .
We must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform .
Period .
Indeed , one of the good things to emerge from the current conflict in Iraq has been the widespread recognition that whether you support this war or oppose it , the sacrifice of our troops is always worthy of honor .
For the rest of us - for those of us not in uniform or without loved ones in the military - the call to sacrifice for the country 's greater good remains an imperative of citizenship .
Sadly , in recent years , in the midst of war on two fronts , this call to service never came .
After 9/11 , we were asked to shop .
The wealthiest among us saw their tax obligations decline , even as the costs of war continued to mount .
Rather than work together to reduce our dependence on foreign oil , and thereby lessen our vulnerability to a volatile region , our energy policy remained unchanged , and our oil dependence only grew .
In spite of this absence of leadership from Washington , I have seen a new generation of Americans begin to take up the call .
I meet them everywhere I go , young people involved in the project of American renewal ; not only those who have signed up to fight for our country in distant lands , but those who are fighting for a better America here at home , by teaching in underserved schools , or caring for the sick in understaffed hospitals , or promoting more sustainable energy policies in their local communities .
I believe one of the tasks of the next Administration is to ensure that this movement towards service grows and sustains itself in the years to come .
We should expand AmeriCorps and grow the Peace Corps .
We should encourage national service by making it part of the requirement for a new college assistance program , even as we strengthen the benefits for those whose sense of duty has already led them to serve in our military .
We must remember , though , that true patriotism cannot be forced or legislated with a mere set of government programs .
Instead , it must reside in the hearts of our people , and cultivated in the heart of our culture , and nurtured in the hearts of our children .
As we begin our fourth century as a nation , it is easy to take the extraordinary nature of America for granted .
But it is our responsibility as Americans and as parents to instill that history in our children , both at home and at school .
The loss of quality civic education from so many of our classrooms has left too many young Americans without the most basic knowledge of who our forefathers are , or what they did , or the significance of the founding documents that bear their names .
Too many children are ignorant of the sheer effort , the risks and sacrifices made by previous generations , to ensure that this country survived war and depression ; through the great struggles for civil , and social , and worker 's rights .
It is up to us , then , to teach them .
It is up to us to teach them that even though we have faced great challenges and made our share of mistakes , we have always been able to come together and make this nation stronger , and more prosperous , and more united , and more just .
It is up to us to teach them that America has been a force for good in the world , and that other nations and other people have looked to us as the last , best hope of Earth .
It is up to us to teach them that it is good to give back to one 's community ; that it is honorable to serve in the military ; that it is vital to participate in our democracy and make our voices heard .
And it is up to us to teach our children a lesson that those of us in politics too often forget : that patriotism involves not only defending this country against external threat , but also working constantly to make America a better place for future generations .
When we pile up mountains of debt for the next generation to absorb , or put off changes to our energy policies , knowing full well the potential consequences of inaction , we are placing our short - term interests ahead of the nation 's long - term well - being .
When we fail to educate effectively millions of our children so that they might compete in a global economy , or we fail to invest in the basic scientific research that has driven innovation in this country , we risk leaving behind an America that has fallen in the ranks of the world .
Just as patriotism involves each of us making a commitment to this nation that extends beyond our own immediate self - interest , so must that commitment extends beyond our own time here on earth .
Our greatest leaders have always understood this .
They 've defined patriotism with an eye toward posterity .
George Washington is rightly revered for his leadership of the Continental Army , but one of his greatest acts of patriotism was his insistence on stepping down after two terms , thereby setting a pattern for those that would follow , reminding future presidents that this is a government of and by and for the people .
Abraham Lincoln did not simply win a war or hold the Union together .
In his unwillingness to demonize those against whom he fought ; in his refusal to succumb to either the hatred or self - righteousness that war can unleash ; in his ultimate insistence that in the aftermath of war the nation would no longer remain half slave and half free ; and his trust in the better angels of our nature - he displayed the wisdom and courage that sets a standard for patriotism .
And it was the most famous son of Independence , Harry S Truman , who sat in the White House during his final days in office and said in his Farewell Address : " When Franklin Roosevelt died , I felt there must be a million men better qualified than I , to take up the Presidential task ... But through all of it , through all the years I have worked here in this room , I have been well aware than I did not really work alone - that you were working with me .
No President could ever hope to lead our country , or to sustain the burdens of this office , save the people helped with their support . "
In the end , it may be this quality that best describes patriotism in my mind - not just a love of America in the abstract , but a very particular love for , and faith in , the American people .
That is why our heart swells with pride at the sight of our flag ; why we shed a tear as the lonely notes of Taps sound .
For we know that the greatness of this country - its victories in war , its enormous wealth , its scientific and cultural achievements - all result from the energy and imagination of the American people ; their toil , drive , struggle , restlessness , humor and quiet heroism .
That is the liberty we defend - the liberty of each of us to pursue our own dreams .
That is the equality we seek - not an equality of results , but the chance of every single one of us to make it if we try .
That is the community we strive to build - one in which we trust in this sometimes messy democracy of ours , one in which we continue to insist that there is nothing we cannot do when we put our mind to it , one in which we see ourselves as part of a larger story , our own fates wrapped up in the fates of those who share allegiance to America 's happy and singular creed .
Thank you , God Bless you , and may God Bless the United States of America .

The only people he ever hears from anymore are 14 year old girls who try to overdose on Tylenol .
YAWN .
How about killing yourself with some style ?
How about killing yourself like a man ?
Here are some manly ways to shove off this mortal coil , along with ratings for each category from 1 to 10 : Eat a tub full of beans : Manliness : 8 Style : 4 Awesomeness : 8 Mess : 5
What you need : a tub , enough beans to fill said tub .
How to do it : just dig in , you chunky son of a bitch !
Keep eating until you can't possibly eat anymore , then eat some more .
Your gut will rupture and you will shit yourself .
The cool thing about this method is that it 's not only disgusting to clean up , but you 'll probably be so bloated from the beans ( choose Van Camp 's by the way , not Bush 's baked beans unless you like the taste of beans pickled in ball sweat ) that you probably wo n't fit in the casket without some serious reconstructive surgery .
Guess who 's footing the bill for that one ?
That 's right : friends and family .
Just kidding .
You have no friends .
Strangle yourself :
Manliness : 9 Style : 4 Awesomeness : 4 Mess : 0
What you need : hands .
How to do it : strangling yourself with your own hands has long been thought impossible because when your body stops getting enough oxygen , you pass out and start breathing normally again .
Passing out while you try to kill yourself is like failing at failing .
You 're the one who has to deal with the embarrassment of having the paramedics finding your dumb ass passed out on the floor in a puddle of your own drool , as they begrudgingly take you to the hospital where the doctors would be so disappointed that one of them might try to strangle you themselves .
And if they do n't , give me a call ; I will .
Even the late Vincent Price strangled himself to death .
Either that or lung cancer , but I can't be bothered to look it up .
Eat shit .
Hold your breath :
Manliness : 9 Style : 3 Awesomeness : 8 Mess : 0
What you need : balls .
How to do it : this is similar to strangling yourself , but the difficulty level is hard .
Harder than a priest at a playground .
Step 1 : Hold your breath .
Step 2 : Wait 10 minutes , then go to step 3 .
Step 3 : If you are reading this , you have failed .
Razor blade :
Manliness : 5 Style : 2 Awesomeness : 8 Mess : 7
What you need : razor , neck .
How to do it : how many times have you tried to kill yourself with a razor blade by slashing up your wrists , only to be told " it 's down the highway , not across the street " ?
Then you listen to this advice and cut up your arms like some amateur dipshit who does n't know what she 's doing .
Your boyfriend dumped you .
You can't go on because you 're the only person who has ever been dumped and this is the most painful thing that has happened to anyone who has lived 14 consecutive years , so it 's time for the solace only decapitation can bring you .
Make sure to go all the way through the spinal column .
Cadbury surprise :
Manliness : 9 Style : 8 Awesomeness : 12 Mess : 8
What you need : ice cream scooper , cadbury eggs .
How to do it : spoon out your eyes with the ice cream scooper , and replace them with cadbury easter eggs .
Then using any of the methods above , kill yourself .
Your family may hate the suicide , but everyone loves cadbury cream eggs !
Why disappoint your loved ones with plain old boring eyes , when you can surprise them with chocolate instead ?!
Try to do it around easter .
The kids will have hours of fun trying to find the last two treats .
Headbutt the sidewalk :
Manliness : 10 Style : 3 Awesomeness : 10 Mess : 4
What you need : a sidewalk .
How to do it :
Step 1 : Slam your head into the sidewalk .
Step 2 : Repeat .
Headbutting is probably the manliest thing ever .
Not only is it useful for suicide , it 's also a great way to break up with your girlfriend .
For example , I could n't find the words to tell my ex that our relationship was over , so one day while we were watching TV I headbutt her in the tits .
Then I picked up my jacket and left .
No awkward goodbyes , no " still friends " bullshit .
Just a couple of bruised titties and a failed relationship .
I rule .
Lick a hooker 's ass :
Manliness : 0 Style : 1 Awesomeness : 1 Mess : 10
What you need : a hooker , $ 0.75 .
How to do it : find a hooker and inquire about her " ass buffet . "
If she does n't know what you 're talking about , punch her .
If she does know what you 're talking about , she should n't charge you more than 75 cents to lick her ass .
You may even get away with not having to pay her since technically it's not sex ( unless you 're gay , but I 'm not sure if it counts if it 's a woman ) .
Fair warning : not paying a hooker is considered shoplifting .
Once you 've done the ( mis ) deed , you may want to have some alcohol nearby .
Make sure it 's something strong like turpentine , because you 'll be tasting a mouth full of funk and hookers do n't always shit properly depending on their clientele .
The tingling feeling in your mouth means the disease is working .
Just sit back and relax while your penis falls off and you break out in hives .
Then just wait a few months and if the other diseases do n't get to you first , the AIDS will .
Talk about a cheap suicide !
At 75 cents , you can't afford not to kill yourself !
That 's it for now .
Just remember : it 's your suicide , have fun with it .

God Bless Joe Biden , he is one the last remaining straight shooters in politics .
Today he expressed his enthusiasm for being in a potential Obama administration , “ I ’d make a great president .
I ’d make a great Secretary of State .
I ’d make a great vice president , ” said Biden .
He did say that he was n’t interested in the VP spot , but would n’t turn it down if it was offered to him , “ There are a lot of people out there who want the job .
I ’m not one of them … ( But ) you ’d have to take it .
There ’s not a single , solitary person who , with Barack Obama as the presidential nominee in this most historic of races , who if asked would say ‘ no . ’
I would n’t say ‘ no . ’
I hope he does n’t ask me .
But if he asked me , I ’d say yes .
I ’m not being coy . ”
Biden is right .
No Democrat in their right mind would turn down Obama , in this political climate , with such a strong candidate at the top of the ticket .
It is far from a sure thing that he will win in November , but if you are a Democrat , you have to like the odds in your favor .
I think Biden would be outstanding at any job he is given .
He would be a fine running mate , an outstanding Secretary of State , and would bring intelligence , experience , and hard work to Obama ’s administration .

I love Biden ’s honesty , and his habit of not taking himself too seriously .
He is the kind of dedicated public servant that would bring instant credibility to Obama ’s cabinet .
Unlike McCain , Obama is lucky in the respect that if he wins the election , he has a bevy of talented people to fill his administration with .
With this quote from Biden today , I think it is pretty safe to assume that if Obama wins , he will hold a prominent place in the next Democratic administration .

Once or twice a week , airplanes landing at the UPS transport hub in Louisville , Ky. , chart a new course to the runway .
Using the latest in GPS tracking technology , the planes glide toward their destination in a maneuver called a " continuous descent , " which brings planes to the ground on a direct line , rather than through a gradual approach .
New aircraft maneuvers rarely make news , but UPS 's testing of the new technique in Louisville , Sacramento , Calif. , and Cologne , Germany , could substantially reduce skyway congestion , noise , and pollution — and save money on jet fuel costs .
Recent testing at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta found that each continuous - descent landing saved 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide .
With oil costs soaring , every drop of jet fuel counts .
Eight years ago , passenger and cargo airlines in the United States had a fuel bill of some $ 16 billion .
This year 's bill will approach $ 60 billion , experts predict .
Last month , the cost of fuel increased about 69 percent from a year ago , according to the Air Transport Association .
Total fuel costs for UPS for all its vehicles , including planes , through the first quarter of 2008 was $ 950 million , up 54 percent from last year .
Starting on July 7 , the company will impose an additional fuel surtax of 32.5 percent per package , up from the current 28 percent .
Passenger airlines have begun charging passengers for carry - on baggage ; start - up airlines are going bust , and smaller cities — more than 30 last year — are seeing their service cut , all because of fuel costs .
In January , the Federal Aviation Administration gave UPS , the world 's largest package carrier , the green light to begin testing the new landing procedure at the Louisville facility , which handles some 100 cargo planes per night .
One or two of those flights a week use the new technique , says Mark Giuffre , a UPS spokesman in Louisville .
Tests over the past few months indicated that each landing using the continuous descent system saves an average of 50 gallons of jet fuel , or about $ 200 per flight .
" That adds up , especially these days , " says Giuffre .
Indeed , the company estimates it will save $ 400 million on jet fuel costs each year for its entire fleet of planes .
In a traditional landing , pilots glide the plane through a series of predetermined elevations in their approach to the runway .
This practice makes noise and uses more fuel as planes rev their engines to level off at each of the elevation intervals .
Think : moving down a series of steps .
With continuous descent , the airplane relies on GPS guidance to essentially coast on idle in a direct line from its cruising elevation to the tarmac .
Think : sliding down a ski slope .
The GPS system that makes continuous descent possible is part of the FAA 's Next Generation Air Transportation System , nicknamed NextGen , which also enables planes to fly in straight lines rather than following the twisting paths of the current radar - based system — another fuel saver .
In addition , NextGen allows planes to fly closer together , land more planes in quicker succession , and be rerouted more quickly .
With some 7,000 planes aloft over the country at any one moment , the new system should also ease congestion and flight delays .
The FAA has approved allowing continuous descent tests in Los Angeles , Phoenix , and Salt Lake City .
But the GPS systems are n't cheap .
Every plane needs reprogramming of its onboard computers and other systems , putting the cost to refit some older planes at $ 300,000 .
There are ground GPS units too , though at $ 200,000 per unit ( several are needed for each airport ) they are still a bargain compared with million - dollar radar units .
While the FAA and trade groups estimate that NextGen could reduce fuel consumption by more than 10 percent , it is unlikely to be in place until 2025 because of cost and technology issues .
Meanwhile , Congress and the airlines are still bickering about who will foot the bill for the new system , expected to cost perhaps as much as $ 20 billion to implement .
The airlines are clamoring for tax credits and subsidies to offset the cost .
Legislation to address the problem has stalled in Congress and probably wo n't be addressed for months .
Every now and then I want to use leading tildes in SBCL pathnames .
That is , something like this :
( probe- file " ~/.emacs " ) => # P " /home/xach/.emacs " OR # P " / Users/xach/.emacs "
OR # P " /usr/u/xach/.emacs "
I know about user - homedir - pathname , but it 's not quite convenient for interactive REPL use .
So I put together a short file that patches SBCL internals slightly so leading tildes in pathnames go through the POSIX getpw interface to look up home directories .
It 's not something I 'll ever use in source files , but it 's pretty convenient interactively .
To use it yourself , just download tilde.lisp and add this to your ~/.sbclrc :
( load " / path/to/tilde.lisp " ) ( tilde:install - tilde - expander )
After that , you can use " ~ / foo " and " ~bob / foo " in SBCL pathnames .
update Here 's a git repo for tilde.lisp , with an ASDF system file too .
War Nerd : War of the Babies in Taki's Magazine
May 28 , 2008
This articles was originally published in Taki's Magazine on May 6 , 2008 .
What was the most important battle of the late 20th century ?
You could argue it was the one that took place on the southern border of Morocco on November 6 , 1975 .
Of course , we ’re not talking about another Stalingrad here .
In fact , what happened that day is n’t usually called a battle at all .
Its official name is “ The Green March . ”
On one side were 350,000 unarmed Moroccan civilians carrying green ( Islamic ) flags , and on the other -- miles inside the border , because they were hoping not to have to confront any of the marchers -- was a shaky , demoralized token force of Spanish troops pretending to defend a former Spanish colony , the Spanish Sahara .
The Spanish Sahara hangs below Morocco where the Sahara meets the Atlantic like a crumbling brick wall .
It was about the least desirable chunk of coastal Africa around , with no water to speak of and a tiny population , which is why the Spanish got it .
By the time the European powers were ready to divide up Africa in the late nineteenth century , Spain had long since lost its glory and tended to get the scraps and leftovers .
But one thing we ’ve learned over the last century is that on this crowded , hungry planet , there ’s no such thing as worthless land .
Spanish Sahara has proven that : in the 30 years it ’s belonged to Morocco , big money has been made from the fishing off the coast and the huge phosphate mine at Bou Craa , a hundred miles inland .
That ’s why the Moroccan King Hassan II , a wily old sultan with friends in the CIA , decided it was worth his while to ship all those loyal subjects down to Morocco ’s southern border , hand out little green flags for the cameras , and send them across the border toward those Spanish troops .
The Moroccans had to think outside the traditional military - conquest box , for the simple reason that Morocco ’s armed forces are pathetic .
They ’re so bad their only contributions to military history have been in the “ slapstick comedy ” department .
For instance , the Minister of Defense once tried to have fighters from the Moroccan Air Force kill Hassan II by shooting down his Boeing 727 as it came home from a foreign trip .
They failed .
Seriously : jet fighters failed to intercept and destroy a big , fat , slow civilian airliner even when they knew its exact flight path .
A military like that pretty much has to resort to unarmed conquest , because its chances in a fair fight are zero .
Of course the Moroccans had the advantage of facing a weak , dispirited colonial Spain just at the moment the Spanish dictator , General Franco , finally got around to dying .
If you ’re old enough to recall those early SNL seasons , you probably remember Chevy Chase ’s running joke , “ This just in : General Franco still dead ! ”
The reason that joke worked is that it took the old General a long time to die , and that meant that greedy up - and - coming regional powers like Morocco had plenty of time to plan ways of getting their hands on former Spanish colonies .
It may not have been very exciting for combat fans , but it was an extremely effective invasion .
The Spanish troops did n’t fire a shot .
The marchers walked over the border , got sand in their shoes , shouted about how this sacred patch of waterless , flat desert was now an integral part of the Kingdom of Morocco , and went back home .
And since then , the Spanish Sahara has been dominated by Morocco , although the local guerrilla army , POLISARIO , gave them some serious problems for a while .
What makes this weird episode my nominee for “ Most Significant Battle of the Era ” is that it showed the new way of winning disputed territory .
If there ’s one thing that we should have learned over the past hundred years , it ’s that traditional armed conquests are getting less and less effective .
This is one of the most surprising twists in all military history .
All through the nineteenth century , the European powers , led by the British and French , took the land they wanted on the grounds that they had better military technology , transport and organization .
Locals who disputed that notion tended to disappear as casualties of inevitable progress .
And that was just an updated version of what had been happening all over the world for thousands of years : bigger , stronger tribes displace and wiped out weaker tribes whenever they could .
That was the norm , even in pre-contact North America , where the Navajo were displacing the Ute in the American Southwest long before the white guys showed up .
Now , even though the balance in conventional warfare is if anything tilting further toward the first world , the technologically advanced and organized countries are in retreat , and the former victims are pushing back , not just claiming their old territories but infiltrating the former colonizers ’ countries .
What matters now is morale , national will .
The Spanish did n’t have it , and the Moroccans did .
So even though the Spanish troops could have wiped out those unarmed marchers , they failed to open fire .
Weapons are only weapons if you ’re willing to use them .
A technologically advanced army without the will to fire is no army at all .
Only us dedicated war nerds seem to realize how weird this is , how totally unprecedented in military history .
Until the 20th century , the problem was n’t usually getting militarily superior forces to open fire -- it was getting them to stop before the weaker tribe , army or country was totally wiped out .
I do n’t know of a single case , before the 20th century , of a militarily superior tribe or nation lacking the will to defend its territory , or for that matter , take the territory of weaker neighbors .
The 20th century was the big turning point .
New powers like Germany and Japan tried to imitate the older colonial powers of the 19th century and suffered total , disastrous defeat , even though they usually prevailed on the battlefield .
That ’s the weird lesson of the two world wars : military superiority in the narrow sense just does n’t cut it any more .
Despite the total battlefield dominance of the Wehrmacht ( and to a lesser extent the Imperial Japanese forces ) , Germany and Japan ended the war not just without additional territory but with their home territories in ruins , their cultures gelded , their birthrates for generations to come among the lowest in the world .
Even the older colonial powers , Britain and France , finished the century in big trouble , without the will to resist the immigrants from the colonies they ’d once ruled .
We ’re at a very strange moment militarily : our weapons still work but our will is gone .
The colonies that were established earliest are the most successful .
For example , northern North America , now the U.S. and Canada , passed into permanent possession of the European settlers ( or so it seemed , until recently ) .
Two things determined this : first , they were settled in the 17th and 18th century , before conscience set in , and because most of the native population had been relatively tiny groups of hunter - gatherers ( which also holds true for Australia , though it was settled much later ) .
Everywhere else -- in Latin America , Africa , Asia -- the locals have been pushing back the colonizers without coming close to what old - style military theorists would call military superiority .
That ’s what we ’re seeing now in South Africa , and more slowly in Europe and the southern United States .
In other places , especially those colonized by the French ( who were never as good at it as the Brits ) , huge colonial populations were totally eliminated , like the million - plus French residents of Algeria .
So there ’s a shocking lesson that military buffs have been slow to face : military superiority does n’t matter nearly as much right now as birthrate and sheer ruthless will .
Ah , birth rate -- funny how it ’s become such a taboo subject for both Left and Right .
The Lefties would n’t dream of telling third - world people to limit their baby - making , and most right wingers can’t bring themselves to endorse birth control even if it could slow the destruction of their own countries .
So birth rate is a weapon without a counter - weapon right now .
So it tends to win .
The Moroccans made it clear that the Green March was all about birth rate .
The number of “ volunteers ” they sent to the border was 350,000 , exactly the number of births per year in Morocco .
So this was basically a ” Lebensraum ” argument like the one the Germans tried earlier in the century .
You might have heard about that one , a little dust - up called the Eastern Front .
And you might be saying right now that if any policy ever failed decisively , it was the Nazis ’ attempt to elbow themselves a little living space from Stalin .
Which is totally true .
But the Nazis tried it the old - fashioned way , with armed conquest .
To succeed in the post -1918 world , the world Woodrow Wilson dreamed up where “ small nations ” have rights even if they can’t defend them , you need to use slower , less obviously military methods , like birthrate and immigration .
The classic example of this kind of slow conquest is Kosovo .
The Serbs could always defeat the Albanians on the battlefield , even when outnumbered , but the Albanians had a huge advantage in the most important military production of all -- babies .
According to the BBC , the birthrate of Kosovo Albanians 50 years ago was an amazing 8.5 children per woman .
The Serb / Albanian conflict offers damn near perfect lab conditions to prove my case that birth rate trumps military prowess these days , because the Serbs always beat the Albanians in battle , yet they ’ve lost their homeland , Kosovo .
Here again , we can blame Woodrow Wilson and his talk about “ rights . ”
In places where tribes hate each other , a tribe that outbreeds its rival will become the majority , even if it ca n’t fight .
So , after generations of skulking at home making babies , letting the Serbs do the fighting , the Albanians finally became the majority in Kosovo and therefore the official " good guys , " being oppressed by the official " bad guys , " the Serbs .
At least that ’s the way the nave American Wilsonian types like Clinton saw it .
So when the Serbs fought back against an Albanian rebellion in Kosovo , and dared to beat the Albanians , Clinton decided to bomb the Serbs into letting go of Kosovo , the ancient heartland of a Christian nation that had spent its blood holding off the Turks for hundreds of years .
The Kosovo Albanians proved that military skill does n’t matter , because they tried and failed to conquer Kosovo the old - fashioned way : armed rebellion by the Kosovo Liberation Army .
It was a wipeout : local Serb militias , a bunch of tired middle - aged part - timers and cops , crushed the KLA .
What happened next is a beautiful illustration of the way losers win these days : the Albanians took the bodies of KLA men who ’d been killed in battle , stripped all weapons and ammo from them , and showed them to gullible Western reporters as victims of a Serb “ massacre . ”
It was a massacre , all right , but only because the KLA could n’t fight worth a damn .
Alive and armed , they were a joke ; dead and disarmed , they helped win Kosovo by making their side the " victims , " which led directly to U.S. military intervention .
To win the way the Albanians won in Kosovo , you need to make a lot of babies .
It ’s that simple .
And to see how it works , you have to drop the namby - pamby liberal idea that people only have babies out of “ love . ”
In lots of places on this planet , baby - making is a form of weapons production .
In some places , it ’s open policy .
For example , in Palestine there ’s an all - out birthrate war going on between the Palestinians and the Israelis .
And one of the most frustrating things about this kind of struggle , from the Israeli perspective , is that the worse you make life for the people in the occupied zones , the more kids they have .
The Gaza Strip , for instance , has one of the highest fertility rates in the world outside Africa , at 5.6 kids per woman .
The rate for Israeli overall is about 2.8 children per woman , high for a rich country .
But the most amazing rates anywhere , even higher than for the Gaza Palestinians , are in the most extreme Zionist groups , the Haredi “ ultra - orthodox ” Jews .
Until recently they averaged eight or nine children per woman .
There was actually a big panic in the Israeli settler press when news hit that their rate had dropped to a mere 7.7 kids per woman .
That ’s actually higher than the rate for Mali ( 7.38 per woman ) , which has the highest birthrate in the world .
The settlers do n’t hide the fact that they ’re producing as many kids as they can in order to change the demographics of “ Greater Israel ” in their favor -- above all to make sure the Palestinians never become the majority .
What ’s interesting is that there were plenty of voices in the ultra-Orthodox community in favor of using Israel ’s military superiority to settle the problem the old - fashioned way , by expelling or wiping out the Palestinians .
Those people lost out ; their leader , Meir Kahane , was assassinated by an Egyptian cabbie in New York , but he ’d lost the debate long before he died .
You just ca n’t get away with those methods these days , not even with every born - again Baptist Zionist in Texas backing you to the hilt .
If you want an example closer to home , just go to Northern Ireland where the Protestant majority the border was designed to maintain has been getting smaller and smaller , thanks to the higher birthrate among Catholics .
As of 2001 , the Catholics were about 46 % of the population , up from 35 % in 1961 .
But as the dreaded “ Catholic Majority ” date approaches , a funny thing is happening up in Ulster : the Catholic birth rate is slowing down even faster than the Protestant rate .
This always happens when a tribe breaks out of its slums into the middle class .
This illustrates one of the real brain - twisters of contemporary demographic struggle : if you really hate the enemy tribe , the best thing you could do would be to make them rich .
Rich people do n’t have nearly as many kids .
Of course there are exceptions like the Ultra - Orthodox Israelis , who are fairly well - off and just dedicated to making as many kids as possible , but generally , money distracts people from starting big families .
So the old methods of keeping down the enemy tribe are usually counterproductive .
If the Ulster hotheads like Ian Paisley had had their way and kept the Catholics down in the slums , their birthrate over the past 30 years would have been much higher and they ’d be ready to stage a Kosovo - style “ majority rule ” coup like the Albanians did against the Serbs , complete with the USAF blowing up every television tower in Belfast like we did to the ones in Belgrade , just to teach those Serbs a lesson : “ No TV till you let your little Albanian brother have Kosovo ! ”
Makin'em rich is the only way you ’re going to settle the kind of conquest - by - immigration we ’re seeing now in Europe and North America .
Nobody will even say honestly how many illegal immigrants there are in the U.S. right now , but just from what I see driving to work , I ’m inclined to go with the higher estimates , something up to 20 million people who snuck in from Mexico and points south looking for work .
As far as I know , nobody ’s claiming the Latino immigrants decided to have a lot of kids as a way of reconquering Texas and California , the way the Israeli settlers are doing .
La reconquista , if it happens , will be an unforeseen result of rising birth rates and falling death rates for countries like Mexico that are just moving up from the third world to , say , the second - and - a - halfth .
By 1970 , Mexico was at that dangerous stage where there ’s just enough basic medical care to keep people alive , so death rates are falling sharply , but people are still poor enough to want a lot of kids .
Between 1970 and 2000 , the Mexican population doubled , from 48 million to 98 million .
So on one side of the Rio Grande you had a lot of young poor people , and on the other , a lot of money and companies eager for cheap labor .
And a muddy little creek like the Rio Grande was n’t nearly wide enough to keep those two groups apart .
As the population of Mexico increased and the living standard rose , the fertility rate actually went into an amazing dive , to the point that the rate for Mexican women now is only 2.39 kids per woman , just two places up from Israel ’s 2.38 .
And the only thing that ’s brought the Latino birthrate down -- in their home countries , not among the ones who immigrated to the U.S. -- is getting enough money that peasant families start thinking of themselves as consumers , and get more excited about buying a new truck or a flat - screen TV than having little Jos .
This is all pretty slow to unfold , compared to traditional military conquest .
Birth rate takes decades to have an effect ; the Albanian victory in Kosovo is the result of birth rates from the mid-20th century .
And in some parts of the world , like the US and Europe , immigrants have a history of being absorbed by the locals rather than sticking to the old tribal hatreds in the style of the Balkans and the Middle East .
It ’s a cultural deal , after all , not racial .
Studies of the U.S. Hispanic population show that within a generation or two , most American Hispanics are ranting about policing the borders and keeping those damn immigrants out of the country .
What ’s really weird -- and I can testify to this from my own experiences growing up -- is when the local culture infiltrates the immigrants , like the fact that Mexicans in the U.S. are deserting the Catholics and becoming born - again Protestants .
Go to any of the younger , feister churchers in the U.S. like the Church of the Nazarene and you ’ll see lots of Mexican families with plenty of kids , singing old Scottish hymns in Tex - Mex English .
In fact , I ran into a really hilarious article by a U.S. Baptist writer who worried that the Baptist birthrate is going down while the Nazarenes are having babies at a rate of three - plus per woman .
So the nightmare scenario that anti-immigrant bloggers are always predicting , where the U.S. turns into one giant Mexico , might end up being true in what you might call “ racial ” terms -- I mean , your second - grade class photo might be two - thirds Hispanic -- but those Hispanic faces would have absorbed a whole born - again American world picture that actually comes from the Scots - Irish who settled the American south hundreds of years ago .
This is one point where people ’s anxiety over these slow , demographic conquests splits according to their real fears : do you just not want to see that kind of face when you go outside , or do you not want to import the culture of the immigrants ’ home country ?
The whole debate right now is so censored , so totally dishonest on both sides , that nobody will come clean about which it is .
I suspect for some people it ’s the faces : they want the faces on their street to be the same shape and color they were when they were growing up .
If that ’s what you want , then no matter where you are , I can guarantee that if you ’re rich enough to worry about things like this ( as opposed to where your next meal ’s coming from ) , then yup , you definitely have grounds for worry .
People move around to where the food is , the money , the good grazing , the jobs .
The Germanic tribes who moved in on Europe a couple millennia back took a more reasonable view ; they called wars “ the movements of the peoples . ”
The Huns push the Goths off the steppe , and boom !
Next thing you know , the Goths are wiping out a Roman army at Adrianople .
The faces are going to change .
We are in a new military - historical era , in which the only states with the sheer will to resist slow “ conquest ” by immigration were the Stalinist states .
Of course they did n’t have much of a problem there anyway -- not too many immigrants trying to sneak into North Korea or the old USSR -- but even if they had faced real demographic challenge , they had the will to open fire .
The Berlin Wall is a nasty case in point , where the will was used to stop people leaving .
But those Stalinist states are not exactly a growth industry these days , and no liberal democratic state has the will to shoot down unarmed people trying to get in ( or out , for that matter ) .
Even the Israelis , who are maybe the fiercest first - worlders on demographic issues , do n’t shoot the poor Africans who cross to Beersheba for jobs in the cafes .
They just send them back to Sudan to be shot there .
So the movement of the peoples , the slow demographic wars , are going to go on .
We just do n’t have a counter - move , except maybe bombarding poor people with money to stay home .
Basically , no matter where you are , the complexions and the features you see on the streets are going to change .
If it ’s any consolation to face - fascists , Europeans got their licks in first , so to speak .
Not many African - Americans around with pure African blood ; not many Mexican Indians without some Spanish in them .
So now the faces blend the other way .
For most people the real worry , if they were allowed to even say it out loud , is culture : if you ’re French , you really do n’t want Paris turning into Kinshasa , because let ’s be honest , Kinshasa is a Hellhole .
If you ’re English , you do n’t want London turning into Karachi , because Karachi is a nightmare .
If you ’re American , you do n’t want Houston -- oh Hell , ever been to Houston ?
If you have half a brain , you do n’t want Houston at all , the lousy sweatbox .
The thing is , most of the people who invaded from those places tend to agree with you .
That ’s why they moved in the first place .
Nobody knows what a Hellhole the Congo is like a Congolese .
I read somewhere that on the Congo riverboats , they have these slang terms for the different decks .
The first - class deck they call “ Europe . ”
The second - class deck is “ China , ” meaning not that great , but livable .
The third - class deck is “ Congo , ” and nobody wants to be there , least of all the Congolese .
So to assess your situation in terms of the new conquests , you have to decide whether you ’re in a Kosovo -- two tribes hating each other forever , turning out babies as weapons -- or that Congolese riverboat , where nobody wants it too “ authentic ” if they can help it .
There ’s a lot of blurring and overlap between those two models , sure .
Take Northern Ireland : a lot of yelling , a lot of noisy tribal hate , but I just do n’t think they have it in them to be another Kosovo .
Too interested in TV and cars .
That ’s what ’s funny about the debate right now : the diehards in the U.S. and Europe wish we had the old ruthless will to seal the borders , but the “ weakness ” of the advanced countries generally works pretty well to turn the immigrants into immigrant - hating locals in a generation or two .
The old model , bayonets on the border , is n’t even in the running .
Time to face that fact .
So the faces will change .
If you can handle these new faces , you ’re likely to be surprised to see your “ weak ” American or European culture win out , slowly , un-gloriously but surely , and you may live long enough to see a whole new crop of pols who look like they just came from Karachi or Kinshasa until you turn the sound on and hear them ranting about how we need to get rid of all these damn immigrants .
Gary Brecher is the author of the new book , The War Nerd .
. Buy it .
Josh Ruxin is a Columbia University expert on public health who has spent the last few years living in Rwanda .
He ’s an unusual mix of academic expert and mud -between - the - toes aid worker .
Rwanda is perhaps the only country besides the United States where July 4th is a national holiday .
And while it is true that Rwandans have great admiration for the U.S. , the Fourth of July is only coincidentally a shared day of celebration .
In 1994 , that date marked the end of the Rwandan Genocide , and the birth of the new government that rose from the ashes .
This Friday , the nation will be celebrating its 14th year of peace and the growing prosperity that has been the result .
This is a virtually unbelievable , unpredictable achievement in light of the forces that aligned to prevent it .
What does peace and development look like in Rwanda ?
Housing projects are springing up ; per capita income is up ; and health indicators are dramatically improved , with more than 50,000 people receiving the AIDS drugs they need via some of the best delivery mechanisms in all of Africa .
Two international - quality malls have sprouted up in Kigali and are doing a brisk business ; international banks are eyeing the market ; internet service is still the cheapest per megabyte ( and fastest ) in all of Africa .
Infrastructure improvement is putting Rwanda ’s neighbors to shame : New roads and electricity grids are being built out alongside potable water lines .
These developments have not gone unnoticed .
Tourism is at all - time high levels with improvements and new tourist venues emerging every month — including the recent addition of first - class accommodations around the country .
On Friday , as those of you in the United States celebrate your Fourth of July , think of us in Kigali .
We ’ll be celebrating with our Rwandan friends on this double holiday at the spanking - new U.S. embassy .
Its size and dramatic stature reassure this nation that the U.S. and Rwanda have more in common than the same Independence Day :
They share a common vision of stability , peace and prosperity .
The remarkable tale of Rwanda ’s liberation can now be accessed by all in a superbly researched new book by Stephen Kinzer , former New York Times bureau chief in Managua , Berlin , and Istanbul .
In A Thousand Hills : Rwanda ’s Rebirth and the Man Who Dreamed It , Kinzer details in brilliant and compelling prose the unprecedented efforts of the Rwandan Patriotic Army to overthrow Rwanda ’s regime .
Most importantly , Kinzer tracks Rwanda ’s trajectory of success to the present day and beyond .
Today , it ’s hard to imagine where Rwanda will be on its 232nd 4th of July holiday but if I were to bet on it , it will be a nation transformed .
The folly of rampant consumerism as resources grow scarcer is lost on no one , least of all the marketing community .
Still , desperate to maximise profits , manufacturers and marketing men are targeting very young children , buying their loyalty almost from birth , and infantilising adults , to deter them from making considered decisions about what they buy .
This way , adults and children will be attracted to the same product , and buy it for most of their lives , trapped in a Peter Pan cycle of consumption , constructed by branding supremos .
For many , shopping changed from chore to leisure pursuit long ago .
You will be hard pushed to find a British consumer who has n't , at least once , gone to the street with the intention of finding something they want to buy , rather than buying something they need .
This behaviour contrasts not only with that of consumers in developing countries , but also with the Europe and US of just 60 years ago .
The exact point at which a life of frugality – led by most people until the 1950s – developed into one of comfort , before slipping into absurd excess , is impossible to determine , admits Benjamin Barber , author of the best - selling Jihad Vs. McWorld .
His new book , Consumed , tackles obsessive , " hyper " consumption .
This trend , predicts Barber , is leading democratic societies towards an early grave .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" It struck me that a lot of what makes up McWorld is superfluous , " he says of his inspiration to analyse this hyper - consumerism , which is most acute in Barber 's US .
" An awful lot of products are not necessary , whether fast food or gadgets or games , " he explains .
" I can't tell you where the tipping point is , but we 're way over it . "
Since basic human needs – food , shelter , clothing – have long since been met for most people in the developed world , marketing professionals now bang their heads together to reinvent and recreate goods in order to sell more stuff .
Barber is far from the first to draw attention to the fact that consumers are very often attracted by the image of a product , rather than its function , and that we would all benefit from consuming less .
Yet he goes one further , blaming hyper - consumption for the current economic crisis .
He also believes the anti-consumer movement lacks the wherewithal to address the problem .
" I love the anti-consumer movement temperamentally , but it risks turning these issues into minority problems , " he says .
Consumption is not only out of control at the shops .
Barber uses television watching as an example : there is nothing wrong with reaching for the remote after a long day at work , he says .
But 60 hours – the time each week an average American spends watching television – is way too much .
Watching TV is just part of the problem .
What we are choosing to watch has changed considerably over the years and now resembles a homogenous lowbrow pulp designed to appeal to children and adults alike .
Barber 's book is subtitled " How markets corrupt children , infantilise adults and swallow citizens whole " .
Commentators have been documenting the rise of the scooter - pushing , iPod - toting kidult for a number of years now , but in Barber 's opinion , the " 40 is the new 20 " spirit does not mean that people are retaining their youthfulness and energy for longer , but that they are not growing up at all .
Why not ?
Because marketers desperate for instant profits are cutting corners by lumping child and adult tastes and products together , instead of building a sustainable market .
This then reduces diversity and threatens to eliminate choice altogether .
The success of films such as Shrek and Spider - Man , aimed at all ages , illustrate this .
" If you want to see the future of Britain , do n't look at what 40 - years - olds are buying , look at what 15 - year - olds are buying and watching and what their music tastes are , " predicts Barber .
For anyone who has sat next to a gang of schoolgirls playing Pussycat Dolls loudly on mobile phones , the idea that their musical tastes will never mature and that the shade of their nail varnish will never be toned down is sobering .
But why can't adults enjoy the nuances of an episode of The Simpsons , say , or a Harry Potter film ?
Does growing up mean becoming boring ?
" I 'm not saying that when we grow up we lose all pleasures , " insists Barber .
" But growing up means becoming more complex and that you require greater stimulation .
If you can be pleased and satisfied with comic books , it means you 've kept yourself as a kid .
I 'm not saying there 's something wrong with people who have fun , but I have fun in a different way from how I did when I was 12 . "
Barber buried his head in marketing textbooks to try to make sense of why we buy more and more stuff we do n't need , and often do not want or enjoy having , either .
Saatchi & Saatchi chief executive Kevin Roberts , the man who loves Head & Shoulders so dearly he continues to use it despite the fact he is now bald , receives frequent scoldings in Consumed .
It is Roberts and his ilk who are driving our impulse to buy .
These big guns are only too aware that most of our needs were met long ago , and it is with this in mind that they have set about eternalising childhood desires and fabricating new adult ones .
In Consumed , the merchandising guru Gene del Vecchio explains : " the demand for adult goods and services has proved not to be endless . "
This must be tackled with a " kidquake of kid- directed goods and services " .
Del Vecchio also worked out that if you want to sell goods globally , you can't sell to adults who belong to distinct cultures .
But children are the same everywhere , and if you get adults to behave like children , you can sell the same products to any generation , anywhere .
Hyper-consumerism is a major contributor to environmental problems , yet so - called green marketers are as guilty as your average marketing man .
" Do n't fool yourself , " warns Barber .
" Green consumerism is still consuming .
The simplest way to go green is not to consume , or to consume less , but these people want you to consume their way , because if you stop consuming they do n't make any money . "
When Barber bought his last car he was tempted by a Lexus hybrid , until a friend pointed out that the hybrid 's powerful engine used more petrol than many non -hybrid vehicles .
Last year , a magazine advertisement for Lexus hybrids was banned in the UK , for misleadingly implying that the car caused little or no harm to the environment .
Desite his green leanings , Barber misses a trick when he orders bottled water in the bar of the London hotel where we meet .
Bottled water , in a country where clean water flows straight from the tap , is perhaps the ultimate in manufactured need .
" Over a billion people are without drinking water , " says Barber .
" Why do n't we find out ways to get the water they need to them , instead of new ways of getting water to us ? "
All this makes Consumed sound like depressing reading .
In many ways , it is , and the idea that Western shoppers are to blame for environmental degradation , even if they have been hoodwinked into buying unnecessary products , is a heavy cross to bear .
Is capitalism eating itself ?
Barber is optimistic .
" Capitalism has a tendency to overdo itself , " he says .
" It destroys everything in its path .
This is a strategy for saving capitalism .
There are deep , pressing human needs that still need to be met and capitalism is the perfect thing to meet them . "

Desperate Gazans trying to break through Rafah crossing
Fri , 06 Jun 2008 22:41:44 Yousef Alhelou , Press TV , Gaz
Politicians are fond of recalling historical figures on the campaign trail - Washington , Lincoln , Roosevelt - as if the mere mention puts them into elevated company .
But there is a problem for John McCain in this Walt Disney World hotel when he reminisces about an idea that John F Kennedy and the Republican leader , Barry Goldwater , once shared of flying around the country for a series of town hall debates .
Barack Obama , whom McCain is trying to entice into a series of such encounters , was just two when Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 .
McCain was already flying combat aircraft .
The age difference is one of the sharpest contrasts between Obama and McCain in an election campaign that is shaping up to be a referendum on a large sweep of America 's political history .
At 71 , McCain has lived through much of it , as was made apparent in his first ad for the general election , released yesterday .
The Republican relives his experiences in Vietnam war .
" I hate war , " he says .
" I 'm running for president to keep the country I love safe . "
But it emerges during this audience with Florida media chiefs that McCain is not just old , but cranky .
Asked about his opposition to a $ 2bn plan to save the Everglades , supported by Florida 's Republican governor , McCain demands : " Tell me what that bill was ? "
Then he turns on the questioner .
" You just answered your own question , " he snaps .
McCain 's confusion is puzzling .
This is his 18th visit to Florida since the campaign began and the Everglades is of big concern to voters .
There is a front page story about Everglades preservation in that day 's Miami Herald .
McCain was due to make his first visit to the region yesterday .
" I am in favour of doing whatever 's necessary to save the Everglades , " McCain says .
" But I will not vote for bills that have projects and other things on them that have not gone through the proper scrutiny . "
It 's an anaemic response for a candidate who has been heavily promoting his environmental credentials in an attempt to appeal to independent voters .
It 's also unlikely to be popular in Florida , which McCain has targeted as a battleground state against Obama .
Since March , when McCain became the last Republican left in the race for the White House , Democratic activists have fretted that the gruelling primary campaign would drain off energy and resources from the presidential race .
But Obama emerged from 16 months of combat with Hillary Clinton a more assured candidate and his campaign staff a well - oiled political machine .
McCain , though better rested , seems out of practice .
Unlike Obama , whose staff line the route to every public appearance with campaign signs and cheering crowds , McCain , the former pilot , seems to fly under the radar .
On the loungers by the pool , no heads turn as McCain walks by en route to the darkened ballroom where he is to address his select audience .
McCain is struggling to build excitement about his candidacy .
At his meeting here , he tries out a new strategy for countering Obama 's powerful message about change .
A McCain White House , he promises , will be about reform .
McCain also tried to inject some excitement into a speaking style that critics , and even his own camp followers , admit is stilted by ignoring the speech scrolling on autocues at the back of the room .
But his delivery was no match for Obama 's soaring oratory .
His 25 years in Congress provides a lot of potential material for his opponents .
The steady criticism from the Obama camp has made it difficult for McCain to get his own message out to voters , and avoid being branded an appendage of the George Bush presidency .
Obama enjoys a narrow lead or is running even with McCain in the national polls .
He has done even better on fund - raising .
Last month , his best for fundraising , McCain took in $ 21.5 m .
Obama took in $ 55 m in his best month , last February , and that was at a time when he was competing for Democratic donors .
But Florida , McCain hopes , could be different .
McCain leads Obama in the polls in this battleground state , and he is working methodically to go after disaffected Clinton supporters .
He started this week at a meeting of Puerto Rican community leaders .
Puerto Ricans are an increasingly important voting bloc and McCain managed to make some headway , impressing the audience with his credentials .
" Obama is a person we did n't know till he got into the race .
We do n't know what he brings to the table , " said Mildred Fernandes , a local official who is backing McCain .
But it 's not yet clear that voters are getting to know McCain any better , or like him more when they do .
小野さんの記事を読んで少し悪乗りを反省した。けれどもIT業界の人材不足って、人材育成とか学生へのPRで解決できるのだろうか。僕が西垣氏の発言を読んでムカッときたのは、長期雇用を前提に若い時分は下働きに甘んじろというが、それはあまりに若手の現状認識や、いまどきのIT業界の平均像からかけ離れているのではないか、ということだ。
IT業界に限らず年功序列、長期雇用が成り立っているのは、下請け構造の上部に位置する一握りの大企業に過ぎない。彼らの高給と安定を支えるために、雇用は安定せず、人材開発のための投資もされず使い捨てられる技術者が少なからずいることの問題は、当のIPAがレポートしている。そして人材が行き渡っていないのは、元請けの大企業ではなく、そういった中小の下請け企業ではないか。
そして膨大な数の 「 業務知識に精通し、かつ、大規模システムをチームワークで作れる人材」を業界が欲する背景に、元請け企業の長期雇用に起因するIT業界の多重下請け構造だけでなく、発注企業側の長期雇用や組織の硬直化に起因する、ビジネスプロセスの個別化や、発注企業のIT部門でさえビジネスプロセスに触り難い組織力学にあるのではないか。
西垣氏も金融SE上がりなら、地銀でさえ自行のビジネスプロセスに固執し、簡単には共同システムやパッケージによる合理化が成功し難い状況をよくご存知だろう。そういった非効率で価値を生まない似たようなシステムは、膨大な数の使い捨てられる技術者の犠牲の上に成り立っている。
丹羽宇一郎さん は 「 まず入社して十年間は泥のように働いてもらう」といった後「入社４年までに全員を海外に研修に出す」とも「毎日深夜まで会社にいろとは言わない。本を読み、人と会い、ものを考えることで知的能力を再生産する努力を続けることだ」ともいっている。
要は若いうちは自分から学べ、投資は惜しまんといっている訳で、これは商社が儲かっているからできることだが、そういう人を大切にする会社には今だって若者が殺到している。人材不足に悩むような業務システム・インフラ系システムを開発しているところで、社員を十年の計、三十年の計でじっくり育てようという気概を持った会社や経営者がどれだけあるだろうか。それができる事業環境にあるだろうか。あるならば、その点こそアピールすべきではないか。きっと若手の入社希望者に困ることはない。
いつもid:fromdusktildawnが書いていることだが、僕も特に若いうちは仕事を通じて誰と会い、何を経験し、学べるかで身の振りようを選ぶべきだと考える。そして学生って賢いもので、決して高くない給与で馬車馬のように働かされようとも、世の中から必要とされている実感を持て、権限委譲が進み、自分が関わっているという手ごたえを感じるところには、ちゃんと優秀なひとが来ているのではないか。若者が来ないのは他じゃ役に立たなさそうなレガシーコードのお守りをさせられ、取引関係で立場が固定していて提案を聞いてもらえなかったり、受注先や元請けの尊敬できない担当者から理不尽を押し付けられ、馬鹿馬鹿しくてやってられないような世界ではないか。だから長続きしないのだろう。
ダンコーガイがインタビューしたアルファギークたちはもちろん魅力的だし、そういう討論会は是非聞いてみたいけれども、彼らの周りにはもともと華があって、PRしなくとも人はもう十分に集まっているはずだ。けれども先のような記事でIT業界全般に対して誤ったイメージもあるようなら、それを払拭すべく華のあるイベントを開くのは素晴らしいことだ。
どうして既存の産業構造を維持したままPRさえすれば若者がやってくるとでも考えているのか、理解に苦しむ。学生はIT業界を知らないのではなく、知っているからこそ真剣に選んでいる。役所がやるべきは資格認定制度やモデル約款で技術者や業界に対して箸の上げ下ろしを指図することではなく、非効率な業界構造が温存され、そこに若者が寄り付かず、付加価値が低いまま放置されていることに対して、かかる業界構造を温存する諸制度を、省の枠を超えて見直すことではないか。
西垣氏が意気揚々とNECに入社した時代と違って、いまや上からいわれた通りにやっていても、10年泥のように働ければラッキーで、3年で泥のように捨てられるかも知れない。10年、20年先の自分のキャリアに対して責任を持ってくれる上司になんか出会えない。それは管理職の人格とかが問題なのではなく、2年先にポストが、10年先に会社があるかさえ分からない、そういう時代なのだ。
いまどき責任と良識ある大人なら「君は俺のいう通り苦労しろ、そうすれば報いてやる」なんて無責任なこと、口が裂けてもいえない。せいぜい俺の背中をみて組織での生き残り方を学べ、骨は拾ってやるから信じたとおりやってみろ、くらいが関の山ではないか。僕が部下を持ったところで、それくらいしかいわない。けれども僕がロールモデルになったり、たまたま提供できた契機が、誰かの10年後、20年後に花開くことがあれば、それは素晴らしいことだと夢想する。こんな空気を吸っていれば、どこへ行っても生き延びれるだろうと実感してもらえる背中をみせたい。
僕も誰かから人生の面倒をみてもらったことはないが、自分で今のキャリアを選ぶ契機を与えてくれた方や、ロールモデルをみせてくれた方はいっぱいいる。こういう時代なのだから、そういう生き様とか価値観といったところでしか、後進に対してコミットできないのではないか。そういう時代の不確実性を共有しつつ、自分から馬車馬のように働くほど打ち込める対象を、どうやってみつける手伝いができるかこそ問題なのだ。
人手が足りないなら、やり方を変えなきゃならない。優秀な若者を能力に見合わない付加価値の低い仕事で奪い合うのではなく、そういった担い手のいない仕事を一掃するような付加価値の高い仕事を誰かがつくるのだ。日本でつくらなくたって遠からずインドや米国がつくってしまい、結果として日本からは、もっと雇用が減ることになる。
あ の10年、日本企業の多くが若者を引き受けて育てることを投げた。いまさら若者から見捨てられても仕方ないではないか。それはそれで労働市場が機能しているということだ。遠からず誰もメンテできなくなる膨大なスパゲッティ・コードをどうするのかを考えると空恐ろしいけれど、本当に手に負えなくなってからしか、会社身分制を飛び越えた無理は通らないだろうから、それは自業自得だ。
いつまでも都合よく下請けに若者が流れ込んでくるなんて考えている経営者がいたら大間違いだ。そういう業界の声を額面どおり聞く役所があれば、それも大間違いだ。将来をコミットできなくとも、希望を与えられ、筋の通ったところに優秀な奴らは集まる。そういうダイナミズムの中で、世の中が回るように壁や理不尽な慣行を壊していくことこそ、これからの役所にとって重要な仕事だろう。
日本の年功序列型の賃金プロファイルは、若いとき会社に「貯金」し、年をとってからその貯金を回収するようになっている。これは、実はグラミン銀行などと同じ村落共同体型のガバナンスだ。新入社員は会社というムラに「贈与」するので、それを取り返すまではやめられない。ところが、取り返せる40代になると、もうつぶしがきかないので、しかたなく会社に一生ぶら下がる・・・というタコ部屋になっているわけだ。
まず、どうして採用時に技術力が求められないのかという点について。IT業界と十把一絡げにまとめているが、人材がもっとも欲しいと思っているのは業務システム・インフラ系システムを開発しているところであり、ここで求められる人材像は業務知識に精通し、かつ、大規模システムをチームワークで作れる人材である。技術力を持っているに越したことはないが、技術力があったとしても業務知識がないと開発に投入できないので、どうしても社内で教育して育てる必要がある。このような業務システムの開発は、西垣さんが引用した現場叩き上げ主義とよくマッチする。
労働者が1時間あたりに生み出す付加価値を示す労働生産性は，元請け企業と下請け企業で顕著な差が見られた。元請けの労働生産性が6415円であるのに比べ，下請けの労働生産性は3719円。下請けの労働生産性は元請けの58％しかない。下請け企業の中でも，「元請け会社は系列会社（あるいは親会社）である」と回答した企業の労働生産性は3480円とさらに低くなっている。「理由として，元請け企業は労働集約的な業務を下請けに外注化する傾向があることが考えられる」（IPA ) 。
日本の情報サービス業市場は世界第2位の規模だが，収益性は欧米IT企業に比べ低いだけでなく，インドIT企業よりも低い。その要因は受託開発中心の体質と多重下請け構造という情報サービス産業特有の問題点にあると経済産業省は分析している。「お客様にきちんとシステムを届けること自体は悪いことではない。しかし作ったシステム汎用性を持たせることができず，それが足を引っ張っている」（八尋氏）。
Now he ’s adding foreclosure to the list .
“ People are moving back down the property ladder , ” Mr. Jernigan said .
Bill Martin , a 50 - year - old former manager in the technology industry , lost his house in the Southern California community of Lake Forest last August .
His local self - storage company sent a truck and driver to pick up his things , a service it offers all new customers .
“ Storage has my hopes in it , ” said Mr. Martin , who sleeps on a foldout bed in his mother ’s guest room .
“ I do n’t tell anyone this , but at least once a week I go over and look at my couch , my refrigerator , my TV stand , my mattress and realize I did have a life , and maybe there ’s a way to go back to it . ”
Investors agree that hard times for homeowners like Mr. Martin will yield good times for storage firms .
U - Store - It ’s stock is up 33 percent this year .
Extra Space is up 18 percent .
Public Storage is up 18 percent .
“ People might lose their home but they ’re not going to lose their things , ” said Charles Ray Wilson of Self Storage Data Services , a research firm .
Yet some evidence suggests that is exactly what is happening .
It is impossible to put precise numbers on the phenomenon , partly because the industry is highly fragmented  the majority of facilities are locally owned  and also because the topic is not one the industry cares to dwell on .
But auctioneers who dispose of units in default , as well as the bidders who try to buy their contents , say they see increasing signs of strain .
They note that more auctions involve people who appear to have had their homes foreclosed .

I recently read that Brigitte Bardot , now in her 70s , has been arrested as a hate criminal for complaining that Muslims in France slaughter sheep without first stunning them .
The famous actress is known for her sympathy with animals , but the French government preferred to interpret her remarks as hatred for Muslims .
Prosecutor Anne de Fontetts promised to throw the book at Bardot .
There are many incongruities here .
The French are persecuting one of their own for taking exception to the practices of an alien culture .
But then , perhaps this is just being broad - minded .
What really jumps out is : if Bardot ’s animal rights position makes her a hate criminal , what does French President Nicholas Sarkozy ’s foreign policy position make him ?
According to Information Clearing House ’s running tally as of July 12 , 1,236,604 Iraqis have been slaughtered as a result of the Sarkozy - supported US invasion and occupation of Iraq .
If Bardot is a hate criminal under French law for complaining about how Muslims prepare their mutton , why is n’t President Sarkozy a hate criminal for supporting an American policy that has resulted in the deaths of 1,236,604 Muslims and the displacement of 4 million Iraqis ?
Such incongruities are everywhere .
It is as if people are no longer capable of thought .
Last week the US Congress passed an ex post facto law that legalized the illegal behavior of telecommunication companies that enabled the Bush Regime to violate US law and to spy on Americans without warrants .
Retroactive laws are unconstitutional .
But , alas , the US Constitution does not make campaign contributions , and telecommunication companies do .
The Bush Regime claimed that its illegal behavior , which requires an unconstitutional retroactive law to protect telecommunication companies and President Bush from being held accountable , is necessary to protect us .
But as our Founding Fathers and every intelligent patriotic person since has patiently explained to the American public , it is the Constitution that protects us .
No safety can be found by fleeing the Constitution .
Without the Constitution we have no protection .
We simply stand naked before unbridled government power .
That ’s pretty much how we stand now after 7.5 years of the Bush Regime .
Electing a Democratic Congress in 2006 did not make any difference .
Indeed , it was a Democratic majority Congress that last week gave Bush his unconstitutional ex post facto law .
As Larry Stratton and I point out in the new edition of Tyranny , the US Constitution has no friends .
The Democrats do n’t like the Second Amendment ( another incongruity in the face of the right - wing police state that Bush has created ) , and the Brownshirt Republicans regard the rest of our civil liberties as coddling devices for criminals and terrorists .
Across the political spectrum , Americans are happy to shred the Constitution in behalf of some agenda or the other .
The government is happy to oblige , because shredding the Constitution removes constraints on the government ’s power .
It has fallen to the private , member - supported organization known as the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) to challenge the retroactive law that destroys the privacy rights granted to US citizens by the Constitution .
The ACLU is regarded by conservatives as a Jewish conspiracy to destroy Christianity , and the right - wing idiots on Fox " News " and talk radio will denounce the ACLU for wanting to empower terrorists .
Conservatives will repeat endlessly that Americans who are doing nothing wrong have nothing to fear .
If this argument held any water , there would have been no point in the Founding Fathers writing the Constitution .
The position of the US Government is that the rights granted Americans by the Constitution facilitate terrorism .
To be safe from terrorists , the argument goes , we must allow the government to take liberties with the Constitution .
This argument gives government the power to set aside the Constitution , and , thus , enables tyranny .
As Milton Friedman and many others taught us , rules are the essence of freedom , and discretionary power is the essence of tyranny .
Bush ’s " war on terror , " essentially a hoax , has transformed the United States into a lawless nation .
We are not lawless in the sense of an absence of laws .
We are lawless in the sense that despite a surfeit of laws , we no longer have the rule of law .
If the President does n’t like an existing law , he ignores it .
If the President does n’t like new laws passed by Congress , instead of vetoing them he prepares a " signing statement , " which says that he will determine what the law means .
This lawlessness has spread from the top of the federal government down to local governments and community associations .
Recently the state of Georgia passed a law that reaffirmed that anyone with a carry permit was entitled to have their concealed weapon when dropping off or picking up passengers at the Atlanta airport .
The Atlanta city government said it would not obey the state law and would arrest anyone , including the state legislator who sponsored the legislation , who carried a permitted weapon onto airport property .
A community in which I live has by - laws that forbid members of the board of the property owners association from serving as general manager of the designated community .
This did not prevent the board from appointing one of their own the general manager .
The POA board regards the by - laws which govern it as merely words without force .
Just like Bush regards the US Constitution .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The implicit government guarantee of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is now explicit .
In a dramatic statement released Sunday , the White House and Federal Reserve moved to give the mortgage giants the capital they need to survive the depression in the housing market and turmoil in financial markets that had left them dangling over a cliff .
Of most immediate importance , the Fed 's board of governors voted to open up its emergency discount window to Fannie and Freddie .
In addition , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced that he will seek congressional authorization to buy stock in the two companies and increase the government 's credit line .
At the moment , each company may borrow only $ 2.25 billion .
In return for the capital , Paulson said that the Bush administration would ask Congress to grant the Fed a " consultative " role in the capital standards of the companies .
The housing rescue package that is nearing final approval by Congress would put in place a strong independent regulator for the companies is slowly moving through Congress .
Paulson says he wants a new provision allowing the Fed to work hand - in - hand with the new agency .
That would be a bitter pill for Fannie and Freddie , which have been at loggerheads with the central bank over the capital issue for years .
It is not clear how Congress will react to Paulson 's request .
The Treasury secretary said he has been in close contact with the Congressional leadership over the weekend , so his request will not come as a surprise to lawmakers .
It would be logical to attach the lifeboat for Fannie and Freddie to the housing rescue measure .
The Senate passed its version of the legislation last week and sent it back to the House for another vote .
It is expected to get to President Bush for his signature before Congress leaves town for its summer recess at the beginning of August .
The House Republican leadership vowed to put politics aside to craft legislation .
Stability is the goal
Fannie and Freddie are strange hybrid companies , known as government - sponsored enterprises .
They were chartered by Congress but are owned by private shareholders .
For years , Wall Street has believed that the government would never allow Fannie and Freddie to default .
The companies have been able to sell debt at lower prices than their competition .
But the agencies have grown to mammoth size .
They own or guarantee $ 5.2 trillion of U.S. home mortgages .
Investors have fled in recent months as the housing market downturn and financial market turmoil have shown no sign of ending .
In the past week , the selling intensified and Freddie and Fannie each lost half their value in volatile stock trading .
Talk of some form of government action rose as the week went on .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in a statement that the plan " will help add stability during this period . "
Paulson said the global reach of Fannie FNM , +0.85 % and Freddie FRE , - 0.64 % necessitated unprecedented action .
" GSE debt is held by financial institutions around the world .
Its continued strength is important to maintaining confidence and stability in our financial system and our financial markets , " Paulson said .
" The problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are pretty straightforward .
Combined , the two GSEs have about $ 95 billion in capital but hold over $ 5 trillion in mortgages .
With home prices falling and mortgage delinquencies rising , doubts are beginning to surface as to whether or not they have enough capital to ride out the housing slump .
The math is pretty daunting , " said Mark Vitner , senior economist at Wachovia .
In prepared statements , Fannie and Freddie said they welcomed the steps outlined by the Treasury and the Fed , while insisting that they were adequately capitalized .
Robert Mudd , the CEO of Fannie Mae , said the option to use the discount window should restore confidence of its stakeholders .
Richard Syron , the CEO of Freddie Mac , said the company 's quarterly results that are being finalized and would show " we have a substantial capital cushion above the 20 % mandatory target surplus established by our regulator . "
James Lockhart , the head of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) that regulates Fannie and Freddie , stressed that the two firms can survive .
The two firms have " $ 95 billion in total capital , their substantial cash and liquidity portfolios , and their experienced management serve as strong supports for [ the GSE 's ] continued operations , " he said in a statement .
Reaction
Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics , wrote that the package unveiled by Paulson and the Fed seems " designed to forestall a full rescue . "
" At the same time , the access to credit via the Treasury and Fed means the implicit guarantee on the GSEs ' debt is now explicit , " he said .
Shepherdson said he thought the plan would be positive for stocks and negative for Treasuries , but he said the sell - off in government notes and bonds would not last long given the weak state of the economy .
Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , predicted that the package would put downside pressure on the dollar .
He said letting the two firms collapse was preferable to a bailout and said the package announced amounted to sticking a finger into a leaking dam that was going to burst one way or another .
Because of the plan , it would burst through a surge of inflation , he said .
Details
In his statement , Paulson said the increase in the line of credit would be temporary and he gave no details of how much on an increase was under consideration .
The department would determine the terms and conditions for accessing the credit , he said .
The ability to purchase stock would also be temporary .
And use of either " would carry terms and conditions necessary to protect the taxpayer . "
But analysts saw signs of an end of an era .
" Looking further ahead , [ Fannie and Freddie ] will face a much different operating environment , and not before time .
Private companies where the taxpayer takes all the downside risk do n't make much sense , " Shepherdson said .
Palestinians are being regularly and illegally barred from reaching Dead Sea beaches in the occupied West Bank , according to a Supreme Court petition filed by Israel 's leading civil rights organisation .
The Association of Civil Rights ( Acri ) in Israel is challenging what it says is the frequently imposed ban by the military on Palestinians seeking to swim or relax at beaches in the northern Dead Sea .
The salt - saturated sea is the only open water accessible to Palestinians from the otherwise landlocked West Bank .
The petition says that the Israeli military is using the Beit Ha'arava checkpoint on Route 90 – the only open access route in the occupied West Bank for travel to the Dead Sea – to turn back Palestinians , mainly but not exclusively on weekends and Jewish holidays .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Acri says that the ban is to appease Israeli settlers operating concessions along the Dead Sea 's northern shore .
They fear losing Jewish customers if there are large numbers of Arabs using the beaches in territory seized by Israel during the Six Day War in 1967 .
A Palestinian bus driver , Mohammed Ahmed Nuaga 'a , described how he was turned back by the military with a party of children , aged between six and 12 , on a school trip from the Hebron district to the Dead Sea last month .
The outing had been officially co-ordinated with the Palestinian Authority education ministry and included 10 teachers and 15 parents .
He returned a few hours later in the hope that the soldiers would relent but they did not do so .
" I tried to explain to them that these are young pupils who came from very far to fulfil a big dream – to see the sea , " he said .
" But the soldiers were aggressive , and started shouting at us that Palestinian passage is forbidden , whether children or adults .
The pupils begged the soldiers to let them go for even 10 minutes just to see the sea and return , but nothing happened . "
In the petition a senior Acri lawyer , Limor Yehuda , says : " We are dealing here with travel bans and entry prohibitions to public places in occupied territory which are tainted with discrimination and characteristic of colonial regimes .
We have here prohibitions preventing the protected population of the occupied territory from using its own resources , while the very same resources are put at the disposal and enjoyment of the citizens of the occupying power . "
The ban came to light after the testimony of two Israeli army reservists who said that at the beginning of their tour of duty in May they were told that the purpose of the checkpoint was to " prevent Palestinians coming from the Jordan Valley to the Dead Sea beaches " .
One of the reservists , Doron Karbel , testified that as a " side note " , the Jordan Valley Brigade Commander , Colonel Yigal Slovik , had said the reason for the checkpoint was that " when Jews and Palestinian vacationers were sitting on the beaches side by side it hurt the business of the surrounding yishuvim [ Jewish communities ] . "
Mr Karbel added : " In a conversation I later had with the Brigade Commander , he told me that he could come up with or find a security justification if he needed to . "
From Ein Gedi southwards , the beaches on the Dead Sea 's western side are in sovereign Israeli territory .
But the popular beaches of the northern Dead Sea are Israeli-run and visitors could easily – but erroneously – imagine they are also in Israel rather than in occupied territory .
In April this year , the British Advertising Standards Authority required the Israel Ministry of Tourism to alter the wording of an advertisement suggesting that Qumran , close to the northern shore , and the site of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls , was in Israel .
In the Acri petition , Ms Yehuda says : " The illegality of the actions and orders of the army cries out to the heavens .
This is a clear case of misusing security considerations as camouflage for achieving other goals which are unrelated to security matters and unacceptable . "
Israel has also been criticised for segregating roads used by Israeli motorists in the West Bank for stated reasons of security .
Israeli officials reject claims that this is racial discrimination , partly because Arabs with Israeli citizenship are permitted to use the roads .
They also frequent the Dead Sea beaches .
The Israeli military declined to comment in detail while judicial proceedings are under way , but said in a statement that " the network of security crossings in the West Bank was erected in response to the extreme terrorist threat and violence during the second intifada . "
Since the violence had " ebbed " crossings were " under review " .
Mark Uemura ( mtu@ ) , back by popular demand , has been gracious enough to share his experiences at c2k8 , The OpenBSD General Hackathon in Edmonton .
Here is his first summary :
The c2k8 hackathon is now over but tremors of the week long earthquake that hit cvs are still being felt from Theo 's dinner table .
That is what hackathons do .
They are like fuel tanks that keep OpenBSD development moving forward and the Big Hackathon held annually is like a boost of nitrous oxide .
Mark 's continues below .
In the n2k8 series , I mentioned that there are many individuals that I follow on misc@ .
They are like heroes on the OpenBSD stage and people that I admire for what they have done in OpenBSD and for the community .
Otto Moerbeek ( otto@ ) is one of those guys .
Theo has spoken very highly of Otto in the past and ever since then , I 've paid closer attention to what Otto has to say on misc@ and what he has done in OpenBSD .
His most recent work on ffs2 support in OpenBSD is really impressive .
With drives getting bigger and cheaper , large partitions are becoming that much more important .
I 'm sure that I can speak for everyone and say , " We really appreciate your work ! " .
Here is what this kind and polite gentleman had to say about this work at the c2k8 hackathon :
malloc ( 3 ) .
Actually , most of the work on malloc has been done in the last two years : first lots of studying of the current malloc and thinking how to improve it .
Then , spread over some months , I did implement it at home and here in Edmonton I worked on the final pieces .
The problem with current malloc is that its main datastructure ( the page directory ) originally was designed to deal with contiguous memory as obtained by sbrk ( 2 ) .
Some years ago , it was adapted to use mmap ( 2 ) , which on OpenBSD returns pages with random addresses .
The page directory does not handle that well : its overhead , both in time and memory usage , for random page addresses is pretty bad .
The new malloc implementation ( omalloc for short ) uses a page directory which does not degrade when handling random page addresses .
It also handles various edge cases better : it never needs memory to free memory .
It also randomizes sub - page sized allocations by default ; the current malloc only does that when the ' G " options is used .
I knew there was room for improvement , but I was pretty amazed that omalloc improves performance by tens of percents in some cases .
The code is also quite a bit smaller and cleaner , in my opinion .
bbq , beer and being able to work full time on things I like 100 % ) is that these suggestions could be discussed face to face , immediately , and so I was able to finish omalloc in far less time than I expected .
Of course omalloc needs more testing , if you are running - current ( and only - current ! ) , you can help by giving the latest version a spin .
The other thing I worked on is fsck_ffs ( 8 ) for really large filesystems .
fsck_ffs needs to store a few bytes of data about each inode in the filesystem being checked .
Depending on the limitations of the platform , this means that filesystems having lots of inodes cannot be checked .
Using a diff originally started by Dale Rahn ( drahn@ ) , I could reduce memory consumption by 20 % .
This diff has been committed .
I am also working on a diff to actually not store all inode data in memory simultaneously ; but this work is not yet ready .
Although , in a certain test setup , I could reduce memory usage by a factor of 4 -- and there 's more to be gained .
One of the small things I worked on with Ken Westerback ( krw@ ) is disklabel ( 8 ) .
We are taking steps to make it present less confusing data in interactive editing mode to make it more understandable .
This is also work in progress : it needs more tweaking before it hits the tree .
The hackathon has been fun and fruitful for me !
He has done quite a lot of work with Jordan Hargrave ( jordan@ ) and others to make ACPI work on OpenBSD for those poor souls that do not have an X40 and can't suspend . ;-)
I brought along my evil ACPI machine , a Sony UX series computer , so that Marco could iron out some more issues with ACPI .
I thought that it would eventually be a potential Zaurus replacement .
Theo bought two of them last year to give to developers mainly because of the ACPI .
Needless to say , it is pretty nicely supported now thanks to Marco and Jordan .
Here is what Marco had to say about his time at the c2k8 hackathon :
softraid crypto implementation while djm@ added a new crypto algorithm that should work a whole lot better for block devices ( AES - XTS ) .
hshoexer@ pushed me to finally implement the delete softraid volume and thanks to that activity , I found an ancient bug that had been plaguing us ( disks are shut down normally yet , they complain that they have unclean metadata upon reboot ) .
The other large project I started working on is rewriting the softraid metadata from scratch because we want to be able to deal with foreign metadata .
Since it needs a rewrite , djm@ and I completely rewrote the softraid on - disk format .
I am dealing with the fallout of that which is quite the task .
This will keep me busy for weeks to come .

Hong Kong Flooded After Worst Rain in 124 Years
Today residents in Hong Kong woke up to find over half their city under water , having received its worst rain in over 124 years .
The rain was so bad that over 8,000 lighting strikes were recorded and at one point over 5.7 inches of rain fell in a single hour , a record high since 1884 .
The nonstop rain also caused numerous mud slides , like the one below , that poured onto highways and trapping vehicles .
The airport freeway was completely flooded , and over 400 flights were delayed or cancelled .
Flooded stores were forced to watch their products float away or get ruined by the water .
Many residents , like the girl below , found themselves trapped waist deep in the floods .
The raging water was so dangerous , policemen had to use ropes to help locals cross the street .
The forecast shows that the rain should die down in the next few days but until it does , residents in Hong Kong are in for a long wet weekend .

A security researcher has developed malicious rootkit software for Cisco Systems ' routers , a development that has placed increasing scrutiny on the routers that carry the majority of the Internet 's traffic .
Sebastian Muniz , a researcher with Core Security Technologies , developed the software , which he will unveil on May 22 at the EuSecWest conference in London .
Rootkits are stealthy programs that cover up their tracks on a computer , making them extremely hard to detect .
To date , the vast majority of rootkits have been written for the Windows operating system , but this will mark the first time that someone has discussed a rootkit written for IOS , the Internetwork Operating System used by Cisco 's routers .
" An IOS rootkit is able to perform the tasks that any other rootkit would do on desktop computer operating systems , " Muniz said in an e-mail interview .
Rootkits are typically used to install key - logging software as well as programs that allow attackers to remotely connect with the infected system .
However , the most notorious rootkit of all , distributed by Sony BMG Music , stopped unauthorized CD copying .
A Cisco rootkit is particularly worrisome because , like Microsoft 's Windows , Cisco 's routers are very widely used .
Cisco owned nearly two - thirds of the router market in the fourth quarter of 2007 , according to research firm IDC .
In the past , researchers have built malicious software , known as " IOS patching shellcode , " that could compromise a Cisco router , but those programs are custom - written to work with one specific version of IOS .
Muniz 's rootkit will be different .
" It could work on several different versions of IOS , " he said .
The software cannot be used to break into a Cisco router -- an attacker would need to have some kind of attack code , or an administrative password on the router to install the rootkit , but once installed it can be used to silently monitor and control the device .
The rootkit runs in the router 's flash memory , which contains the first commands that it uses to boot up , said EuSecWest conference organizer Dragos Ruiu .
Muniz said he has no plans to release the source code for his rootkit , but he wants to explain how he built it to counter the widespread perception that Cisco routers are somehow immune to this type of malware .
" I 've done this with the purpose of showing that IOS rootkits are real , and that appropriate security measures must be taken , " he said .
Security researcher Mike Lynn offered a similar rationalization for his controversial 2005 Black Hack presentation showing how to hack into a Cisco router and run a small " shellcode " program .
Lynn 's presentation was " very shocking because , until then , nobody thought you could actually build exploits for Cisco , " Ruiu said .
" This rootkit is the next step . "
Within hours of his 2005 Black Hat talk , Lynn was sued by Cisco , which claimed he had exposed trade secrets in violation of his Cisco end - user license agreement .
Cisco 's suit was quickly settled , but Muniz and his employer clearly have Lynn 's experience in mind as they ready for next week 's conference .
They declined to provide technical details on the presentation ahead of time .
" We 're still in the process of putting the whole presentation together , and we also need to work with Cisco before we talk to anybody , " a Core spokesman said .
" The big concern is making sure that everything is cool with Cisco . "
Cisco declined to comment for this story .
Jennifer Granick , the Electronic Freedom Foundation lawyer who represented Lynn in 2005 , said that Cisco could bring these trade - secret claims against Muniz , but because the technical community reacted so negatively to the 2005 lawsuit , she believes that this may not happen .
" Cisco thinks of itself as really researcher - friendly , " she said .
" I think they will be very careful before filing legal action . "
Still , the rootkit comes at a sensitive time for Cisco .
Last week , the New York Times reported that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation considers the problem of fake Cisco gear a critical U.S. infrastructure threat .
In late February the FBI culminated a two - year investigation by breaking up a counterfeit Cisco distribution network and seizing an estimated US $ 3.5 million worth of components manufactured in China .
According to an FBI presentation on Operation Cisco Raider , fake Cisco routers , switches and cards were sold to the U.S. Navy , the U.S. Marine Corps. , the U.S. Air Force , the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration , and even the FBI itself .
The U.S. Department of Defense has expressed concerns that the lack of security in the microelectronics supply chain could threaten the country 's defense systems , and the idea that an attacker could sneak a rootkit onto a counterfeit Cisco system has security experts worried .
Cisco routers are typically compromised by hackers who are able to guess their administrative passwords , said Johannes Ullrich , chief research officer with the SANS Institute .
But there are few tools around to check these systems for signs of hacking .
" How would you find out ? " he said .
" That 's the big problem . "
Online - Durchsuchung in Bayern : O'zapft is !
Radikaler noch als Wolfgang Schäuble : Bei der Einführung der Onlinedurchsuchung ist Bayern schneller als der Bund - und geht viel weiter .
FREIBURG taz Bayern stellt Bundesinnenminister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) in den Schatten .
Während über das BKA - Gesetz noch diskutiert wird , will der CSU - dominierte Bayerische Landtag bereits in dieser Woche die Online - Durchsuchung für Landespolizei und Landesverfassungsschutz einführen .
Ende Februar hat das Bundesverfassungsgericht grünes Licht für die heimliche Ausspähung von Computern gegeben .
Jetzt werden auf verschiedener Ebene entsprechende Gesetze geplant .
Die Öffentlichkeit interessiert sich dabei vor allem für die Änderung des BKA - Gesetzes .
Das Bundeskriminalamt soll hier erstmals präventive Befugnisse , inklusive das Recht zur Online - Durchsuchung , erhalten .
Das Gesetz soll Ende des Jahres beschlossen werden .
Doch Bayern ist schneller .
Schon Donnerstag sollen die Sicherheitsbehörden des Freistaats neue Befugnisse zum heimlichen Zugriff auf private Computer bekommen .
Die Pläne von CSU und Landesregierung gehen dabei weit über Schäubles Vorhaben hinaus .
So will Bayern seiner Polizei erlauben , auch in Wohnungen einzubrechen , um Spionage - Software auf dem Rechner eines Verdächtigen zu installieren .
Das BKA muss Späh - Trojaner via Internet auf verdächtige Rechner bugsieren .
Während das BKA die Onlinedurchsuchung nur zur Abwehr internationaler Terrorgefahren einsetzen darf , gilt diese Beschränkung für die bayerische Landespolizei nicht .
Sie kann bei jeder dringenden Gefahr für den Staat sowie Leib , Leben und Freiheit von Personen eingesetzt werden .
Die Bayernpolizei soll Daten aus privaten Computern zudem nicht nur kopieren , sondern auch verändern und löschen dürfen .
Neue Befugnisse erhält in Bayern aber nicht nur die Polizei , sondern auch der Verfassungsschutz .
Wie vom Bundesverfassungsgericht verlangt , soll auch der Nachrichtendienst nur eingreifen können , wenn es Anhaltspunkte einer konkrete Gefahr für " überragend wichtige " Rechtsgüter gibt .
Die Landesregierung räumt ein , dass dies eigentlich ein Fall für die Polizei ist , doch bekomme der Verfassungsschutz oft Hinweise von Geheimdiensten aus dem Ausland , die er der Polizei aus Gründen des Quellenschutzes nicht weitergeben darf .
Am Freitag will Bayern auch Einfluss auf die Bundespolitik nehmen .
Dann wird der Bundesrat über einen Gesetzentwurf des Freistaats abstimmen , mit dem die Onlinedurchsuchung auch in der Strafprozessordnung eingeführt werden soll .
Computer könnten dann auch zur Strafverfolgung heimlich ausgeforscht werden .
Den Bayern geht es neben Terror auch um Mord , Raub und Kinderpornografie .
Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) prüft noch , ob sie auch eine Änderung der Strafprozessordnung vorschlägt .
交通事故に遭ってしまった場合、保険会社に示談交渉を依頼しても望む結果が得られないことがあります。また自分に事故の非が全く無い場合、すなわち過失割合がゼロの被害者になった場合、保険会社に交渉の代理を依頼することができません。自分で交渉できないときには弁護士に交渉や訴訟の代理を依頼する必要があります。弁護士費用は高額であることが知られていますが、どれくらいかかるものなのでしょうか？
交通事故の示談交渉や訴訟で弁護士に払う費用と「報酬」の定義について
弁護士に交渉を依頼した場合、事前事後に相談料・着手金・日当など様々な費用を支払わなければなりません。こうした費用は報酬とは異なるので注意しましょう。依頼するかどうか決める前に弁護士に相談する際には、相談料が発生します。
一般には30分で5千円が相場となっていますが、弁護士が自由に決めて良いことになっています。新司法試験の導入により弁護士の数が増加したため、顧客獲得競争が激化していることから相談料を無料とする法律事務所も増えています。
弁護士に交渉を依頼する際には委任契約を結びますが、この委任契約は双方のどちらからでも解除することが認められています。着手金は委任契約を締結する際に弁護士が受け取るもので、事件解決に至らないうちに解除されても返金されません。
着手金は予想される賠償額を基に算定されることが多く、紛争の内容によってその額は異なります。着手金が無料の弁護士も増えていますが、履行途中に委任者が解除した場合、受任者たる弁護士から違約金を請求されることがあるので注意しましょう。
また、弁護士が裁判所に赴く場合などに日当を払う必要があります。前日か半日かによってもその額は変わってきます。以上の相談料・着手金・日当などの費用を含まない報酬とは、依頼者の望む結果が得られた場合に弁護士に対して支払う成功報酬のことです。
したがって、弁護士が尽力したにも関わらず依頼者の希望する賠償を得られなかったときは、弁護士は報酬を受け取ることができません。参考資料>>弁護士法人アディーレ法律事務所
... 交通事故法律
ただし、弁護士の尽力によってほぼ解決の見通しが立っているにも関わらず、依頼者が報酬の支払いを渋って勝手に相手と和解を成立させてしまった場合などは「みなし成功報酬」と言って弁護士に成功報酬を支払わなければならないこともあります。
報酬の額は自由に決められることになっており、依頼者は弁護士から請求された報酬を支払う必要があります。
弁護士の報酬に基準はあるのでしょうか？
弁護士が報酬の額を自由に決められるといっても、実際には一定の基準に従って定められる額を請求するのが通常です。弁護士が準拠とする一定の基準とは、日弁連が定めていた報酬基準のことです。日弁連の旧報酬基準に従った報酬額を決めている弁護士から法外な額を請求されるおそれがないので、顧客は安心して依頼することができます。
弁護士はこの基準に従う義務はありませんが、社会的に相当とされる日弁連の基準を参考にすることによって顧客からの信頼を得る努力をしているのです。
報酬を決める際に基準となる 「 経済的利益」について
交通事故の示談交渉や訴訟で依頼人が得られる「経済的利益」の額によって、弁護士の報酬は定まることになります。この「経済的利益」とは何を指すのでしょうか？一般には相手から受け取る賠償額全体がこれに当たるとされています。
加害者から支払われた賠償額のうち、一定の割合を報酬として受け取るということです。しかしながら、この賠償額が予め加害者側の保険会社から提示されていた場合を想定してみましょう。この額を不服として弁護士に増額の交渉を依頼したら、元々もらえる分に加えて増加した額のみを「経済的利益」と考えることもできます。
弁護士の交渉による増加分のみを「経済的利益」とすると、報酬は賠償額全体を「経済的利益」とする場合に比べて少なくなります。「経済的利益」をどちらにするかは依頼人と弁護士の契約内容によって定まるので、依頼人は「経済的利益」が何を指すか確認しなければなりません。
因みに日弁連の旧報酬規定によると「経済的利益」とは賠償額全体を指すとされていました。
報酬額の具体的基準とは？
示談交渉で賠償額について和解が成立せず、訴訟に至った場合には弁護士の負担も増えるので、報酬も増えることになります。
日弁連の旧報酬規定によると、 「経済的利益」が300万円以下なら16％、300万円を超えて3千万円以下の場合には賠償額の10パーセントに加え18万円、3千万円を超えて3億円以下の場合には6パーセントに加え138万円、3億円を超えたら4パーセントに加え738万円という基準が定められていました。
先述したとおり弁護士はこの規定に拘束されませんが、依然としてこの基準を参考にして報酬額を定めている法律事務所が多く見られます。訴訟事件に至らず、示談交渉で和解が成立した場合の報酬基準も、日弁連の旧報酬基準を参考にして決められる場合が多いです。
和解によって得られる 「 経済的利益」のうち一定の割合を報酬として受け取ることができますが、示談交渉だけで賠償にこぎつけられた場合には弁護士の負担も少ないので、訴訟事件の報酬額の3分の2に減額することが認められています。
いずれにせよ、旧報酬規定通りではなく、ある程度独自の基準を提示する法律事務所も少なくありません。訴訟事件も示談交渉のみの場合も、「経済的利益」の額に関わらず損害賠償額の10パーセントに20万円を加えた額を一律の基準とする法律事務所が増えています。
弁護士費用特約について
自動車の任意保険には弁護士費用特約が附帯されているものが少なくありません。弁護士費用特約があれば弁護士費用を保険会社が払ってくれるので、弁護士に払う報酬額を気にすることなく依頼することができます。弁護士費用特約には保険会社が弁護士を紹介してくれるものもありますが、当事者が自分で選んだ弁護士の費用を負担してくれることが多いので大変便利と言えるでしょう。
ただし、一般的には損害賠償額が1800万円を超えると特約のカバーでは足りず、保険加入者にも弁護士費用の負担が生じることになります。弁護士費用特約を利用すると、損害賠償額の10パーセントに20万円を加えた額を基準とせず、日弁連の旧報酬規定に基づく報酬体系を利用する場合が多いです。
保険会社が支払う弁護士費用の基準が、日弁連の旧報酬規定を準拠としている場合がほとんどだからです。一般的な保険では弁護士費用は上限300万円とされています。弁護士費用特約を利用しても等級が下がることはなく、翌年から保険料が上がることはありません。
I ’m “ live blogging ” from the One Laptop Per Child Foundation ’s day - long media event at the MIT Media Lab .
The big news is that OLPC founder Nicholas Negrponte has just unveiled the design for the foundation ’s second - generation laptop , which is n’t really a laptop at all but a double - screened , fold - up electronic book .
Below are five shots of Negroponte ’s presentation taken with my iPhone .
[ Update 4:15 pm 5/20/08 :
And below those are three high - resolution images that OLPC sent out to the media after the presentation . ]
Negroponte says the cost of this 2nd - generation device , which uses dual - touch screens with 16:9 aspect ratios , will be kept to $ 75 .
( Compare that to the $ 188 cost of the foundation ’s current first - generation XO laptop . )
Costs will be kept down in part by using screens built for portable DVD players , which are rapidly coming down in price , Negroponte says .
“ The reason you can have the audacity to do this is that the 16:9 displays on DVD players are so inexpensive that to anticipate them costing $ 20 each is not out of the question , ” he says .
The book - like design of the device “ comes from something we ’ve learned over the past couple of years — that the book experience is key , ” Negroponte said during his presentation this morning .
“ Some people have asked me why not just give kids cell phones ?
And in fact there will be 1.2 billion cell phones manufactured this year , and cell phones are of huge consequence in the developing world — but the cell phone is not a learning device .
The next generation laptop should be a book . ”
Negroponte said the foundation plans to bring out the second - generation device by 2010 .
By that time , he added , the cost of the original XO Laptop will also have been brought below $ 100 .
Click on the images below to see larger versions .
UPDATE 4:15 pm 05/20/08
Okay , we ’ve got the official high - res versions of three of the XO 2.0 images now .
As before , click on the thumbnails below for larger versions .
Addendum 4:30 pm 5/20/08
I ’m back at the office , and wanted to add a few more details .
In a press release issued shortly after Negroponte ’s presentation , OLPC said that key goals for the so - called XO - 2 computer include the aforementioned $ 75 price tag ; power consumption of 1 watt , reducing the amount of time required for children in unelectrified areas to generate power manually ; a smaller footprint ( the XO - 2 is about half the size of the XO ) so that the device is easier to carry to and from school ; and an “ enhanced book experience ” that resembles the right and left pages of a book in vertical format , a laptop in hinged horizontal format , and a flat continuous tablet in flat two - screen format .
The dual touchscreen display is being designed by Pixel Qi , the hardware design firm founded by former OLPC CTO Mary Lou Jepsen .
OLPC also said that a new version of the original XO laptop , called XO - 1.5 , will be released in the spring of 2009 “ with the same design as the first generation but with fewer physical parts and at a lower cost than XO - 1 . ”

Passing parameters to JavaScript functions seems simple enough .
Since the language is weakly - typed , all the parameters in the call are simply comma-separated .
And in the definition of the function it can get no more complicated than that–a comma-separated list of parameters .
Not much room for flexibility , is there ?
But let ’s take a closer look .
Suppose you do n’t pass all the parameters that a function is expecting .
What happens ?
If you shortchange a function , all the parameters you failed to supply are undefined .
What happens if you give more parameters than the function expects ?
They are ignored , but you can find they are still accessible in an array - like list called arguments .
( No , it ’s not an array .
While it does have a length , it ’s missing the methods that come with arrays . )
Now What ?
So we ’ve revealed a bit of flexibility –JavaScript wo n’t come to a screaming halt if you supply more or less parameters than a function expects .
It ’s more flexible in handling parameters than we might have suspected .
Some languages allow you to specify default parameters .
Can JavaScript do that ?
Well , it ’s not in the spec , but JavaScript programmers commonly provide default parameters using JavaScript ’s || operator .
a = a || 1 ;
If a is undefined , a will be assigned 1 .
A will also be assigned 1 if a is 0 .
That ’s not always what you want , so sometimes a condition is best :
if ( a===undefined ) { a=1 ; }
Let ’s try one .
We ’ll make a function that takes three parameters .
a will have the default value of 1
b will have the default value of 2
c will have the default value of 3
function test ( a , b, c ) { a=a| |1 ; b=b||2 ; c=c||3 ; console.log ( a , b, c ) ; }
We can call it like this :
test ( 1,2,5 ) ; test ( undefined , 3, undefined ) ; test ( ) ;
And get output like this :
1,2,5 1,3,3 1,2,3
If you have a lot of parameters coming in , that can get messy fast .
Is there a better way ?
There Is a Better Way
More than a few programmers have taken a stab at providing a nice default parameter implementation , and JavaScript is flexible enough to provide many ways to do it .
Most of these solutions feel over - engineered to me , so I spent some time thinking about the problem and came up with my own solution .
I wrote a function called defaultHandler .
This is going to be easy !
Take a look :
defaultHandler=function ( defaults , params ) { var i ; for ( i in params ) { defaults [ i] =params [ i ] ; } return defaults ; }
We start with the “ defaults ” object that was passed in .
Obviously , this holds all the default values for the parameters we expect to get passed in .
Then we spin through everything that was passed in as a parameter and add it to the defaults , overwriting values when we run into identical keys .
Simple .
Too simple , perhaps .
The trick must be in how we use it .
Is that it ?
Well , here ’s an example .
function test ( obj ) { var params=defaultHandler({a:1, b:2,c:3} , obj ) ; console.log ( params ) ; }
Hmm .
Not much going on there , either .
I told you this was going to be easy !
Here , I call our test function :
test ( {a : 5 , x:" tuna "} ) ; test ( {} ) ; test ( {b:10 , y:5} ) ;
And get the following output :
Object a=5 b=2 c=3 x=tuna Object a=1 b=2 c=3 Object a=1 b=10 c=3 y=5
That ’s all there is to it .
Instead of passing parameters , we always pass in one single object that holds all the parameters .
In effect , we ’re ignoring JavaScript ’s “ almost an array , but not really ” parameter - passing system , and using a full - blown object to do the parameter passing work .
Since objects can hold anything ( numbers , booleans , arrays , objects , functions , probably even regex descriptions ) , nothing has changed except the packaging and naming of parameters .
And we ’ve gained tons of flexibility .
Come to think of it , you do n’t even really need the default handler .
That ’s just a nice way of pruning down the parameters which need to be passed .
Why Would I Do This ?
Imagine you ’ve written an operating system .
It has a nice windowing user interface .
You have function calls like “ OpenWindow ” that take some parameters .
In a later version of the interface you want to start adding parameters to the function .
It can get messy .
You want to keep backwards compatibility so old applications do n’t break .
So maybe you have a slew of new functions like “ NewOpenWindow . ”
Then you come out with another revision and you want to add still more parameters .
When it gets silly enough , you look for another solution .
The Amiga guys solved this problem with taglists .
Taglists were much like an object–a list of names and corresponding values .
You only supply the parameters you want to .
That was the first time I saw this sort of solution .
They added an OpenWindowTags ( ) function and that solved the problem forever .
Unfortunately , in the case of the Amiga , “ forever ” did n’t last very long .
It ’s a great solution for APIs of JavaScript libraries .
You can add new stuff in the future without breaking any old calls to your library .
A good rule of thumb is to use JavaScript ’s normal parameter conventions whenever the number of parameters are small and it ’s inconceivable that they might change .
Otherwise , pass in an object .
We 're not sure if these plans will ever make it to reality , but the Telegraph is reporting that Britain 's Home Office is working on database designed to store the details of every phone call , email , and web page accessed by British citizens in the previous year .
The idea is to have various telecom providers hand over their records , which will all go into the database and then be accessible by police upon receipt of a court order .
Of course , there 's no reason why police could n't simply ask the ISPs for the appropriate data when they get that court order , since records are already required to be kept for a year , but sometimes it 's important for a government to build a massive scary database of personal information with endless potential for abuse by embittered low - level bureaucrats , you know ?
The plan is still in draft stages , so hopefully it dies on the table -- and if not , well , the NSA welcomes you with open arms , British expats .

McCain 's Role in the WMD Cover up
John McCain and Charlie Black ’s War
How a Senator and a Lobbyist Led the Deception Campaign
that Tricked the U.S .
By Mark G. Levey Part 2 , Part 3
Who ’s responsible for the “ intelligence failure ” that plunged the U.S. into the Iraq War ?
As much as anyone else , that distinction is shared by two Americans who discovered and nurtured Ahmad Chalabi and “ Curveball ” , and pushed their fortunes in Washington .
One of those men is currently the presumptive Republican candidate for President of the United States , and the other is his chief political fixer .
This is the story about how they did it , and then shifted the spotlight of intelligence failure , political scandal , and criminal conspiracy off themselves .
***
Here are some key events to keep in mind as the Iraq War deception unfolds :
1998 -2003 - John McCain enthusiastically espoused the delusion about cheap and easy Middle East wars , and sponsored Ahmed Chalabi ’s Iraqi National Congress ( I.N.C. ) organization , even though the CIA had cut it off for producing faulty intelligence .
1998 - McCain was a co-sponsor of the Iraq Liberation
Act that led to the creation of a false intelligence factory that replaced CIA Iraq reporting .
He led charges in the Senate about Iraqi WMD programs that U.S. intelligence was reporting did n’t exist .
2001 -2003 - Using $ 100 million allocated by the Act cosponsored by McCain , Ahmed Chalabi’s I.N.C. generated the false intelligence about nonexistent mobile bioweapons labs cited as part of the case for the Iraq invasion .
I.N.C. Chalabi ’s group was paid $ 335,000 a month in the lead - up to the Iraq war to gather intelligence .
2003 - McCain and four other Republican Senators made an appeal to Bush to “ personally clear the bureaucratic roadblocks within the State Department ” that stood in the way of even more funding for the I.N.C. McCain acted as a character witness for Chalabi , stating “ He ’s a patriot who has the best interests of his country at heart . ”
Prior to advocating in favor of the October , 2002 Iraq War Resolution , McCain read the classified CIA National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , and was briefed on multiple occasions about it .
While he knew that U.S. intelligence was split over Iraq WMDs , McCain never said anything publicly about the other view contained in the classified documents in which he had been given special access .
05/03 – present - Even after the Iraq WMD deception and failed occupation became clear , McCain has refused to acknowledge that he had been wrong all along about the justifications for the Iraq War , and says he would vote again for that war , and again vote to fund Chalabi .
Senator McCain still avoids taking responsibility for his role in the Iraq intelligence failure , perhaps for no better reason than he kept some distance between himself and operatives at the Pentagon and in the Office of the Vice President who actually carried out the policy , some of whom were later convicted of espionage and related charges .
1997 - present - The McCain campaign ’s chief publicist , Charlie Black , a powerful GOP lobbyist , has protected and promoted the cause of Ahmad Chalabi’s I.N.C. organization in Washington since 1997 , and also played a major role in spreading I.N.C. disinformation .
1997 - present – As the Iraq War plan developed , Black ’s lobbying firm has received hundreds of millions from U.S. companies doing Iraq
War related business , a substantial portion of the profits from which Black has funneled back to McCain and other prominent GOP leaders
Iraq War : Made in the USA
The conventional telling of the Iraq War story starts and stops with a motley group of exiled Iraqi businessmen , dissident scientists and professional conmen associated with the Iraqi National Congress ( I.N.C. ) .
Most Americans instantly recognize only two names in connection with the Iraq WMD “ intelligence failure ” : Ahmad Chalabi , the group ’s leader and “ Curveball ” , an engineer who claimed to have been working inside Saddam Hussein ’s biological weapons programs at the time of his defection to Germany in 1998 .
The I.N.C. exiles are often portrayed as masters of deception who by their own home - made ingenuity cooked up the raw intelligence that tricked much of the Washington establishment .
We are expected to believe that , they alone , made Senators and spies believe – incorrectly -- that Saddam Hussein had WMDs , and “ mushroom clouds ” would soon be seen over American cities .
The story being told about Saddam Hussein ’s WMD was , of course , a lie .
And , the easiest thing to do after it was found out was to attach blame for the “ intelligence failure ” onto a shady cell of foreign outcasts and Arabic - speaking oddballs bearing false documents and phony eyewitness accounts .
The truth is , the Iraq “ intelligence failure ” was more than anything else a case of deliberate and willful self - deception and bullying by a group of powerful Washington insiders – led by Vice President Dick Cheney , along with John McCain on Capitol Hill , and Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon -- who wanted to demonstrate that they , rather than the professional military and CIA , knew best how to start , fight , and ( they thought ) quickly and easily win wars in the Middle East .
Second only to scapegoating Iraqis , the official Washington narrative contains another deceptive subtext : everyone wants to pretend the Iraq WMD operation was somehow free of any partisan motivation .
That too , as we shall see , is a g -d damned lie , papered over by the active participation of neoconservative Democrats , particularly Joe Lieberman .
Ranking GOP Senators and Congressmen , along with their aides and allies in the network of conservative Republican dominated think - tanks and lobbying shops were instrumental in creating I.N.C. , and keeping it generously funded during the 1990s until the disaster in Iraq was fully realized in 2005 .
In starkest , bottom - line terms , the U.S. went to war in 2003 as the result of frustration by GOP Congressional leaders and neoconservative operatives at what they viewed as the Clinton Administration ’s refusal to “ finish off ” Saddam Hussein .
Starting in 1992 , when George H.W. Bush was defeated , lobbying started for regime change in Baghdad .
Of course , Bush , Sr. and his advisors had quite intentionally avoided overthrowing Saddam .
In 1991 , then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was quoted by the New York Times as saying ,
If you 're going to go in and try to topple Saddam Hussein , you have to go to Baghdad .
Once you 've got Baghdad , it 's not clear what you do with it .
It 's not clear what kind of government you would put in place of the one that 's currently there now .
Is it going to be a Shia regime , a Sunni regime or a Kurdish regime ?
Or one that tilts toward the Baathists , or one that tilts toward the Islamic fundamentalists ?
How much credibility is that government going to have if it 's set up by the United States military when it 's there ?
How long does the United States military have to stay to protect the people that sign on for that government , and what happens to it once we leave ?
Nonetheless , almost immediately after Clinton took office , voices were raised calling for regime change .
Conservative critics in Washington intensified their crusade in the second term as Hussein retained his grasp despite sanctions and periodic air strikes against of his remaining defenses in Operation Desert Fox .
In 1997 , after a failed uprising and incompetent coup attempt launched by Chalabi ’s orders , against the advice of U.S. officials , the CIA cut - off I.N.C .
As Robert Baer , who was the CIA officer on the ground in Iraq , Chalabi essentially sacrificed the Kurdish resistance in defiance of Clinton ’s National Security Advisor Anthony Lake .
The response of the Washington political establishment was passage in 1998 of the Iraq Liberation Act , which mandated even greater spending on I.N.C. and six other opposition groups .
During hearings on the Iraq Liberation Act , a parade of ranking U.S. military and intelligence officers led by Gen , Anthony Zinni clearly warned Congress of the dangers and futility of the plan to overthrow Saddam ’s government by “ regime change ” .
Leading the charge on Capitol Hill was Senator McCain , along with his colleague , Joseph Lieberman , both vociferous advocates of regime change , focusing from an early date on the danger they described about Iraq ’ arsenal of Weapons of Mass Destruction .
Here ’s McCain and Lieberman at a January 28 , 1999 hearing :
Sen . McCain also pressed Zinni as to what Operation Desert Fox had
achieved , asking about Iraq 's chemical and biological weapons programs ,
" How much has that been set back ? "
Zinni replied , " We did n't attack
that .
That 's very difficult because many of the plants that could
produce that are pharmaceutical plants or agricultural chemical
production plants .
It 's easy in dual - use facilities like that , to
produce it .
Biological it 's even less difficult in labs . "
McCain asked , " So conceivably they could continue their development
of biological and chemical weapons , put it on a Scud missile and attack
Israel ? " Zinni replied , " That 's possible , yes , sir . "
Sen. Lieberman said , " The report that Mr. Butler of UNSCOM
submitted to the Security Council earlier this week just confirms all of
our fears that Saddam and Iraq remain a threat , that they have weapons
of mass destruction and capability to deliver them , and it gives -- it
should give all of us a sense of real urgency about trying to deal with
this problem and him , particularly . "
Global Security
That 's the political background against which one may understand , why , from Day One , the incoming Bush - Cheney White House was obsessed with invading Iraq .
By a number of informed accounts , Iraq was all that Bush 's national security team could think and talk about , ignoring expert advice to protect the country against other known threats , such as al - Qaeda cells inside the U.S .
Where Cheney and others could not find sufficient justification in intelligence findings to sell Congress and the UN on invading a sovereign country – a legal nicety that still could not be ignored , even after 9/11 – these officials were quite happy to have evidence manufactured for them by Chalabi ’s network , and to loot the U.S. Treasury to pay for it .
Those intelligence officers who questioned the construction within the Pentagon and CIA of elaborate stovepipes and “ cells ” generating falsified data were pushed aside , and those career officers , such as CIA officer Valerie Plame and Lt. Col .
Karen Kwaitowski at DIA , who visibly resisted , had their programs and careers destroyed .
But , the story about the I.N.C. - OSP - OVP pipeline has been often told .
What still needs to be examined – what avert their eyes from – is the part played by key Members of Congress , including John McCain , in laying the groundwork and funding the Iraq intelligence deception .
John McCain was certainly at the center of this .
During the lead - up to the invasion of Iraq , he was Chairman or Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Commerce Committee , as well as a sitting Member on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
He used his particular credibility and influence with the U.S. military to sell a fraudulent intelligence product .
Indeed , the principal cause of the “ intelligence failure ” behind the Iraq war is much closer to home than is officially acknowledged , and the chief culprits speak imperfect English with an American Mid-western and Dixie accents .
Among public office holders , the chief sponsors for Chalabi ’s Iraqi National Congress in the years leading up to the 2003 invasion was a group of GOP leaders and Congressional Committee heads , including Tent Lott , Newt Gingrich , and John McCain .
In October , 1998 , after the CIA cut its funding of Chalabi ’s group because it was producing unreliable intelligence and a series of disastrous failed rebellions inside Iraq , Congress passed the Iraq Liberation Act , handing the I.N.C. $ 97 million to overthrow Saddam Hussein .
The funding attached to this Bill , which John McCain co-sponsored , was based on little more than a vaguely defined plan to carry out “ regime change ” , a plan that Chalabi scratched out with a group of neoconservatives working at Washington and Jerusalem think - tanks .
McCain ’s other role as a propagandist during the lead up to the Iraq War has also been soft - peddled and largely forgotten in recent years , since attention has focused on the middle to endgame “ Surge ” , for which he is , also , provides the face .
McCain , among others in Congress , repeated without reservation that Saddam Hussein threatened the American heartland with WMD .
McCain read the classified version of the October 2002 CIA NIE on Iraq , yet never even hinted at the fact that U.S. intelligence was far from unanimous that Iraq had mobile bioweapons trailers and uranium enrichment facilities claimed by the Bush Administration .
According to Politico , Link
John McCain , whose spokeswoman , Eileen McMenamin , e-mails that " Sen. McCain was briefed on the NIE numerous times and read the Executive Summary . "
Furthermore , John McCain betrayed the special trust that many Americans had in him .
McCain had a practically unique claim to military expertise combined with a sense of moral certainty about him that many , especially in the military , found unusually compelling .
He often repeated in terms of Puritan clarity that the invasion of Iraq was a necessary and just war to “ disarm ” Saddam , a message that worked like a charm .
In a New York Times op - ed , “ The Right War for the Right Reasons ” , John McCain wrote on March 12 , 2003 , a week before the invasion : New York Times
" American armed forces will likely soon begin to disarm Iraq by destroying the regime of Saddam Hussein .
We do not know whether they will have the explicit authorization of veto - wielding members of the United Nations Security Council .
But either way , the men and women ordered to undertake this mission can take pride in the justice of their cause .
" Critics argue that the military destruction of Saddam Hussein 's regime would be , in a word , unjust .
This opposition has coalesced around a set of principles of '' just war '' -- principles that they feel would be violated if the United States used force against Iraq .
" The main contention is that we have not exhausted all nonviolent means to encourage Iraq 's disarmament .
They have a point , if to not exhaust means that America will not tolerate the failure of nonviolent means indefinitely .
After 12 years of economic sanctions , two different arms - inspection forces , several Security Council resolutions and , now , with more than 200,000 American and British troops at his doorstep , Saddam Hussein still refuses to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
SNIP
" The force our military uses will be less than proportional to the threat of injury we can expect to face should Saddam Hussein continue to build an arsenal of the world 's most destructive weapons .
SNIP " Both houses of Congress , by substantial margins , granted the president authority to use force to disarm Saddam Hussein .
That is all the authority he requires .
" Many critics suggest that disarming Iraq through regime change would not result in an improved peace .
There are risks in this endeavor , to be sure .
But no one can plausibly argue that ridding the world of Saddam Hussein will not significantly improve the stability of the region and the security of American interests and values .
Saddam Hussein is a risk - taking aggressor who has attacked four countries , used chemical weapons against his own people , professed a desire to harm the United States and its allies and , even faced with the prospect of his regime 's imminent destruction , has still refused to abide by Security Council demands that he disarm .
" Is n't it more likely that antipathy toward the United States in the Islamic world might diminish amid the demonstrations of jubilant Iraqis celebrating the end of a regime that has few equals in its ruthlessness ?
Would n't people subjected to brutal governments be encouraged to see the human rights of Muslims valiantly secured by Americans -- rights that are assigned rather cheap value by the critics ' definition of justice ?
' Our armed forces will fight for peace in Iraq -- a peace built on more secure foundations than are found today in the Middle East .
Even more important , they will fight for the two human conditions of even greater value than peace : liberty and justice .
SNIP
" The one risk that John McCain did n’t mention was the risk that the often - described Iraqi arsenal of the world 's most destructive weapons ” did n’t actually exist .
The good Senator gave no hint amid his public display of moral certitude about “ just war ” that he had any awareness of an underlying risk of self - deception and deception within the government .
' Fourteen months later , Congressional hearings commenced into the failure to find Weapons of Mass Destruction .
Responses fell neatly down party lines .
McCain used the opportunity to reassert his assumed moral certitude and appearance of military expertise to continue to support the decision to invade Iraq :
In his questioning of Charles Duelfer , head of the Iraq Survey Group that had finally published its long - delayed report .
After Duelfer concluded Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction were " essentially " destroyed since the 1991 Gulf War , McCain responded : Link
" SEN .
JOHN McCAIN : Knowing the history of Saddam Hussein , his use of weapons of mass destruction ... he had them in 1991 , is there any doubt in your mind that if Saddam Hussein were in power today and there were no restrictions or sanctions placed on him , that he would be attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction , Mr. Duelfer ?
McCain Sponsored INC Disinformation Unit that Replaced CIA Iraq Intelligence Gathering
How did it come to be that McCain and the rest were seemingly so oblivious to the facts on the ground in Iraq ?
Much of this melts down to the fact that GOP lawmakers simply refused to believe what they were being told by American intelligence officers and international arms inspectors .
They wanted a much more aggressive policy there .
The response by McCain and others in Congress was to create an alternative intelligence gathering organization , one that would deliver an alternative reality in Iraq to the one being described by the CIA and IAEA .
Along with large piles of public money and the lies they repeated to bolster the case for war , Chalabi ’s GOP allies in Congress pushed for I.N.C. to be given extraordinary powers as a sort of quasi- independent intelligence agency housed at the Pentagon under the roof of the Defense Intelligence Agency .
After the Bush - Cheney Administration took power , a newly - create “ Information Collection Agency ” employing I.N.C. assets began to bypass and co-opt the intelligence gathering and analysis functions that had been previously carried out by professional analysts at DIA and CIA Near East desks .
Now safely in place under looser management , I.N.C. produced vast quantities of flawed “ product ” , raw intelligence and disinformation which it distributed to “ US government recipients ” , such as William Luti at the Pentagon Office of Special Plans ( OSP ) and John Hannah , Vice President Cheney ’s special assistant for national security .
Another recipient of I.N.C. materials was news media , including Judith Miller at the New York Times , who long before developed a close working relationship with Chalabi .
On December 20 , 2001 , Judith Miller published a front - page story in the Times about an Iraqi engineer who claimed to have direct knowledge of twenty secret chemical - , biological - , and nuclear - weapons sites in Iraq .
That source was , of course .
Chalabi ’s protégé , Code - name “ Curveball ” , and this launched the second Iraq War .
McCain and his Congressional colleagues voted Chalabi money and influence over Iraq intelligence based on a plan that ranking military and intelligence officers strongly and publicly opposed at the time .
In open testimony to Congress , General Anthony Zinni , then commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East warned that the notion of cheap and easy invasion of Iraq was unworkable .
Zinni called Chalabi ’s regime change plan , “ pie in the sky , a fairy tale . ”
Zinni said later , “ They were saying if you put a thousand troops on the ground Saddam ’s regime will collapse , they wo n’t fight . ”
See , Jane Mayer , The New Yorker , “ The Manipulator ” , ( May 29 , 2004 ) , Link
McCain fully embraced the delusion about cheap and easy Middle East wars , and was a co-sponsor of the Act that led to the creation of a false intelligence factory funded by the U.S. Congress to replace CIA Iraq reporting .
Even after the Iraq WMD deception and failed occupation became clear , McCain has refused to acknowledge that he had been wrong all along about Iraq .
Senator McCain still avoids taking responsibility for his role in the Iraq intelligence failure , perhaps for no better reason than he was smart enough to keep some distance between himself and the Pentagon operatives who actually carried out the policy .
The Los Angeles Times observed about this : Link
" McCain did not publicly embrace or join the hard - core neoconservatives who pushed hardest to unleash the U.S. military against Baghdad before the war .
But McCain backed many of the same policies .
" He repeatedly urged backing Iraqi émigré groups , internal dissidents and other proxy forces to overthrow Hussein .
His hawkish views carried weight as a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , which oversees the Pentagon .
" In 1998 , he was among the cosponsors of the Iraq Liberation Act .
The law set " regime change " in Baghdad as U.S. policy and mandated support to opposition groups seeking to overthrow the dictator .
" Among the major beneficiaries was the Iraqi National Congress , a London - based exile group headed by Ahmed Chalabi …
McCain ’s Success at Keeping
His image clean is owed to Good PR and Charlie Black .
Five years , 4,000 US dead , and $ 600 billion later , John McCain continues to trade on his image as a maverick , a sophisticated military thinker and crusading fiscal conservative .
In great part , he owes that lingering mirage to another key figure in this story , a powerful GOP strategist , and head of one of Washington ’s wealthiest lobbying firm , BKSH Associates , a man with the appropriate name , Charlie Black .
By one estimate , Black ’s clients have paid him some $ 100 million for his peculiar talents in engineering wars , and keeping political events on track until they pay off with no -bid contracts .
To grasp the mutually profitable Peter - paid - Paul relationship between John McCain and Charlie Black , read this 2003 account of the role of lobbyists in drumming up federal contracts for “ rebuilding ” Iraq :
Lobbyists hustle for reconstruction business in Baghdad
By Peter H. Stone
National Journal Link
August 7 , 2003 " Consider BKSH & Associates , the firm run by well - known GOP strategist Charlie Black .
Over the past four years , BKSH has been boosting the interests of the Iraqi National Congress , whose leader , Ahmed Chalabi , was a key anti-Saddam opponent and now sits on the newly formed Iraqi Governing Council .
Besides helping the INC - which has enjoyed extensive backing from the Pentagon but is quite controversial at the State Department and the CIA - BKSH has started to help open doors for such U.S. companies as AT&T , Cummins Engine , and Fluor that are seeking business in Iraq .
And there is this about Black 's role as McCain 's Washington fixer : Link
Charlie Black , John McCain Aide and Super - Lobbyist
John McCain 's primary defender in the Lady Lobbyist Scandal * is a man named Charlie Black .
As a senior adviser to the campaign who is doing McCain 's damage control right now , Black has to explain to the press that John McCain did n't have a romantic relationship with lobbyist Vicki Iseman , did n't treat Iseman 's clients with undue favoritism , and is n't too close to lobbyists in general despite his years of anti-lobbyist rhetoric .
Black , of course , is a lobbyist .
In fact , as the head of the extremely influential lobby shop BKSH and Associates , he 's one of Washington 's most powerful influence - peddlers .
In the Washington Post story today about the lobbyists that populate the upper ranks of McCain 's campaign ( here 's another guy ) ; Black is listed as working for AT&T , Alcoa , JP Morgan , and U.S. Airways .
He works and has worked for far more companies than that , however .
By day , Charlie Black represents the corporations that profit from the Iraq War , while by night he clean up after John McCain ’s indiscretions that might mar his presidential election effort .
Yes , Virginia , Washington is a very small town , and the revolving door is golden .
In addition to deserving his own share of the credit for cultivating the careers of the men who started the Iraq War , Black is also one of its biggest profiteers , receiving tens of millions to lobby for a host of companies that have swollen their bottom lines with massive military and intelligence contracts during the era of kleptocratic one - party rule , the period of Bush - Cheney - McCain - Delay - Hastert GOP dominion over America .
Christie Hardin Smith at FiredogLake has observed this about Black : Link /
When you think about Charlie Black , think of him in terms of Jack Abramoff 's political reach , connections and influence -- only much , much more so -- with that same odious level of using it to the furthest extent to suck money out of clients who pay - to - play from K Street .
CONCLUSION
John McCain was very much one of Chalabi ’s key mentors in Congress , and along with Joe Lieberman , a vocal purveyor of false information about nonexistent Iraqi WMD .
And , it was Congress , as well as the White House , the Pentagon , and the CIA , that was responsible for the Iraq WMD deception .
Responsibility for the Iraq intelligence deception should not for a moment be limited to Chalabi and his Iraqi exiles .
About this , Jane Meyer wrote in her New Yorker portrait of Chalabi , “ The Manipulator ” , Link
Peter Galbraith , a former Ambassador to Croatia and a human - rights activist , who has long supported Chalabi ’s efforts to depose Saddam , suggested that if the Administration was unhappy with the outcome in Iraq it had only itself to blame .
“ Chalabi is one of the smartest people I know , ” he told me .
As Galbraith put it , Chalabi “ figured out in the eighties that the road to Baghdad ran through Washington .
He cultivated whom he needed to know .
If he did n’t get what he wanted from State , he went to Capitol Hill .
It ’s a sign of being effective .
It ’s not his fault that his strategy succeeded .
The presumptive Republican nominee for President has been a knowing part of an espionage and deception operation that led to the deaths of 4,000 Americans in Iraq .
John McCain is a security risk .

Shining Light on the " Black World "
In January of 2002 , the Washington Post ran a story detailing a CIA plan put forward to President Bush shortly after 9/11 by CIA Director George Tenet titled , " Worldwide Attack Matrix , " which was " outlining a clandestine anti-terror campaign in 80 countries around the world .
What he was ready to propose represented a striking and risky departure for U.S. policy and would give the CIA the broadest and most lethal authority in its history . "
The plan entailed CIA and Special Forces " covert operations across the globe , " and at " the heart of the proposal was a recommendation that the president give the CIA what Tenet labeled " exceptional authorities " to attack and destroy al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the rest of the world . "
Tenet cited the need for such authority " to allow the agency to operate without restraint -- and he wanted encouragement from the president to take risks . "
Among the many authorities recommended was the use of " deadly force . "
Further , " Another proposal was that the CIA increase liaison work with key foreign intelligence services , " as " Using such intelligence services as surrogates could triple or quadruple the CIA 's effectiveness . "
The Worldwide Attack Matrix " described covert operations in 80 countries that were either underway or that he was now recommending .
The actions ranged from routine propaganda to lethal covert action in preparation for military attacks , " as well as " In some countries , CIA teams would break into facilities to obtain information . " [ 1 ]
P2OG : " Commit terror , to incite terror … in order to react to terror "
In 2002 , the Pentagon ’s Defense Science Board ( DSB ) conducted a " Summer Study on Special Operations and Joint Forces in Support of Countering Terrorism , " portions of which were leaked to the Federation of American Scientists .
According to the document , the " War on Terror " constitutes a " committed , resourceful and globally dispersed adversary with strategic reach , " which will require the US to engage in a " long , at times violent , and borderless war . "
As the Asia Times described it , this document lays out a blueprint for the US to " fight fire with fire . "
Many of the " proposals appear to push the military into territory that traditionally has been the domain of the CIA , raising questions about whether such missions would be subject to the same legal restraints imposed on CIA activities . "
According to the Chairman of the DSB , " The CIA executes the plans but they use Department of Defense assets . "
Specifically , the plan " recommends the creation of a super - Intelligence Support Activity , an organization it dubs the Proactive , Preemptive Operations Group ( P2OG ) , to bring together CIA and military covert action , information warfare , intelligence and cover and deception .
For example , the Pentagon and CIA would work together to increase human intelligence ( HUMINT ) forward / operational presence and to deploy new clandestine technical capabilities . "
The purpose of P2OG would be in " ‘ stimulating reactions ’ among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction , meaning it would prod terrorist cells into action , thus exposing them to ‘ quick - response ’ attacks by US forces . "
[ 2 ]
In other words , commit terror to incite terror , in order to react to terror .
The Los Angeles Times reported in 2002 that , " The Defense Department is building up an elite secret army with resources stretching across the full spectrum of covert capabilities .
New organizations are being created .
The missions of existing units are being revised , " and quoted then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as saying , " Prevention and preemption are ... the only defense against terrorism . " [ 3 ]
Chris Floyd bluntly described P2OG in CounterPunch , saying , " the United States government is planning to use " cover and deception " and secret military operations to provoke murderous terrorist attacks on innocent people .
Let 's say it again : Donald Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney , George W. Bush and the other members of the unelected regime in Washington plan to deliberately foment the murder of innocent people -- your family , your friends , your lovers , you -- in order to further their geopolitical ambitions . " [ 4 ]
" The Troubles " with Iraq
On February 5 , 2007 , the Telegraph reported that , " Deep inside the heart of the " Green Zone " [ in Iraq ] , the heavily fortified administrative compound in Baghdad , lies one of the most carefully guarded secrets of the war in Iraq .
It is a cell from a small and anonymous British Army unit that goes by the deliberately meaningless name of the Joint Support Group ( JSG ) . "
The members of the JSG " are trained to turn hardened terrorists into coalition spies using methods developed on the mean streets of Ulster during the Troubles , when the Army managed to infiltrate the IRA at almost every level .
Since war broke out in Iraq in 2003 , they have been responsible for running dozens of Iraqi double agents . "
They have been " [ w ] orking alongside the Special Air Service [ SAS ] and the American Delta Force as part of the Baghdad - based counter - terrorist unit known as Task Force Black . "
It was reported that , " During the Troubles [ in Northern Ireland ] , the JSG operated under the cover name of the Force Research Unit ( FRU ) , which between the early 1980s and the late 1990s managed to penetrate the very heart of the IRA .
By targeting and then " turning " members of the paramilitary organisation with a variety of " inducements " ranging from blackmail to bribes , the FRU operators developed agents at virtually every command level within the IRA . "
Further , " The unit was renamed following the Stevens Inquiry into allegations of collusion between the security forces and protestant paramilitary groups , and , until relatively recently continued to work exclusively in Northern Ireland . " [ 5 ]
Considering that this group had been renamed after revelations of collusion with terrorists , perhaps it is important to take a look at what exactly this " collusion " consisted of .
The Stevens Inquiry ’s report " contains devastating confirmation that intelligence officers of the British police and the military actively helped Protestant guerillas to identify and kill Catholic activists in Northern Ireland during the 1980s . "
It was , " a state policy sanctioned at the highest level . "
The Inquiry , " highlighted collusion , the willful failure to keep records , the absence of accountability , the withholding of intelligence , and the extreme of agents being involved in murder , " and acknowledged " that innocent people had died because of the collusion . "
These particular " charges relate to activities of a British Army intelligence outfit known as the Force Research Unit ( FRU ) and former Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) police officers . " [ 6 ]
In 2002 , the Sunday Herald reported on the allegations made by a former British intelligence agent , Kevin Fulton , who stated that , " he was told by his military handlers that his collusion with paramilitaries was sanctioned by Margaret Thatcher herself . "
Fulton worked for the Force Research Unit ( FRU ) , and had infiltrated the IRA , always while on the pay roll of the military .
Fulton tells of how in 1992 , he told his FRU and MI5 intelligence handlers that his IRA superior was planning to launch a mortar attack on the police , yet his handlers did nothing and the attack went forward , killing a policewoman .
Fulton stated , " I broke the law seven days a week and my handlers knew that .
They knew that I was making bombs and giving them to other members of the IRA and they did nothing about it .
If everything I touched turned to shit then I would have been dead .
The idea was that the only way to beat the enemy was to penetrate the enemy and be the enemy . " [ 7 ]
In 1998 , Northern Ireland experienced its " worst single terrorist atrocity , " as described by the BBC , in which a car bomb went off , killing 29 people and injuring 300 . [ 8 ]
According to a Sunday Herald piece in 2001 , " Security forces did n't intercept the Real IRA 's Omagh bombing team because one of the terrorists was a British double - agent whose cover would have been blown as an informer if the operation was uncovered . "
Kevin Fulton had even " phoned a warning to his RUC handlers 48 hours before the Omagh bombing that the Real IRA was planning an attack and gave details of one of the bombing team and his car registration . "
Further , " The man thought to be the agent is a senior member of the [ IRA ] organization . " [ 9 ]
In 2002 , it was revealed that , " one of the most feared men inside the Provisional IRA , " John Joe Magee , head of the IRA ’s " internal security unit , " commonly known as the IRA ’s " torturer - in - chief , " was actually " one of the UK 's most elite soldiers , " who " was trained as a member of Britain 's special forces . "
The Sunday Herald stated that , " Magee led the IRA 's internal security unit for more than a decade up to the mid-90s - most of those he investigated were usually executed , " and that , " Magee 's unit was tasked to hunt down , interrogate and execute suspected British agents within the IRA . " [ 10 ]
In 2006 , the Guardian reported that , " two British agents were central to the bombings of three army border installations in 1990 . "
The claims included tactics known as the ‘ human bomb ’ , which " involved forcing civilians to drive vehicles laden with explosives into army checkpoints . "
This tactic " was the brainchild of British intelligence . " [ 11 ]
In 2006 , it was also revealed that , " A former British Army mole in the IRA has claimed that MI5 arranged a weapons - buying trip to America in which he obtained detonators , later used by terrorists to murder soldiers and police officers , " and " British intelligence co-operated with the FBI to ensure his trip to New York in the 1990s went ahead without incident so that his cover would not be blown . "
Further , " the technology he obtained has been used in Northern Ireland and copied by terrorists in Iraq in roadside bombs that have killed British troops . " [ 12 ]
Considering all these revelations of British collusion with IRA terrorists and complicity in terrorist acts in Northern Ireland through the FRU , what evidence is there that these same tactics are not being deployed in Iraq under the renamed Joint Support Group ( JSG ) ?
The recruits to the JSG in Iraq are trained extensively and those " who eventually pass the course can expect to be posted to Baghdad , Basra and Afghanistan . " [ 13 ]
P2OG in Action
In September of 2003 , months after the initial invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , Iraq ’s most sacred Shiite mosque was blown up , killing between 80 and 120 people , including a popular Shiite cleric , and the event was blamed by Iraqis on the American forces . [ 14 ]
On April 20 , 2004 , American journalist in Iraq , Dahr Jamail , reported in the New Standard that , " The word on the street in Baghdad is that the cessation of suicide car bombings is proof that the CIA was behind them . "
Jamail interviewed a doctor who stated that , " The U.S. induces aggression .
If you do n't attack me , I will never attack you .
The U.S. is stimulating the aggression of the Iraqi people ! "
This description goes very much in line with the aims outlined in the Pentagon ’s P2OG document about " inciting terror , " or " preempting terror attacks . " [ 15 ]
Weeks after the initial incident involving the British SAS soldiers in Basra , in October of 2005 , it was reported that Americans were " captured in the act of setting off a car bomb in Baghdad , " as , " A number of Iraqis apprehended two Americans disguised in Arab dress as they tried to blow up a booby - trapped car in the middle of a residential area in western Baghdad on Tuesday .
…
Residents of western Baghdad 's al - Ghazaliyah district [ said ] the people had apprehended the Americans as they left their Caprice car near a residential neighborhood in al - Ghazaliyah on Tuesday afternoon .
Local people found they looked suspicious so they detained the men before they could get away .
That was when they discovered that they were Americans and called the … police . "
However , " the Iraq police arrived at approximately the same time as allied military forces - and the two men were removed from Iraq custody and whisked away before any questioning could take place . " [ 16 ]
It was reported that in May of 2005 , an Iraqi man was arrested after witnessing a car bombing that took place in front of his home , as it was said he shot an Iraqi National Guardsman .
However , " People from the area claim that the man was taken away not because he shot anyone , but because he knew too much about the bomb .
Rumor has it that he saw an American patrol passing through the area and pausing at the bomb site minutes before the explosion .
Soon after they drove away , the bomb went off and chaos ensued .
He ran out of his house screaming to the neighbors and bystanders that the Americans had either planted the bomb or seen the bomb and done nothing about it .
He was promptly taken away . "
Further , another story was reported in the same month that took place in Baghdad when an Iraqi driver had his license and car confiscated at a checkpoint , after which he was instructed " to report to an American military camp near Baghdad airport for interrogation and in order to retrieve his license . "
After being questioned for a short while , he was told to drive his car to an Iraqi police station , where his license had been forwarded , and that he should go quickly .
" The driver did leave in a hurry , but was soon alarmed with a feeling that his car was driving as if carrying a heavy load , and he also became suspicious of a low flying helicopter that kept hovering overhead , as if trailing him .
He stopped the car and inspected it carefully .
He found nearly 100 kilograms of explosives hidden in the back seat and along the two back doors .
The only feasible explanation for this incident is that the car was indeed booby trapped by the Americans and intended for the al - Khadimiya Shiite district of Baghdad .
The helicopter was monitoring his movement and witnessing the anticipated ‘ hideous attack by foreign elements . " [ 17 ]
On October 4 , 2005 , it was reported by the Sydney Morning Herald that , " The FBI 's counterterrorism unit has launched a broad investigation of US - based theft rings after discovering some vehicles used in deadly car bombings in Iraq , including attacks that killed US troops and Iraqi civilians , were probably stolen in the United States , according to senior US Government officials . "
Further , " The inquiry began after coalition troops raided a Falluja bomb factory last November and found a Texas - registered four - wheel - drive being prepared for a bombing mission .
Investigators said there were several other cases where vehicles evidently stolen in the US wound up in Syria or other Middle Eastern countries and ultimately in the hands of Iraqi insurgent groups , including al - Qaeda in Iraq . " [ 18 ]
In 2006 , the Al - Askariya mosque in the city of Samarra was bombed and destroyed .
It was built in 944 , was over 1,000 years old , and was one of the most important Shi’ite mosques in the world .
The great golden dome that covered it , which was built in 1904 , was destroyed in the 2006 bombing , which was set off by men dressed as Iraqi Special Forces . [ 19 ]
Former 27 - year CIA analyst who gave several presidents their daily CIA briefings , Ray McGovern , stated that he " does not rule out Western involvement in this week 's Askariya mosque bombing . "
He was quoted as saying , " The main question is Qui Bono ?
Who benefits from this kind of thing ?
You do n't have to be very conspiratorial or even paranoid to suggest that there are a whole bunch of likely suspects out there and not only the Sunnis .
You know , the British officers were arrested , dressed up in Arab garb , riding around in a car , so this stuff goes on . " [ 20 ]
Death Squads for " Freedom "
In January of 2005 , Newsweek reported on a Pentagon program termed the " Salvador Option " being discussed to be deployed in Iraq .
This strategy " dates back to a still - secret strategy in the Reagan administration ’s battle against the leftist guerrilla insurgency in El Salvador in the early 1980s .
Then , faced with a losing war against Salvadoran rebels , the U.S. government funded or supported " nationalist " forces that allegedly included so - called death squads directed to hunt down and kill rebel leaders and sympathizers . "
Updating the strategy to Iraq , " one Pentagon proposal would send Special Forces teams to advise , support and possibly train Iraqi squads , most likely hand - picked Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shiite militiamen , to target Sunni insurgents and their sympathizers , even across the border into Syria , according to military insiders familiar with the discussions . " [ 21 ]
The Times reported that , " the Pentagon is considering forming hit squads of Kurdish and Shia fighters to target leaders of the Iraqi insurgency in a strategic shift borrowed from the American struggle against left - wing guerrillas in Central America 20 years ago .
Under the so - called ‘ El Salvador option ’ , Iraqi and American forces would be sent to kill or kidnap insurgency leaders . "
It further stated , " Hit squads would be controversial and would probably be kept secret , " as " The experience of the so - called " death squads " in Central America remains raw for many even now and helped to sully the image of the United States in the region . "
Further , " John Negroponte , the US Ambassador in Baghdad , had a front - row seat at the time as Ambassador to Honduras from 1981 - 85 . " [ 22 ]
By June of 2005 , mass executions were taking place in Iraq in the six months since January , and , " What is particularly striking is that many of those killings have taken place since the Police Commandos became operationally active and often correspond with areas where they have been deployed . " [ 23 ]
In May of 2007 , an Iraqi who formerly collaborated with US forces in Iraq for two and a half years stated that , " I was a soldier in the Iraqi army in the war of 1991 and during the withdrawal from Kuwait I decided to seek asylum in Saudi Arabia along with dozens of others like me .
That was how began the process whereby I was recruited into the American forces , for there were US military committees that chose a number of Iraqis who were willing to volunteer to join them and be transported to America .
I was one of those . "
He spoke out about how after the 2003 invasion , he was returned to Iraq to " carry out specific tasks assigned him by the US agencies . "
Among those tasks , he was put " in charge of a group of a unit that carried out assassinations in the streets of Baghdad . "
He was quoted as saying , " Our task was to carry out assassinations of individuals .
The US occupation army would supply us with their names , pictures , and maps of their daily movements to and from their place of residence and we were supposed to kill the Shi'i , for example , in the al - A'zamiyah , and kill the Sunni in the of ' Madinat as - Sadr ’ , and so on . "
Further , " Anyone in the unit who made a mistake was killed .
Three members of my team were killed by US occupation forces after they failed to assassinate Sunni political figures in Baghdad . "
He revealed that this " dirty jobs " unit of Iraqis , Americans and other foreigners , " does n’t only carry out assassinations , but some of them specialize in planting bombs and car bombs in neighborhoods and markets . "
He elaborated in saying that " operations of planting car bombs and blowing up explosives in markets are carried out in various ways , the best - known and most famous among the US troops is placing a bomb inside cars as they are being searched at checkpoints .
Another way is to put bombs in the cars during interrogations .
After the desired person is summoned to one of the US bases , a bomb is place in his car and he is asked to drive to a police station or a market for some purpose and there his car blows up . " [ 24 ]
Divide and Conquer ?
Craig Murray , former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan , wrote in October of 2006 , that , " The evidence that the US directly contributed to the creation of the current civil war in Iraq by its own secretive security strategy is compelling .
Historically of course this is nothing new - divide and rule is a strategy for colonial powers that has stood the test of time .
Indeed , it was used in the previous British occupation of Iraq around 85 years ago .
However , maybe in the current scenario the US just over did it a bit , creating an unstoppable momentum that , while stalling the insurgency , has actually led to new problems of control and sustainability for Washington and London . " [ 25 ]
Andrew G. Marshall contributed to breaking the Climate Change consensus in a celebrated 2006 article entitled Global Warming A Convenient Lie , in which he challenged the findings underlying Al Gore 's documentary .
According to Marshall , 'as soon as people start to state that “ the debate is over ” , beware , because the fundamental basis of all sciences is that debate is never over ' .
Andrew Marshall has also written on the militarization of Central Africa , national security issues and the process of integration of North America .

Imagine how Americans would feel if we suddenly realized that our most trusted trade partners have been slowly but inexorably imposing a tariff against U.S. goods since 2002 – a tariff now in excess of 50 % .
What really stings is that these same trade partners are also our most important allies , in both military and ideological terms .
We like to think we share the same moral values when it comes to defending democracy and the virtues of free market capitalism .
How ...
This is a list of modern people who have convinced themselves and others that through divine revelation they have been chosen to be the messiah , saviour , teacher or leader for all humanity .

A new Tory policy launched this week promises to allow Murdoch to bring his Fox News style to Britain .
Old impartiality rules for news broadcasting will be scrapped for all except the BBC .
That means abandoning the culture of broadcasting balance that Murdoch has always felt stifling for Sky News .
No-holds - barred shock - jock television news and current affairs would replace the seriousness of Adam Boulton .
For those who have never sampled the joys of Murdoch 's Fox News , it is an eye - popping spectacle to British viewers .
Raucous , brash , aggressive and ultra-rightwing , it would arrive here with the same cultural impact that the Sun had on British newspapers .
There are few serious media observers , apart from those in Murdoch 's pay , who do not see his arrival in Fleet Street as marking a steep downward path for the British press .
The attack press we have now that so shocks European visitors is mainly thanks to the man who controls more than 40 % of newspaper readership .
Allowed to run
Sky untrammelled , his dominance of both press and broadcasting would be unthinkable in almost any developed nation : the United States has far stricter cross-media ownership rules .
Possibly only Italy could compare with Britain for lax media ownership regulation , where Berlusconi is about to prove yet again this week that he who controls most of TV and newspapers can control elections .
Murdoch never harboured personal political ambition - only to sway countries to the right and keep them there .
The opportunity to pump out Sun - type broadcasting will warm his enthusiasm for David Cameron , who is otherwise not quite right enough to have earned total Murdoch approval .
The Tory document attacks the BBC as being liberal - biased .
With great glee , its opening paragraph quotes Andrew Marr apparently agreeing .
But Marr had spoken once of an " innate liberal bias " in the context of a long and thoughtful discourse on the BBC 's perpetually self - critical striving for fairness and balance , unique in all the media .
Responding to the Tory policy , he warned politicians yesterday : " If you want partisan and biased broadcasting , just you wait .
You have no idea how demeaning it will feel for you .
Broadcasters will become like bloggers , but with vastly more firepower , as they rip into you just as newspapers do .
Be careful what you wish for . "
Some say the BBC would stand to gain , as the only non-partisan voice , but wiser heads warn that the BBC would inevitably be sucked towards the new rowdy Fox News culture .
The Tories ' other main recommenation will also delight Murdoch .
It is to top - slice the BBC licence fee and spread the proceeds to other broadcasters .
Murdoch has always used his newspapers to undermine the BBC , claiming it damages the free market in broadcasting - as indeed it does , and as indeed it should .
The media is not like other markets : lack of competition has often been the guarantee of media quality .
Radio 4 , Radio 3 , BBC4 , CBBC and CBeebies , programmes like Newsnight and the Today programme , flourish in competition - free zones .
American newspapers often follow the same pattern where one - newspaper cities sustain the quality of a Washington Post or a San Francisco Chronicle .
In the UK , since the Beaverbrook - Northcliffe battles , too many newspapers have fought each other downhill , shouting ever louder to be heard on overcrowded newstands .
The BBC needs competition , say the Tories , but that is dogma , not an honest evaluation of what competition has historically done to BBC quality .
People complain most about BBC output when it has to compete hardest .
What else but trawling for viewers makes BBC News sometimes lead on Heather Mills or gruesome murders ?
No , the BBC is never perfect , and we rightly subject it tougher quality expectations .
At first glance , taking money from the licence fee to give to others who produce good but unprofitable programmes looks innocuous .
Is n't this just special pleading by the BBC to want it all ?
But spreading the money around breaks the direct link between viewers and the BBC : there is strong support for paying the licence fee , with a majority willing to pay more than the present £ 2.60 a week .
Its transparency is popular : licence - payers see where the money goes and who to blame if they do n't like it , not pepper - potted around among commercials on other channels .
Some quango handing out money to specific " programmes of merit " would attract the same opprobrium as the lottery funds .
The BBC already contracts out 30 % of output : a new bureaucracy handing out small sums would syphon off more in administration .
And all for what ?
Channel 4 needs a new funding system now ITV can no longer bear the cost .
So why not make all profitable broadcasters pay a small levy to pay for C4 's public service remit ?
Why should n't Sky pay ?
When considering value for money , Sky 's revenue is £ 4.5 bn , compared with the BBC's £ 2.5 bn for TV and online .
But how many memorable programmes has Sky ever made ?
In terms of viewing , in a week the BBC gets 42 % of viewers , ITV 22.7 % and Sky 6.8 % .
There will be a tough fight to defend the BBC .
Michael Grade , the former BBC chairman and now head of ITV , waded in yesterday : " Were I still chairman of the BBC I would be arguing that to distribute monies given by the British public exclusively for BBC use to other bidders feels like a breach of contract .
The public should be asked if they are happy to have their BBC dues used for any other purpose . "
Saving the BBC from Murdoch - pleasing predators should be clear blue water between the main parties at the next election .
Alas , not so .
James Purnell , the previous culture secretary , announced that top - slicing the licence fee was on the cards .
Perhaps the new culture secretary , Andy Burnham , would kick it into the tall weeds where it belongs ?
If Britishness means anything , it means the BBC .
No , depressingly in his first statement , he hastened to agree it was indeed an option .
Yet again , Labour legitimises a Tory policy .
Only the Lib Dems denounce cutting licence fee funds as " a disaster for the future of the BBC and public service broadcasting " .
If there is to be a hung parliament , here is another reason why the Lib Dems might improve either party in power .

Hannibal Gaddafi has denied claims he assaulted two of his staff in Switzerland Libya 's state shipping company says it has halted oil shipments to Switzerland in protest at the brief arrest of leader Muammar Gaddafi 's youngest son .
It threatened further action if the Swiss did not apologise for the arrest .
Geneva police held Hannibal Gaddafi for two days after he and his pregnant wife allegedly hit two of their staff .
The couple face charges of bodily harm , threatening behaviour and coercion .
They have denied any wrongdoing over the alleged incident on 15 July .
Costly row ?
The stopping of oil shipments comes a day after the Swiss foreign ministry complained of Libya taking " retaliatory measures " , such as forcing Swiss firms to close Libyan offices .
Libya's General National Maritime Transport Company - which has links to Hannibal Gaddafi - said in a statement that it had halted all oil shipments to Switzerland .

The firm handles most of Libya 's oil exports .
However , the AFP news agency reported that oil carried by commercial vessels would not be affected .
In a joint statement with the national port authority , the company also said ships sailing under the Swiss flag had been banned from entering Libyan ports .
It is a row that could prove costly to both countries , says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva .
Switzerland imports at least half its crude oil from Libya but Libya owns a large oil refinery in Switzerland .
Libya 's influential people 's committees have also called for Libya to withdraw its deposits from Swiss banks if an apology for the arrest is not forthcoming .
' Worrying measures '
The Swiss foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Libya had " taken a number of worrying retaliatory measures " for Mr Gaddafi 's arrest since he was released on bail on 17 July .
It said Swiss companies ABB and Nestle had been ordered to close their Libya offices and that Swiss staff there had been arrested .
Flights between Libya and Switzerland had been reduced , Libya had stopped issuing visas to Swiss citizens and Tripoli had recalled some of its diplomats from Bern , the Swiss foreign ministry said .
The ministry also said it had sent a delegation to Libya to explain Mr Gaddafi 's arrest .
It has advised Swiss citizens not to travel to Libya until further notice .
It is not Hannibal Gaddafi 's first brush with the law .
In 2005 he was convicted by a court in France of assaulting his girlfriend .

World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) is alarmed by the dramatic decline of at least 30 percent in the Bengal tiger population of Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in Nepal , once a refuge that boasted among the highest densities of the endangered species in the Eastern Himalayas .
The recent survey of April 2008 showed a population of between 6 - 14 tigers , down from 20 - 50 tigers in 2005 .
The Government of Nepal made a low - key announcement on July 1 based on the results of a long - term camera trap study conducted in large part by WWF .
Officials identified poaching as perhaps the major cause of tigers disappearing from this protected area .
Ironically , armed poachers have been photographed by the very equipment set up to capture tiger images .
" The loss of tigers in Suklaphanta is undoubtedly linked to the powerful global mafia that controls illegal wildlife trade , " said Jon Miceler , managing director of WWF 's Eastern Himalayas Program .
" The evidence suggests that Nepal 's endangered tigers are increasingly vulnerable to this despicable trade that has already emptied several Indian tiger reserves — clearly , this is symptomatic of the larger tiger crisis in the region .
We need a stronger , more sustained response to this issue in order to protect the future of tigers in the wild . "
Suklaphanta shares a porous international border with India , allowing for easy and untraceable transportation of wildlife contraband .
Unlike poaching of other species like rhinos where only the horns are removed , virtually no evidence remains at a tiger poaching site because all its parts are in high demand for illegal wildlife trade .
In May , two tiger skins and nearly 70 pounds of tiger bones were seized from the border town of Dhangadi .
Just last month , two separate raids recovered tiger bones being smuggled by local middlemen through the reserve .
" With only 4,000 tigers remaining in the wild , every tiger lost to poaching pushes this magnificent animal closer to extinction , " said Dr. Sybille Klenzendorf , director of WWF 's Species Conservation Program .
" Tigers can not be saved in small forest fragments when faced with a threat like illegal wildlife trade — this is a global problem that needs the concerted effort of governments , grassroots organizations and all concerned individuals . "
WWF is committed to working even more closely with local communities and various government bodies in Nepal and India to tackle illegal wildlife trade .
Activities ranging from improved community - based anti-poaching operations to entrenched informant networks and better - equipped rapid response teams are being strengthened .

I have a clear memory of a terrible crime that was committed in southern Lebanon in 1978 .
Israeli soldiers , landing at night on the beach near Sarafand – the city of Sarepta in antiquity – were looking for " terrorists " and opened fire on a car load of female Palestinian refugees .
It took the Israelis a day before they admitted shooting at the car with an anti-tank weapons , by which time I had watched civil defence workers pulling the dead women from the vehicle , their faces slopping off on to the road , an AP correspondent holding his hands to his face in shock , leaning against an ambulance , crying " Jesus Christ !
Jesus Christ .
I suppose all this is because of what Hitler did to the Jews . "
Save for his remark , however , all I remember is silence .
As if the whole scene was muted , sound smothered by the dead .
Yet I was running a tape recorder for part of the time , and when I listened to the old tape again a few days ago , I could hear many women , weeping , cars passing , honking horns above the shrieks of grief .
My own original notes state , in my handwriting , that " a throng of women stood crying and wailing " .
Yet all I remember now is silence .
A child was on a stretcher , cut in half , a girl in the back seat of the car , curled in death into the arms of an older woman .
But silence .

I was reminded of all this by an especially powerful interview conducted at Cannes with the Israeli director Ari Folman , who has made a remarkable film – Waltz with Bashir – about Israel 's later , 1982 invasion of Lebanon and about the " collective amnesia " of the soldiers who participated in this hopeless adventure .
Bashir Gemayel was the name of Israel 's favourite Christian Maronite militia leader who was elected president but almost immediately assassinated .
It 's an animated film – a film of cartoons , if you like – because Folman is trying to fill in the empty space which the war occupies in his mind .
Because he can't remember it .
" I never talked about my army service , " Folman said .
" I got on with my life without talking about it , without thinking about it .
It was like something I did n't want to be connected with whatsoever . "
In one astonishing scene , Israeli soldiers come ashore in Lebanon – only to find that there is no one there .
They are entering an empty country , washed clean of memory .
Alas , Lebanon was not empty ; more than 17,000 Lebanese and Palestinians , almost all civilians , died in that terrible war , and at the end of Folman 's movie , the animation turns to reality with photographs of some of the 1,700 Palestinian dead of the Sabra and Chatila massacre , murdered by Israel 's Phalangist allies while the Israelis watched from high - rise buildings .
It is Folman 's dream that this film should be shown in an Arab country – given the dotage and stupidity of most Arab ministers , that is surely a hope that will not be realised – but it did almost win the Palme d'Or at Cannes .
Amnesia is real .
And it afflicts us all .
But it is also a block to memory .
Take my old letter - writing friend , poet Don Newton .
He dropped me a note the other day , asking why humans have to create wars and mentioning , at the start , that he remembered the Second World War and , in 1944 , Germany 's V2 missiles .
What grabbed me by the throat , however , was the penultimate paragraph of his letter , written with an eloquence I cannot match – and whose power and suddenness will shock you , as readers , just as it shocked me .
This is what Don wrote :
" I saw some of my friends killed around me when I was 12 , when a V2 punched into the road near where we were playing ...
I was lucky and survived but ran over the road to find my father lying dead by our front gate .
He looked for all the world like a grey , dusty broken puppet with his left arm laying next to him .
It had been sliced off just above the elbow by a piece of shrapnel that had also cut through the oak gatepost behind him .
" Strangely enough , that sight seems to have wiped from my conscious mind all but a handful of memories of him and those are mostly unpleasant in their associations , like the time I burst into the toilet when I was only six , to find him sitting reading a newspaper , and blurted out that my younger brother by a year had been run over .
Peter died in hospital the next day without ever recovering consciousness .
This ' amnesia ' is , I suppose , a defence mechanism but I find it weird and unable to break .
I am struggling to put this problem into a poem and , hopefully , when it is out on paper maybe the fog will clear ? "
I find this letter – horror and the mundane inextricably , unbelievably mixed together – unanswerable .
The V2 explosion turns into a father 's death , the interruption in the lavatory into a child 's death .
And a poem to clear the amnesia ?
Only a poet could suggest that .
I did n't see my father die but I was sitting beside my own mother when she died from the results of Parkinson's .
My memory is clear – she choked on her own saliva because she could no longer clear her throat – and I do remember sitting by her body and thinking ( and here I quote another Israeli , a fine and brilliant novelist ) , " I 'm next ! "
So I turned , of course , to a haiku in Don 's latest collection of poetry , The Soup Stone , called " Mum's Death , 1982 " – the same date as Folman 's Israeli invasion when he ( and I ) were trying to stay alive in Lebanon :
" Just sitting , waiting ,
For your last slow breath .
Suddenly – it 's here . "
Which is about as close to death as you can get in verse .
And there really is a silence at the end .

The plant denies that the fertiliser is harmful to health
Dangerous levels of the known carcinogen cadmium have been found in the sludge produced from the plant in the southern state of Kerala .
The chemicals were traced in an investigation by BBC Radio 4's Face The Facts programme and prompted scientists to call for the practice to be halted immediately .
However , Vice - President of Coca - Cola in India , Sunil Gupta , denied the fertiliser posed any risk .
" We have scientific evidence to prove it is absolutely safe and we have never had any complaints , " Mr Gupta said .
The results have devastating consequences for those living near the areas where this waste has been dumped
Professor John Henry ,
poisons expert
Face
The Facts presenter John Waite visited the plant following complaints from villagers that water supplies were drying up because of the massive quantities of water required by Coca - Cola .
Villagers , politicians , environmentalists and scientists have accused the firm of robbing the community of the area 's most precious resource .
They say the area 's farming industry has been devastated and jobs , as well as the health of local people , have been put at risk .
' Disturbing '
As part of the probe , Face The Facts sent sludge samples to the UK for examination at the University of Exeter .
Locals have protested at the chemicals and the draining of water
Tests revealed the material was useless as a fertiliser and contained a number of toxic metals , including cadmium and lead .
The lab 's senior scientist , David Santillo , said : " What is particularly disturbing is that the contamination has spread to the water supply - with levels of lead in a nearby well at levels well above those set by the World Health Organisation . "
According to Britain 's leading poisons expert , Professor John Henry , consultant at St Mary 's Hospital in London , immediate steps should be taken by the authorities in India to ban the practice immediately .
The levels of toxins found in the samples would , he said , cause serious problems - polluting the land , local water supplies and the food chain .
" The results have devastating consequences for those living near the areas where this waste has been dumped and for the thousands who depend on crops produced in these fields , " Professor Henry said .
' Good for crops '
Cadmium is a carcinogen and can accumulate in the kidneys , with repeated exposure possibly causing kidney failure .
Cadmium and lead were found in the samples from the fertiliser
Lead is particularly dangerous to children and the results of exposure can be fatal .
Even at low levels it can cause mental retardation and severe anaemia .
Professor
Henry said : " What most worries me about the levels found is how this might be affecting pregnant women in the area .
You would expect to see an increase in miscarriages , still births and premature deliveries . "
Mr Gupta said local farmers had been grateful for the fertiliser because many could not afford brand - name products of their own .
" It 's good for crops , " he said .
" It 's good for the farmers because most of them are poor and they have been using this for the past three years . "
Coca - Cola say they will continue to supply the sludge to farmers .

Eleven major corporations today urged the U.S. Senate to pass climate change legislation , saying the Lieberman - Warner Climate Security Act ( S. 3036 ) , which will be voted on this week , â€œrepresents a real effort to establish the regulatory framework that we need.â€ 
The companies backing the effort â€ “ Allianz of America ; Catalyst Paper Corporation ; FPL Group , Inc. ; JohnsonDiversey , Inc. ; Johnson & Johnson ; Levi Strauss & Co. ; National Grid , Nike , Inc ; Novo Nordisk ; Tetra Pak ; and Xanterra Parks & Resorts â€ “ are working with World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) to reduce their carbon emissions .
Many are members of WWFâ€™s Climate Savers and PowerSwitch ! programs .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
In an open letter to the U.S. Senate , the 11 companies said passage of climate change legislation is a top priority .
â€ œOur companies recognize that ignoring climate change is not an option .
What will ultimately undermine economic growth is a failure to take action , â€ they wrote .
They further state in the letter : â€ œThe Lieberman - Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 represents a real effort to establish the regulatory framework that we need â€ “ one that is credible , comprehensive and mandatory .
While we recognize that more work remains to be done , this bill profoundly advances the dialogue within Congress about solutions - oriented policies .
By harnessing the power of market mechanisms within a federally mandated system , Congress can combat climate change while creating significant business opportunities , providing our companies with the certainty they need for business planning and opening up new avenues for innovation .
We believe strongly that reducing carbon emissions is not only good policy , it is good business .â€ 
The full text of the letter is available at WWFâ€™s website .
WWF President and CEO Carter Roberts said , â€ œWhen major corporations publicly urge Congress to pass climate change legislation , itâ€™s a clear sign that addressing the problem is in our nationâ€™s economic interests .
â€ œThese companies recognize the risks for failing to take action and the opportunities in the new , low - carbon world .
A cap and trade program ensures that we make progress on climate change ; it provides a framework for the market to reward new forms of energy and more efficient products ; and finally it establishes new financial markets which will pump billions of dollars into our cities and states.â€ 
Roberts added , â€ œThe Lieberman - Warner bill will put us on the path to a cleaner , safer , more efficient future .
When the bill comes to a vote this week , the choice facing each Senator will be between two vastly different futures .
I hope they choose wisely .â€ 
WILMINGTON , Delaware ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp said on Tuesday its all - electric Chevrolet Volt was on track for a launch in 2010 after the company ’s board approved funding for production of the high - profile plug - in vehicle .
“ The Chevy Volt is a go , ” GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner told reporters ahead of the company ’s annual meeting with shareholders in Wilmington , Delaware .
“ What we ’re saying with this approval is that the GM management and board believe the technical goals of the Volt are not only achievable , but achievable generally within the time frame we previously outlined , ” Wagoner said .
The announcement on Tuesday represents the most detailed road map toward bringing the highly anticipated car to the market by the end of 2010 , an ambitious timetable challenged by some of GM ’s rivals .
A successful launch of the Volt is critical to GM as the top U.S. automaker struggles with a heavy lineup of gas - thirsty trucks and works to claim an edge in fuel - saving technology against Toyota Motor Corp and its market - leading Prius hybrid .
Wagoner said GM ’s plan is to manufacture the Volt in its Hamtramck , Michigan plant .
That depends on negotiations with state and local governments for tax incentives , he said .
GM remains committed to its target of getting the vehicles into showrooms by the end of 2010 , said Wagoner .
Unlike gas - electric hybrids such as the Prius , which run on a system that twins battery power and a combustion engine , the Volt will be powered entirely by an electric motor and have a battery that can be charged through an ordinary power socket .
The Volt ’s on - board engine will be used only to power the battery on longer trips , GM has said .
Executives , including Wagoner , have previously said the 2010 timeline would be a “ stretch ” to meet since GM was rushing to do basic battery - development work at the same time that it engineered a new vehicle from the ground up .
GM is designing the Volt to run for 40 miles powered by a 400 - pound lithium - ion battery pack that can be recharged at a standard electric outlet when the vehicle is parked .
The Volt marks one of the first attempts to adapt lithium - ion batteries , widely used in consumer electronics , to power a car .
Toyota is also racing to market its own plug - in hybrid by 2010 using the same technology .
Getting the pioneering plug - in hybrid to the market first has become more urgent for GM as it copes with high gasoline prices the automaker now sees as a permanent threat to its business .
GM is also under increasing pressure from the government and environmentalists to improve fuel economy .
“ We intend to show the production version of the Chevy Volt publicly in the near future , ” Wagoner said .
GM has been testing two sets of battery packs supplied by a subsidiary of Korea ’s LG Chem Ltd , and German auto parts supplier Continental AG using technology developed by privately held A123 Systems .
GM product chief Bob Lutz said he expected to name a Volt battery supplier “ soon ” without elaborating .
The Volt has attracted an active fan base of bloggers and potential buyers unlike any other vehicle in the industry ’s usually secretive development process .
Capitalizing on the enthusiasm for the vehicle , GM has also featured the Volt in its advertising .

Four of the past 5 months are “ all - time ” records for Southern Hemisphere sea ice anomalies , “ unprecedented ” since the data set began in 1979 as shown below :
On a global basis , world sea ice in April 2008 reached levels that were “ unprecedented ” for the month of April in over 25 years .
Levels are the third highest ( for April ) since the commencement of records in 1979 , exceeded only by levels in 1979 and 1982 .
This continues a pattern established earlier in 2008 , as global sea ice in March 2008 was also the third highest March on record , while January 2008 sea ice was the second highest January on record .
It was also the second highest single month in the past 20 years ( second only to Sept 1996 ) .
The graph below shows the monthly anomaly ( aggregating NH and SH ) , collating information from ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135 .

As suggested by a reader , here ’s the same information with each monthly series plotted as a separate line ( April - solid ; January – dotted . )
The surge in anomaly area in 2008 is not limited to a single month , but is consistent for all 4 months to date ( and for the YTD average ) .

Ipopt is a leading nonlinear optimization tool .
There are a bunch of interfaces , e.g. C/C++ standard interfaces , Java and MATLAB interface , FORTRAN interface for programmers .
However , no existing interface to python was presented .
I started to connect ipopt with python two months ago inspired by OpenOpt .
After lots of extensive development and nasty testing , today , I proudly announce that the python interface of ipopt , aka , pyipopt , version alpha , is ready to go .
With the help of this module , in python , you can just use
import pyipopt
nlp = pyipopt.create(n , xl , xu , m , gl , gu , nnzj , nnzh , f , gradf , g , gradg , h , apply_new )
solution = nlp.solve(x0 )
to get your NLP problem which n variables ( xl , xu are boundaries for variables ) , m constraints ( gl , gu are boundaries for constraints ) , and objective function f ( gradf is the gradient , h is the Hessian matrix ) with constraints g ( gradg is the Jacobian value ) optimized by IPOPT .
The package is available via google code : http://code.google.com/p/pyipopt/
An OpenOpt hooker is under development .
The code has BSD license .
you can use this module whatever you want .
For bug report and other related things , reach me at youxu AT wustl.edu .
To write a package is not rocket science , but it might save you some time in your research .

How to Tap Your Nap
Photo by Stock Photo
What do you do when you have problems that need creative solutions ?
Would you like to be more creative ?
Are you willing to give sleep a try ?
Thomas Edison , Salvador Dali and Stephen King all did it .
So did Wagner , Poe and Twain .
They all used this technique successfully at one time or another .
What am I talking about ?
The ability to use the initial stages of sleep to generate creative ideas or to solve a perplex problem .
Sounds a little far - fetched , does n’t it ?
I thought so too , until I discovered that many of the great scientists , artists and engineers of our time have used sleep as a means of inspiration and problem solving .
It has been described as trolling or mining for ideas in the subconscious of our mind .
We now know that our minds are just as active while we are sleeping as when we are awake .
Portions of the brain do shut down during the midnight hours , while others become active and take us to far - away places where the ‘ wild things roam ’ .
Some of the greatest minds of our time have mastered this technique and enhanced their creativity .
And with a little help , so can you .
Salvador Dali called his technique slumber with a key .
He would sit in a chair with a heavy key in his left hand and plate on the floor .
He would drift off , enjoy the subconscious show and wake up when the key would drop on the plate .
Stephen King also gets ideas from his sleep .
He says that ideas are sent the way you would send someone an interoffice message in a pneumatic tube .
Sometimes ideas are normal and retrieved while in a light sleep .
Other , more exotic ideas are found in the depths of his sleep and only occasionally survive the trip to the surface .
Thomas Edison would put two steel plates on the floor directly underneath his hands , which were holding a steel ball .
As he sat in his chair and drifting off into dream - land , his hands would open , dropping the balls on the plates and wake him up .
He then noted any images , thought or ideas he had during his “ naps ” .
The following article was inspired by Jeff Warren ’s book The Head Trip : Adventures on The Wheel Of Consciousness .
While this article touches on only one aspect of our sleep patterns , “ The Head Trip ” is truly an adventure on the exploration of our consciousness .
Who is Creative ?
Everyone has the ability to be creative and we should n’t think otherwise .
You , me , your neighbor , even your land lady .
Not everyone needs to be a Picasso or a Rembrandt , but we all have a creative and artistic side that can be tapped and nurtured .
The key is that one needs to have the desire and the willingness to try .
I ’m not saying it ’s easy but with a desire to learn , and some persistence , you too can be the creative person you want to be .
For me , I selected writing as my creative outlet .
I enjoy the craft and enjoy creating stories to communicate ideas .
I ’ve been freelance writing for a short time now , and people ask me , where do you get ideas for articles ?
I usually tell them , I sleep on it and get a confused look in return .
For me , ideas come at different times and I ’ve started to carry a notebook to capture them when they come .
Besides getting ideas while driving or taking a shower , I tend also to generate topics for articles or even entire paragraphs while I ’m half asleep or in a partial sleep state .
Sometimes I get these ideas in the morning when I wake before my alarm while laying there half asleep .
Other times I get these ideas at the beginning of the night when the wheel of consciousness starts to spin and I end up in another place .
Sleep is Exercise for Your Brain
Did you ever think about how you fall asleep ?
It ’s a little more complicated than curling into the fetal position and waking up in the morning .
There are actually five stages of sleep that we go through each night .
REM sleep is the most commonly known stage and is where many of our wildest dreaming takes place .
But it ’s in the first stage of sleep where we can easily be aware of our surroundings and mine our subconscious for creative ideas .
The first stage of sleep is called the Hypnagogia .
I promise never to use that word again and will use the term Sleep Onset , instead .
During the first phase of sleep is when we ’re in between consciousness and that deep , REM sleep that we all love .
As we slowly slip deeper into our minds , a funny thing starts to happen .
Ideas start to generate .
Some of them are fantastical , while others are practical .
With a little practice , you too can use Sleep Onset to help generate creative ideas or solve complex problems .
Putting the Technique to Practice
There are two tricks to getting this technique to work :
You need to ‘ prime the pump ’ of your subconscious Awaken before you slip into a deep sleep and do n’t remember that great idea you had in the beginning of the night .
Did you ever experience a state where you were half - asleep ?
It ’s when you ’re kind - of sleeping , but not really and you can still hear things around you ?
It ’s a strange feeling .
You ’re laying or sitting motionless , hearing noises or music around you , and you still have some cognitive ability .
Your brain is starting to relax , but it ’s not relaxed enough to send you completely into the land of Oz .
That ’s the stage of Sleep Onset that you can use to your advantage .
I really enjoy this feeling and always wake very refreshed and feeling great .
What a nice side affect – even if you do n’t find any ideas , you ’re getting some rest and wake up feeling refreshed .
And that is never a bad thing to do .

The following are 6 steps to putting this technique to practice .
1. Start with a “ Beginner ’s Mind ”
The concept of beginner ’s mind is a Zen teaching that basically states that we should take our knowledge of a subject and set it aside for a while and approach a task with a clear mind .
How many stories have we heard where someone described an invention that everyone said was impossible .
Sometimes too much knowledge can get in the way of a creative endeavor .
If you know something is impossible , then it will be .
But , if you do n’t , then the possibilities are limitless .
2. Prime Your Subconscious by Focusing on Your Topic
You need to set your mind to the topic or problem at hand and this should be done before you start to fall asleep .
It ’s similar to when you have a problem and you have that Aha !
moment while taking a shower .
Up until that point your subconscious was busily working on your problem while you were distracted by the noise of everyday life .
But one word of caution : you need to focus deeply on a problem repeatedly for a while , in order to drive it into the subconscious .
Only then can your Aha ! moment pop out later .
3. Turn on the Music
I ’ve experienced the creative state of Sleep Onset many times , and it most frequently occurs when I ’m listening to music .
Either I put on headphones or have music playing in the background .
While I enjoy rock - n- roll and Guitar Hero , a softer style of music works best for me when going to sleep .
Buddha Lounge and Kitaro are my favorites .
Do n’t be afraid to experiment New Age and Ambient Music .
Guns - N- Roses may be right for you , and that ’s ok too .
Whatever works , works .
4. Get Comfortable
Being on an easy chair , lying in bed or sitting on a plane – pick your favorite place , get comfortable and relax .
Believe it or not , I experience the creative state frequently while flying .
Once I reach the point where ‘ electronic devices are permitted ’ , the head phones go on and I start streaming music into my brain .
Maybe it ’s a combination of the music , the gentle rocking motion of the plane and the hum of the engines that get my mind going .
For me , it ’s a recipe for creative success .
It ’s a shame the mood is broken when the plane hits some nasty turbulence and my drink ends up in my lap .
5. Think About Your Topic as You Drift Off
You ’re comfortable , you ’ve thought about your topic , and your favorite music is playing in the background .
Now you can start to drift off .
Before long you may notice that you ’re “ kind - of ” sleeping .
You ca n’t move , you hear the music , and you ’re aware that you ca n’t move and you ’re hearing music .
6. Free Your Mind
In your semi-conscious state , you ’re aware of what ’s happening and where it may lead .
Learn to recognize this state of mind and focus on your idea or problem .
This is where problem solving occurs and the ideas start to generate .
There ’s no magic that I can write about here , you ’ll just have to try it and see what happens .
For me , I usually start to think about a topic for an article and I ’ll start to formulate the opening lines and the premise of the initial paragraph .
7. Wake Up and Take Notes
I typically wake up after a period of time without the aid of heavy keys or ball bearings .
But you may want something to prevent you from falling into a deep sleep and missing your creative opportunity .
I suggest you set an alarm for 15 – 25 minutes and be prepared to take notes when you awake .
When I wake , I usually write down the opening lines or scribble the paragraph that I was thinking about .
It ’s never perfect , but it gives me enough information that I can easily bring it into focus .
The process is like polishing a rock , after a while the rock becomes smooth and shiny .
When you polish long enough , you can make anything look good .
Parting Words
Normally when one thinks of altered states , you have an image of being locked in an isolation chamber or taking substances that should n’t be taken .
While some may have had success with these alternative methods , they usually lead to unwanted side effects .
The sleep approach is legal , it works AND you wake up refreshed .
What more could you ask for ?
What are your thoughts on alternative methods for generating creative ideas ?
What do you do when you ’re stuck with a problem ?
See you in the comments below .
Editor ’s Comment ( Tina ) : I have not consciously tried sleep as a method for generating ideas , but am very intrigued by Victor ’s unique voice .
I will give this a try and comment .
What I do regularly is a simple “ visualization session ” either in the bath or sitting on a comfortable couch .
The idea is to relax completely and let your unconscious mind flow , while allowing your conscious mind to lightly direct traffic .
I would start with 5 minutes of gratitude with eyes closed , and then I would drive in to visualizing the end result I want for various problems .
I would list out specific constraints and ask specific questions .
I would repeat the question in my mind .
Even if I did n’t find the answer after my ‘ rituals ’ , I would continue to mentally repeat the question throughout the day .
The answer eventually comes , sometimes quickly , sometimes after a few days .
I ’ve found that when the answers are received , I ’m usually in a relaxed state : after waking up from sleep , after visualization session , while reading , and while taking a walk .
Music wise , I prefer any CD from Nawang Khechog for creative visualization .
It ’s also what I listen to when writing all articles for Think Simple Now .
Editor ’s Editor ’s Comment ( Adam ) : I have been using shallow sleep as a focus and contemplation opportunity for a long time .
I can remember when I was younger , lying in bed at night as thoughts stream through my mind and wondering
Why are n’t I this creative during the day ?
Like me , I imagine that most people experience this same rush , but rarely write down those thoughts .
I really appreciate Victor ’s approach and style .
I hope to see more of his writing on Think Simple Now .
I would also like to note that the Editor spends a long time in shallow sleep every morning while her alarm rings , sometimes for hours .
She may not have consciously tried this technique , but I guarantee that she ’s experienced it .
An awkward situation had traveled 3,000 miles west , darkening even the land of perpetual sunshine .
As much as players were not looking forward to flying across the country for the third time in two weeks , they were at least a little hopeful that some of the spectacle surrounding the team would dissipate here .
It had , but just a bit , as some local and national reporters listened in on Randolph ’s pregame session with the news media , interested to hear about a situation from the 1970s in the Bronx from a man who lived through it .
“ It ’s always there , ” Randolph said .
“ It ’s always around .
You ca n’t escape it . ”
Randolph acted relaxed , as if he were resigned to his uncertain fate , while meeting with reporters over the weekend .
He cracked jokes , offered thoughtful answers , and shed the defensive front that has dominated his interaction during his three and a half seasons as manager .
But Monday , sitting in the visiting dugout  a more cramped space than the dingy interview room at Shea Stadium  Randolph seemed a little more guarded .
“ What we talk about as a team is how we can get this thing going  period , ” Randolph said .
“ I just wish we could get back to that because that ’s really what it ’s all about .
We spend so much time talking about all this extracurricular stuff , man , and it ’s like , this team just needs to focus on playing winning baseball .
That ’s the way we started out in spring training , and that should be the main focus here .
It ’s unfortunate , but that ’s the way it should be . ”
Randolph watched most of the game from the top step of the dugout , leaning over the railing , and was often flanked by Peterson .
Their emotions mirrored the flow of the game .
When Luis Castillo ’s mishandling of a superb throw from Marlon Anderson allowed Chone Figgins to slide safely into second , Randolph grimaced and recoiled .
When Howie Kendrick lashed a Mike Pelfrey pitch for a run-scoring single in the fourth , Peterson violently slammed a rolled - up piece of paper against his hip .
When Aaron Heilman came in with two runners on base and struck out Vladimir Guerrero and Torii Hunter to end the Angels ’ three - run seventh , Randolph clapped vigorously as Peterson nodded beside him .
With the exception of Peterson , a leftover from Art Howe ’s tenure , all the other coaches have been hired by the Randolph - Minaya tandem .
Randolph said he was bothered by reports that some of them , people he considers friends as well as teammates , may not be with the team for much longer .
He said he was a little surprised but not completely blindsided last July when Minaya fired the hitting coach Rick Down , a close friend , and replaced him with Johnson .
He said that he had no feel now for what could happen .
Do n't fall victim to vampires !
Do n't get slashed by a psycho !
Do n't get stuck , ASK DR .
ELDRITCH !
Dear Dr. Eldritch ,
I accidentally sold myself into slavery !
Please help me get out of this contract !
While surfing the web a couple weeks ago , I saw a " Desktop Minion " utility that was really cute .
It was free , so I downloaded it .
When I came to the terms and conditions page , I just clicked " I agree . "
Well , a couple days later , these big guys show up at my door .
They asked if I was the one who downloaded the minion software , and when I said yes , they grabbed me , and threw me into a black van !
It turns out that there 's a clause that says I have to serve ten years of " indentured servitude " in exchange for the program !
I tried to argue that I had n't read everything in the agreement , but they just laughed .
Now I 'm being kept in a subterranean cavern with dozens of others who downloaded the software .
We 're being forced to do data mining , and the overseers whip us if we work too slowly .
We fight over the food , which is terrible , and what 's worse , we 're only allowed fifteen minutes of Internet a day !
There are no spam filters or pop -up blockers , so you can guess where most of that time goes .
I managed to email my family , and they contacted a lawyer .
She said that it was a binding legal contract , and I should have read it more carefully .
Some help !
I know I got myself into this , but there must be some way out , other than ten years working underground .
What can I do to escape ? -- Melinda , somewhere underground Dear Melinda ,
Let me guess ; you 're Internet savvy enough not to buy " Magical Pixie Dust " from unsolicited emails , so you were confident you could n't be fooled .
Now , most advice columnists would try to be supportive and validate your choices , but I have to ask :
What were you thinking ?
I know ; it did n't occur to you that someone would so cruelly exploit another 's carelessness .
I can see how you 'd believe this , as unscrupulous individuals have only been deceiving the gullible for , oh , thousands of years .
So it 's still rather new .
Perhaps you felt you were too smart to be tricked .
If so , I suggest you look around at your present circumstances and reassess .
You may be highly intelligent , but the opposite of " gullible " is not " clever , " it 's " incredulous " ( the judges would also accept " skeptical " ) .
Every day , bright people fall for scams , cons , cheap pick - up lines and advertising , so you 're in good company .
You would n't believe how many times Albert Einstein bought x-ray glasses from the back of a comic book .
I know ; I should n't be kicking you while you 're underground .
So let 's see what can be done .
I 've got some Bad News , and some Not - Quite - as - Bad News .
Bad News first :
Your lawyer is correct , an online EULA ( that 's End - User Licensing Agreement , of course ) is binding , and you fell for it lock , stock and pillory .
I trust you 'll be more careful in the future when you click .
The Less - Bad News is that there 's always an Escape Clause .
That 's a holdover from the ancient evil traps like opening puzzle boxes , reading mystical grimoires , or summoning demonic entities .
These are implied contracts , and the legal profession has continued the tradition .
As a side note , you 'd actually be better off if it were a magical contract , as enforcement is done by the arcane forces of magic , which are notoriously difficult to subvert .
Corporations often breach non-magical legal contracts when it becomes easier to default than to honor them .
But I digress .
Read the agreement very carefully , looking for any tiny loophole or condition that may nullify the contract .
If it 's air - tight , you may be required to challenge the corporation and beat its champion in a competition .
That 's fairly common .
How 's your chess game ?
The other option is to foment a rebellion !
Who has n't wanted to incite an angry mob to throw off their chains and rise up against the oppressors ?
True , it 's a mob of the sort of people who would download free software , but the promise of high - speed Internet access may stir them to be heroic .
Liberte ! Egalite !
ISP !
If it 's any comfort , I 'm told by my friends from the Future that a class - action lawsuit will eventually be won against companies that use deceptive EULA tactics .
After that , they 'll be required to provide a concise summary of terms , highlighting any unusual or unexpected conditions , like your servitude clause .
It does n't really help you now , but your suffering will help prevent future victims .
Perhaps they 'll send you some Magical Pixie Dust in gratitude .
Good luck , and let me know how it comes out ! -- Dr. Eldritch
In spite of reassurances from the Washington talking heads and policy wonks that the U.S. is not about to launch an attack on Iran , or countenance an Israeli strike , the Sunday Times has the real scoop :
“ President George W. Bush has told the Israeli government that he may be prepared to approve a future military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities if negotiations with Tehran break down , according to a senior Pentagon official .
“ Despite the opposition of his own generals and widespread skepticism that America is ready to risk the military , political , and economic consequences of an airborne strike on Iran , the president has given an ‘ amber light ’ to an Israeli plan to attack Iran ’s main nuclear sites with long - range bombing sorties , the official told The Sunday Times .
“ ‘ Amber means get on with your preparations , stand by for immediate attack , and tell us when you ’re ready , ’ the official said .
But the Israelis have also been told that they can expect no help from American forces and will not be able to use U.S. military bases in Iraq for logistical support . ”
It seems , however , that the Israelis have already been using U.S. bases in Iraq to train for the coming attack .
There have been denials all around  from the Iraqis , the Americans , and the Israelis  but both the Iraqi media and the Israeli media have reported , as the New York Post put it , that “ Israeli warplanes have been flying over Iraq and landing at U.S. bases there in preparation for an attack on Iran . ”
The Iraqi Web site Nahrainet reported Israeli fighter jets have been in rehearsals , so to speak , for their much - anticipated strike at Iran , flying at night over Jordanian airspace and arriving at U.S. air bases in Nasiriyah in southern Iraq and near Haditha in western Anbar province .
The Israelis , in concert with their amen corner in the U.S. , have been engaged in a propaganda blitz targeting Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons program , the whole point of which is not to pressure the Iranians into backing down , but to force the U.S. to take action in lieu of the Israelis going it alone .
Why fight if your big brother is willing to wage the battle ?
To that end , the Israelis are taking aim at Washington , rather than Tehran , in a full - scale political assault that shows every sign of succeeding where it counts  in the Oval Office .
The Times cites a top Pentagon official :
“ It ’s really all down to the Israelis .
This administration will not attack Iran .
This has already been decided .
But the president is really preoccupied with the nuclear threat against Israel and I know he does n’t believe that anything but force will deter Iran . ”
Translation : The U.S. will not be the first to attack Iran , but it may well join in once the Israelis get things started .
Laura Rozen , writing in Mother Jones , reports that a parade of Israeli officials  including Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi  is due in Washington over the next two weeks to impress upon the Americans the urgent necessity of taking military action .
Rozen spoke to neocon superhawk David Wurmser , former adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney on Middle Eastern affairs , who said :
“ ‘ Ultimately , my gut tells me that most of the administration on most levels would push back very hard , ’ on Israeli pressure on Washington to authorize it to strike Iran , Wurmser added .
‘ What those in the administration who do n’t want Israel to act probably wo n’t want is for it to be taken to the highest level .
They would always be afraid that [ the president ] might not be so tough on the Israelis .
If the Israeli [ government ] really intends to do something , they would go to the highest level without a lot of people knowing . ' ”
They may have gotten to the president already , as Rozen reports :
“ A former Pentagon intelligence official who spoke with Mother Jones also alleges that Meir Dagan , the chief of the Israeli intelligence service , the Mossad , held secret meetings with officials in the White House on Wednesday .
Neither the Israeli embassy nor National Security Council would comment on whether Dagan had been at the White House . ”
This is really the crux of the matter : George W. Bush .
Reckless , more radical than most of his advisers , and now dangerously fixated on his “ legacy , ” he is more determined than ever to leave his lasting mark on the Middle East and the world  and , given that the Constitution has been abandoned , and a single man can take us to war without the consent of Congress or the people , an apocalyptic departure from office seems more likely than not .
As in the run-up to the Iraq war , the prelude to this far greater conflict is marked by attempts to circumvent what one Bush official disdainfully referred to as “ the reality - based community ” and “ stove - pipe ” the Israelis ’ analysis of Iran intelligence into the White House .
Our own National Intelligence Estimate , compiled by the CIA and a raft of other intelligence - gathering outfits , says that the Iranians abandoned their nuclear weapons program years ago and they are n’t anywhere near weaponization of their nascent nuclear capabilities at the present time .
The Israelis beg to differ , and they are stating their case to Bush in person  whispering in a presidential ear that has been unusually receptive to them in the past .
Wurmser gives the odds of the Israelis attacking Iran before Bush leaves office as “ slightly , slightly above 50 - 50 . ”
If that happens , then it is only a matter of time  a very short time  before the U.S. is involved in a large - scale conflict with Iran that will send oil prices skyrocketing past $ 300 per barrel and bring the world economy to a screeching halt .
Not only that , but war with Tehran will upend the American political landscape and give John McCain more than a fighting chance to beat frontrunner Barack Obama .
In this context , the Israeli pressure for military action can be seen as a direct attempt to influence an American election that , so far , is not going to their liking .
Obama has openly stated that he favors negotiating with the Iranians , which is what the Israelis fear most .
How better to eliminate this possibility than by tying Obama ’s hands the moment he gets into office ?
With the U.S. already engaged in hostilities with Iran , negotiations will be off the table  and the Israelis will be off the hook .
The Telegraph reports that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently told one of his closest friends that “ in three months ’ time it will be a different Middle East . ”
Yes , and also , perhaps , a very different America
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
One of the best features of the Freedom and Prosperity Society conference I attended in Bodrum , Turkey , last month was meeting Sean Gabb , director of Britain ’s Libertarian Alliance , a teacher , novelist , and classical scholar .
Check out his report on the conference here .
The guy is a real pleasure to read .
Arizona Senator John McCain plans to call today for lifting the ban that prevents offshore oil and gas drilling along much of the US coastline - but would give states like Florida veto power over opening up their shores .
McCain , who plans to unveil his proposal in detail today , said yesterday that lifting the decades - old moratorium should be a " very high priority " with gasoline prices soaring .
He said that allowing states to explore for gas and oil " and perhaps providing additional incentives for states to permit exploration off their coasts ... would be very helpful in the short term in resolving our energy crisis " .
House Republicans are waging an increasingly aggressive push to lift both a congressional and a presidential ban that prevent exploration of the coastline .
An effort to lift the ban was defeated along partisan lines Wednesday in a House subcommittee meeting , but its sponsor plans to try again this week .
Democrats assailed McCain 's proposal .
Hari Sevugan , a spokesman for Barack Obama , said McCain 's " plan to simply drill our way out of our energy crisis is the same misguided approach backed by President Bush that has failed our families for too long and only serves to benefit the big oil companies " .
Florida lawmakers have long opposed any efforts to open the coastline to drilling and Senator Bill Nelson said that " any approach to weaken the moratorium on coastal oil drilling is irresponsible " .
" There is n't enough oil in the US to make even the smallest dent in world oil prices , which largely are being run up by unregulated traders and speculators , including the oil companies , " the Democratic senator said .
Ken Lundberg , a spokesman for Senator Mel Martinez , a Republican who has worked with Nelson to fend off efforts to explore the coast , said Martinez was " very sympathetic to the desire to increase domestic production " and was interested in seeing the details of McCain 's plan .
Congress has approved bans on offshore oil and gas leasing since the 1980s , allowing exploration only in the far western Gulf of Mexico and some parts of Alaska .
There 's also a presidential ban on exploration or drilling , which lasts until 2012 .
Facing similar pressure to open up more of the coastline to exploration , Florida 's congressional delegation in December 2006 reached a compromise to give up eight million acres in the Gulf of Mexico in exchange for the state getting at least a 125 - mile buffer zone from drilling .
House Republicans have pushed an effort to allow for drilling within 50 miles of the coastline ; McCain said yesterday that the distance should be the " subject of negotiation and discussion " .
" I 'm not dictating to the states that they drill or they engage in oil exploration , " he said at a news conference at his campaign headquarters in Alexandria , Virginia .
" I am saying that the moratoria should be lifted so that they have the opportunity to do so . "
McCain came under fire in Florida recently for opposing a national catastrophe insurance pool and voting against a bill that included money for restoring the Everglades , and his campaign stressed today to reporters that his push to open the coastline would allow states to make the call .
But he did not offer details on whether it would be up to state governors or legislatures .
And it remains uncertain whether state officials would remain united in opposition to drilling , given the pressure .
Florida Governor Charlie Crist , who has endorsed McCain , sidestepped the issue last week when asked whether he would support oil drilling off Florida 's coast .
" Number one , I do n't like it , " he said , " But nor do I like the price of gas and I do n't think the people of Florida are enjoying it either . "
McCain has angered his fellow Republicans for opposing drilling in Alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge .
He repeated his opposition yesterday .
" I believe that Anwr is a pristine area , " he said .
" Obviously , I 've felt that way ever since we put it in to permanent preservation status .
I do believe that there are places in the world , as I said , that we should not drill .
But I certainly think that there are areas off our coasts that should be open to exploration and exploitation .
And I hope we can take the first step by lifting the moratoria in order to do so . "
Thank you for ending that post with something completely irrelevant to the conversation .
Who cares if I drew large breasted females yesterday .
They were n't ' large breasted female versions of - INSERT CHARACTER HERE -' just girls .
Essentially parodies of parodies ?
Yeah , nice excuse .
What you completely fail to understand is that the game is n't about cute pinups and shit .
It 's about fighting .
And your little excuse does n't help you at all , because it 's still a bad execution .
But good idea , though .
I 've seen many female versions of the classes .
I do n't give a damn if you draw half naked men , or half naked woman .
As long as you stick to what the idea of the game [ or whatever else you 're doing ]
The Iraqi prime minister 's office said Mr Bush had called to apologise
US President George W Bush has made a personal apology over the shooting of a Koran by an American soldier , the White House has confirmed .
Mr Bush made the apology during one of his regular video conferences with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .
The soldier was sent home by the US military after the Muslim holy book was found riddled with bullet holes at a shooting range by Iraqi police .
The US military said last week that the soldier would be disciplined .
He was unnamed , but was said to be a staff sergeant in a sniper section .
' People 's anger '
Mr Maliki 's office said in a statement : " The American president apologised on behalf of the United States ... promising to present the soldier to the courts . "
Mr Maliki had expressed the anger felt by the Iraqi people , his office said .
A US military spokesman last week described the shooting as " both serious and deeply troubling " , but stressed it was an " isolated incident and a result of one soldier 's actions " .
US military authorities have already apologised to community leaders in the area , west of Baghdad .

Barack Obama has issued a new statement on FISA in response to the growing number of his supporters objecting to his position .
Genuine credit to him for being responsive this way and for having his site be a forum for disagreement among his supporters and himself .
Providing a forum for those sorts of debates is a sign of a secure and healthy campaign .
Despite that , the statement contains many dubious claims and , in a couple cases , outright misleading statements .
Worse , Obama 's statement only addressed the objections to the telecom immunity provisions of the bill , while ignoring the objections to the ( at least ) equally pernicious new warrantless eavesdropping powers the bill authorizes .
Taking Obama 's claims in order :
It grants retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that may have violated the law by cooperating with the Bush administration 's program of warrantless wiretapping .
This potentially weakens the deterrent effect of the law and removes an important tool for the American people to demand accountability for past abuses .
That 's why I support striking Title II from the bill , and will work with Chris Dodd , Jeff Bingaman and others in an effort to remove this provision in the Senate .
Obama says he will vote to remove immunity from the bill , but he knows full well that this effort will fail and that the final bill will have telecom immunity in it .
The bottom line is that he will nonetheless end up voting for this bill with immunity in it even though he previously vowed to support a filibuster of " any bill " that contains retroactive immunity .
Put another way , Obama claims he opposes telecom immunity but will vote for a bill that grants it .
But I also believe that the compromise bill is far better than the Protect America
Act that I voted against last year .
Whether it's better than the Protect America Act ( PAA ) is irrelevant .
The PAA already expired last February .
If the new FISA bill is rejected , we do n't revert back to the Protect America Act .
We just continue to live under the same FISA law that we 've lived under for 30 years ( with numerous post - 9/11 modernizing amendments ) .
So whether this bill is a mild improvement over the atrocious , expired PAA is not even a coherent reason to support it , let alone a persuasive one .
The exclusivity provision makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the FISA court .
The current FISA law -- as a federal court ruled just yesterday -- already has the same exclusivity provision , and it did nothing to stop the President and the telecoms from breaking the law anyway .
The fact that Obama is now going to vote to end the telecom lawsuits and immunize the lawbreakers means that there will be no consequences for their having broken the law .
How can Obama possibly claim that the " exclusivity " provision in the new FISA bill has value when the current law that they broke already has the same provision ?
As I wrote today :
They 're presenting as a " gift " something you already have , and telling you that you should give up critical protections in exchange for receiving something that you already have -- namely , a requirement that the President comply with eavesdropping laws .
What they 're doing is tantamount to someone who steals your wallet , takes all the money out , gives the empty wallet back to you , and then tells you that you should be grateful to them because you have your wallet .
Exclusivity is obviously no reason to change the current FISA law since it already has exclusivity in it .
Obama :
In a dangerous world , government must have the authority to collect the intelligence we need to protect the American people .
The government already has " the authority to collect the intelligence it needs to protect the American people . "
That authority is called FISA , which already allows the Government extremely broad authority to spy on any suspected terrorists .
The current law results in virtually no denials of any spying requests .
So how can Obama -- echoing the Bush administration -- claim a new law is needed to provide " the authority to collect the intelligence we need to protect the American people " when the current FISA law already provides that ?
But in a free society , that authority cannot be unlimited .
As I 've said many times , an independent monitor must watch the watchers to prevent abuses and to protect the civil liberties of the American people .
This compromise law assures that the FISA court has that responsibility .
This is just false .
The new FISA bill that Obama supports vests new categories of warrantless eavesdropping powers in the President ( .pdf ) , and allows the Government , for the first time , to tap physically into U.S. telecommunications networks inside our country with no individual warrant requirement .
To claim that this new bill creates " an independent monitor [ to ] watch the watchers to prevent abuses and to protect the civil liberties of the American people " is truly misleading , since the new FISA bill actually does the opposite -- it frees the Government from exactly that monitoring in all sorts of broad categories .
Why else would Bush and Cheney be so eager to have this bill if it did n't substantially expand the Government 's ability to eavesdrop without warrants ?
The Inspectors General report also provides a real mechanism for accountability and should not be discounted .
It will allow a close look at past misconduct without hurdles that would exist in federal court because of classification issues .
The recent investigation ( PDF ) uncovering the illegal politicization of Justice Department hiring sets a strong example of the accountability that can come from a tough and thorough IG report .
Having the Executive Branch investigate itself for alleged lawbreaking is not " oversight . "
In our system of Government , government officials and corporations which are accused of breaking the law are subjected to courts of law -- just like everyone else -- not to " investigations " by agencies within their own branches of government with very limited powers .
Marcy
Wheeler has more on the extremely limited capacity of Inspectors General to investigate lawbreaking at high levels of government .
The ability to monitor and track individuals who want to attack the United States is a vital counter - terrorism tool , and I 'm persuaded that it is necessary to keep the American people safe -- particularly since certain electronic surveillance orders will begin to expire later this summer .
Given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill , and losing important surveillance tools , I 've chosen to support the current compromise .
This is the most misleading part of Obama 's statement .
The " certain surveillance orders [ which ] will begin to expire later this summer " -- that Obama claims we must maintain -- are warrantless eavesdropping orders that were authorized by the PAA , which Obama voted against last August .
As I asked the other day :
Had Obama had his way , there never would have been any PAA in the first place , and therefore , there never would have been any PAA orders possible .
Having voted against the PAA last August , how can Obama now claim that he considers it important that the PAA orders not expire ?
How can he be eager to avoid the expiration of surveillance orders which he opposed authorizing in the first place ?
Moreover , the Government already has " the ability to monitor and track individuals who want to attack the United States " under the current FISA law .
Citing the need for such monitoring in order to justify this new FISA bill is just pure fear - mongering ( " you better let us eliminate FISA protections if you want us to keep you safe from the Terrorists " ) .
Obama has always said in the past that " the FISA court works . "
When did he change his mind and why ?
I do so with the firm intention -- once I 'm sworn in as president -- to have my Attorney General conduct a comprehensive review of all our surveillance programs , and to make further recommendations on any steps needed to preserve civil liberties and to prevent executive branch abuse in the future .
This expression of Obama 's " intention " has so many equivocations and vague claims as to be worthless .
In a society that lives under the rule of law , government officials and corporations which break our laws are held accountable by courts of law , not by vague promises from politicians of some future " review " and " recommendation " process grounded in claims that we can trust the Leader to do the right thing , whatever he decides in his sole discretion and infinite wisdom that might be .
That is no consolation for blocking courts from adjudicating whether laws were broken here , which is what the bill that Obama supports will do .
A working device could be used to enhance the acoustics of concert halls Being woken in the dead of night by noisy neighbours blasting out music could soon be a thing of the past .
Scientists have shown off the blueprint for an " acoustic cloak " , which could make objects impervious to sound waves .
The technology , outlined in the New Journal of Physics , could be used to build sound - proof homes , advanced concert halls or stealth warships .
Scientists have previously demonstrated devices that cloak objects from microwaves , making them " invisible " .
" The mathematics behind cloaking has been known for several years , " said Professor John Pendry of Imperial College London , UK , an expert in cloaking .
" What has n't been available for sound is the sort of materials you need to build a cloak out of . "
Sound shield
The Spanish team who conducted the new work believe the key to a practical device are so - called " sonic crystals " .
These artificial composites - also known as " meta- materials " - can be engineered to produce specific acoustical effects .
Sound waves are channelled around an object by sonic crystals " Unlike ordinary materials , their acoustic properties are determined by their internal structure , " explained Professor Pendry .
These would be used to channel any sound around an object , like water flowing around a rock in a stream .
" The idea of acoustic cloaking is to deviate the sounds waves around the object that has to be cloaked , " said Jose Sanchez - Dehesa of the Polytechnic University of Valencia , one of the researchers behind the new work .
He believes a material that consists of arrays of tiny cylinders would achieve this effect .
Simulations showed that 200 layers of this metamaterial could effectively shield an object from noise .
Thinner stacks would shield an object from certain frequencies .
" The thickness depends on the wavelength you want to screen , " he told BBC News .
Sub systems Dr Sanchez - Dehesa now wants to make and test such a material in the lab to confirm the simulations .
But researchers , such as Professor Pendry , believe the initial work is already an important first step .
Acoustic cloaks could be used to make soundproof rooms or buildings " It 's not an unrealistic blueprint - it does n't demand that we do extraordinary things , " he said .
" This is something that can easily be manufactured . "
If a material could be commercialised , both researchers believe it could have many applications .
Walls of the material could be built to soundproof houses or it could be used in concert halls to enhance acoustics or direct noise away from certain areas .
The military may also be interested , the researchers believe , to conceal submarines from detection by sonar or to create a new class of stealth ships .
However , the material may need to be optimised first .
" You do n't want to wrap a submarine in something that is heavy and several inches thick , " said Professor Pendry .
" It would add quite a lot to the Navy 's fuel bill , I think . "
Light touch
The research builds on work by scientists from Duke University in North Carolina , US , and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology .
Duke University researchers created an invisibility cloak in 2006 Earlier this year , independent teams from the two institutions demonstrated the mathematics necessary to create an acoustic cloak .
Other scientists have shown that objects can be cloaked from electromagnetic radiation , such as microwaves .
For example , in 2006 , scientists at Duke University showed how a small copper cylinder could be rendered invisible from microwaves .
The technique used a metamaterial consisting of 10 fibreglass rings covered with copper elements , to deflect the microwaves around the object and restore them on the other side .
To an observer it looked like the microwaves had passed straight through the cylinder .
Other researchers hope to build the holy grail of cloaking : an invisibility device that would channel light at wavelengths normally visible to the eye .
However , this technology is in a more primitive state , according to Dr Sanchez - Dehesa .
" We believe the acoustic cloak is more feasible than a similar device for light , " he said .

RE : PUZZLE FARTER , 6/2/08 draft
We think this draft represents progress from the 5/01/08 draft , but there are still areas that need to be addressed to make this the strongest possible casual videogame .
As always , we look forward to discussing these issues with you .
1. DEVELOPING THE CHARACTER ARC
We ’re lacking a clear backstory and dramatic arc for Puzzle Farter .
Why is this story happening to this character , now ?
Why is he so gassy ?
He is literally a fish out of water , but we never develop this idea .
Let ’s consider PRETTY WOMAN as a template : Puzzle Farter is trying to navigate a world in which he does n’t fit in , but in trying to understand it , reveals its absurdities .
( And falls in love .
See note # 4 . )
In this spirt , we ’d like to consider adding an event ( an “ Inciting Incident ” ) early in the story , explaining how Puzzle Farter entered this world .
Also , Puzzle Farter needs to talk .
He needs to clearly articulate his goals in a funny , relatable way .
We see Joe Pesci for the role , but are open to other suggestions .
2. KEEPING PUZZLE FARTER PROACTIVE
Currently , Puzzle Farter spends much of his time reacting to outside pressures .
We would like to find ways to keep him more in charge of the narrative — and for his decisions to have a deeper resonance in the story .
For example , right now , his only response to threats is to jump or run .
Can we see him kill or otherwise incapacitate the other characters ( hopefully in a charming way ) ?
Like Grand
Theft Auto 4 , we ’d also like to see a mission - based interface which would allow the character to explore on his own .
( The “ sandbox ” model . )
Also , we ’d like a system for keeping track of gold points .
3. CLARIFYING OBJECTIVES
The addition of doors to each level has gone a long way towards making it clear what Puzzle Farter is attempting to achieve in each encounter .
But we ’re missing a bigger goal :
What is Puzzle Farter hoping to find ?
What is his want ?
What does he need ?
( The conflict between these two questions can contribute a lot of second - act gravitas . )
Let ’s consider adding a Fish Sister , who is kidnapped in the prologue .
This would go a long way towards strengthening our Villain Plot .
4. LOVE INTEREST
Puzzle Farter needs a love interest , someone who can match him toot for toot .
We think Rachel McAdams would be perfect .
Also , players need to be able to select gender , so as not to eliminate the gay gamer demographic .
5. MULTIPLAYER
The game needs to be multiplayer .
We should also discuss making it a MMORPG .
6. RATING AND CONTENT
To appeal to families , we need to be sensitive to content concerns .
Let ’s replace the farting with something less offensive .
( Natural News )
The United States ranks worst among developed nations in the number of preventable deaths , according to a study conducted by researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and published in the journalResearchers tracked how many preventable deaths took place in 19 developed nations between 2002 and 2003 .
A preventable death was defined as one that would not have occurred if the patient had access to timely and effective health care .
The United States ranked dead last , with 109.7 preventable deaths for every 100,000 people .
France came in first , with 64.8 , followed by Japan and Australia , with 71.2 and 71.3 , respectively .
Following Australia , in order , were : Spain , Italy , Canada , Norway , the Netherlands , Sweden , Greece , Austria , Germany , Finland , New Zealand , Denmark , Britain , Ireland , Portugal and the United States .
If the U.S. health care system functioned as well as that of France , 101,000 fewer people would die each year , the researchers found .
According to researcher Ellen Nolte , the poor showing of the United States came largely from the large number of U.S. residents that lack health insurance - 47 million , or more than 15 percent .
" I think health care in the United States is pretty good if you have access , " Nolte said .
" But if you do n't , I think that 's the main problem , is n't it ?
"
In preventable death data from 1997 - 1998 , France and Japan still ranked first and second , respectively .
At that time , the United States ranked 15th .
The drop in the U.S. ranking came from the fact that while preventable deaths decreased an average of 16 percent in the 19 countries between 1998 and 2003 , the U.S. decrease was only 4 percent .
" It is startling to see the United States falling even farther behind on this crucial indicator of health system performance , " said Cathy Schoen , senior vice president of the health policy foundation Commonwealth Fund , noting that " other countries are reducing these preventable deaths more rapidly , yet spending far less . "
Michael Vick Makes 12 Cents an Hour
is making 12 cents ( 12 cents too much ) an hour while he is serving his time at Leavenworth Prison for his involvement in a dogfighting ring .
Falcons owner Arthur Blank must be keeping in touch with the football star and said that Vick is doing the best he can in the joint and when not writing letters or doing the dishes , he is playing quarterback in the courtyard .
Vick , who received a whopping $ 37 million signing bonus from the Falcons , was ordered to return nearly $ 20 million to the team .
Do n't be looking for the wayward QB to be back in action any time soon .
His release date is July 2009 .
Vick might want to donate his dishwashing funds to an animal charity of some sort .
For more details on Vick 's legal trouble and sentencing , check it out here .
Last month , Google C.E.O.
Eric Schmidt , who sits on Apple 's board of directors , revealed that he 's been compelled to leave Apple board meetings on more than one occasion because Google 's mobile - device platform , Android , poses a direct challenge to Apple 's iPhone .
If Google were to adopt a similar practice of asking its directors with conflicts of interest to step outside , its board meetings might start getting pretty small .
The first to get the heave - ho would be John Doerr , who finds himself on the other side of the Android - iPhone fault line :
In March , Doerr launched the $ 100 million iFund to invest in companies writing applications for the iPhone .
If Google 's board went on to discuss App Engine , Google 's cloud computing initiative , Doerr would again have to excuse himself since he sits on the board of Amazon , whose fast - growing Web - services business competes directly with App Engine .
Should the conversation turn to Google 's vigorous efforts to optimize its services for the iPhone , Doerr could return to the meeting .
But if talk veered toward Google 's plans to acquire wireless spectrum , John Hennessy , who sits on Cisco 's board , might have to recuse himself , since Cisco has scrapped publicly with Google over who deserves to get the biggest slice of the new wireless broadband spectrum being auctioned off by the Federal Communications Commission .
Google 's venture - capital investments ?
Sergey Brin should take a walk — after all , his new bride , Ann Wojcicki , is a founder of bio - info startup 23andMe .
After Brin returns , perhaps the board would like to address tactics in the pitched battle between Google 's Checkout payment service and eBay 's PayPal .
Might director Ann Mather , who served as a board member for Shopping.com before eBay acquired it for $ 634 million in 2005 , care to head to the cafeteria for a coffee ?
Of course , Google is n't deliberately stacking its board with representatives from its competitors .
It 's just that , as anyone whose business Google has targeted with its ever - expanding arsenal of services knows , there 's no escaping the Googleplex .
One suggestion : Rather than asking its directors to run hither and thither , Google could have its engineers build a boardroom version of the Cone of Silence from this summer 's film version of Get Smart .

Outgoing President George W. Bush and both of his presumptive replacements John McCain and Barack Obama are rumored to be in attendance at this year ’s Bohemian Grove gathering , an annual get - together of the global elite staged inside a sprawling forest encampment which kicks off tonight and runs until July 27 .
Bohemian Grove is a 136 - year - old all - male encampment complete with restaurants , bars , stages and lodges , which caters to around 2,000 members of the global elite along with Californian hoi polloi on a yearly basis in July .
The camp is set within a 2,700 acre secluded forest replete with giant redwood trees .
Former attendees include Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon , who both went on to become President , as well as regulars like Henry Kissinger , Alan Greenspan , David Rockefeller , Colin Powell , as well as George W. Bush and his father .
In 2000 radio host and film maker Alex Jones infiltrated the gathering and caught exclusive video footage of a bizarre mock human sacrifice ritual , known as “ the cremation of care ” , under a 40 foot stone owl that the members refer to as Molech .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Attendees dress up like Klan members in hooded robes and perform druidic pagan ceremonies to mark the spectacular finale of the event .
In 2004 , The New York Post reported that top gay porn star Chad Savage was hired by the Grove to “ service ” its members during the event and “ attend to their every need ” .
“ When they ’re not listening to policy speeches , “ Bohos ” are known to urinate freely in the redwoods and perform mock - druidic rituals that revolve around a 40 - foot - tall stone owl .
In one ritual , called “ Cremation of Care , ” members wearing red - hooded robes cremate a coffin effigy of “ Dull Care ” at the base of the owl altar , ” the report stated .
Alex Jones discusses the shocking footage he obtained during his 2000 infiltration of the Grove .
Homosexual orgies are known to be part of the festivities enjoyed by the predominately “ Christian conservative ” leaders who go there .
Former attendee Richard Nixon once referred to the Grove as , “ the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine . ”
A reader who got a summer job working at the Grove in 2005 , Chris Jones , told us that he was regularly propositioned for sex by the old men attending the encampment and asked if he “ slept around ” and wanted to have some fun .
Jones was later sentenced to three years in jail by California authorities for simply showing a tape of his visit to minors .
However , the media ’s attitude to hundreds of powerbrokers attending an event at which the Manhattan Project was known to have been born , while frolicking around dressed up as women pissing up trees and having gay sex , has been sophomoric to say the least .
One such hit piece in the Sacramento News & Review , which ties the Grove as well as public organizations such as the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission with shape - shifting reptoid conspiracies , is useful for only one piece of information – the claim that Presidential hopeful John McCain may be attending this year ’s gathering .
George W. Bush and his father give a lakeside talk at Bohemian Grove in this photo from the Grove ’s annual yearbook .
In addition , according to an Arizona Daily Star report about a different subject , President Bush ’s schedule for next week has not been released , meaning Bush , a regular attendee with his father to Bohemian Grove in past years , could be set to make a visit at some point to mark the last year of his presidency .
Tellingly , both McCain and Democratic candidate Barack Obama will be in California from Saturday to Tuesday , during which time both candidates are scheduled to speak at the National Council of La Raza , a racist Mexican separatist group that advocates a violent overthrow of the southwestern U.S. states .
Their schedule puts them in the perfect location to enjoy a night at the Grove this weekend .
Two years ago we were able to accurately surmise then British Prime Minister Tony Blair ’s visit to the Grove , which coincided with a visit to San Francisco where he met with powerbrokers .
Thus far , there has only been one other mainstream report concerning the event , an article entitled Power brokers due at Bohemian Grove , appearing in the Santa Rosa Press Democrat , a local paper that routinely covers the gathering .
“ Critics , who until recent years mounted protests outside its gates , say the gatherings serve as strategy sessions for a New World Order operating outside democratic institutions , ” states the article .
“ Most critics raise the specter of national policy with global implications coming from behind the gates of an exclusive , closed - door gathering of largely conservative , wealthy white men . ”

Comment on this article
This article from the AP was posted yesterday , reporting the sale and transport of 550 metric tons of yellowcake uranium from Iraq to Canada .
Some of the leading right wing blogs were quick to hail the find as a significant victory for the Bush administration and proof of Saddam 's WMD program , but as Daniel De Groot at Open Left Points out , their celebrations may be a bit premature , if not dishonest :
I noted last night that a supply of uranium from Iraq had been successfully moved to Montreal in secrecy .
If you check into this , you 'll quickly find that the uranium a ) was not weapons grade and b ) was well known to the UN and IAEA and was being stored legally by Saddam 's government .
It was legally in Iraq according to international law .
I wondered if the right wing echo chamber would use this as " proof " that the WMD claims were true after all .
I got even better than I hoped , as not only do they use it that way , but they reveal how dishonest they are by the way they have done this .

When you ’re at work , you probably sometimes get emails that you do n’t want to deal with .
Maybe you missed a deadline and have yet to ‘ fess up , or are supposed to meet with your boss and know it ’s going to be ugly .
But eventually you deal with it , because you ’re responsible and know you ca n’t avoid the situation forever .
Unless , of course , you ’re the Bush White House , in which case you stick your fingers in your ears and start singing loudly and shouting “ I ’m rubber and you ’re glue ! ” every time your co-workers try to bring up the issue .
From the New York Times :
The White House in December refused to accept the Environmental Protection Agency ’s conclusion that greenhouse gases are pollutants that must be controlled , telling agency officials that an e-mail message containing the document would not be opened , senior E.P.A. officials said last week .
The document …ended up in e-mail limbo , without official status .
Now , “ e- mail limbo ” is certainly a concept with which the White House is familiar , though it ’s not totally clear how they played this one .
Did they open the email in order to reply to it , but leave the attached report untouched ?
Or did they just take one look at the subject line and start a second email thread about how they were n’t going to open the first one ?
They must have looked at something , because for the past week they ’ve been pressuring EPA officials to cut huge sections of the supposedly unseen report .
The final version , due out as early as next Wednesday , will contain no conclusions , only a general discussion of the issue .
What is the White House trying to hide ?
According to the Times article , a conclusion estimating that the government could save up to $ 2 trillion over the next three decades by strictly regulating greenhouse gas emissions .
You ’d think an administration $ 400 billion in debt would be shouting that number from the rooftops .
But this kind of knee - jerk anti-regulatory reaction defies all logical engagement .
Everyone already knows that greenhouse gases are bad for the environment — Bush has even said so himself .
To ignore that reality for the sake of ideological purity is childish , and its repercussions will last a hell of a lot longer than it would have taken to read one uncomfortable email .

In 25 years on Wall Street , I have never seen things this bad .
We ’ve had some tough times : the 1987 stock - market crash , the collapse of the once - all - powerful Drexel Burnham Lambert , the immolation of Long Term Capital , the post - 9/11 calamity , and the dot - com implosion .
Every one of these events rocked the Street , causing pay cuts and layoffs and creating a sense of doom .
But this time is different ; it ’s doom itself .
Wall Street closely guards its layoff numbers , but piece together the evidence and a grim picture appears : an estimated worldwide total of 4,000 dismissals at Morgan Stanley , 5,000 at Merrill Lynch , 7,000 at UBS , and 16,000 at Citigroup .
Even the extremely profitable Goldman Sachs is letting people go in some departments .
Then there ’s Bear Stearns .
A year ago , Bear was the firm to work at .
People talked of the Era of Bear .
Now it ’s gone .
Vanished .
With more than 10,000 of its 14,000 former employees either looking for work or soon to be laid off by its new owner , JPMorgan .
Right , JPMorgan — the firm that seemed to pants the Fed and Treasury when it snapped up Bear Stearns for a pittance .
Well , it now appears possible that Morgan may have grossly underestimated how terrible the Bear bond portfolio may be .
The thinking on the Street was that Morgan could n’t miss ; it got $ 30 billion in guarantees against losses .
But now it looks like the losses might exceed the guarantees .
For those of us looking to Morgan as the best - capitalized play on Wall Street after Goldman , one that could emerge as a strong player when things get better , the possibility that the Fed got the better end of the deal is chilling .
As if all that were n’t bad enough , news came last week that Lehman Brothers is fighting for its corporate life .
As someone who has great respect for Lehman CEO Dick Fuld , I ’m stunned at the size of the reported $ 2.8 billion loss for the quarter just finished , especially considering how confident the company was about its prospects for that quarter a couple of months ago .
They just raised $ 6 billion in capital at what I thought were fire - sale prices , but immediately the stock went below the $ 28 offering price , even though that figure already represented a hefty discount versus the previous week ’s price .
The people who bought into this deal have to feel like they just leased an apartment in Dresden after the first 400 bombers hit , not realizing that there were another 900 behind them .
Lehman ’s compensation costs are so out of control that it ’s going to need to break out the electric bleachers to downsize ahead of the short - selling posse .
It already reassigned CFO Erin Callan and COO Joseph Gregory .
The 28,100 overpaid , underworked employees who remain in place are simply ballast on Lehman ’s leaky ship .
In typical times , the castoffs from these sinking ( or sunk ) firms would have no problem finding jobs .
When Drexel collapsed , or Deutsche Bank picked off Bankers Trust , or Prudential eliminated its equities business , there was always some shop on the rise , looking to hire .
But these are not typical times .
This time around , no firm — no area of the business — is rising .
Every product , from stocks and bonds to mergers and acquisitions to corporate finance , is under pressure at every bank .
The clients themselves , fresh from getting talked into buying horrid complex products , many of them mortgage - related , are not exactly eager to buy anything exotic , which is where the big fees have been coming from in recent years .
Worse , the same clients sold lots of those exotic products back to the firms that issued them , and I do n’t believe all the write - downs on that acid - reflux inventory have been taken yet , particularly at Lehman , Merrill , and Citigroup .
I expect tens of billions more in write - downs from those three firms alone .
At the same time , a host of other profit sources are drying up .
Private - equity deals have shut down almost completely , as the slowdown in the economy has stoked fears that the newly privatized , debt - laden companies wo n’t be able to make good on their bonds .
The banks are no longer generating profits from lending hedge funds billions to buy product , because the brokers ended up taking a beating when the clients borrowed too much and then began to default on those loans .
The bankers and brokers had moved aggressively into these fixed - income revenue rivers in the first place because the equities - trading game , long a mainstay of all of these firms , had become so commoditized that it was impossible to make money from it .
To make matters worse , former attorney general Eliot Spitzer destroyed a once - sweet fee - generating scam — the practice in which banks ’ research departments wrote rosy reports about companies in order to win their investment - banking business and rake in the M&A profits .
No wonder all of these stocks are at or near their multiyear lows , depths not seen since the dot - com aftermath of 2002 , when Wall Street last shriveled .
Not all is grim .
Morgan Stanley , for one , is making a concerted effort to build an asset - management business , where it takes clients ’ monies and manages them in - house .
That ’s nowhere near as lucrative as selling proprietary mortgage bonds , or other exotic products , but asset management tends to have a longer half - life because individual money is “ sticky , ” not “ hot ” — it stays in one place .
Then there is Goldman Sachs .
Goldman , from the days that I worked there in the eighties , always had a phrase , “ long - term greedy , ” that it used to discourage those brokers who wanted to make a trade that made a quick buck for the salespeople but was n’t in the best interest of the client .
“ Give them the dollars , you take the pennies , and they will be with you for life , ” my old boss used to say .
That approach is why the firm never fell into the Bear trap , and why it ’s been able to buy back 11 percent of its equity in the past four years , rather than issue billions of dollars in value - diluting stock .
I am an inherent optimist about Wall Street .
Every time I ’ve seen one business go down , there was always a replacement business right behind it .
The Street was always like a four - engine plane :
It could handle one , even two engines going down , and keep flying .
Now , though , it feels like all the engines — investment banking , bonds , equities , and mergers and acquisitions — have shut down at once .
Try as I might to see where new business can come from , I do n’t see it coming anytime soon .
That ’s bad news for the banks and their shareholders .
It ’s bad news for the 200,000 or so people who work on the Street and the estimated 850,000 who buy and sell securities nationwide .
And it ’s bad news for the New York co-op owners , real - estate brokers , and others who benefit from Wall Street largesse .
God knows why , but people often call me to see if I can help place them or their brother or daughter or nephew at a Wall Street firm .
There was a time when I would happily say yes ; sometimes my help even worked .
Not anymore .
These days , I do n’t even bother .
The era of the big Wall Street payday is over .
When people call me looking for a job , I tell them to try a law firm .

For a country with a population smaller than a mid-size Canadian city , Iceland has produced a disproportionate number of critically acclaimed musicians : Björk , GusGus , Múm ... actually , that 's almost it .
And it 's probably not a stretch to say that if a certain British band had n't taken a shine to them , Sigur Rós would be wallowing in similar obscurity to fellow Icelandic noisemakers Cynic Guru .
Remember their hit , " Doom Master " ?
No ?
Interesting ...
If you were conscious in 1999 , and reading really egotistical music magazines like Ray Gun , you might remember Ágætis byrjun , and how it became that album it was really cool to own , but that no one ever actually listened to it .
It had all the requisite ingredients : incomprehensible name , singer who sounded like a whale and sang in a made - up language , long instrumentals with spooky string sections .
Naturally I loved it , and still consider it one of my 25 desert - island albums .
Recently Sigur Rós released a tour DVD , Heima , which chronicled the band members ' two - week trek through their homeland , staging free concerts and performing in schools and coffee shops .
The trailer still gives me goose bumps , but I 'm a sucker for sweeping vistas , accents and hand lettering .
It displays a band at the height of its powers , so to speak , captivating crowds that , apart from the allure of a free concert , might otherwise never have listened to them .
( Watch the faces of the children in the crowd as they become absolutely captivated . )
Now the band is set to release its fifth LP , Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust , which , according to the website , translates as " with a buzz in our ears we play endlessly , " and which is currently streaming for free .
The first single " Gobbledigook , " and many other tracks , is available as a download .
It might seem odd to say this about an album with such an unwieldy title , but this could be Sigur Rós 's most accessible album to date .
" Gobbledigook " channels The Flaming Lips with slippery acoustic guitars , foot - stomping percussion and what sounds like chanting from outer space .
" Góðan Daginn " is what passes for a ballad in the Sigur Rós universe .
Of course , this accessibility might come at the cost of what made Sigur Rós so interesting in the first place .
Or as one friend put it , " It 's like Radiohead going to their back catalogue , but ignoring Kid A or OK Computer and mining The Bends instead .
Not a bad thing ... but a little disappointing . "
Perhaps it was in sensing this lack of musical innovation that the band turned to photographer Ryan McGinley to shoot the above album cover and inspire the naked romp of a first video .
Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust officially comes out June 23 .
Sigur Rós 's only scheduled tour stop in B.C. is at Vancouver 's Orpheum Theatre on Sept. 27 , 2008 .

Alex Jones takes 32 drugs each day for his epilepsy ( Photo : Merthyr Express )
A mother has been told she cannot travel to school with her severely epileptic son because she has not been police checked .
Jayne Jones , of Aberfan near Merthyr Tydfil , used to travel with her son Alex , 14 , in the council - provided taxi when she feared he may have a fit .
But Merthyr Tydfil council has told her this must stop until she has undergone a Criminal Records Bureau ( CRB ) check .
The council said this was a standard requirement for escorting children .
Mrs Jones , 41 , who is Alex 's full - time carer , said : " I still do n't understand why being his parent and being trained to use his drugs , I 'm not allowed in the taxi .
" I would be in no contact with any children other than my own child .
" It would be a case of me going to school and catching a bus home and that 's it .
" I really do n't understand it . "
Mrs Jones said she was in the process of being CRB - checked but was not allowed to travel with her son until it had been completed .
My husband and I are the only ones trained to give or use any medication for Alex
Jayne Jones Alex , who requires 24 - hour care , has cerebral palsy and epilepsy .
Mrs Jones said he required 32 anti-convulsant drugs each day and had an operation on Boxing Day last year to try to control his epilepsy .
He has been fitted with a Vagus Nerve Stimulation device which sends an electrical pulse to the brain at regular intervals .
These signals help control electrical signals in the brain that cause seizures .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Alex attends Greenfield school near Merthyr Tydfil and travels in a taxi with a driver and an escort .
But Mrs Jones said the driver and escorts were not trained to use Alex 's medication .
" My husband and I are the only ones trained to give or use any medication for Alex , " she said .
" If you use any kind of anti-convulsant drugs , you have to be trained to use them , they can't be handed over willy - nilly to anybody .
" If we can't get in the cab with him , then he 's being put at risk . "
Mrs Jones who also has another son , 8 - year - old Lucas , said the experience had impacted on her whole family .
" What 's important to us is Alex 's wellbeing - Lucas knows which drugs Alex needs to stay alive - he 's very caring .
" What we need now is to resolve the matter before September hopefully , " she added .
A spokesperson for Merthyr council said : " We cannot comment on particular cases but can confirm that CRB checking is a requirement of our transport provisions in relation to adults travelling on home - to - school transport in the capacity of an escort .
" This is a standard requirement and has been for several years .
" Any adult acting as an escort will , in the public gaze , be viewed as acting with the full acquiescence of the council and hence with its implied authority .
" For the protection of the council and all vulnerable persons in its care it 's essential all those endowed with an authority , implicit or explicit , should meet the security requirements within the transport contract provisions . "

The new shower curtain smell may be hazardous to your health , warns a new study from the Center for Health Environment and Justice ( CHEJ ) .
The study tested vinyl shower curtains from popular stores such as :
Bed Bath & Beyond
Kmart
Sears
Target
Wal - Mart .
PVC ( vinyl ) shower curtains can release as many as 108 volatile organic chemicals .
Some of these chemicals cause developmental damage as well as damage to the liver and central nervous , respiratory , and reproductive systems .
In addition , some chemicals were found in the air 28 days after a PVC shower curtain was unwrapped and hung .
This investigation shows that PVC shower curtains are significant contributors to indoor air pollution .
Read report ( PDF )
According to the study :
During a CBS interview , the study 's director pointed out that :
When you open a new vinyl shower curtain in your home , you 'll experience a strong chemical odor .
Over the years we have received a lot of complaints from parents and consumers concerned about experiencing headaches and other health problems associated with the exposure to the new shower curtain smell .
The EPA classifies seven of the chemicals that we found as hazardous air pollutants .
Unfortunately , the testing did not replicate the higher temperature and humidity conditions found in regular showering conditions , which may increase concentrations of pollutants released from the curtain .
However , the CHEJ speculated that the concentration of chemicals are likely to be greater during a shower than those reported by the study .
How to avoid dangerous shower curtains
The study offered two suggestions :
" Avoid shower curtains made with PVC , as well as other PVC products , especially those that are fexible .
These products are not always labeled although some may be labeled as “ vinyl ” or “ PVC . ”
Do not buy shower curtains that are not labeled .

The environmentalist movement believes that unless immediate and drastic measures are taken to combat global warming , “ disease , desolation and famine ” are “ inevitable ” on a scale that might spell the end of life on earth , making earth “ as hot as Venus . ”
Surely , such an apocalyptic threat demands immediate action .
Given the resistance to curtailing industrial production ( not to mention the economic destruction and mass death that such a curtailment would entail ) , environmentalists should eagerly supports experiments that attempt to compensate rather than eliminate the impact of industry on the environment .
In fact , a number of relatively simple , low - cost measures have been proposed by scientists and entrepreneurs , one of which is documented in the June 2008 issue of Popular Science ( PDF ) .
As early as 1988 , oceanographers proposed seeding the oceans with iron , which would cause an algae bloom that could rapidly compensate for the entire effect of industrial civilization for far less money that it would cost to eliminate CO2 emissions .
Seeding experiments by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have demonstrated that the technique works , although further experimentation is required .
A number of entrepreneurs , such as Russ George of Planktos Corp ( TED video ) stepped forward to carry out the required work .
How would you expect environmental groups to react to such an opportunity ?
If you guessed outright or even cautious optimism , you would be dead wrong .
“ I do n’t think any quick geo - engineering fixes are going to work , ” said one Greenpeace scientist .
“ There are only two ways that we ’re going to solve climate change : reduce the amount of energy that we use and dramatically change the methods we use to generate it . ”
According to Scientific American , environmental groups were essentially united in the belief that “ if society relies on quick techno - fixes to ameliorate global warming … people will stop putting in the hard work necessary to cut carbon emissions . ”
Think about what that statement means .
“ Hard work ” means government coercion to destroy the industrial production that feeds ( sometimes barely ) a rapidly growing human population .
“ Quick engineering fix ” means a fast , cheap , technological solution that allows us to have our cake ( the wealthy , healthy life that industry makes possible ) and eat it too ( literally , algae eating CO2 ) .
Notice that their objection is not that iron seeding wo n’t work , but that it eliminates the incentive to destroy industrial civilization .
As the article make clear , environmentalists are violently opposed to even exploring any measure that attempts to neutralize the “ threat ” of global warming rather than deal with the cause .
Lies and intimidation are integral to the movement : the terrorist group Sea Shepherd , which has sunk nine ships since 1979 , threatened any future seeding experiments , their PR machine used fear of nanotechnology to claim that iron ore ( plain rust ) is “ engineered nanoparticles , ” while their political branch got the Spanish government to ban seeding on the grounds that it constitutes “ toxic waste ” dumping .
As should be clear by now , environmentalism is not actually opposed to global warming – ending the “ threat ” posed by global warming is the last thing on their agenda .
Their real goal is to use the global warming scare to bully the developed world into reverting into the pre-industrial , pre-civilized age .
They oppose viable alternative energy sources for the same reason that they oppose viable fixes to the crises they invent – they oppose nuclear energy , hydro power , and they are organizing to oppose wind power just as it has become viable .
If solar panels ever become viable , they will certainly invent reasons to oppose them too .
( Note that I am not actually advocating iron ore seeding .
I am not convinced that the climate is warming as rapidly as claimed , or that CO2 is the cause , and even it is , it is likely that higher CO2 levels and a warmer climate offer tremendous benefits to both plant and animal life .
If anything , we should be encouraging measures that make our world greener and more comfortable . )
Official : Bush vetoes $ 300 billion farm bill
President Bush vetoed the $ 300 billion farm bill on Wednesday , calling it a tax increase on regular Americans at a time of high food prices in the face of a near - certain override by Congress .
It was the 10th veto of Bush 's presidency .
But since it passed both houses of Congress with veto - proof majorities , his action was likely to be canceled out by new votes .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said lawmakers should think twice before they do that .
" Members are going to have to think about how they will explain these votes back in their districts at a time when prices are on the rise , " she said .
" People are not going to want to see their taxes increase . "
The bill approved earlier this month includes increased subsidies for farmers and food stamps for the poor .
With grocery prices going up dramatically , the measure also was sprinkled with pet projects that lawmakers can take home to voters this election year .
Perino said the bill is $ 20 billion over the current baseline - " way too much to ask taxpayers right now . "
" This bill is bloated , " she said .
" When grocery bills are on the rise , Congress is asking families to pay more in subsidies to wealthy farmers at a time of record farm profits . "
A Google Groups thread has a webmaster who has been receiving a lot of rogue spider attacks from the Africa region .
He wants to go as far as ban the whole continent of Africa .
But he is concerned that by doing so , he will also hurt his Google rankings .
It is actually not all that uncommon for network administrators to block specific regions of web traffic .
In fact , I believe my office blocks the Asia and Africa regions from entering our network ( not this site , but my office network ) .
We pretty much banned that whole region , because we have no reason to allow those regions in ( in most cases , but things have come up ) .
Would blocking the whole Africa hurt this guys search rankings in Google ?
Googler , JohnMu , stepped in to say that by blocking an entire region , it would " be considered cloaking " and would be against Google 's Webmaster Guidelines .
Got that , if you block specific regions of traffic , like everyone outside of the US , that is cloaking and against Google 's guidelines .
Do I agree with this policy ?
In many cases , no .
If your site is local in nature and having visitors from outside a specific region does n't make sense for your bandwidth bill , then it is up to the site owner to make that call .
Of course , there may be users outside of a specific region that are your target audience , but in many cases people take the route of percentages and are willing to have some collateral damage .
John does give some excellent advice , advice that is not as easy as blocking a whole region via the Router but good advice in any event .
He said , instead you should " add blocks based on the user 's activity , not based on his location . "
Of course , then you need to build algorithms and software that detects certain activities and blocks them based on that activity .
More tips on that type of detection here .
Forum discussion at Google Groups .
Update : Danny Sullivan and I talked to Google about this .
Googles revised statement on this is summed up in a comment Danny , where Google said :
As long as the web server always blocks IPs from ( say ) Africa , it 's not doing anything special / different for Googlebot , and so it would n't be considered cloaking , but geolocation instead .
Plus , Matt Cutts of Google gives a little more on what happened here :
Yup , what Danny said .
The downside of doing a lot more talking to webmasters and site owners is that sometimes we 'll misspeak , but I 'd much rather have that problem and sometimes need to clarify than not be talking to webmasters as much .
Barry , thanks for highlighting this , and JohnMu , thanks for always being willing to answer questions in the Google webmaster discussion group .
We have posted a new article on this retraction over here .
BOGOTA , Colombia ( AP )  Colombian peasants devoted 27 % more land to growing coca last year , the United Nations reported Wednesday , calling the increase " a surprise and a shock " given intense efforts to eradicate cocaine 's raw ingredient .
Estimated cocaine production , however , increased only slightly in Colombia and other Andean nations — to about 994 metric tons in 2007 from 984 metric tons the year before , according to the U.N. — as cultivation shifted to smaller , less - productive plots in more remote locations .
The net increase in coca farmland came despite " record " U.S. - backed eradication efforts that disrupted the growing cycle , said Gen. Oscar Naranjo , the chief of Colombia 's police .
" These young crops , the new ones , are less productive , both in the number of leaves and in terms of the potency of the leaf , " Naranjo said , and coca farmers in remote locations can't get chemicals needed to process the leaves as easily .
Still , coca farmers are aggressively tearing down forest to make way for crops and laboratories , and the young plants will eventually produce much more coca if eradication efforts do n't keep up .
" The increase in coca cultivation in Colombia is a surprise and shock : a surprise because it comes at a time when the Colombian government is trying so hard to eradicate coca ; a shock because of the magnitude of cultivation , " said Antonio Maria Costa , director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime .
In all , 99,000 hectares , or 382 square miles , of coca cultivation were found in Colombia last year , up from 78,000 hectares in 2006 , according to the UNODC 's annual survey .
Total cultivation in Colombia , Peru and Bolivia — the world 's three principal sources of coca — grew 16 % to 181,600 hectares , or 701 square miles .
Costa noted in his statement that " just like in Afghanistan , where most opium is grown in provinces with a heavy Taliban presence , in Colombia most coca is grown in areas controlled by insurgents . "
Farmers are quickly replanting and minimizing the damage from aerial spraying by planting herbicide - resistant hybrids and coating plants with cane juice , said Bruce Bagley , an international studies professor at the University of Miami .
" Areas that have been sprayed have then been brought back into production , " Bagley said .
" It 's time for aerial spraying to give way to other programs . "
Colombia 's drug police sprayed herbicide on 153,000 hectares of coca and manually eradicated another 65,000 hectares last year , which Naranjo called " unprecedented in the worldwide fight against illegal crops . "
Washington has spent more than US$ 5 billion to help Colombia combat its long - running insurgency and the world 's largest cocaine industry .
About 80 % goes to the military , and only 20 % to social efforts to wean farmers off coca .

ちなみに、コード は /lang/sql/mysql_timeline - CodeRepos :: Share - Trac に置いてあります 。C++ で約 120 行 ( ＋同程度のラッパライブラリ )
なので、簡単に理解できると思います。実際のアクセスパターンをコードに直接書けばいいので、むしろ
SQL をチューニングするより簡単かもしれません。コアのコードはこんな感じ。
int4store( follower_keybuff , user_id ) ; if ( follower_tbl-> file->index_read_map(follower_tbl->record[0 ] , follower_keybuff , 1 , HA_READ_PREFIX ) == 0 ) { do { unsigned follower_id = follower_follower_id_fld->val_int ( ) ; int4store( message_keybuff , follower_id ) ; if ( message_tbl->file->index_read_map(message_tbl->record[0 ] , message_keybuff , 1 , HA_READ_PREFIX_LAST ) == 0 ) { do { if (! test_add_id(message_id_fld->val_int ( ) ) ) { break ; } } while ( message_tbl ->file->index_prev(message_tbl->record[0 ] ) == 0 && message_user_id_fld->val_int( ) == follower_id ) ; } } while ( follower_tbl -> file->index_next(follower_tbl->record [0 ] ) == 0 && follower_user_id_fld->val_int ( ) == user_id ) ; }
使い方はこんな感じ。ユー ザID 123 のタイムラインが表示されます。
% g++ - I ~/dev/mysql/51/32-src/include - I ~/dev/mysql/51/32-src/sql
- I ~/dev/mysql/51/32-src/regex -g - Wall - O1 - fno-rtti - fno-exceptions - shared -o timeline . so timeline.cc ( snip ) % cp timeline .
so ~/dev/mysql/51/32-bin/lib/plugin % mysql -u root - p test mysql > CREATE FUNCTION timeline returns int soname ' timeline.so ' ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE fetch_timeline_tt ( id int unsigned NOT NULL ) ENGINE =heap ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.00 sec ) mysql > SELECT timeline ( 123 ) ; mysql > SELECT message .*
FROM message INNER JOIN fetch_timeline_tt USING ( id ) ;
実装はしていませんが、過去の任意の時間のタイムラインを抽出する機能をつけることも簡単でしょう ( message->index_read_map の呼出条件を変えるだけ ) 。
なんだかんだ言って 、MySQL の API の奇麗さと InnoDB のチューニングのすばらしさを見せつけられた感じです。中途半端に自前のストレージを書くより、大樹によりかかるほうが楽だなと痛感しました。複雑な条件での検索を実行したいけど
SQL では上手に書けない、というケースでは、この手法は結構現実的な選択肢になるのかもしれません。
6月13日追記 : rev. 13812 でページング処理に対応しました。SELECT timeline(user_id, max_message_id ) ; のように書くことで、メッセージ ID が max_message_id 未満のタイムラインを取り出すことができます。処理速度は最新タイムライン取得と同等かなと思っていたのですが、1,300 タイムライン/秒程度と、やや劣化しました。インデックスサーチの条件が先頭４バイトから８バイトになったためかな、と思います。
また、ユーザー毎の最新のメッセージIDをキャッシュできるようにしました
( 内部でユーザIDを鍵とする配列を準備し、そこにメッセージIDの最大値を格納)。コンパイル時に
-DCACHE_MAX_MESSAGE_IDS=1
とすることで有効になります。ただ、この場合は、InnoDB 内の状態と timeline UDF 内のキャッシュ情報を同期させる必要があるので、必要に応じて timeline_set_maxid( ) 関数 ( これも UDF として実装してあります ) を呼び出すようにしてください。
-- MySQL 起動時に最新メッセー ジIDをキャッシュ SELECT timeline_set_maxid(user_id , max ( id ) ) FROM message GROUP BY user_id ; -- INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE にトリガーを設定 ( 手動で SQL 発行してもいいですが ) CREATE TRIGGER timeline_update_maxid_after_insert AFTER INSERT ON MESSAGE FOR EACH ROW BEGIN SELECT timeline_set_maxid( NEW.user_id , ( SELECT max ( id ) FROM message WHERE user_id=NEW.user_id ) ) INTO @unused ; END ; ( 以下略 )
ただ、ここまでしても最新タイムラインの取得速度は
1,710 タイムライン/秒から 2,000 タイムライン/秒程度までしか向上しませんでした。結局、いったんテンポラリテーブルに結果のメッセージIDを格納してから、それを別の
SQL クエリで結合して取り出しているのがオーバーヘッドになっていると考えられます。この点を最適化しようと思うと、MySQL

I had to rename a lot of files today , recursively .
I found a nice script from Sarah Vessels .
I made it more general purpose ( the SVN stuff is gone for example ) .
I also tried moving with the system command mv but it did n’t work so I tried with FileUtils.mv instead which worked fine .
require ' find ' require ' fileutils ' def finder ( start_dir , look_for , replace_with ) Find.find ( start_dir ) do | path| if FileTest.file ? ( path ) if path =~ look_for old_name = File.basename ( path ) new_name = old_name.gsub ( look_for , replace_with ) dir = path.gsub ( /#{old_name} / , '' ) if File.exists ? ( dir + old_name ) puts " #{dir + old_name} to #{dir + new_name}
" FileUtils.mv( dir + old_name , dir + new_name ) end end end end end finder ( '/ some/dir / ' , /\.html$ / , '.htm ' )
You pass the directory you want to start with , the regular expression you want to replace with and the replacement you want to use .
Without knowing anything about the internals ( like me ) one can anyhow deduce that Find. find will return all sub-paths in a recursive fashion .

A massive unexploded World War II bomb discovered in an east London river was defused by a specialist army team overnight , police said .
The discovery of the one tonne device , said by police to be " the largest bomb ever to be dropped on London " forced the closure of several rail services and part of the Underground .
The bomb was dredged from a river by a mechanical digger near Bromley - by - Bow Underground Station in east London on Monday , during work to clear a site for the 2012 Olympic Games .
Royal Engineers finally made the " Hermann " bomb safe , a day after it began to tick during efforts to defuse it , the Metropolitan Police said .
London Underground and some national rail services were suspended and a 200 - metre exclusion zone set up .
An air exclusion was also in place as the location is below the flight path to City and Heathrow airports .
Some 380 tonnes of sand were packed around the device to minimise any blast .
To add to the risk , the site was next to a gasworks a sewage works .
Police Superintendent Gary Buttercase said he would recommend the bomb disposal officer for a medal .
" This is n't like you see where you 've got a remote control , " he said .
" This is a human being dealing with a bomb of unimaginable magnitude , the largest bomb ever to be dropped on London . "
East London was heavily bombed during World War II .
The Royal Engineers bomb disposal squad are the modern - day equivalents of teams set up during the conflict to deal with unexploded Nazi ordnance .

Irritable Male Syndrome
Women get PMS and men get IMS .
While it may be common knowledge that PMS is the psychological and emotional symptoms related to a woman ’s menstrual cycle it is not so clear what IMS , or Irritable Male Syndrome , is .
The name for the result of a drop in testosterone levels in male mammals may interfere extensively with a man 's daily life , causing everything from depression and anxiety to hyper - sensitivity and anger .
Jed Diamond , author of “ Male Menopause , ” specializes in helping men and women overcome negative outcomes of the condition .
Diamond describes IMS as being similar to PMS .
“ IMS is related to the concurrence of stress , decrease in self - esteem , and biochemical changes that can affect a man in adolescence or middle age . ”
The syndrome that Diamond says can occur at any time in a man 's life affects more than just the one experiencing it .
The anger , or irritability associated with IMS , may be directed at women .
“ We can have an almost irrational need to break away and be free ....
We often see our partners as the ones who are holding us back , ” writes Diamond in his book .
A quiz , which can be found on Diamond ’s theirritablemale.com website is one way the " MenAlive " founder helps people become more aware of the condition .
The quiz lists 50 questions having to do with feelings a man with IMS might experience at an extreme rate .
The online quiz requires testers to rank the average amount of times certain feelings were experienced in the span of one month .
Instead of trying to fight off feelings Diamond simply wants men to build an awareness , something his quiz does with a few clicks of a mouse .
A warning preceding the test tells men to “ let the score be a guide , not an absolute indicator that there is a problem or not a problem . ”
Another professional , Dr. Aimee Aubeeluck of the University of Derby in Great Britain , also studies the syndrome or , as she calls it , “ male PMS . ”
In a 2004 study of 50 men and women , she conducted a similar test to that of Diamond 's , recording the results having to do with the frequency of specific feelings occurring in a months time .
The results turned out to be complementary to findings by Diamond , demonstrating the symptoms attributed to PMS as being just as frequent in men .
She views awareness as a crucial part in the solution to a condition that she refers to as being largely unknown .
“ This study is very exciting as it not only raises issues in terms of health implications for women who find themselves stereotyped as having PMS but also for men who may be suffering from cyclical changes that are left undiagnosed or untreated due to a lack of recognition , ” said Aubeeluck .
She suggests that this evidence might also be a factor proving the notion that PMS in women is something that is n’t as uncontrollable as commonly assumed .
However , Criminologist Dr Patricia Easteal of the Australian National University mentions PMS in women in her 2001 book " Less Than Equal . "
She links the energy given off by women experiencing PMS as being contagious in their male partner .
Though she does n’t support the notion of IMS she does label the experience of being around someone who is experiencing hormonal changes as an uncomfortable one .
“ If you 're a man living with a woman who has a very clear mood cycle then it ’s inevitable you ’re going to be affected by that , but it does n't mean you have PMS , ” she said .
Paulson and Bernanke Bailout Friends on Wall Street , a Disaster for US Tax Payers
Jason Simpkins writes : Standing on the steps of the U.S. Treasury building across the street from the White House , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson asked Congress for the power to prop up Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , the two failing mortgage giants involved with nearly half of the $ 12 trillion U.S. mortgage market .
" The president has asked me to work with Congress to act on this plan immediately , " Paulson said Sunday .
" Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder - owned companies .
Their support for the housing market is particularly important as we work through the current housing correction . "
But half a world away - in his new home in Singapore - peripatetic investing guru Jim Rogers blasted the federal government for its new activist approach , which conflict with the very idea of a free market .
A rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - the second federally sponsored corporate bailout in four months after the Treasury Department rode to the rescue of The Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. ( BSR ) in March - is shifting the cost of errant financial strategies away from shareholders and onto U.S. taxpayers .
" I do n't know where these guys get the audacity to take our money , taxpayer money , and buy stock in Fannie Mae , " Rogers , the best - selling author and famed investor told Bloomberg News .
" These companies were going to go bankrupt if [ the feds ] had n't stepped in to do something , and they should 've gone bankrupt with all of the mistakes they 've made .
What 's going to happen when you … put some Band - Aids on it for another year or two or three ?
What 's going to happen three years from now when the situation 's much , much , much worse ? "
Clearly , a sweeping rescue of the government sponsored entities , such as the one planned , will bring with it a broad new range of liabilities for the American taxpayer , who will be financing institutions that are widely regarded as insolvent .
The debt securities issued by Fannie and Freddie are widely owned by pension funds , mutual funds , institutional investors , and even foreign governments .
So a collapse of the two government - sponsored enterprises would send shockwaves through an economy that is already struggling to overcome the worst housing recession in a quarter - century , tight global credit markets and soaring inflation thanks to rising food and energy prices .
Paulson asked Congress for the authority to buy equity in - and lend to - the companies , while also substantially increasing their lines of credit .
The Treasury Department did not specify the amount of credit that would be made available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , but those briefed on the plan told the International Herald Tribune that administration officials are lobbying Congress to extend the line of credit to $ 300 billion .
Each company currently has a $ 2.25 billion credit line that was established close to 40 years ago .
At the time , Fannie Mae had only $ 15 billion in outstanding debt according to IHT .
Now , Fannie has a total debt of about $ 800 billion and Freddie has roughly $ 740 billion .
Many on Capitol Hill , particularly Senator Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) , greeted the plan with enthusiasm .
" The Treasury 's plan is surgical and carefully thought out and will maximize confidence in Fannie and Freddie while minimizing potential costs to U.S. taxpayers , " Schumer said .
" While Fannie and Freddie still have solid fundamentals , it will be reassuring to investors , bondholders and mortgage - holders that the federal government will be behind these agencies , should it be needed . "
But Rogers - who contends that the U.S. economy is in the midst of its worst recession since World War II - referred to Paulson 's plan as an " unmitigated disaster . "
" They 're ruining what has been one of the greatest economies in the world , " Rogers said , making a collective reference to both Paulson and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke .
Said Rogers : Paulson and Bernanke " are bailing out their friends on Wall Street … but there are 300 million Americans that are going to have to pay for this . "
[ Editor 's Note :
For an insider 's explanation of the catalysts for the Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac financial crisis - as well as the long - term fallout investors can expect - check out Contributing Editor Shah Gilani's " Inside Wall Street " column also contained in this issue of Money Morning .
Global Investing guru Jim Rogers has been particularly critical of the U.S. government 's willingness to bail out Wall Street 's financial miscreants .
Indeed , in an exclusive interview with Money Morning earlier this year , Rogers predicted the failure of the U.S. Federal Reserve for this very reason .
And while that 's very bad news for U.S. - focused investments , there is an alternative - Asia , and more specifically , China , Rogers says .

THE love - in last week in Unity , New Hampshire , when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton stood together , was a marker in Mr Obama 's campaign to be president .
Mrs Clinton spoke of standing “ shoulder to shoulder ” with her Democratic former rival ; he gushed about “ how good she is , how tough she is , how passionate she is ” .
It was the first time since Mrs Clinton dropped out of the race that the two had appeared together in public .
From now on Mr Obama will tap Mrs Clinton 's financial donors , enlist some of her staff and reach out to her supporters .
With the primary season forgotten , Mr Obama is now sauntering towards the centre , ready to spar with John McCain .
In the process he may enrage left - wing activists who constitute his base ( however Mr McCain faces the same , or even a harder , challenge with his supporters on the right ) .
Since wrapping up the nomination Mr Obama has taken a number of positions that have caused discomfort to some on the left .
These have included : his solemn undertaking to protect Israel , in a speech to the leading pro-Israeli lobby ; the reversal of his promise to accept public - funding limits for the election ; and , last week , his waffled reaction to the Supreme Court 's ruling on gun rights .
Individually , these topics are not of huge electoral importance .
But Mr Obama is busy signalling that he belongs in the middle of the road .
More tests await .
On Iraq Mr Obama has made an explicit promise to “ remove one to two combat brigades each month , and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months ” .
Naturally a more peaceful Iraq would provide conditions in which a withdrawal is more likely , but as president he would have to weigh the risk that leaving quickly might jeopardise the relative improvement in security in the country .
There have been nods and winks from Obamaite foreign - policy wonks that he would revisit the pledge when president , but Mr McCain will want to focus on the subject before then .
The Republican has already chided his rival for not making a trip to Iraq for more than two years .
Mr Obama recently said that he will go there soon .
Then there is the looming Senate vote on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , which contains a provision granting telecoms companies immunity from lawsuits for co-operating in a surveillance programme that conducted wiretaps without warrants .
Mr Obama had said he was “ proud ” to stand with “ a grassroot movement of Americans ” in opposing the FISA legislation , but he has now watered down his opposition and supports the latest compromise , to the fury of liberal bloggers .
MoveOn.org , the left 's noisiest pressure group , is running a campaign to persuade Mr Obama to vote against the bill .
Senate leaders are desperately trying to engineer a separate vote on the immunity provision so that the senator from Illinois can register his objection .
Another issue rumbling away is free trade .
During the primaries Mr Obama joined Mrs Clinton in turning up the rhetorical heat against NAFTA .
Both floated the threat of an “ opt out ” from the agreement to force renegotiations with Canada and Mexico , which Mr Obama said could be used to gain “ leverage ” with their trading partners .
This went down well among unions and displaced workers in the rustbelt states , but Mr Obama has since talked about the importance of trade and markets , in an effort to sound a bit more sensible on economic policy .
This last transition is particularly delicate .
In a recent interview for Fortune , Mr Obama admitted that “ sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified ” and that he wanted to open a dialogue .
“ Obama goes soft on free trade ” , thundered the Nation , a left - leaning magazine , pointing out that Mr Obama 's perceived hostility to free trade is the characteristic most likely to appeal to working - class voters in the mid-west in November 's general election .
He is not helped by a hostile takeover bid for Anheuser - Busch from a Belgian brewer .
The maker of Budweiser is based in the swing - state of Missouri , where Democrats are calling opposition to a deal “ patriotic ” .
One consolation is that Mr McCain will also be keen to avoid the subject , as his wife owns at least $ 1 m - worth of Anheuser shares and stands to benefit financially from a deal .

As described in a June 9 , 2008 post on Newsweek 's website by Tina Peng , they follow .
Fitness club managers dish about their members ' most obnoxious habits
It was perhaps the most extreme case of gym rage — ever .
While taking a Manhattan spin class last August , Christopher Carter became so annoyed by the unrelenting grunts and shouts of a fellow spinner that he tipped the other guy right off his bike and into a wall .
The grunter was hospitalized for two weeks after the incident .
Carter was acquitted of assault charges on June 2 .
Hopefully , the acquittal wo n't inspire a rash of altercations , as other exercisers decide that they too have had it with obnoxious gym behavior .
Because any gym rat can tell you , grunting is n't the most irritating thing people do in fitness clubs .
From making lunch in the sauna to sporting unsavory yoga attire , club managers report that some of their patrons are clueless when it comes to gym etiquette , or general decency .
Here are nine of the most outrageous fitness club offenses .
1. The Sauna Stovetop A manager at a New York Sports Club was walking through the women 's locker room a few years ago when she smelled cheese .
Puzzled , she opened the door to the sauna , where a woman had placed bread and cheese on the hot rocks to make a postworkout grilled cheese sandwich .
" Not only was it a health code violation , it was not really respectful to the other people in the sauna , " says NYSC PR director Linda Hufcut .
" She said , ' I do this all the time . '
That was , obviously , the last time she ever did it . ' "
2. Nude Fitness ?
A couple of visitors to a Gold 's Gym in Paramus , N.J. , decided to get naked and weigh themselves before they started working out .
The two men did n't seem daunted by the fact that the scale was outside the locker room .
They hung out by the scale , in full view of the other , clothed patrons , until a manager asked them to put some clothes on .
They told Mike Epstein , the gym's owner , that they did that sort of thing all the time at their home gym .
Perhaps they meant " home gym " as in the one in their basement .
3. Creative Blow - Drying
A man in a California Crunch gym decided that the best way to dry out his sweaty shoes was to stick a hair dryer in each of them while he took his after - workout shower .
He was shocked when managers asked him to cease and desist .
" He said , ' I did n't even realize I should n't be doing this ' , " says Keith Worts , chief operating officer of Crunch , a national fitness chain .
4. Downward Dog ?
At another Crunch location a man had a habit of taking a yoga class while wearing shorts without underwear .
He was more than happy to correct his faux pas as soon as managers made him aware that other members were uncomfortable with the view they were getting .
5. Work Out , Sleep
In Some people get a little too relaxed at the gym .
Gold 's Gym managers have reported finding customers who fell asleep in the tanning facility and did n't wake up until the gym was closed , as well as customers who fell asleep on the bench press in between sets .
6. Killer Karaoke
It 's common and profoundly annoying : gymgoers get carried away listening to their music players .
Before they know it they 've treated everyone in the room to an off - key rendition of " ... Baby One More Time . "
" I call it karaoke gone bad , because there is no background music and they 're singing at the top of their lungs , " says Harry Reo , a regional vice president for 24 Hour Fitness .
7. Talking ( Too Much of ) the Talk Fed up with people gabbing on their cell phones as they used the elliptical , many gyms have banned cell phones around workout equipment and designated areas for patrons to make calls .
Still , people forget .
" There 's nothing worse than running on the treadmill and having someone next to you conducting an extremely loud conversation , " says Hufcut , who 's seen some people use walkie - talkies while on the treadmill .
8. Sweat Sins
It seems basic , but enough people forget to wipe down their equipment after using it that this was one of the four deadly gym sins included on an informational video NYSC taped a few years ago .
During the segment a careless gymgoer did n't dry off his machine ; when he stood up , the entire machine was covered in dripping goo .
9. Scrimmage to Scuffle
It 's only logical that testosterone can run high at the gym , and sometimes managers need to break up altercations on the basketball court , says Nancy Pattee Francini , co-founder and president of the Sports Club / LA , which has 10 locations around the country .
" Those guys , when they 're playing basketball , can get into fights , " she says .
" They 're not terrible fights — we 're a high - end club . "
These are , of course , the worst offenses , not the norm .
Obnoxious behavior can usually be curbed with a little etiquette education , say gym owners .
" Most of the time it 's really an awareness issue with members , " says Worts of Crunch .
" We have to remind them that they 're in a shared public space . "
Nonetheless , it might not be a bad idea to look over the list and make sure you 're not committing any gym sins .
Minnesota High School senior Jon Soli has invented a duel fuel system that may one day be powering vehicles all across America .
It 's taken him two years of work , but it 's finally here .
His invention could lower your fuel bills by 30 % .
He built a battery - powered device that can actually turn water into energy and lower the amount of gas you need by about 23 % .
" It 'll lower emissions , clean up the environment , and it will save you money . " ( soli )
You may have heard of hydrogen cars .
Soli 's invention attaches to your motor and uses both hydrogen and oxygen for energy .
He and four friends re-designed the engine and design of a car so it gets 866 miles to the gallon .
Their completed vehicle helped them take first place in the design proposal portion of the 20th annual Supermileage Challenge presented by the Minnesota Technology Education Association .
The car is n't safe for the road , but the combination of that engine , Soli 's invention , and a safer frame could revolutionize the way we drive .
" I 'm feeling great .
I did n't know it would get this far .
The project just seemed to get bigger and bigger , " says Soli .
Iranian police are charged with enforcing strict anti-vice laws
Tehran 's police chief , who was reportedly discovered in a brothel , has been arrested , it has been confirmed .
Local media have reported that General Reza Zarei was found with six naked women in a house of prostitution in the Iranian capital last month .
He has been taken to jail while his case is investigated , a spokesman for Iran 's judiciary said .
Gen Zarei was in charge of enforcing Iran 's strict anti-vice laws , which include a ban on prostitution .
State media had recently reported that Gen Zarei had been replaced as police chief in Tehran , but had not explained why .
Sex taboo
Iran has tough punishments for unmarried couples who have sex or behave in a manner considered immoral .
Young people have been jailed or flogged for dancing together at house parties .
The public dress code can be tightly enforced , with women barred from showing their hair or wearing make up or colourful clothes and men from wearing their hair long .
For years the hardline Iranian establishment never admitted that prostitution existed .
They now acknowledge the problem , though , and prostitutes are becoming more visible on the streets , correspondents say .
Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are expected in Sydney
A court in Sydney has struck down a controversial state law that made it illegal to " annoy " pilgrims gathered for a Roman Catholic youth festival .
The judges ruled that the law , which allowed the police to fine people protesting over the Vatican 's stance on various issues , limited free speech .
The ruling came as the World Youth Day festival opens .
It will be attended by Pope Benedict XVI later this week .
The challenge to the law was brought by a coalition of protest groups .
Activists say they plan to hold a rally on Saturday at which they will demonstrate against the Church 's stand on homosexuality and birth control , by handing out condoms and wearing provocative T - shirts .
Civil liberty groups had denounced the New South Wales state law - which threatened fines of up to A$ 5,500 ( £ 2,680 ) against anyone causing " annoyance " to pilgrims - as unnecessary and repugnant .
Wake consciences
The World Youth Day event , which the Pope is heading , is expected to draw some 200,000 young Catholics to Sydney .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The event - which actually runs for six days - begins on Tuesday , although the Pope will not be taking part until later in the week .
During his trip , the Pope will also meet Aboriginal groups , and is likely to repeat an apology made by Pope John Paul II to Australia 's indigenous people for injustices carried out by Catholic missionaries .
He also told reporters he wanted to wake up consciences , to make politicians and experts respond to environmental issues .
The Pope will close his trip by presiding over an open - air Mass on 20 July at Sydney 's Randwick Racecourse , which is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of pilgrims .
Rails programmer , how long do you think these glory days will last ?
I first started thinking about this while attending Railsconf and talking to programmers who were creating Rails projects within gorillas such as AOL , LinkedIn , Monster , and of course Yellowpages ( my apologies to AOL , LinkedIn , and Monster if any of those projects were supposed to be secret ) .
After watching DHH ’s keynote , it sunk in further .
Now I hear that Engine Yard just got $ 15 m more funding , and the picture is crystal clear : the hobgoblins from years ’ past that have kept Rails away from corporate use are melting away faster than polar ice cap .
This is a bad thing for those that like the competitive advantage Rails affords .
With the advantage of RoR ( and two tablespoons of Firebug ) , right now is one of those rare times in which a motivated programmer or two can compete technologically with legacy web companies that have payrolls 100x greater .
If Bonanzle could dig up an ounce of business savvy ( still TBD ) to go with our technology , I like to think we could be one of the seminal examples of this .
Look down the list of our technological advantages vs the gorillas ( real time offer making , integration with all major IM clients , image cropper , price guessers , pretty urls , 0 - page - load item creation , real time messaging built into site , item importers for eBay / Craigslist , etc. etc. ) , and it ’s clear that we ’re living in an age where the possibilities for the underdog are as rife as ever .
But how long will that be the case ?
With a test - driven development environment like Rails , where metaprogramming and a solid MVC architecture can cut 125,000 lines of code to 20,000 lines ( like Yellowpages did in moving to Rails ) , suddenly gorillas are nimbler , and order is restored to the world .
Eventually , the gorillas might just figure this out .
The horror .
In light of these facts , I have taken to pumping up the FUD on Rails whenever possible .
I like my unfair Rails advantage , and would miss it if it were gone .
In the interests of helping the reader perpetuate Rails FUD amongst their own social circle , I have created the following collection of sound bites to help you desecrate Rails :
Rails Does n’t Scale .
C’mon , you know it ’s true .
I even preached this one myself .
Tell them that “ Ruby is the slowest programming language ” ever .
I mean , it ’s slower than an excellent language like Python by a factor of 3 x .
It ’s slower than C by about 70 x !
I can only imagine how much slower it is than x80 assembly .
Visualize how screaming fast your assembly - driven site could be .
If your listener happens to mention cloud computing , I recommend you retort with the thousands of dollars they ’d have to spend on a server cloud for a heavily trafficked site .
If they point out that those costs are a fraction of the development costs they ’d incur otherwise , move on to point number two .
No Big Sites Use Rails .
Yes … yes … yes !
In Rails ’ history , excluding a couple one shot wonders like YellowPages and Twitter ( do n’t forget : Twitter is rumored to be leaving Rails ) , no “ big ” web site is running on Rails .
Point out that both Facebook and Flickr run on PHP .
Or better still , perhaps your listener would like to literally be the next MySpace and build on .
NET ?
Hopefully they do not retort that almost none of the biggest sites were built when Rails existed , or that most new sites are built on RoR , or that any kind of bad Rails juju they encountered could be monkey patched since it ’s all open source .
It should suffice to say that if no big site has been built on Rails by now , no big site ever will be .
Still not dissuaded ?
Google uses Python .
Yes , they also use Ruby .
But they use Python more .
This one ought to work well when convincing a take - over - the - world CEO .
Other Languages have More Libraries .
This works sort of like number two… point out how many libraries PHP already has .
Or .
Net. Or Java , or C ++.
You can manipulate the hell out of an image with any of these choices .
Or if you decided at the last minute that you wanted to make your web site into a PS3 game , you ’d be glad you chose C++ and its PS3 libraries .
Only the savviest enterprise -y tech guy will be able to discern between quantity and quality : think how many underdeveloped , crap libraries they ’ve become accustomed to while dealing with Java .
Open Source Software is Unsupported Software or Ruby on Rails Does n’t Deploy on Windows or URLs Do n’t Matter .
Alright , if they still were n’t convinced after four points that terrific , you ’re going to need to fire some scattershot .
These arguments should close the case for the last few Windows types , and for others , hopefully they tilt in favor of Anything But RoR .
But for the last few hard - to - budge listeners , you ’ll need to pull out your ace in the hole …
The Creator is an Ass .
Have you ever listened to DHH talk ?
What an elitist snob .
Thinks he is God ’s gift to programming .
The way he repeatedly cut off this nice Python fellow was disrespectful .
Any framework created by this guy must be an elitist , disrespectful framework to use .
And that should about do it … double bonus points for anyone who can convince eBay to give ASP .NET a whirl !

Sedona : Is the Whole Town Built on a Hoax ?
By Laurie Gough
Masculine energy fields , spiritual consciousness guides , and The Eleventh Chakra .
Is any of this for real ?
Laurie Gough puts feet on soil around Sedona , Arizona to separate divine from delusional .
I 'm hiking in Boynton Canyon near Sedona , Arizona , and the woman behind me is berating her husband for not warning her to wear hiking boots , speaking to him in a voice which tells of ongoing bitterness , a voice which discourages calm discussion on the matter .
It 's at this point I realize that the theory of Boynton Canyon being devoid of male–female tension because of its " vortex " is in error .
Either that or we have n't reached the vortex yet , the place where soothing energy is supposedly oozing out of the earth .
Yesterday , the owner of Sedona 's Center for the New Age––a shop full of crystals , tarot cards , flute music and dreamy–eyed patrons — enlightened me on the various energy vortexes around Sedona .
The owner , a woman in her late–50s , a fellow Canadian , told me that the vortex energy of Boynton Canyon is special .
" There are two types of energies coming from the rocks : magnetic ( female ) and electric ( male ) .
Boynton Canyon has both , " she said .
" It 's balanced , so you 'll notice people there are calm .
There 's no male–female tension in Boynton Canyon . "
Wow , I 'd said .
Couples on the brink of divorce should hang out there .
It could save a lot on lawyer fees .
" As for the other three vortex sites , " the woman continued , " Cathedral Rock is magnetic and therefore feminine .
The energy at Bell Rock is so powerful , you 'll notice it before getting out of your car .
The Airport Vortex is masculine , " she said , " so watch out .
The strength of it might knock you over . "
I 'd first heard about Sedona at a remote campground south of Sedona called Verde Hot Springs where my husband and I had camped for six days .
The campground local hippies made jokes about Sedona 's tourists , but at the same time , each had a story to tell in support of Sedona 's mystical reputation .
Around a fire , a camper offered his vortex expertise , claiming that one vortex takes something away from you that you want but gives you back something you need .
" Hey , kind of like the Rolling Stones song , " I 'd offered .
Another vortex overwhelms you with so much energy you might get sick ; another puts you to sleep , another vortex strips you of your beliefs .
I smiled and nodded politely , pretending I did n't think him a total flake .
Big Money from Strong Earth Energy
Sedona is known as the New Age Mecca––or New Age Tourist Trap , depending on your astrological sign––and when April White Cloud tacked her ads around town declaring she was a master clairvoyant , psychic healer and shaman priestess , I did n't trust her , or the town 's metaphysical claim to fame , for a minute .
Nor did I trust the man in the glossy photo with the gray ponytail who claimed he would open the Third Eye , retrieve wandering souls , and channel spirits for $ 200 a session .
Among the month 's topics in the popular New Age magazine , Sedona , Journal of Emergence are : " The World Through My Dog 's Sacred Vision , " " The Eleventh Chakra in the Fourth Dimension , " and my favorite , " Could It Be You 're Already Dead ? "
Sedona was entirely different from other Arizona towns we 'd visited , places like Bisbee and Patagonia , old–fashioned towns with real people who have real jobs , but perhaps , I reflected , it 's only right that screwballs have their own town .
All the talk of altered states and parallel universes was a turnoff , but I was curious about the vortexes .
I suggested to my husband Rob that instead of ditching Sedona immediately , we go searching for energy sites .
The vortex woman said that the best way to feel the vortex energy was to go on a guided trek .
Since guides are on a " higher level of spiritual consciousness , " you have a more powerful experience .
At $ 250 , I figured Rob and I could find the vortexes on our own and maybe eavesdrop on a guided tour , let leftover sacred energy spill onto us .
Surely the Earth would n't care who had forked out cash and who had n't .
As I left , the vortex woman called out not to worry about going guideless because the energy is so overwhelming , a person would have to be abnormally insensitive not to feel anything .
Sacred energy of the Earth , come and get me .
Seeking Surges of Energy
In the first half –hour of the five–mile hike through Boynton Canyon , our first vortex , we passed Enchantment Resort , which somewhat detracts from the nature experience as you walk by million –dollar guest houses , but soon , we were hiking at the foot of crimson cliffs and eventually into a snowy pine forest .
First , we passed crowds of hikers on this popular trail , but the further we went , the fewer hikers we encountered so the more we stopped to chat .
Now , near the end of the trail , high up in a spectacular box canyon , we ask our fellow hikers , " So , do you feel anything ? "
" Yeah , my legs hurt , " someone says .
" Yep , sure am thirsty , " says another .
Nobody has found the vortex .
Back at our van after the hike , we meet a man who gives us a more detailed vortex map than ours , and we discover that Boynton Canyon 's vortex is just 50 yards from the parking lot , conveniently .
The map shows the vortex to be on a knoll surrounded by twisted juniper trees .
Supposedly the energy of the vortex twists the trees .
I 'd seen twisted junipers in the southwest before , however , usually in windy places , like on top of this knoll .
I sit down in the dusty red dirt up on the knoll to absorb some sacred energy , but all I feel is the midday sun burning my face .
I'm a redhead , apparently an insensitive one , and have to watch my skin .
But I 'm not deterred .
We decide that after exploring downtown , we 'll head back into the hills for sunset .
Sedona , despite it being New Age Disneyland , is stunning .
New businesses in this rapidly –growing town of 15,000 must have red clay roofs and adhere to adobe architecture in muted shades of browns , greens and taupes .
Even the gas stations are adobe .
The adobe McDonalds in Sedona advertises , " The Only Teal Green Arches in the World " and they do n't look bad .
When the sun sets in a place like Sedona , a place surrounded by red rock mountains , it 's an event of dazzling proportions that people anticipate for hours .
The last rays of the day ignite the towering rocks like golden castles until finally they burn up in a glowing cayenne blaze .
When it 's over , the mountains darken to violet shadows as if the sun were never there at all .
The sky fills with rosy clouds , the air turns cold and the people turn to go home .
We decide to watch the sunset from Airport Vortex ( the " masculine " vortex which might knock me over ) because it has tremendous views .
I scramble up the rocks ahead of Rob , thinking perhaps I 'll " feel " more on my own .
It 's a short but steep climb to the top of the vortex and on my way up I pass a middle–aged woman huffing and puffing coming down .
" I did n't feel anything , " she says to her husband .
" What a darn waste of time that was . "
I keep climbing .
When I reach the top , the sun is in the process of painting everything a fierce red and I sit down on the sandstone rock .
For a long time I stare out across the dizzying grandeur of the high desert landscape , the mesas , mountains and buttes , the ancient rocky depths below , trying to probe the depths of my inner self , yearning for the earth 's energy to mingle with my own , and a feeling gradually starts to come over me : starvation .
I could go for a super burrito right now .
The next day we go to Cathedral Rock , which , with its red rock spires lofting over the flowing Oak Creek , is the most photographed site in Sedona .
We hike along the brook through the trees until we find Cathedral Rock Vortex , sit down , and try seriously this time to sense the surges of energy .
Under the shade of a juniper tree beside the creek I close my eyes , take a deep breath and try to empty my mind of its clutter .
Gradually I began to relax as tranquility flows through me .
The world around me is at peace .
Then I hear something stirring ––low murmurs drifting up through the funnels of the red ground straight to my heart .
Hallelujah , Mother Earth has finally reached me !
The murmurs grow louder , so loud I open my eyes to see a group of people sitting in a circle across the creek .
They 're chanting .
They 're also dressed funny , wearing black capes and wide –brimmed mauve hats .
A moment before , I 'd thought I 'd just felt God , or somebody like him , and now I just feel crummy .
Whatever the chanters are doing looks serious .
We get up to leave .
How can we feel anything with them babbling away like that ?
Earth 's Real Energy
On our way back we see a couple in their 60 s – –portly , friendly and all –American .
The man is struggling to cross the stream .
He shouts at us , " Hey , where is the damn thing ? "
" What , " I say , " the vortex ? "
" The what ?
What 's that ? "
" Well , it 's supposed to be … "
" I'm looking for the photo op , " he interrupts .
As it turns out , the photo op is a far more stirring place than the actual vortex .
A flat plain of smooth red molten rocks , cooled in wavy shapes millennia ago , is now a perfect spot for picnics .
People are eating , drinking wine , and enjoying the view .
Children laugh at some ducks that actually seem to be shooting the rapids and flying back to shoot them all over again .
People throw sticks for dogs and families take photos .
These people are oblivious to the " sacred site " just ten minutes away but seem to be having a lot more fun than the murmuring circle of New Age energy channelers .
I feel inspired on several levels .
The fourth and last of the Sedona vortexes is Bell Rock , also a popular site for UFO sightings , and we stop there just for the heck of it on our way back to the campsite .
I 've given up on the vortexes and admit I do n't try very hard to feel anything at Bell Rock .
I recall a friend saying the only vortex he noticed in Sedona was the one sucking gas from his car when he sat in traffic for 45 minutes .
Was the whole town built on a hoax ?
How can you have a spiritual moment when it 's expected of you ?
Are n't these things meant to happen when we least expect it ?
But as I climb Bell Rock I look to the west .
The sun has just fallen behind a mountain and its afterglow is orchestrating the whole sky into swirling masses of mandarin and deep purple wine .
Far off somewhere , a green tree of the brightest emerald is cutting through the arid night , while up in the sky a single planet , perhaps Venus , shines down to where I sit on the rock .
A breeze cools my arms , pines give off the fragrance of oozing gum , and coyotes howl for night to begin .
Inside I 'm quietly exploding from the aching beauty around me .
This is the Earth 's energy , I realize , and this is sacred .

Spanish health authorities launched a virtual portal through the Second Life website yesterday designed to help young people too embarrassed to speak to a doctor about sexually transmitted disease or a drug problem .
Real doctors will log on and offer advice to their anonymous patients .
What both will see is an image of a consulting room with a doctor and a typical patient .
Dr Rosario Jimènez , of the Adolescent Attention Working Group , is one of the doctors who will spend up to four hours a week answering their virtual patients ' questions .
She said : " Teenagers do not often go to see the doctor but this is an efficient and amusing tool to reach them because we can both use the same route .
Even though they do not often suffer serious illnesses , they often expose themselves to risks which can develop into problems in the future .
" This is a way to talk about their doubts about taking drugs or sexual relations which they cannot do in a traditional consultation . "
The Second Life health portal was set up by the Spanish Society for Family and Community Medicine ( FYC ) and the Coalition for Citizens with Chronic Illnesses .
Dr Luis Aguillera , FYC president , said : " This idea started as a way to connect health professionals and adolescents and to give internet users a reliable space to get health advice . "
The Spanish - language isla de salud ( health island ) on Second Life will also include detailed information on health matters and a meeting room for website users .
The FYC plans to open other Second Life portals for chronic conditions in six months .
Aguillera said : " Even though a virtual consultation can never substitute for a real face - to - face one , we will be able to deal with problems of dermatology and psychology through a webcam . "

Based on information from Foreign Policy ( July / August 2008 ) .
Barack Obama advanced his drive to unite the Democratic Party behind his candidacy for president Wednesday by winning the long - sought endorsement of vanquished rival John Edwards at a boisterous rally .
The announcement was a blow to Hillary Rodham Clinton , whose bid for the Democratic nomination appears all but lost , and brought Obama a welcome distraction from his landslide defeat Tuesday in the West Virginia primary .
The 41 - percentage - point rout sparked new questions about his persistent troubles appealing to white , blue - collar voters , even if it did little to boost Clinton ’s prospects .
In Edwards , Obama picked up the support of a former presidential candidate who had emphasized his roots as the son of a mill worker and aimed his pitch at working - class voters .
“ The Democratic voters in America have made their choice , and so have I , ” Edwards told the enthusiastic crowd .
“ There is one man who knows and understands that this is a time for bold leadership .
There is one man that knows how to create the change , the lasting change , that you have to build from the ground up .
There is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America , not two .
And that man is Barack Obama . ”

In another sign of Obama ’s progress in uniting the party , the Illinois senator also won the endorsement Wednesday of a major abortion rights group , NARAL Pro-Choice America .
The group praised Clinton , but its rejection of her was stinging nonetheless for the New York senator , who is seeking to become the nation ’s first female president .
Even though Clinton vowed Wednesday to fight to the last contests on June 3 in Montana and South Dakota , Obama ’s rally with Edwards appeared choreographed to ease her exit .
Speaking to 12,500 Obama supporters here in a sports arena , Edwards , one of the most prominent Democrats who had not endorsed a candidate , paid lengthy tribute to Clinton .
The mention of her name initially sparked boos , a sign of the fractured state of the party as the nominating race winds down .
“ It is hard to go out there and speak up when the odds turn against you , ” Edwards said , adding that Clinton had “ shown strength and character ” in battling for improved healthcare and a better life for millions of Americans .

“ She is a woman who , in my judgment , is made of steel , and she ’s a leader in this country , not -- not -- because of her husband , but because of what she has done , ” he said .
Obama , too , offered kind words for Clinton as he ripped into President Bush and Arizona Sen .
John McCain , the presumed Republican White House nominee .
Both Republicans , Obama said , champion tax cuts for “ those with the most , and tell everyone else to fend for themselves . ”
“ John Edwards and I believe in a different America , ” Obama said , borrowing an Edwards campaign theme .
“ Hillary Clinton believes in a different America .
The Democratic Party believes in a different America -- one America , where we rise and fall together as one people , and that ’s why we are going to take Washington by storm this November . ”
“ Yes , we can ! ” the crowd shouted .

Obama also pledged to take up Edwards ’ campaign to cut poverty in half over the next 10 years .
“ He will have a partner in that effort , ” Obama said , “ because that is a goal that I will set as president of the United States of America . ”
A former North Carolina senator and his party ’s 2004 nominee for vice president , Edwards dropped out of the race in January after poor showings in Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina .
Clinton and Obama competed fiercely for his endorsement , each visiting his home in Chapel Hill .
For more than three months , Edwards declined to take sides , indicating recently that he would let voters decide .
He did not explain why he changed his mind , but Obama told reporters Wednesday that Edwards had made his decision in the last several days .
Now , some of the 19 delegates whom Edwards won in the early contests could swing toward Obama .
His endorsement could also sway some superdelegates , the party leaders who probably will settle the nomination .
In the race for delegates , Obama leads 1,887.5 to 1,718 , according to the Associated Press .
It takes 2,026 to win the nomination .

Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe said her team respected Edwards , “ but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night , this thing is far from over . ”
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds was caustic .
“ Despite months of lofty claims , ” he said , “ Barack Obama ’s best effort at uniting his party relied on the same divisive partisan attacks that only reminds Americans that he ’s a candidate with no record of bipartisan success . ”
The Grand Rapids event capped a daylong Obama swing across Michigan , part of a tour of fall battleground states that he launched on Tuesday in Missouri and will resume next week in Florida .
Obama has tried to strike a balance between jumping ahead to the general - election race without seeming presumptuous about the nomination he has yet to capture .
He plans to campaign this week in South Dakota and Oregon , which holds its primary Tuesday .
Advertisement
In the Detroit suburbs on Wednesday morning , Obama set out to build ties with the Midwestern blue - collar workers whose support has eluded him in primaries and caucuses .
Wearing goggles and earplugs , he toured the assembly lines of a Chrysler factory in Sterling Heights .
He also sported a flag pin on his lapel , an apparent gesture to quiet conservative critics who have questioned his patriotism because he often does n’t wear a pin .
In the nearby suburb of Warren , Obama sharply attacked McCain ’s economic agenda at Macomb County Community College .
Faulting McCain for advocating extensions of Bush ’s tax cuts , Obama told invited guests that he and the Arizona senator would offer Americans a stark choice in November .
“ It ’s going to be a clear choice between four more years of the same failed Bush policies that have wrecked Michigan ’s economy , or real change that allows us to write a new chapter in American manufacturing and the American economy and American history , ” he said .
Obama called for public investment in alternative energy production to help revive the manufacturing sector in Michigan and other economically pressed states .
Advertisement
Obama also said that McCain ’s plans to remedy economic troubles closely resembled Bush ’s .
“ I think that is going to be the central issue in this election :
Who can restore a sense of fairness and economic growth for everybody -- bottom - up economic growth instead of trickle - down nonsense that does n’t end up working for the American people , ” he said .

﻿ This article documents how an urban legend got started the weekend of June 28 - 29 , 2008 , how and why urban legends spread virally , and what you can do to spot them and stop them .
On Sunday , June 29 , I received several forwarded articles alleging a large European banking conglomerate predicted a United States financial " meltdown " within coming weeks .
The forwarded story led me to a blog , not a news site , which alleged to provide a one paragraph abbreviation of the story , introduced by the statement " I was shocked to read the following , which was posted 4 hours ago ... " .
The article alleges that Fortis chairman , Maurice Lippens , expects 6,000 US banks to file for bankruptcy in coming weeks .
It mentions that even large financial institutions , such as Citigroup and General Motors , will also be affected , and these events will start a complete financial meltdown in the United States .
STORY DOES NOT HOLD UP TO SCRUTINY
A quick internet search revealed the same abbreviated " article " -- only one paragraph long , with the exact same introductory statement -- has been posted on 269 other blogs and discussion boards .
Most of these discussion boards allow anonymous posts , with no accountability required by the poster or author ( such as the Sean Hannity fan site , the Ron Paul discussion board , etc ) .
The story can also be found on Digg and other viral marketing and web ring sites , and I predict that you will probably see this many more times , on discussion boards or in emails , for months or years to come .
Most posts also claim that the original story was written in Dutch , and a few even contained a dead link to the alleged original story on Da Telegraaf , a Dutch news submission site .
After searching the Da Telegraaf site , I was able to find the original story , which was submitted anonymously .
It had no author , it sited no source , it came from no news syndicate ( such as Reuters or Associated Press ) , and it was submitted to no news syndicates .
My first reaction to the story was that it contained all the elements of a net rumor or an urban legend , the kind my grandfather likes to forward to me : Bill Gates will give you $ 1,000 for forwarding his email ; Obama is n't really a US citizen ; undocumented Mexican laborers are going to get $ 1 trillion in free US health care but you are not ; car jackers are going to steal your car by putting a flyer on your window ; etc .
I next searched every legitimate news site I could think of , including press release sites , blogs or personal web sites by Fortis directors or employees , interviews , oral or written public statements , etc . I found no predictions of 6,000 bankruptcies .
THE REAL FORTIS STORY
Now , I am the first person to distrust mainstream news sources .
And for years , I have said that the economic policies of the Bush administration are not sustainable , and we are headed towards a huge collapse .
In fact , we are already seeing many elements of that collapse .
However , this story appears to be nothing more than a net hoax , designed to inspire fear .
Fortis did in fact issue a press release last Friday , summarizing its efforts to raise capital over the last few weeks ( 1.5 billion euros ) to protect itself against potential crash of hedge funds ( particularly oil speculators ) .
This is actually good news for most US consumers .
In early June , financial genius and progressive activist George Soros testified before Congress that oil prices have reached an artificial high of $ 140 per barrel .
His opinion , and the opinion of experts throughout the industry , is that the price has been driven up artificially by futures market and other speculators , and just like the tech market correction / crash of the late 1990's , the oil market will soon correct itself down to the real price of $ 80 - 90 per barrel .
This will most likely result in a price reduction at the pump , possibly a dollar per gallon or more .
Additionally , oil consumption has been slowing down over the past months , and for the first time in years , demand is lower than supply .
Fortis 's efforts have been simply to raise real money , to protect itself against artificially overpriced hedge funds .
THE ANATOMY OF AN URBAN LEGEND
Before my career in the nonprofit sector , I was trained as a researcher at the University of Kansas .
Moreover , I earned a Master 's Degree ( with honors ) in Religious Studies , where we were trained extensively in research methodology , including folklore , legends , and mythology .
As I read this story , and look at the way it is spreading , I realize that though the delivery system ( the internet ) is relatively new , this story has many of the same elements as folklore and legends that are thousands of years old :
- It comes from a " reputable " source
Fortis is a company that most of us vaguely recognize as a world leader in the banking industry , but are n't quite sure what they do .
In fact , all legends and folklore site experts or some slightly unknown reputable source ( my friend 's uncle is an engineer , this was written by a corporate insider , etc ) .
Even the Gospel of Luke begins with a claim that the author has considered all the statements of eye witnesses , all the texts , and all other sources of information before writing his version of events .
- The expert is foreign ( preferably European ) , and the original story is not in English
Not only was the source in Dutch , there were no English translations available , outside the one paragraph summary by the discussion board poster (s ) .
This actually adds perceived credibility to the story .
Americans tend to resent Europeans , yet trust their experts .
We all seem to know , for example , that the Europeans have been driving hybrid cars and using solar and wind power for 30 years , yet this technology seems to be withheld from us .
This also begs additional question about the original poster (s ) who coincidentally first noticed the story at the exact same time ( 4 hours ago ) : were all of these people bilingual Dutch - English readers ?
If not , how were they able to summarize the story for us , in the exact same manner ?
And lastly , English is the official business language in Western Europe - why would an international bank issue a press release in Dutch ?
- It feeds on existing fears and insecurities
Most urban legends are based on economic fears , racial fears , fears or anxieties about technology or the future , fears or anxieties of gays or women , etc .
It 's not exactly a secret that most of us have been negatively affected by the slumping economy of the past 7 years , and by outrageous gas prices .
- A sense of awe and shock , and / or a secret story that was leaked
Ironically , urban legends feed on the notion that we are being hurt by misinformation or lack of information .
This is a huge enticement to coerce many of us into action ( or non-action ) .
As psychologist John Bradshaw has said , many of us are still " stuck " in childhood anxieties , installed by our parents and guardians .
Think about it : the most popular net rumors are the things that were the source of family secrets and anxiety when we were children : sex , gender issues , money , the future , etc .
It is not difficult to manipulate people with more misinformation if you can find an unhealed nerve and touch on it .
- Sense of urgency
This story alleges that this story broke just 4 hours ago , and predicts the market will crash within weeks .
This sense of urgency encourages us to read more , to share with friends , to sell all our stocks ... to do something , anything , before checking out the facts .
- Details are vague and sketchy
I find it highly unlikely that a press release by a huge international firm like Fortis would make such a bold claim , even if it were true .
Nonetheless , an authentic , savvy press release would include facts with details , names of banks and branches likely to be affected , etc .
None of these elements were present in this story .
- It spread over the weekend
Be suspect of stories that " break " over the weekend .
This is a trick used extensively by tricksters such as Karl Rove , because businesses typically cannot respond or react over the weekend , and news rooms are covering issues from previous week , not today 's news .
If you look at the " whisper campaigns " started by Karl Rove in past election cycles , such as John McCain 's " love child " rumor in the 2000 primaries , and the John Kerry swift boat and Navy medal rumors in 2004 , they were all started over the weekend .
They spread like wildfire on talk radio and over the internet , but candidates and mainstream news were not able to respond until the following week .
- A slight basis in the truth
As I learned as a child when trying to manipulate my parents , all effective white lies have a little bit of truth in them .
As I mentioned , Fortis did indeed issue a press release , and it did indeed predict a crash of a specific sector of the market .
And , of course , Fortis is known for its financial savvy .

Altonji , Bharadwaj , and Lange do not know .
They say :
The anemic response of skill investment to skill premium growth | vox - Research - based policy analysis and commentary from leading economists :
The earnings premium for skilled labour has increased dramatically in recent decades .
Yet ...
Americans are not acquiring significantly greater skills in response to this change ....
Since 1980 , the demand for skilled labour has risen faster than the supply of skills , fuelling a steady increase in the earnings premia found for measures of skills such as schooling or cognitive test scores .
The rapid rise in the skill premium represents a substantial increase in the economic incentive to acquire skills ....
[ B] etween 1980 and 2000 the internal rate of return for completing high school rather than dropping out after tenth grade has increased from approximately 40 % to 55 % ....
How rapidly and how much young adults respond to this increase in the returns to skills and how this response varies across the population have important implications ....
In Altonji , Bharadwaj , and Lange ( 2008 ) , we ... look at factors that influence skill acquisition , such as parental education and growing up in a two - parent family ... make use of measures of the ease with which young adults transition from schooling into the labour market ....
[ O ] verall the 1997 youth cohort is more skilled than the 1979 cohort ... at the median ... skill [s ] ... increased by about 6.5 percent .
Is [ that ] ... a behavioural response by youth to the widening skill premium ?... [ N ] o....
[ M]embers of the more recent cohort have significantly more educated parents than young people in 1979 ....
Holding parental education , race and gender , and family structure constant , the supply response to the increase in skill premia between cohorts was small : about 1 % on average and about 1.5 % at the median ....
It seems that very large increases in skill premia are necessary to induce young workers to increase their investments in skills substantially ....
This implies that , all else equal , the large degree of earnings inequality observed today is likely to persist far into the 21st century ....
[ T ]he difference in the skills of the 1980 and 2004 youth cohorts is larger at the top of the skill distribution than at the bottom ... due to the changing distribution of parental education ....
[ T ]he changing distribution of skills in the population will exacerbate rather than counteract the trend towards increasing earnings disparities ....
At this point we can only speculate as to why the response in skills to the increase in skill premia is so small ... non-pecuniary costs of skill investments ... liquidity constrained ... myopic ... other reasons ... consistent with a number of studies ( e.g. Kane ( 1994 ) , Dynarski ( 2003 ) ) that find that schooling decisions are quite sensitive to direct costs of schooling and tuition subsidies ....
Cunha and Heckman ( 2007 ) ... [ perhaps ] parental investment during early childhood shapes the potential to acquire additional skills later in life ....
At this point , the question of why the supply response to the increase in the labour market returns to skill has been so small is an open one .
In our opinion , it ranks among the most important empirical issues facing labour economists today .
June 25 , 2008  --
In Democratic primaries this year the overwhelming majority of Muslim Americans voted for a man who has , throughout the campaign , vigorously knocked down rumors that he is a Muslim .
But support for Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , during the primaries does n't mean the Democrat has a free pass from the Muslim American community .
Last week 's incident at an Obama rally in Michigan put some added strain on Obama 's support in the Muslim American community .
A campaign volunteer reportedly barred two Muslim American women from appearing in camera - range behind Obama 's podium after they refused the campaign representative 's request to remove their headscarves .
After the incident received media attention , Obama called the women personally to apologize .
But the hurt still lingers for some Muslim Americans .
" I was quite disappointed .
The Obama campaign to me , represents a change from traditional politics and embodies an America which supersedes discrimination and racism .
This incident is in stark contradiction to that notion , " said Lydia Habhab , a 23 - year - old Arab Muslim - American graduate student and Dearborn , Michigan native .
" For a candidate who is talking about change , and who is a minority … who is talking about giving hope to everyone , it was very offensive to me as a Muslim woman who wears a headscarf , " said Tuqa Nusairat , a 24 - year - old Arab Muslim - American who is a Virginia native and graduate student .
" Although Obama personally called the girls wearing hijab to apologize , it is still disheartening to think that the level of Islamophobia in his campaign and within America is so high , that having women wearing hijab within a camera shot away from Obama was even an issue , especially within one of the most highly populated Muslim areas in the country , " said Habhab .
Reza Marashi , a 26 - year - old non-practicing Iranian Muslim American raised in Seattle , agrees .
" I think it 's a testament to both the climate of misunderstanding in this country surrounding Muslims and Islam , and the inexcusably poor job the Bush Administration has done in trying to educate American people on Muslims and Islam . "
" Obama called the two women personally to apologize .
That 's the classy thing to do .
If he becomes president , hopefully he 'll continue to address these issues with class , " Marashi added .
While Marashi accepts Obama 's apology , Dr. Yvonne Haddad , a Christian Arab professor at Georgetown University and expert on Islam in North America and the West , said it 's hard to tell whether this incident will have any lasting repercussions among voters .
Muslim Rumors as ' Smears '
The Michigan speech episode adds to some feelings of resentment at the way that Obama has knocked down false rumors that he is , or was at one time , Muslim .
Some say they are offended when the Obama campaign refers to those false assertions that he is a Muslim as " smears . "
The Obama campaign earlier this month launched a new Web site dedicated to knocking down false rumors , especially those circulated on the Internet , called www.fightthesmears.com.
The third ' smear ' listed on the site 's homepage is the one that claims Obama is a Muslim .
The campaign explains on the site that the truth is : " Senator Obama has never been a Muslim , was not raised as a Muslim , and is a committed Christian . "
" When the mudslinging began and campaigns were launched ' exposing ' Obama as a Muslim , he had every reason to deny it , " said Habhab .
But , she said , " I would have preferred Obama to have seized the opportunity to rhetorically ask , ' What is wrong with being a Muslim ? ' raise awareness of this phobia we are self - imposing , and promote the fact that regardless of religion , we are all Americans , which is what matters . "
" Obama has attempted to distance himself , but what he really needs to say is , 'even if I were a Muslim , that 'd be okay , " Julia Shearson , executive director of the non-profit Islamic civil rights and advocacy group Council on Islam - American Relations ( CAIR ) in Ohio .
Brookings Institution senior fellow Shibley Telhami says , " Muslim Americans liked the fact his initial reaction to assertions he was Muslim was , ' I 'm not a Muslim American but so what if I were Muslim ? '
They would love to see him repeat this , and they are frustrated that he has n't repeated it .
They are frustrated with the discourse . "
Haddad agrees that Obama is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to disproving claims he is Muslim .
" What Muslims are objecting to is that his dissociation from Islam is confirming the American attitude that there is something wrong with Islam and that it has no place in American democracy . "
" Muslims are often not viewed as fully American or are seen as the ' other people ' , " said Dawud Walid , executive director of CAIR Michigan .
Walid says Michigan has had mosques vandalized in recent years , and spray - painted with hate slurs such as " 9/11 murderers go home , " as well as death threats against Muslims American leaders , including at his office .
" Since 2001 , candidates have been very sensitive .
The hijab [ incident ] does n't necessarily reflect any attitude on his party , but may be an honest recognition on the part of his staff [ of prevalent opinions towards Muslims in America ] , " said John Voll , professor of Islamic history and associate director of the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim - Christian Understanding at Georgetown University .
Changing Public Opinion
The percentage of Americans with an unfavorable opinion of Muslim Americans has edged upward , from 25 percent in 2005 to 29 percent in 2007 , according to a September 2007 Pew Research Center report .
The report also said that while the Muslim religion had gained increasing national visibility in recent years , 58 percent of Americans said they know little or nothing about the religion 's practices — little changed since 2001 .
A separate report from May 2007 , also by the Pew Research Center , says 53 percent of Muslim Americans say it has become more difficult to be a Muslim in the United States since the September 11 terrorist attacks .
Marashi said as a Muslim American , he has faced discrimination in the U.S. " I was not surprised or offended by the incident at the rally , because I do think this treatment is typical … Muslim Americans have been a part of this country for quite some time now , and they should be treated as such . "
Nusairat says she has been wearing a Muslim headscarf , known as a ' hijab ' since she was very young , and that in Northern Virginia , where she grew up , she faced no significant discrimination .
" After 9/11 , you are more aware of people 's reaction , but there were no serious issues . "
Of wearing the hijab in America , Nusairat says " It 's a personal choice , my interpretation of what god asked me to , god wants me to do , it 's a prescription from my religion .
It 's not just blindly following . "
The practice of wearing a " hijab " is based on Islamic doctrine , although it is not specifically mandated by the Qur'an , nor entirely unique only to Islam .
Controversy over women wearing hijabs abound in Europe , as well as the United States , and even among Muslims .
When asked why she does n't wear a hijab , Habhab said , " This is a very difficult question for me . "
" When you wear the hijab , you are on the front lines of Islamic representation .
I love Islam and I feel that I am a good Muslim , but I represent Islam in a different way .
I represent it by fasting during Ramadan , not drinking , and speaking up when I hear a false statement or misrepresentation about Islam , " said Habhab .
Excluded From Political Life
Some Muslim Americans say they have not always felt welcome in political life .
" For instance , you have had candidates in prior years refusing to accept contributions from people with Muslim sounding names , " said Voll .
But Telhami says the negative attention some Muslims experienced post - 9/11 served to energize them politically .
" Actually while they 're frustrated with the system and sort of the discrimination that they 're anti-American , it 's making them more active than before , " Telhami said .
" You have an anti-Republican backlash that is similar to , but on a higher scale among Muslims , especially exacerbated by the McCain campaign , which frames the war on terrorism as not the ' war against al - Qaeda , ' but the ' war against Islamofacism , ' " said Telhami .
A January 2008 CAIR poll on American Muslim voters found that of 49 percent of Muslim Americans identify themselves as members of the Democratic Party ( up from 42 percent in 2006 ) , while only 8 percent as members of the Republican Party ( down from 17 percent in 2006 ) .
When asked in that same poll which candidate they were supporting in the primaries , 45 percent were uncommited .
Of the 55 percent who did identify a candidate , 25 percent selected then - candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , 20 percent said Obama , and 4 percent said former Sen. John Edwards .
Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , led for preferred Republicans with 2 percent , with the current expected Republican nominee , Sen. John McCain , polling at less than 1 percent .
Telhami said he believes that expression of Muslim American support for Obama was not necessarily an endorsement of Obama per se , but his opposition of the war in Iraq .
" As of late , he added " there has been some frustration with him — not enough to abandon him , but in general , people are worried that he may be overcompensating under pressure , " said Telhami , citing Obama 's recent speech to a pro-Israel lobbying group supporting Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel .
" And the recent episode , where Muslim women wearing headscarves were apparently not allowed to appear behind him — that 's a frustrating episode .
But there is far more frustration with McCain , " said Telhami .
Movement Possible ?
Since they now vote overwhelmingly Democratic , some Muslim Americans worry that their support could be taken for granted by the Democratic Party .
" I do feel like our community is taken for granted .
Obviously our community has dealt with the Patriot Act , targeting , and civil rights , and also a lot of the Muslim community originates in the Middle East , and domestic and foreign issues that have concerned us .
The Democratic Party realizes this , but they do n't realize people could just sit it out or vote for Nader , " said Nusairat .
" Muslim Americans display a grand spectrum of interests .
In terms of foreign policy , we may be more in line with the Democratic Party , but that is where it ends .
For those Muslims who are also Arab like me , we have a huge entrepreneurial spirit making the many Muslim / Arab American small business owners fiscally in line with Republicans , " said Habhab .
" Furthermore , Republicans are socially conservative which is also in line with a lot of Islamic teachings such as in issues of abortion , same sex marriages , etc .
I think it would be foolish to take the Muslim American vote for granted . "
Telhami says it 's difficult to poll Muslim Americans for political affiliation , since the community is diverse and can be hard to identify in data gathered by the U.S. Census .
" They do n't all have identical views .
In general they are frustrated with American policy and they have been in recent years far more democratic , but in general they are socially conservative , " said Telhami .
" I do n't call myself a Democrat , " Marashi said .
" I vote on the issues , not on the parties .
When I vote in elections , I support candidates who have views on issues that are similar to mine .
It could be a Democrat or Republican , " said Marashi .
Parents ' fury at ' Down 's Syndrome dolls ' designed to help children deal with disability
At a distance , it may seem to be an ordinary , if a little old - fashioned , doll .
But look up close and you will see that it is , in fact , quite unusual .
The protruding tongue , almond - shaped eyes , flattened nose and low ears all make it very different to most shop - bought toys .
So do the small mouth , short fingers and the horizontal crease across the palm of the hands .
Controversial : Disabled dolls , like this one with Down 's syndrome , are popular
This is a Down ’s syndrome doll which has been designed with the characteristics of children born with the condition .
It ’s one of an increasingly popular — but hugely controversial — range of dolls with different disabilities produced to give youngsters with health problems a toy with which they can identify .
The manufacturers claim such dolls , which are finding a growing market in Britain , help ‘ normalise ’ conditions like Down ’s syndrome so young sufferers do n’t feel so different from their friends .
They even say such dolls may help make disabled people more accepted by society .
Children undergoing cancer treatment can get ‘ chemo ’ dolls which are bald and come complete with headscarves .
Others are available with hearing aids , glasses , guide dogs , wheelchairs , crutches and leg braces .
Many parents of disabled children have welcomed the dolls as a realistic alternative to the physical perfection of the Baby Annabells already on the market .
Others , however , dismiss them as a sick joke .
In fact , their detractors believe they only emphasise a disabled child ’s differences to their able - bodied friends .
Civil servant Sue Farren , from Durham , whose daughter Rebecca has cerebral palsy and has to use a wheelchair , is horrified by the very idea .
Inspiration : Disabled children feel more part of society , the makers claim
She says : ‘ To me , creating disabled dolls like these and giving them to a child pigeon - holes the disabled and turns them into something akin to a freak show .
‘ It seems as if the disability is being highlighted here , whereas most disabled kids just want to blend in and be accepted for who they are — Rebecca does n’t even like her disability being referred to .
‘ Also , it worries me that able - bodied children might treat these dolls as a figure of fun .
Life is difficult enough as a disabled child , as Rebecca will testify , without this unwelcome attention . ’
Her daughter was 13 months ’ old when doctors diagnosed cerebral palsy , but it has n’t held her back .
Sue , 50 , says : ‘ Rebecca is 14 now — a very bright girl who is in mainstream school , taking eight GCSEs , and is predicted to do well and hopefully go on to university .
She likes to feel there is very little she cannot do , and I think that to have given her a doll when she was younger which highlighted her disability could have knocked her confidence .
‘ Growing up with her disability was hard work — even going to stay at a friend ’s house was difficult , as she needs help in a home which is n’t adapted for the purpose , as ours is .
‘ Her aim is to lead a fully independent life , and I think to have given her a doll in a wheelchair would only have reinforced a painful self - image . ’
Social worker Alison Wellemin ’s daughter Sarah is one of the 60,000 people living in the UK with Down ’s syndrome .
' Terrifying ' :
One parent said the dolls only serve to ' single out ' disability
Alison , 51 , from North London , has huge doubts about the benefits of disabled toys .
‘ When Sarah was six , her mainstream primary school bought a Down ’s syndrome doll with the best of intentions , ’ she says .
‘ But I thought it was horrible and even overheard a teacher referring to it as “ peculiar ” .
‘ Far from educating others about children with Down ’s syndrome , these dolls single children like Sarah out and stereotype them just because they have the condition .
‘ They are totally one - dimensional — they ca n’t show that a child with Down ’s syndrome can be funny , bright and articulate .
SARAH is now 16 .
Her mother says : ‘ She has just sat four GCSEs , and recently enjoyed their end - of - year school prom on a boat on the Thames .
She did n’t gain such acceptance through having unrealistic props like Down ’s syndrome dolls .
Her friends treat Sarah as just another person because she ’s always integrated with other children .
‘ Integration is the key to normalising Down ’s syndrome rather than drawing unnecessary attention to it through dolls . ’
But there ’s no doubt there is a growing demand for them .
When Mattel launched Becky , a friend of Barbie , in a bright pink wheelchair , it sold out in a fortnight .
East Sussex - based company kidslikeme .co.uk also saw the potential for catering for overlooked
minority groups .
They ’ve launched ranges of black and Asian dolls as well as ones wearing hearing aids , glasses and leg braces with accompanying guide dogs and wheelchairs .
Until now , dolls with Down ’s syndrome have not been made in the UK and have only been available over the internet .
That seems likely to change .
Education : Many experts believe dolls like this can help all children learn
Donna Moore , from South Carolina , set up downicreations.com 12 years ago and is currently in talks with British stores to stock her products .
As a former special needs teacher , she says she felt there was a real need for them .
‘ Children with Down ’s syndrome did n’t have anything to identify with .
They carry around baby dolls that do n’t look anything like them .
‘ The children realise they are not the same and they want something to identify with , like all children . ’
WHEN teaching , Donna , who has three sons , became friends with a young boy called Tim , now 24 , who has Down ’s syndrome .
He helped inspire her .
‘ When he came to stay with us , he had an ugly little girl ’s doll , so I told him I was making him a new one , ’ she says .
‘ I visited manufacturers and found an artist .
I took him pictures of children with Down ’s syndrome I knew and we worked on them until we got it right . ’
Each of her £ 90 dolls has the 13 indications of the condition , such as small ears and a flattened nose , as well as a mark on the chest to indicate the scars of the heart surgery most Down ’s syndrome sufferers undergo as they are often born with defects .
Donna , who runs her company as a not - for - profit charity , denies her dolls harm rather than help disabled children .
‘ I can count the negative comments I ’ve had on one hand , ’ she says .
‘ Otherwise it ’s been overwhelming approval .
‘ For a child , seeing themselves and having something they can identify with is so important .
‘ Our society today is hung up on perfection and when a child with Down ’s syndrome picks up a regular doll , they do n’t see themselves .
I ’ve heard so many people say “ They do n’t know the difference ” , but they do .
‘ We are not trying to promote the difference , we are trying to promote their beauty and let them know they may have different features , but inside they are still the same .
They have the same hopes and dreams . ’
Her dolls are n’t just bought for children , though .
‘ I ’ve sold to parents who have lost children and they say it ’s a reminder of what their child was like .
That ’s wonderful .
‘ Schools , hospitals and universities have also bought them and I think this will help educate children .
They say ignorance is bliss , but the more we teach about Down ’s syndrome , the more receptive and understanding children will be towards others with the condition . ’
Maria Campas , from Muswell Hill , London , could n’t agree more .
She was initially distraught when , eight years ago , her daughter Victoria was diagnosed with Down ’s syndrome , just minutes after being born .
But later Maria and her husband Richard Davis , both photographers , vowed to end the stigma attached to the condition and set up the London branch of the Down ’s Syndrome Association .
She says : ‘ Two years ago on a trip to Brazil , I came across a Down ’s syndrome doll and bought it for Victoria .
She loved her other dolls at home but I thought having a doll that looked just like her would make her realise that she was n’t so different after all .
‘ She loves the doll .
She ’s called her Clara and she always plays with her as well as her normal dolls . ’
Maria believes such toys should be in the play areas of schools and hospitals to help normalise the condition and challenge people ’s perception of it .
She says : ‘ We had a naive perception early on that children with Down ’s did n’t develop or walk properly and did n’t look clean and fresh .
It ’s just not the case .
‘ Victoria ’s in mainstream school , she goes to ballet classes and gymnastics and although she ’s a bit slower to learn than the other kids , she ’s thriving .
‘ But I strongly feel that introducing the disability dolls into lots of places would make a huge difference to how society accepts those with Down ’s syndrome .
‘ If they were as used to seeing such dolls , perhaps people would n’t be so shocked when they encounter a child like Victoria .
Perhaps they would n’t stare so much in the street .
‘ They need to understand that just because they look different , Down ’s syndrome kids can communicate and play like any other child and many of them do really well at school and in life now . ’
Carol Boys , chief executive of the Down ’s Syndrome Association , also believes they can be positive , but warns buyers to be careful as the ranges vary in quality and accuracy .
‘ Anything that helps to “ normalise ” Down ’s syndrome and promote inclusivity has to be a good thing , ’ she says .
‘ If the Down ’s syndrome dolls give joy to those with the condition and their siblings , we fully support them . ’
But not everyone agrees .
There have been so many offensive comments posted on Helga Parks ’ down syndromedolls.com website , she has been forced to post a disclaimer on it .
Helga sells around 2,000 dolls a year at £ 25 each as far afield as the UK , Australia and Saudi Arabia .
Her new venture , Chemo Friends , are hairless dolls with a catheter port for children undergoing cancer treatment .
‘ This just reeks of a bad joke , ’ says one comment on the website .
Emma Moorcroft , from Abbots Langley , Herts , thought the same thing when she first saw the dolls .
The 31 - year - old ’s daughter Sian , five , suffers from a rare condition called intermediate ( Type II ) spinal muscular atrophy , and will never walk because she does not have enough muscle .
As well as being concerned that the toys emphasise her daughter ’s difference from other children , she was also concerned with their appearance .
Emma says : ‘ Sian loves her toys , so when I first heard about a disability doll I thought it was a great idea .
‘ I imagined they would be trendy little dolls , like her Barbies , only perhaps with a fantastic snazzy pink wheelchair .
‘ But when I actually saw them I was shocked by how terrifying they look .
In fact , they are so offensive they are the last thing I would actually give her to play with .
They look so abnormal — not at all appealing , pretty or trendy .
‘ Sian is already very image - conscious and loves wearing fashionable clothes .
But these dolls are ugly with old - fashioned clothes , so Sian would n’t relate to that at all .
‘ Instead , they would single her out as different and make her disability stand out more than it does already . ’
Sara Kelsoe , 23 , has similar concerns but believes if the dolls were brought up to date , they could work .
Her son Cieran , three , contracted meningitis two years ago and had to have both his legs and some fingers amputated .
‘ These dolls look disturbing and somewhat sinister , ’ says Sara , from Northwich , Cheshire .
‘ But it would be fantastic if Action Man could take his legs off at night when he went to bed and put them on the next morning ready to conquer the world .
‘ That is the reality of Cieran ’s life — he wears prosthetic legs but like many boys , he dreams of fighting baddies and playing football .
It would be a great way of telling him that despite having no legs , there is nothing he wo n’t be able to do . ’
So are these ‘ disabled dolls ’ a force for good , or well - intentioned folly ?
It ’s a question which bitterly divides thousands of parents of disabled children — and as they become more widely available , the controversy will only grow .

Less than four months after losing the California primary , Democrat Barack Obama leads Republican John McCain in projected November general election matchups , a new Los Angeles Times / KTLA
Poll has found .
Obama , the Illinois senator who has inched close to his party ’s nomination , would defeat McCain by seven points if the election were held today .
New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , whose fortunes have faltered since her Feb.
5 drubbing of Obama in California , would eke out only a three - point victory , the poll found .
The poll appeared to illustrate that Democrats , at least in California , are gravitating toward the candidate who is broadly expected to eventually seize the party ’s mantle .
Obama now runs better against the Arizona senator than does Clinton among many of the groups that powered her victory in the state , among them Latinos , Catholics and those without college degrees .
Although exit polls in recent primaries elsewhere have shown Clinton supporters reluctant to embrace Obama as the nominee , there was little of that sentiment evident in the California poll .
But the survey could not measure whether time had eased partisan passions or whether Californians were predisposed to embrace either Democrat .
Advertisement
Overall , Obama led McCain 47 % to 40 % among registered voters , while Clinton led McCain 43 % to 40 % .
McCain has insisted that he will compete to win California in the fall .
But California has gone to the Democrat in each of the last four presidential elections .
Most of the state ’s political professionals consider it to be reliably Democratic -- and too expensive to prompt a full - throated effort by a Republican candidate who could amass electoral votes more cheaply elsewhere .
McCain ’s standing against Obama -- coming after months of good news for the Republican and a brutal and continuing Democratic primary battle -- offered the presumptive GOP nominee little solace .
One bright spot was support among Latinos .
McCain won 38 % of Latinos against Obama and 41 % against Clinton ; both figures are substantially higher than the proportion won by George W. Bush in his two presidential campaigns .
But other poll findings suggest problems for McCain .
The senator has made joint appearances with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and has touted the affinity between the two .
But the governor ’s job approval rating has slumped dramatically , from 60 % favorable among voters in January to 43 % favorable now .
About 42 % of Californians disapproved of how Schwarzenegger has handled his job .
Advertisement
The rating was the lowest for Schwarzenegger since October 2005 , shortly before voters soundly rejected ballot measures he pressed for in a special election .
The poll also found Californians more pessimistic about the state ’s direction than at any time since the 2003 recall that swept Schwarzenegger into office .
Fewer than one in five voters felt the state was headed in the right direction , with two - thirds convinced it was on the wrong track .
That was the lowest rating since August 2003 , on the eve of the recall campaign , when a mere 14 % of voters were optimistic .
Women were among the most pessimistic , with 16 % judging the state headed in the right direction .
Not coincidentally , they viewed the governor far less favorably than Californians overall , with only 35 % approving of how he has governed .
Republicans , too , were negative , with 73 % saying the state was on the wrong track and 52 % approving of Schwarzenegger ’s tenure .
The governor has clashed repeatedly with fellow Republicans on a range of policy issues .
Advertisement
The poll , under the direction of Susan Pinkus , interviewed 834 Californians , including 705 registered voters , on Tuesday and Wednesday .
The margin of error is 3 percentage points in either direction overall and 4 points for registered voters .
Margins were larger for demographic subgroups .
Signs that Democratic loyalty had survived the primary surfaced repeatedly in the survey .
To take one measure , Clinton won 76 % of Democrats against McCain ; Obama won 75 % , a statistically insignificant difference .
In any case , Obama more than made up for it by winning more independents and Republicans than Clinton would .
Gregory Sanders , a Democrat from West Hollywood , said he “ avidly ” supported Clinton in the primary but would now back Obama .
“ I accept that she lost the nomination , ” he said in a follow - up interview , adding that he still has “ reservations ” about Obama because of the controversial comments made by his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Advertisement
“ He strikes me as naive , and the Rev. Wright scandal demonstrates that , ” Sanders said .
“ Obama knew that was a problem and he did n’t do anything about it . ”
But Lena Neal , a Democrat from Perris , described herself as a former Clinton supporter who had turned to Obama as the primary season progressed .
“ He ’s just a down - to - earth person , just a reachable person , ” she said .
Clinton demonstrated more strength than Obama among only a few demographic groups , including white women and older women .
But her small advantage among those groups tends to undercut her argument that she is the Democrat best able to deliver big states in November -- at least where California is concerned .
Matched against McCain , Obama won a larger percentage than Clinton of self - described liberals , moderates and conservatives .
Both he and Clinton won 86 % of liberal Democrats and about two - thirds of moderate Democrats .
Advertisement
Democratic women , Clinton ’s bulwark throughout the primaries and a source of emotional sustenance now , in the closing days of the race , showed no sign of turning against Obama .
About 74 % of them sided with Clinton against McCain ; 75 % sided with Obama against McCain .
Obama won larger percentages against McCain than did Clinton among white voters ; he lost them to McCain by four points , while Clinton lost by eight .
Surprisingly , however , Obama made up ground among Latinos , who overwhelmingly backed Clinton in the primary .
A little more than half of Latinos sided with Obama over McCain , while just under half sided with Clinton over McCain .
McCain has argued that he can run strongly among Latinos , in part because he has long favored comprehensive immigration reform that would include a strategy to legalize immigrants , much to the disdain of many in his party .
In the survey , he lost Latinos to Clinton by six points and to Obama by 14 points .
Becky Espinoza of Kerman , a Republican , said she would vote for McCain because “ he ’s got more experience . ”
Advertisement
“ The only thing I hesitate on is his age , ” she said .
Key to Obama ’s strength in California , at this point , is the group that was largely ignored in the run-up to the primary : men .
Overall , Obama held a 10 - point advantage over McCain among men , while Clinton split men with McCain .
White men gave McCain a three - point advantage over Obama and a 15 - point edge over Clinton .
Nonwhite men sided with the Democrats in landslide proportions .
With Republicans now only about one - third of the California electorate , GOP candidates must reach deeply into the ranks of moderates if they are to win statewide .
There , McCain was faltering .
He was losing moderates to Clinton by 24 points and to Obama by 30 points .
He was also having a difficult time holding on to his own party members .
One in five Republicans surveyed by the poll sided with Obama in their matchup .
McCain won only 70 % of his party colleagues , not enough to offset losing independents and 75 % of Democrats to Obama .
Advertisement
The party loyalty numbers were a potential sign of trouble for both McCain and Obama , though at this point they are canceling each other out .
Typically , candidates corral nine out of 10 of their party ’s voters .
A substantial drop in Republican support for McCain would put the state out of reach for him , and a drop in Democratic support for Obama could make California more competitive .

Does ADD make you tired ?
Sleep disturbances caused by ADHD have been overlooked for a number of reasons , including the late age of onset .
But recent studies confirm that ADD symptoms do not go away at night .
Here , understand the ADHD and sleep link and its most common manifestations .
Plus , get tips for winding down quicker , staying asleep longer , and waking up healthier .
ADHD and Sleep Problems
Adults with ADHD rarely fall asleep easily , sleep soundly through the night , and then wake up feeling refreshed .
More often , ADHD ’s mental and physical restlessness disturbs a person ’s sleep patterns — and the ensuing exhaustion hurts overall health and treatment .
This is widely accepted as true .
But , as with most of our knowledge about ADHD in adults , we ’re only beginning to understand the stronger link between ADHD and sleep , that creates difficulties :
Falling asleep
Staying asleep
Waking up
Sleep disturbances caused by ADHD have been overlooked for a number of reasons .
Sleep problems did not fit neatly into the American Psychiatric Association ’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) requirement that all ADHD symptoms must be present by age 7 .
Sleep disturbances associated with ADHD generally appear later in life , at around age 12 , on average .
Consequently , the arbitrary age cutoff has prevented recognition of sleep disturbances in ADHD until recently , when studies of adults have become more common .
Just as ADHD does not go away at adolescence , it does not go away at night either .
It continues to impair life functioning 24 hours a day .
In early attempts to define the syndrome , sleep disturbances were briefly considered a criterion for ADHD , but were dropped from the symptoms list because evidence of them was thought to be too nonspecific .
As research has expanded to include adults with ADHD , the causes and effects of sleeping disturbances have become clearer .
For now , sleep problems tend either to be overlooked or to be viewed as coexisting problems with an unclear relationship to ADHD itself .
Sleep disturbances have been incorrectly attributed to the stimulant - class medications that are often the first to be used to treat ADHD .
The Four Big ADHD Sleep Problems
No scientific literature on sleep lists ADHD as a prominent cause of sleep disturbances .
Most articles focus on sleep disturbance due to stimulant - class medications , rather than looking at ADHD as the cause .
Yet adults with ADHD know that the connection between their condition and sleep problems is real .
Sufferers often call it “ perverse sleep ” — when they want to be asleep , they are awake ; when they want to be awake , they are asleep .
[ Watch This Video : 5 Fixes for “ I Can’t Sleep ” ]
The four most common sleep disturbances associated with ADHD are :
1. Difficulty Falling Asleep with ADHD
About three - fourths of all adults with ADHD report inability to “ shut off my mind so I can fall asleep at night . ”
Many describe themselves as “ night owls ” who get a burst of energy when the sun goes down .
Others report that they feel tired throughout the day , but as soon as the head hits the pillow , the mind clicks on .
Their thoughts jump or bounce from one worry to another .
Unfortunately , many of these adults describe their thoughts as “ racing , ” prompting a misdiagnosis of a mood disorder , when this is nothing more than the mental restlessness of ADHD .
Prior to puberty , 10 to 15 percent of children with ADHD have trouble getting to sleep .
This is twice the rate found in children and adolescents who do not have ADHD .
This number dramatically increases with age : 50 percent of children with ADHD have difficulty falling asleep almost every night by age 12 ½ by age 30 , more than 70 percent of adults with ADHD report that they spend more than one hour trying to fall asleep at night .
2. Restless Sleep with ADHD
When individuals with ADHD finally fall asleep , their sleep is restless .
They toss and turn .
They awaken at any noise in the house .
They are so fitful that bed partners often choose to sleep in another bed .
They often awake to find the bed torn apart and covers kicked onto the floor .
Sleep is not refreshing and they awaken as tired as when they went to bed .
[ How Sleep Deprivation Looks a Lot Like ADHD ]
3. Difficulty Waking Up with ADHD
More than 80 percent of adults with ADHD in my practice report multiple awakenings until about 4 a.m .
Then they fall into “ the sleep of the dead , ” from which they have extreme difficulty rousing themselves .
They sleep through two or three alarms , as well as the attempts of family members to get them out of bed .
ADHD sleepers are commonly irritable , even combative , when roused before they are ready .
Many of them say they are not fully alert until noon .
4. Intrusive Sleep with ADHD
Paul Wender , M.D. , a 30 - year veteran ADHD researcher , relates ADHD to interest - based performance .
As long as persons with ADHD were interested in or challenged by what they were doing , they did not demonstrate symptoms of the disorder .
( This phenomenon is called hyperfocus by some , and is often considered to be an ADHD pattern . )
If , on the other hand , an individual with ADHD loses interest in an activity , his nervous system disengages , in search of something more interesting .
Sometimes this disengagement is so abrupt as to induce sudden extreme drowsiness , even to the point of falling asleep .
Marian Sigurdson , Ph.D. , an expert on electroencephalography ( EEG ) findings in ADHD , reports that brain wave tracings at this time show a sudden intrusion of theta waves into the alpha and beta rhythms of alertness .
We all have seen “ theta wave intrusion , ” in the student in the back of the classroom who suddenly crashes to the floor , having “ fallen asleep . ”
This was probably someone with ADHD who was losing consciousness due to boredom rather than falling asleep .
This syndrome is life - threatening if it occurs while driving , and it is often induced by long - distance driving on straight , monotonous roads .
Often this condition is misdiagnosed as “ EEG negative narcolepsy . ”
The extent of incidence of intrusive “ sleep ” is not known , because it occurs only under certain conditions that are hard to reproduce in a laboratory .
Why Do People with ADHD Have Problems Sleeping ?
There are several theories about the causes of sleep disturbance in people with ADHD , with a telling range of viewpoints .
Physicians base their responses to their patients ’ complaints of sleep problems on how they interpret the cause of the disturbances .
A physician who looks first for disturbances resulting from disorganized life patterns will treat problems in a different way than a physician who thinks of them as a manifestation of ADHD .
Thomas Brown , Ph.D. , longtime researcher in ADHD and developer of the Brown Scales , was one of the first to give serious attention to the problem of sleep in children and adolescents with ADHD .
He sees sleep disturbances as indicative of problems of arousal and alertness in ADHD itself .
Two of the five symptom clusters that emerge from the Brown Scales involve activation and arousal :
Organizing and activating to begin work activities .
Sustaining alertness , energy , and effort .
Brown views problems with sleep as a developmentally - based impairment of management functions of the brain — particularly , an impairment of the ability to sustain and regulate arousal and alertness .
Interestingly , he does not recommend treatments common to ADHD , but rather recommends a two - pronged approach that stresses better sleep hygiene and the suppression of unwanted and inconvenient arousal states by using medications with sedative properties .
The simplest explanation is that sleep disturbances are direct manifestations of ADHD itself .
True hyperactivity is extremely rare in women of any age .
Most women experience the mental and physical restlessness of ADHD only when they are trying to shut down the arousal state of day - to - day functioning in order to fall asleep .
At least 75 percent of adults of both genders report that their minds restlessly move from one concern to another for several hours until they finally fall asleep .
Even then , they toss and turn , awaken frequently , and sometimes barely sleep at all .
The fact that 80 percent of adults with ADHD eventually fall into “ the sleep of the dead ” has led researchers to look for explanations .
No single theory explains the severe impairment of the ability to rouse oneself into wakefulness .
Some patients with ADHD report that they sleep well when they go camping or are out of doors for extended periods of time .
One hypothesis is that the lack of an accurate circadian clock may also account for the difficulty that many with ADHD have in judging the passage of time .
Their internal clocks are not “ set . ”
Consequently , they experience only two times : “ now ” and “ not now . ”
Many of my adult patients do not wear watches .
They experience time as an abstract concept , important to other people , but one which they do n’t understand .
It will take many more studies to establish the links between circadian rhythms and ADHD .
How to Get to Sleep with ADD
No matter how a doctor explains sleep problems , the remedy usually involves something called “ sleep hygiene , ” which considers all the things that foster the initiation and maintenance of sleep .
This set of conditions is highly individualized .
Some people need absolute silence .
Others need white noise , such as a fan or radio , to mask disturbances to sleep .
Some people need a snack before bed , while others can’t eat anything right before bedtime .
A few rules of sleep hygiene are universal :
Use the bed only for sleep or sex , not as a place to confront problems or argue .
Have a set bedtime and a bedtime routine and stick to it — rigorously .
Avoid naps during the day .
Two more elements of good sleep hygiene seem obvious , but they should be stressed for people with ADHD .
Get in bed to go to sleep .
Many people with ADHD are at their best at night .
They are most energetic , thinking clearest , and most stable after the sun goes down .
The house is quiet and distractions are low .
This is their most productive time .
Unfortunately , they have jobs and families to which they must attend the next morning , tasks made harder by inadequate sleep .

Unfortunately , they have jobs and families to which they must attend the next morning , tasks made harder by inadequate sleep .
Avoid caffeine late at night .
Caffeine can cause a racing ADHD brain to grow more excitable and alert .
Caffeine is also a diuretic , although not as potent as experts once thought , and may cause sleep disruptions brought on by needing to go to the bathroom .
It is a good strategy to avoid consuming any liquids shortly before bedtime .
Treatment Options for ADHD - Related Sleep Problems
If the patient spends hours a night with thoughts bouncing and his body tossing , this is probably a manifestation of ADHD .
The best treatment is a dose of stimulant - class medication 45 minutes before bedtime .
This course of action , however , is a hard sell to patients who suffer from difficulty sleeping .
Consequently , once they have determined their optimal dose of medication , I ask them to take a nap an hour after they have taken the second dose .
Generally , they find that the medication ’s “ paradoxical effect ” of calming restlessness is sufficient to allow them to fall asleep .
Most adults are so sleep - deprived that a nap is usually successful .
Once people see for themselves , in a “ no - risk ” situation , that the medications can help them shut off their brains and bodies and fall asleep , they are more willing to try medications at bedtime .
About two - thirds of my adult patients take a full dose of their ADHD medication every night to fall asleep .
What if the reverse clinical history is present ?
One - fourth of people with ADHD either do n’t have a sleep disturbance or have ordinary difficulty falling asleep .
Stimulant - class medications at bedtime are not helpful to them .
Dr. Brown recommends
Benadryl , 25 to 50 mg , about one hour before bed .
Benadryl is an antihistamine sold without prescription and is not habit - forming .
The downside is that it is long - acting , and can cause sleepiness for up to 60 hours in some individuals .
About 10 percent of those with ADHD experience severe paradoxical agitation with Benadryl and never try it again .
Experts point out that sleep disturbances in people diagnosed with ADHD are not always due to ADHD - related causes .
Sometimes patients have a co-morbid sleep disorder in addition to ADHD .
Some professionals will order a sleep study for their patients to determine the cause of the sleep disturbance .
Such tests as a Home Sleeping Test , Polysomnogram , or a Multiple Sleep Latency Test may be prescribed .
If there are secondary sleep problems , doctors may use additional treatment options to manage sleep time challenges .
The next step up the treatment ladder is prescription medications .
Most clinicians avoid sleeping pills because they are potentially habit - forming .
People quickly develop tolerance to them and require ever - increasing doses .
So , the next drugs of choice tend to be non -habit - forming , with significant sedation as a side effect .
They are :
Melatonin .
This naturally occurring peptide released by the brain in response to the setting of the sun has some function in setting the circadian clock .
It is available without prescription at most pharmacies and health food stores .
Typically the dosage sizes sold are too large .
Almost all of the published research on Melatonin is on doses of 1 mg or less , but the doses available on the shelves are either 3 or 6 mg .
Nothing is gained by using doses greater than one milligram .
Melatonin may not be effective the first night , so several nights ’ use may be necessary for effectiveness .

Clonidine .
Some practitioners recommend in a 0.05 to 0.1 mg dose one hour before bedtime .
This medication is used for high blood pressure , and it is the drug of choice for the hyperactivity component of ADHD .
It exerts significant sedative effects for about four hours .

Antidepressant medications , such as trazodone ( Desyrel ) , 50 to 100 mg , or mirtazapine ( Remeron ) , 15 mg , used by some clinicians for their sedative side effects .
Due to a complex mechanism of action , lower doses of mirtazapine are more sedative than higher ones .
More is not better .
Like Benadryl , these medications tend to produce sedation into the next day , and may make getting up the next morning harder than it was .
Problems Waking Up with ADHD
Problems in waking and feeling fully alert can be approached in two ways .
The simpler is a two - alarm system .
The patient sets a first dose of stimulant - class medication and a glass of water by the bedside .
An alarm is set to go off one hour before the person actually plans to rise .
When the alarm rings , the patient rouses himself enough to take the medication and goes back to sleep .
When a second alarm goes off , an hour later , the medication is approaching peak blood level , giving the individual a fighting chance to get out of bed and start his day .
A second approach is more high - tech , based on evidence that difficulty waking in the morning is a circadian rhythm problem .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the use of sunset / sunrise - simulating lights can set the internal clocks of people with Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome .
As an added benefit , many people report that they sharpen their sense of time and time management once their internal clock is set properly .
The lights , however , are experimental and expensive ( about $ 400 ) .
Disturbances of sleep in people with ADHD are common , but are almost completely ignored by our current diagnostic system and in ADHD research .
These patterns become progressively worse with age .
Recognition of sleep disturbance in ADHD has been hampered by the misattribution of the difficulty falling asleep to the effects of stimulant - class medications .
We now recognize that sleep difficulties are associated with ADHD itself , and that stimulant - class medications are often the best treatment of sleep problems rather than the cause of them .

( NewsTarget ) Blood transfusions increase the risk of complications and reduce survival rates .
Recent research is revealing that almost immediately after it is donated , blood begins to loose its ability to transfer oxygen from the red cells into the tissues of the patient .
When patients receive stored blood , their chances of heart attack , heart failure , stroke and death increase in proportion to the length of time the blood has been stored .
Nitric oxide in red blood cells is critical to the delivery of oxygen to tissues .
It is nitric oxide that keeps blood vessels open .
Several recent studies have shown that the nitric oxide in red blood cells begins to break down almost immediately after the donated cells leave the body of the donor .
It does n't matter how much oxygen is carried by red blood cells .
Without sufficient amounts of nitric oxide , this oxygen cannot reach the tissues .
When the blood vessels cannot open because of insufficient nitric oxide , tissues go without oxygen .
The result can be fatal .
In a study reported in the March 20 , 2008 , researchers tested the hypothesis that serious complications and mortality after cardiac surgery are increased when transfused red cells are stored for more than 2 weeks .
Data was examined from patients given red cell transfusions during coronary - artery bypass grafting , heart - valve surgery , or both between June 30 , 1998 and January 30 , 2006 .
A total of 2,872 patients received 8,802 units of blood that had been stored for 14 days or less ( " newer blood " ) and 3,130 patients received 10,782 units of blood that had been stored for more than 14 days ( " older blood " ) .
The median duration of storage was 11 days for newer blood and 20 days for older blood .
Researchers found that patients who were given older units had higher rates of in - hospital mortality ( 2.8 % vs. 1.7 % , P=0.003 ) , incubation beyond 72 hours ( 7 % vs. 5.6 % , P=0.001 ) .
kidney failure ( 2.7 % vs.1.6 % , P=0.003 ) , and sepsis or septicemia ( 4.0 % vs. 2.8 % , P=0.01 ) .
A composite of complications was more common in patients given older blood ( 25.9 % vs. 22.4 % , P=0.001 ) .
Older blood was associated with an increase in the risk - adjusted rate of the composite outcomes ( P=0.03 ) .
At one year , mortality was significantly less in the patients given newer blood ( 7.4 % vs. 11.0 % P < 0.001 ) .
Researchers concluded that in patients undergoing cardiac surgery , transfusion of red cells that had been stored for more than 2 weeks was associated with a significant increased risk of postoperative complications as well as reduced short - term and long - term survival .
In another study , at the University of Bristol and the Bristol Heart Institute in the U.K. , reported by the American Heart Association in , research was aimed at quantifying associations of transfusion with clinical outcomes and cost in patients having cardiac surgery .
Researchers examined clinical , hematology , and blood transfusion databases linked with the UK population register .
Additional hematocrit information was obtained from intensive care unit charts .
Respiratory , wound infections or septicemia , and heart attack , stoke , and renal impairment or failure were pre-specified as co-primary end points .
Secondary outcomes were resource use , cost , and survival .
Associations were estimated with an adjusted regression model .
All adult patients having cardiac surgery over an eight year period with key exposure and outcome data were included in the study .
Researchers concluded that patients receiving a red blood cell transfusion were three times more likely to experience complications from lack of oxygen to key organs , such as heart attack or stroke .
At any time after their operations , transfused patients were less likely to have been discharged from the hospital , and were more likely to have died .
Red blood cell transfusions were also associated with increase length of hospital stay , increased early and late mortality , and higher hospital costs .
A study at Duke university in 2004 found that heart patients who receive a blood transfusion to treat blood loss or anemia were twice as likely to die during their first 30 days of hospitalization .
They were also more than three times as likely to suffer a heart attack within 30 days , when compared to those who did not receive a transfusion .
This study was based on a retrospective analysis of the treatments received by more than 24,000 patients who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome .
There are times when transfusion may be necessary , such as when a patient has undergone massive blood loss .
However , it is apparent that many physicians often rush to order a transfusion when it may not be needed , simply based on the patient having low numbers on a blood test .
The body can generally respond to lower blood levels by producing more red blood cells .
This is how a donor replaces the blood he has donated .
These study results suggest that this readiness to transfuse needs to be examined .
When transfusion is indicated , the age of the blood should be a consideration in light of the study results , even if it is your own blood that has been banked for use in your surgery .
Current practice is to store blood for transfusion for up to six weeks .
Yet this research indicates that positive outcomes are associated with transfusions of fresh blood .
Treating stored red blood cells with a solution of nitric oxide results in restoration of most of the ability of the red cells to provide oxygen to tissues .
As the first study indicates , stored blood becomes deficient in nitric oxide , limiting its ability to transport oxygen to the tissues of the body .
Yet stored blood is not routinely treated with nitric oxide before it is administered in most hospitals .
The ability to screen donated blood for HIV and other infections has lead to an understanding among people that blood for transfusion is safe .
People accept transfusion when it is bought up , because they assume it is a safe procedure .
These studies indicate otherwise .
As these findings become more widely known , empowered patients may begin to question the need and appropriateness of transfusion except in the most dire of circumstances .
The empowered patient may even begin to question the need for the surgery that is being recommended , and view it , as also indicated , in only the most dire circumstances .

Hillary Clinton has joined Barack Obama at a rally - their first public event since she pulled out of the race to be the Democratic presidential candidate .
The rally in Unity , New Hampshire , was an opportunity for supporters of the party to come together after the divisive primary battle .
The event follows a joint dinner in Washington where Mr Obama offered help to clear Mrs Clinton 's campaign debts .
Mrs Clinton urged supporters at the Democratic rally to vote for Mr Obama .
JUSTIN WEBB'S AMERICA
Being lucky is important in politics and Obama does have that aura about him
The luck of Obama " If you think we need a new course , a new agenda , then vote for Barack Obama and you will get the change you need , " she told the cheering crowd .
" He will work for you , he will fight for you and he will stand up for you every day in the White House . "
After her speech , Mr Obama joined the crowd in chanting " thank you Hillary " .
He said the Democrats needed Mrs Clinton and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , if they were to win the presidency .
" We need them badly - not just my campaign , but the American people need their service and their vision and their wisdom , " Mr Obama said .
Debt burden
Although he and Mrs Clinton had started the campaign for the Democratic nomination with different agendas , Mr Obama said they had " made history together " .
What can the two candidates ' body - language tell us about their relationship ?
In pictures
The BBC's North America editor , Justin Webb , says the get - together in Unity is rich in political symbolism .
As well as the name , it is also the town whose Democrats were evenly split - 107 voted for Obama , 107 for Clinton .
Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton greeted each other with a kiss and a handshake when they caught the flight to New Hampshire on Friday .
They also sat next to each other on the plane , the Associated Press reported .
Prior to Thursday 's dinner , the two had not met in person since two days after the last primaries .
Rivals seek unity in Unity Latest opinion polls suggest that while Mr Obama has made headway in winning over Mrs Clinton 's supporters since she withdrew from the nomination race , one in five of them has indicated they will vote for the Republican candidate , John McCain .
Our correspondent adds that Thursday 's fundraising dinner was important for both sides - the Clinton campaign needs an injection of cash to pay off $ 20 m ( £ 10 m ) debts , but Mr Obama needs the financial muscle of the Clinton money raisers .
Mrs Clinton 's advisers have warned Mr Obama that her ability to campaign on his behalf will be limited if she has to spend the summer raising money to pay off her debts .

Speed Racer's Box Office Flop Explained
The final numbers are n’t in yet , but it does n’t matter .
Speed Racer is officially a tremendous flop .
Early estimates indicate that it only made $ 20 million opening weekend , and even that as it turns out , may be generous .
By way of comparison , Iron Man made $ 100 million its opening weekend , and $ 50 million this weekend .
Those are the kinds of numbers you expect from a summer blockbuster people actually want to see .
Over the next days and weeks as Speed Racer quietly slips out of theaters , there ’s going to be a lot of talk as experts point fingers and try to figure out what the hell went wrong .
However to me , the answer seems obvious .
Speed Racer is first and foremost a kids ’ movie .
That should have worked for it .
It ’s been months since we ’ve had an even halfway exciting kids ’ movie , and usually when that happens the next one to show up in theaters makes a mint .
Speed Racer had the jump on all the other summer children ’s films .
It was the first .
It should have been sold out with Mom ’s dragging hordes of pre-teens in to see the Wachowski brothers ’ brightly colored racing movie .
Except whoops .
They forgot to tell parents that this was a kids ’ movie .
Sure the trailers had a lot of bright colors and vroom vroom noises , but it was never entirely clear that this was a movie for kids .
Most of the ads touted that it was the latest from the creators of The Matrix , a series of films known for being R-rated and violent .
Others were attached to corporate sponsorships for boring , adult things like insurance .
Few of the most heavily used advertisements were clearly geared towards youngsters .
Instead , nearly all of the trailers and TV spots seemed to be struggling to strike a confused middle ground , in a weird attempt to appeal to everyone , while all they really accomplished was to appeal to absolutely no one .
Warner Brothers never quite caught on to the fact that adults were not going to be interested in this thing , no matter how they advertised it .
Maybe their researchers spent too much time on fanboy sites like the increasingly out of touch AICN , allowing the niche audience there to convince them that there was this huge fanbase for Speed Racer , when in fact it ’s a crappy cartoon which most people barely remember , and of those that do few think of it all that fondly .
Note to Warner Brothers : Harry Knowles likes a lot of crap .
He does n’t really represent the mainstream , he does n’t even represent the mainstream geek crowd , he represents a tiny subset of people which apparently , are worth about $ 20 million at the box office .
That ’s who you got into the theater this past weekend .
The very small crowd that comprises Speed Racer fans , and a few stragglers who were n’t already totally disillusioned by the way the Wachowskis ' ruined The Matrix .
Speed Racer blew it in marketing .
They needed to sell this thing solely to pre-teens , and they did n’t .
The result was a movie which adults had no interest in and parents were never quite sure was meant for their kids .
Welcome to flop city Speed Racer .
You had it coming .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A few months ago , it seemed liked nothing could stop Iraqi sprinter Dana Hussain from representing her country in the upcoming Summer Olympics .
Iraqi sprinter Dana Hussain was devastated to learn she could not participate in the Beijing Summer Olympics .
Then , the International Olympic Committee banned Iraq from competing because of what it says is the government 's political interference in sports .
Hussain cried for hours after hearing the news , which arrived in the form of a letter to Iraqi officials .
" She has n't stopped .
It 's like finding out that a close relative has died , " said her coach , Yousif Abdul Rahman .
Abdul Rahman attempted to console Hussain by assuring her that she could compete in the 2012 Olympics .
Watch Hussain react to the news »
" In this horrible situation , " she said , " who can say I 'll even be alive in 2012 ? "
CNN received a copy of the letter sent to Jassim Mohammed Jaffer , Iraqi minister of youth and sports , and Ali Mohsen Ismail , acting secretary general of the Iraqi general secretariat of the Council of Ministers .
" We deeply regret this outcome , which severely harms the Iraqi Olympic and Sports Movement and the Iraqi athletes , but which is unfortunately imposed by the circumstances , " said the letter , signed by two IOC officials .
Watch an official explain the decision »
The move stems from an Iraqi government decision in May to suspend the nation 's Olympic Committee and form a temporary committee to handle its duties .
The Iraqi government thought the committee had not been operating properly and as a result undermined the sporting movement there .
The government said the original committee held meetings without quorums and had officials serving in one - year posts for more than five years .
Many of the officials also lived outside Iraq , the government said .
iReport.com :
See a cartoonist 's take on the decision
Emmanuelle Moreau , a spokeswoman for the International Olympic Committee , said it suspended Iraq 's national Olympic Committee in June after the government removed elected officials and put in people the IOC did n't recognize .
She said the IOC proposed to the Iraqi government that officials come to the organization 's headquarters in Lausanne , Switzerland , " to discuss possible solutions . "
But she said they did n't respond .
" We 're extremely disappointed with the situation .
The athletes have been ill - served by the government in Iraq , " she said .
Moreau said Iraq missed a Wednesday deadline for the entry of athletes to compete in archery , judo , rowing and weightlifting .
Watch a historian discuss the Olympics in Iraq under Saddam Hussein »
She said there is a chance that track and field athletes could compete if the original committee is reinstated .
The deadline for the track team to register is at the end of the month .
The Games begin August 8 .
A former official from the disbanded Iraq Olympic Committee said the IOC 's decision was justified because the government interfered with the national committee by suspending it .
The former official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject .
He said he believed that the government suspended the committee out of " jealousy . "
The national committee was making great strides , and the government , namely the Ministry of Youth and Sports , wanted control of it , he said .
The seven Iraqi athletes who were to travel to China for the Games ' start in August are disappointed by the decision , officials said .
They include an archer , a weightlifter , a judoka , two rowers and two sprinters , one of whom is Dana Hussain .
Her coach called the decision unfair and said he blames " everyone " : the Iraqi government and the Iraqi and International Olympic committees .
In the end , Abdul Rahman said , the athletes are paying the price .
" It 's a shame after all the efforts , ambitions , risks and dangers , " he said .
" I wish from the bottom of my heart they would reconsider this unjust decision for the sake of the athletes . "
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .

Actual space technology has been making cars haul ass way faster for years now , including a solar car that broke speed records using parts taken directly from the Hubble Space Telescope .
But that 's nothing compared to what 's on the way , including muscle cars that use heat - resistant pistons .
Click through for details .

Nuna , a Dutch solar car , finished first in the 2001 World Solar Challenge , reaching a record - breaking top speed of 100 KPH and crossing from Darwin to Adelaide in a record - breaking 32 hours and 39 minutes .
The car included dual junction and triple junction gallium - arsenide solar cells , which the European Space Agency had developed for its SMART - 1 mission to the Moon .
The car also had Maximum Power Point Trackers , which balance the power output between the battery and the solar cells , and which the ESA included on its Rosetta space probe .
And the Hubble Space Telescope 's contribution was two solar strips from its large solar array , salvaged by an astronaut in 1993 .
Here 's a video .
Let 's not mock the wacky Dutch accents :
And Nuna 's successor , Nuna II , uses improved ESA solar cells that harvest 20 percent more power .

But it 's not just solar cars that are benefiting from space technology .
The Pescarolo - Judd C 60 prototype racing car uses composite materials developed for space flight to reduce its weight by 38 kg , giving it better heat protection while boosting its speed .
And this is just the beginning of the ways space tech is being used in super - fast cars , or will soon be .

A special kind of carbon fiber known as carbon - carbon , developed for missile nosecones , is already used to create car brakes that can withstand temperatures of up to 3000 F .
But soon , NASA says , it 'll be used to create higher performance pistons and connecting rods that could allow engines to go way faster without overheating .
And when you 're taking sharp turns at 150 mph , you 'll soon be in less danger of rolling over and ending up looking like an accordion .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory 's Variable Dynamics Testing ( VDT ) vehicle will use a computer algorithm to alter several factors in rollovers , including the " understeer coefficient , " load - transfer distribution and frequency and damping of the " vehicle roll mode . "

Not to mention the fact that NASA sponsored a contest to develop a " Personal Air Vehicle , " aka " flying car . "
Meanwhile , the Mars Spirit Rover 's AutoNav system lets it navigate the Martian terrain unaided , and could help to lead to the driverless cars that GM and other carmakers say we 'll have within a decade .

Actual race cars pack a lot of technology from the space program .
For example , NASCAR drivers used to suffer third - degree burns on their feet , when the metal floorboards of their cockpits reached 330 F from the overheating engines ... until 1996 , when NASCAR and the Kennedy Space Center experimented with installing the heat shields from the Space Shuttle in its cars .
Similarly , the cooling flame - retardant suits NASCAR drivers wear come from the Advance Crew Escape Suits ( ACES ) worn by Shuttle crews .
And then there are some uses of NASA technology that improve cars in less turbo- charging ways .
Like this child car seat , which uses NASA 's " systems integration expertise " to creating a better environment for the kiddies , including an entertainment system , video monitoring and a biotelemetry tracking system .
Basically , it 's like putting your kid inside a Teletubbie .
And then there 's this car wax , which claims to use NASA technology to ensure you 'll never have to wax your car again .
It looks like NASA is pretty desperate to find some valuable uses of its technology before its budget gets sliced down to nothing .

Two operatives for a now - defunct Maryland - based private security firm , which spied on environmental groups and other targets for corporate clients , are now in the crosshairs of a Louisiana lawyer representing plaintiffs exposed to dangerous toxins that leaked from a pipeline operated by chemical manufacturer Condea Vista .
As Mother Jones revealed in April , from the mid-1990s to at least 2000 the security firm , Beckett Brown International , gathered intelligence for corporations and the PR firms they employed .
Using methods that ranged from covert surveillance to dumpster diving to infiltrating activist groups , the firm , which was founded by former Secret Service agents , sought to obtain inside information that could be used as ammunition against activist campaigns .
One of BBI ’s clients was Condea Vista , a company whose chemical spill in Lake Charles , Louisiana , is considered among the largest in US history .
BBI ’s activities were brought to light by John Dodd , a Maryland businessman who invested in the company before learning of its covert practices .
Earlier this year , Dodd opened his collection of company documents to Mother Jones .
Those documents , contained in cardboard boxes piled high in a storage facility , trace the course of various investigations against activist groups .
Throughout the files are references to something called the “ Lake Charles Project , ” an effort by Condea Vista — then a subsidiary of the German petrochemical company RWE - DEA and now part of SASOL , the South African mining , chemical , and synfuels giant — to fend off protests and legal actions mounted in response to its pollution of the region .
At the time , Condea was fighting civil suits by workers who had been sickened by leaks from the Lake Charles pipeline , as well as campaigns by local environmental activists .
Condea and the crisis management firm it hired to mute the controversy , Nichols - Dezenhall , collectively paid BBI at least $ 200,000 for its services in Louisiana , according to billing records .
In addition to intelligence reports , client briefings , internal emails , and billing records laying out the Lake Charles Project , Mother Jones has also obtained video copies of depositions of two key players in the operation : Jay Bly and Tim Ward , the BBI operatives who oversaw intelligence gathering efforts on Condea opponents .
The depositions , taken last fall by Lake Charles attorney Perry R. Sanders Jr. , who is representing workers who say they were harmed during the cleanup of the spill ( and who was not the source of the videos ) , will be entered in state court in Louisiana as part of an effort to force Condea Vista to come clean about what exactly it ordered the hired spooks to do .
Attorneys familiar with the litigation said that bringing Ward and Bly into the case — and potentially showing that Condea , through BBI , engaged in unsavory , if not illegal , surveillance practices — could influence a jury to set higher punitive damages .
The bulk of BBI ’s covert operations in the Lake Charles area took place in the middle to late 1990s , during trial preparations for a host of lawsuits brought by workers who had been exposed to high levels of ethylene dichloride ( EDC ) , a solvent used in the polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) industry that is a probable carcinogen and can also cause permanent damage to organs and the central nervous system .
Since the mid-1980s , Condea had routed EDC through a pipeline , owned by the oil company Conoco , that stretched from Conoco ’s docks on the Calcasieu River in Westlake to Condea ’s chemical plant in Lake Charles .
The lawsuits alleged that the chemical company was aware of the high risk of leaks from the deteriorating , 40 - year - old pipeline , yet continued to use it to transport , and at times even store , the dangerous chemical .
While some of the litigation has since been settled , Sanders and his co-counsel continue to litigate cases brought by plaintiffs — 500 of them — who say they were harmed as a result of the spill .
Seeking damages for his clients , Sanders has charged Conoco , its former parent company Dupont , and SASOL with , among other things , “ reckless disregard for the public safety and environment . ”
An initial complaint filed in 2004 accuses Conoco specifically of “ engaging in a corporate policy of destroying documents that would reveal the true extent of the spill and Conoco ’s culpability . ”
Also named in suits filed by Sanders are R.W. Equipment Company and Anco Industries , companies hired to assist in the cleanup of the spill .
( In a statement provided to Mother Jones , SASOL , which bought Condea Vista in 2001 , said it had no comment on the litigation or the events surrounding BBI ’s Lake Charles operation , since it purchased the chemical manufacturer years after the spill occurred .
A lawyer representing Conoco in the Lake Charles litigation did not return a call for comment . )
Located in the historically Cajun bayou country of southwest Louisiana , upriver from the Gulf of Mexico , Lake Charles has been no stranger to chemical contamination .
Like the notorious “ Cancer Alley ” in the eastern part of the state , the area is home to a high concentration of petrochemical manufacturers .
But the spill from the Conoco - Condea pipeline was huge even by Louisiana standards .
High levels of EDC were first discovered in the local estuary in 1993 , and subsequently traced to the pipeline and to Conoco ’s dock facility .
The 1.6 million pounds recovered from the soil in the resulting cleanup effort were only a fraction of the total EDC that had leaked — by various estimates , between 19 million and 47 million pounds .
But the companies downplayed the extent of the spill , and workers were dispatched to clean it up without being warned of the health hazards posed by EDC or being provided with adequate protective gear .
By the late 1990s , some of those workers were suffering health effects ranging from burns to severe respiratory problems .
In the mid-’90s Tom Filo , an attorney with the Lake Charles firm of Cox , Cox , Filo , Camel & Wilson , first brought suit against Condea Vista on behalf of sickened workers .
In 1997 , he won an $ 8 million verdict .
The jury in the case found Condea liable for “ wanton and reckless disregard of public safety . ”
Not only did the spill sicken workers , Filo says , but it contaminated the Chicot Aquifer , which provides drinking water for southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas .
As he litigated the case against Condea , Filo says he suspected that his opponents might be using dirty tactics .
“ The offices were broken into a couple of times while the litigation against Vista was going on , ” Filo told me .
“ In one incident I got a call from the security system .
And I went down to the office at 3 a.m .
There were 6 cops — sheriff ’s deputies — sitting in the conference room .
I said , ‘ What ’s going on ? ’
Well , they were ‘ Just checking the office . ’
The next morning the office manager discovered the front door had been broken through .
A friend checked out the city agencies and found a record of an alarm being set off , then one minute later cancelled . ”
Filo says he later discovered that one of the police officers sitting in his conference room that night had a day job at Condea Vista .
“ Weird shit was going on back then , ” he says .
Years later , Filo ’s suspicions that he and his law firm were being spied on were confirmed .
In 2006 , the Louisiana lawyer received a call from John Dodd , alerting him that he might have been a “ victim ” of BBI .
Filo , who is specifically referred to as a “ target ” in internal BBI documents , later flew up to Maryland to comb through Dodd ’s archive .
Among the documents
Filo found were handwritten copies of his phone records .
He also says he discovered confidential documents related to his litigation against Condea Vista , including a medical report by a doctor who had examined a client , a copy of an autopsy request , and internal memos between attorneys planning strategy in the case .
He dismissed the possibility that these documents were fished out of the trash .
“ Copies of correspondence between lawyers never get put in the trash . ”
If private investigators were eavesdropping on his offices , or had gone so far as to steal documents from his firm , that would explain something that had long puzzled him .
As he prepared his case against Condea Vista , he says , he was startled to find that his opposition “ had info I was going to put in a brief before I wrote the brief . ”
When Filo returned from Maryland , he showed some of Dodd ’s BBI documents to Michael Tritico , a local environmental activist .
Included in the records were photographs of Tritico ’s mother ’s house , which had apparently been staked out in an effort to monitor the activist ’s whereabouts .
“ I always assumed the other side was watching , ” Tritico told me .
The BBI documents show that the security firm had also surveilled the homes of other local activists , followed them , and attempted to trace the funding sources for their campaigns .
One of the main focuses of BBI ’s Lake Charles operation was a group called the Calcasieu League for Environmental Action Now , known as CLEAN , which in the 1990s was working in coordination with Greenpeace to hold local industry accountable for polluting the environment .
In 1998 , BBI set up an operation to gather information on CLEAN , hiring a “ research consultant ” named Mary Lou Sapone , who had experience infiltrating activist groups , to oversee the job .
Sapone , in turn , hired an operative , an area school teacher , to pose as an activist in order to penetrate CLEAN .
( Attempts to locate the operative for comment were unsuccessful .
Sapone did not respond to a request for comment . )
After joining the environmental group , the mole ascended quickly through its ranks , soon taking part in high - level strategy meetings .
All the while he was reporting back to Sapone , telling her what the activists were planning , identifying the scientists who were working with them , and providing information on the internal rivalries within the Lake Charles activist community .
Sapone passed the intelligence on to BBI , which then used it to formulate briefings for its client , Condea Vista .
In one such briefing , dated August 20 , 1998 ( PDF ) , the security firm boasted that its “ operative is being nominated to the citizen action panels for local industries ” and it asked which local industry Condea Vista would prefer the operative to focus on .
Another BBI document ( PDF ) noted , “ The operative has been trained to be inquiring , but not participatory .
Operatives are not allowed to offer suggestions or ‘ help ’ the targets in any way .
They are trained to seek documents , ID friends and foe legislators and regulators , follow money trails , ID informants , discover future targets . ”
Filo recalls that during the period in which the mole was apparently active , CLEAN held frequent nighttime meetings in his law firm ’s offices .
Among BBI ’s targets in Louisiana was a Greenpeace organizer named Beth Zilbert who was then working with CLEAN .
Dodd ’s files contain her phone records and numerous references to surveillance on Zilbert , with notes on her address and the license plates of vehicles that came and went from her house .
Jay Bly , a former Secret Service agent who served as BBI ’s “ manager of special projects , ” traveled to Lake Charles to conduct surveillance on Zilbert ’s home and Filo ’s office , reporting back to Tim Ward , a vice president at the firm and later its president .
In some cases , Bly tailed vehicles as they left Zilbert ’s home .
According to Bly ’s official BBI bio , his responsibilities at the firm ranged from handling “ complex competitive intelligence and due diligence inquires ” to the “ management of misinformation campaigns and opposition research . ”
( After BBI , later known as S2i Security , disbanded in 2001 Ward set up his own security company , Chesapeake Strategies , where Bly now works .
A lawyer representing Ward and Bly did not respond to a request for comment .
Ward has declined requests for comment . )
In a telephone interview , Zilbert , now an attorney in Lake Charles , laughed about the surveillance reports , but talked of frequently feeling threatened during that period .
“ We knew someone was following us , ” she says .
In depositions of Bly and Ward taken by Perry Sanders late last September and obtained by Mother Jones , both men , on the advice of their attorney and lawyers representing Conoco and SASOL , declined to provide details on their Louisiana operation .
They did , however , confirm that they had worked on behalf of Condea Vista in Lake Charles , as well as in Washington , DC .
Asked by Sanders whether all the information they had collected on Condea ’s behalf had been gathered with the company ’s authorization , Ward replied , “ yes . ” Questioned on whether , during the course of BBI ’s work for Condea , the security firm “ had the occasion to gather information from lawyers , ” Ward ’s attorney stopped him from answering , citing a Maryland statute that he said precluded Ward from breaching client confidentiality .
As Sanders pursues his case , he intends to challenge the confidentiality claim in an effort to force Ward and Bly to shed more light on BBI ’s activities .
Greenpeace , a BBI target in Washington as well as in Louisiana , has launched its own investigation and is currently mulling its legal options , which could include filing civil suits against the companies that employed BBI , as well as some of the firm ’s one - time operatives .
The group has sent a task force to comb through John Dodd ’s archive , and is currently trying to figure out the depths to which its operations were penetrated .
“ Our assessment right now is that they used something beyond dumpster diving as a source , ” says one Greenpeace official with knowledge of the investigation .
Among the internal documents that ended up in BBI ’s possession were donor lists and the social security numbers of employees — sensitive records , the Greenpeace official says , that would be unlikely to wind up in the trash .
“ If you were known to have thrown these away , you would have been fired , ” the official says .
He added that around Greenpeace ’s Washington offices , the news that the organization was the target of an elaborate intelligence gathering operation was viewed as a badge of honor .
“ That they were coming at us that hard with these ops means we were effective . ”

Katy teen in trouble with the law 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Katy teen Stephen Gegenheimer had just bought $ 50 worth of roman candles and fireworks Monday afternoon and was headed home to set them off in his front yard when he spotted flashing lights in his rearview mirror .
An arson officer with the Houston Fire Marshal 's Office told the 17 - year - old that he'd violated the law by driving through an annexed area of Houston with fireworks in his trunk .
Gegenheimer was baffled .
Fireworks are illegal in the city of Houston , but legal in Harris County .
He 'd bought his fireworks legally at a stand in unincorporated Harris County and was planning to take them to his house in Katy , a few miles away , where he could legally use them .
But Gegenheimer 's direct route from the Wal - Mart in the 1300 block of Fry Road to his house in the 20600 block of Morning Creek Drive passed through a small stretch of Fry Road that has been annexed by the city of Houston , so the officer ticketed him .
" It 's ridiculous , " said Gegenheimer .
" I feel I have n't done anything wrong , but here I am with a $ 500 to $ 2,000 fine . "
As Americans prepare to celebrate the nation 's independence this weekend , Gegenheimer 's tale highlights the sometimes confusing laws surrounding the sale , use and transport of fireworks in the Houston area .
City officials have issued more than 1,200 fireworks - related criminal citations since 1997 , according to a Municipal Court database of alleged violations obtained by the Houston Chronicle .
" We 're just enraged because we feel it's as close to entrapment as you can get , " said Gegenheimer 's mother , Missy .
" He 's a good kid .
He 's never had a violation or a citation in his life and he was just trying to have fun on the Fourth of July . "
On Tuesday , her son testified in civil district court on behalf of TNT Fireworks , a national wholesale distributor that has filed a lawsuit against Houston , accusing officials of annexing roads for the sole purpose of enforcing fire codes that prohibit the possession of fireworks .
" We want our customers and our delivery trucks to be able to travel unfettered , " said Samantha Trahan , a Houston attorney representing TNT .
" Typically a fire marshal has someone who waits outside the stands and then follows customers .
That 's a detriment to the sale of fireworks and it affects our ability to do business . "
Although Judge Martha Hill Jamison denied Trahan 's request for a temporary restraining order , she admonished the city against issuing tickets to people like Gegenheimer .
" I 'd suggest you get word out to your fire marshals that it 's bad PR to be ticketing people who legally bought fireworks and are legally transporting them , " Jamison said .
She also suggested the city post signs to indicate when a driver is entering an annexed area .
" I think that 's a good idea , " said Assistant City Attorney Bertrand Pourteau .
But that does n't change the fact that TNT 's suit is baseless , Pourteau said .
The city must enforce its laws in annexed areas just as it does in the city limits proper , he said .
Pourteau said he sympathizes with Gegenheimer , but the teenager 's story had no place in Tuesday 's civil court hearing .
" He 'll have his chance to make his case in municipal court , " Pourteau said .
Meanwhile , fireworks stands plan to hand out maps to customers to show them what route to take so they can avoid annexed roads .
At the TNT stand in the Wal - Mart parking lot where Gegenheimer bought his fireworks , supervisor Frank Kammerlohr said workers were " blindsided " by reports that officials were ticketing their customers .
The stand is run by volunteers with Katy 's Family Life Assembly of God , which is using proceeds to fund a youth group trip to a national fine arts competition and youth convention in North Carolina .
" We obviously did n't have any idea that the HPD or the fire marshal was watching our stand with binoculars or whatever , " Kammerlohr said .
" I realize the city of Houston can do what it wants , but it seems kind of peculiar that they can hopscotch down Fry Road and annex this block and not that block . "

Conclusions
I frequently say that I 'm a big fan of constructive criticism of Twisted , but I rarely get it .
People either gush about how incredibly awesomely spectacularly awesome Twisted is , or they directionlessly rant about how much it sucks , but aside from a fairly small group of regulars who file issues on the Twisted tracker , I do n't hear much in between .
I caught wind of ( and responded to ) some blog comments of the latter type ( directionless ranting ) from Lakin Wecker .
After I responded , in an unusual response for someone writing such comments , he apologized and promised to do much better .
He has responded with some much more specific and potentially constructive criticism , ominously entitled " twisted part 1 " Lakin , thanks for reformulating your complaints in a more productive way .
I do think that some useful things might happen as a result of this article .
While I do n't necessarily agree with it , I do care about this type of criticism .
In order to demonstrate my appreciation , I will try to make this a thorough reply .
It sounds like there are several mostly separate issues that you had here .
I 'll address them one at a time .
I believe that the main issue is that the twisted .
mail API is missing some convenience functionality which will allow users to quickly build SMTP responders that deal with whole messages .
This is definitely a shortcoming of twisted .
mail .
However , this shortcoming is not entirely unintentional .
In general , Twisted 's interfaces encourage you to write code which scales to arbitrary volumes of input .
IMessage is a thing that can receive a message , rather than a fully parsed in - memory message , because we want to encourage users to write servers that do n't fall over .
If you have to handle each line as it arrives , it 's less likely that you 'll die if you a message bigger than the memory of the machine that is running the server .
That 's not to say that there should n't be some additional , higher - level interface which does what you want .
Quotient , for example , uses twisted .
mail , but provides a representation of a message which has all of its data written to disk first , and efficient APIs for accessing things like headers without fetching the whole message back into memory .
twisted .
mailprovides something like this itself ; if you poke around in twisted .
mail .
maildir and twisted .mail.mail , you 'll find FileMessage ( an implementation of a message which writes its contents to disk ) and MaildirDirdbmDomain ( an implementation of IDomain which uses a directory of maildirs to deliver messages ) .
Not that these would not have been useful for your use case : they just show that we 're happy to have higher - level stuff implemented within Twisted .
One function which might be cool to provide is something which will parse an incoming SMTP message and convert it to an email .
Message .
Message , then hand it off to some user code .
Even better would be to integrate this with the command - line " twistd mail " tool , such that you could easily deploy such a class as an LMTP server or something like that .
Although we do n't have all the pieces you need , there is also the ever - present issue of documentation of the pieces which we do have .
Some of the code in twisted .
mail might have been useful to you if its documentation had been better .
For example , you might also notice some pretty strong similarities between twisted.mail.protocols.DomainDeliveryBase.receivedHeader and your own implementation of that method .
My main point here is that fixing this is a simple matter of programming ( or , in the latter case , of documenting ) .
I think that the best way to deal with that shortcoming is simply to submit patches to twisted .
mail which add the functionality that you want .
Lots of open source projects are like this : they were driven just far enough to satisfy their implementors ' use - cases .
twisted .
mail is a perfectly functional and simple API if you want to build what it is designed to build .
When we 're talking about " Twisted " , we 're typically talking about the core , and the programming model that comes with it .
When you get into the specifics of an API like twisted .
mail , twisted .names , and even twisted .
web ( maybe even especially twisted . web ) you 're going to find plenty of shortcomings and areas that it do n't yet do what you need .
There are some areas which are downright bad , and some which are so bad that they 're embarrassing .
We need volunteers to identify the areas that are lacking and add to them .
The reason that I disagree with your conclusion that Twistedis necessarily more complex , hard to explain , too dense , unreadable ( etc , etc ) is that the main thing to compare it to is shared - state multithreaded socket servers , or asyncore .
Here 's a good example of what makes Twisted simple , at its core :
This server supports a large number of clients .
It supports TLS .
It 's cross-platform .
It supports both inbound and outbound connections .
And yet , including the import , it 's only 4 lines of code .
You can write a threaded version of this which appears to be just as short , but it 's pretty much impossible to do without getting a half - dozen subtleties of either a socket API or a concurrency issue wrong .
For example , your example " smtp_helper.py " .
You do n't provide any documentation of its concurrency properties , but the implementation of ' start ' is almost certainly wrong .
For one thing , starting the same TestSMTPServer twice , or even starting two completely different TestSMTPServers at the same time , will not work .
Of course , you 'd never do that , but let 's say your SMTP client also used asyncore and a thread .
Now you 've got a client using socket_map in the main thread and a server using socket_map in another thread .
Also , there 's the fact that process_message may be called from an arbitrary thread ; if it ever grew to do anything more complex than appending to a list , it would need its own serialization logic .
This is n't something that could be fixed — the entire approach is wrong , and you would need to rewrite all of your tests to work completely differently in order to fix it .
You 'd need to asynchronously start both your client and your server , then have an API for letting your tests know when both of them are done .
By the time you 're doing that , you 're practically implementing your own mini-Twisted , along with extensions to unittest that turn it into Trial .
Ironically , you can use Twisted to fix this problem .
If you really like the API presented by the ' smtpd ' module , you could write a wrapper which would make an asyncore dispatcher look like a Twisted protocol factory ( or protocol ) , and hook asyncore into the main loop , then use ' trial ' for your testing .
How exactly one would implement such a thing is beyond the scope of this post , but it 's not actually that hard ; just look at the relatively few methods that asyncore .
dispatcher calls on self .
socket and you 'll probably get the idea .
I feel that the comparison of " Twisted " versus " non-Twisted " code you 've presented is a bit unfair .
The Twisted example is a demonstration of utility functionality that Twisted Mail is missing , not a core idea that Twisted implements wrong .
The code it is being compared to looks simple only because critical areas of correctness that would need to be addressed in a real system ( and will probably eventually need to be addressed , if the test is maintained for a long time ) are being completely ignored .
The twisted example , if it fails , will fail relatively straightforwardly ; the other example 's failure mode will be an obscure traceback coming out of otherwise unrelated ( but not thread - safe ) code .
However , your subjective experience of some areas of Twisted being hard to understand and use is entirely valid .
Your detailed description of why it was difficult for you has already been useful , but I hope you will stick around and help us improve the situation for future users as well .
Perhaps the more significant issue that you discovered while you were working on this is the subtle mystery of getting Twisted to fully shut down a connection and a bound port inside a test .
This is really way too hard , and it is a problem which affects anyone who wants to use Trial for integration testing .
Although I 'd really like to see this problem dealt with in a systematic way , and I 'd like it to be easy as pie to write integration tests with trial , there is a reason that the issue has n't been fixed .
As the Twisted team has been improving our testing skills , we 've been finding more and more that you absolutely need good unit tests before you can really write integration tests .
Without unit tests , you do n't know whether the individual pieces work , so they tend to break in surprising ways when you put them together .
In Twisted itself we are still in the process of rehabilitating a very large , and very old hodgepodge of unit , functional , and integration tests to be broken down into smaller , more coherent unit tests .
Until that process is finished , and trial has been tuned to be as good as possible forsort of testing , integration testing is n't going to be a focus of any core developer .
I agree with the advice that you were given on IRC .
We could eliminate the particular surprise of doing a clean connection shut - down in trial , and provide a good way to do it , but you 'd still face issues with your tests where the SMTP API might be scheduling timed calls or doing other things behind your back which would be difficult to monitor or shut down .
Talking to a mock message - sending implementation for starters would be a lot easier .
I can understand your concern about passing more parameters .
Luckily , this is Python : you do n't necessarily need to change the interface of the system you 're testing .
If you have a system , A , that depends on another system , B , to perform some of its work , you need to have a reference from A to B somewhere .
That can be passed as a parameter , imported as an object , or loaded as a module .
In Java , you 'd need to change all your type declarations and do some kind of dependency injection magic , but in Python you can always cheat .
The worst case in Python , after all , is that A imports B as a module .
So , if you do n't want to add any parameters , or even any attributes or methods , consider this :
Some might consider this a bit gross , of course .
It might be cleaner to add a specific API for plugging in a different implementation of B .
However , it 's useful to use this technique in cases — such as the one you described in your post — where you are trying to add some test coverage for an API which has already been written and you do n't have control over .
I hope that digression helped , but I do n't want to turn this into a screed about what you could have done better ; let 's consider your requirements as fixed ( this needs to be an integration test ) and look at what Twisted could have done better .
One thing the core team has been talking a lot about lately has been the development of verified test doubles .
We do n't have a lot of them , and we need more .
For example , if you could pass a faketo both your SMTP sender and receiver code , then you could manually make sure it was sending traffic at the appropriate times , to the appropriate hosts , and fail your test in sensible ways if it did something unexpected , rather than just having trial bomb out on you .
This would also let you have regression tests to make sure that your code was working with the latest version of Twisted , in case the APIs in question changed .
You would n't need your test to have a full , complete , clean shutdown of your SMTP connections because they would simply be garbage collected , as they would not be connected to the real reactor .
You can see an example of what this might look like in twisted.internet.task .
Clock .
If someone contributed a real , documented , usable , verified test double for IReactorTCP , we would all be eternally grateful , especially if they could coalesce all the uses of the numerous attempts at it in our own test suite .
Something else we could do is write a supported factory wrapper which would allow the use of a real factory and connection in a trial test , but that would shut everything down cleanly at the connection level in tearDown .
I would personally like this a lot , but I can't promise that it would be popular with the rest of the Twisted team .
We all spend a lot of time trying to convince people to write unit tests before integration tests .
I know that I 'm a little concerned that providing great integration testing support will just lead to more people being confused by weird interactions in the guts of whatever protocol they 're talking to .
Eventually , however , integration tests can be useful , and I wrote the beginnings of the wrapper that I 'm suggesting when I was writing tests for the AMP protocol .
You might be able to use that as an example even if Twisted does n't provide any public APIs for that sort of thing .
Unfortunately there 's not much I can do immediately to fix the problems that you 've had , Lakin .
If someone with a similar level of Twisted experience attempts a similar task in the near future , it 's likely that they 'll hit the same issues .
I barely ( read : did n't actually ) have the time to write this blog post , and I definitely do n't have the time to fix the problems I 've outlined .
While there are definitely some problems here , I do n't think the situation is really all that bad .
According to your post , learning enough about Twisted to do what you were doingwriting the Twisted version of this code took only 3 days .
This learning curve is not as steep as some have accused Twisted of having .
Presumably it would have taken someone already familiar with twisted .
mail and trial much less time .
It did n't take me much more than 2 minutes to read and understand it :-) .
As I mentioned above , your friend 's threaded smtpd implementation has some pretty severe problems which might cause maintenance headaches later , whereas you were quite careful to do a proper shutdown ( the trickiest thing to get right ) in the Twisted version , so it is likely to be fairly robust going forward .
Yeah , those 5 - 4 decisions are a real bitch , President Gore .
From the Washington Post :
In the days following the Sept. 11 attacks , President Bush and his advisers sought to create an unprecedented parallel system to detain suspected terrorists far from the normal scrutiny of the U.S. judiciary .
The naval base at Guantanamo Bay offered a way to indefinitely hold those individuals the administration considered among the most dangerous in the world .
But the Supreme Court ’s decision yesterday to grant habeas corpus rights to the detainees struck at the very core of the administration ’s approach , as a narrow majority ruled that even hardened suspects are due the basic right to challenge their custody in federal court .
The ruling throws into disarray the administration ’s detention strategy , almost certainly leaving to Bush ’s successor and the next Congress the dilemma of what to do with the Guantanamo Bay detainees .

Newspaper Criticized For Publishing Photo
By Helen Thomas , Hearst White House columnist
“ Hearst Newspapers ” — — WASHINGTON — Some readers resented The Washington Post for publishing an Associated Press photograph of a critically wounded Iraqi child being lifted from the rubble of his home in Baghdad ’s Sadr City “ after a U.S. airstrike . ”
Two - year - old Ali Hussein later died in a hospital .
As the saying goes , the picture was worth a thousand words because it showed the true horrors of this war .
Click here to find out more !
Neither side is immune from the killing of Iraqi civilians .
But Americans should be aware of their own responsibility for inflicting death and pain on the innocent .
The Post ’s ombudsman , Deborah Howell , said about 20 readers complained about the photo , while a few readers praised the Post for publishing the stark picture on page one .
Some mothers said they were offended that their children might see the picture , though one wonders whether their youngsters watch television and play with violent videos in a pretend world .
From the start of the unprovoked U.S. “ shock and awe ”  invasion of Iraq on March 20 , 2003 , the government tried to bar the news media from photographing flag - draped coffins of American soldiers returning from Iraq .
A Freedom of Information lawsuit forced the government to release pictures of returning coffins .
Howell said some readers felt the photo of the Iraqi boy was “ an anti-war statement ; some thought it was in poor taste . ” 
Well , so is war .
Howell said her boss , Executive Editor Len Downie , “ is cautious about such photos . ” 

For the person behind the moniker “ Viking Knight , ” the Internet is a virtual playground for hate .
“ Mexican ’ts are a b…stard race and will come to nothing in the end .
WHITE POWER FOREVER , ” Viking Knight wrote in response to the fatal shooting of a 17 - year - old boy .
“ Somebody saved the LAPD the trouble of icing this ‘ vato . ’ …
He is one less Mexie on the planet , not that it counts for much . ”
On the beating of an Orthodox Jew by skinheads in North Hollywood : “ We should offer a reward to the guy who off ’d this Christ - killer .
… Jew$ are a disease . ”
On the death of an Armenian girl who was denied a liver transplant by her health insurance company : “ God got rid of one the Turks missed .
Too bad
He does n’t get rid of all of them . ”
A person might expect to find these and other vile comments by Viking Knight — including slurs against gays and Asians — posted on a white supremacist or neo -Nazi Web site .
But the banner on the top of the page belongs to the Daily News of Los Angeles , and in other cases to its MediaNews Group sister paper , the Pasadena Star - News .
Like dozens of other people who post comments through these and other newspaper Web sites , Viking Knight can remain as anonymous as he or she wishes to be .
And due to the anonymity and instant access to an audience that poorly monitored newspaper and social networking sites provide , Internet hate speech is a growing national phenomenon .
“ It ’s democracy gone wild , ” said Deborah Lauter , director of the national civil rights division of the Anti-Defamation League .
She ’s hoping the Daily News and the Star - News will remove racist diatribes from the Web and be more vigilant about hate speech in the future .
“ Unfortunately , we believe now that many more papers are offering this kind of [ comment ] service we are going to see an increase in that kind of hate rhetoric .
While it is protected speech , we believe it is incumbent on a newspaper or a social networking site to step up and be a responsible corporation , and be more active in moderating [ its Web site ] and taking down what is clearly hate speech , ” said Lauter .
“ Once they decide to create that forum , then they have to act responsibly and monitor it . ”
The Daily News and Star - News Web sites allow any reader to post his or her views through a service called Topix , which allows discussion forums to be built around news articles and other subjects .
“ It is impossible for any paper our size to read all the comments every day , so this is an issue often discussed [ among the 57 MediaNews Group daily newspapers , many of which use Topix ] , ” said Ryan Garfat , online editor of the Daily News .
Garfat said the paper typically relies on Web users to flag hate speech and other abusive posts through Topix , which forwards those complaints to editors .
He said Tuesday that he plans to remove hate speech identified by this newspaper , but is already dealing with dozens of reader complaints about other posts — some of which are n’t hate speech at all .
Garfat also said that there were no plans to change how the Web site is monitored .
“ The unfortunate effects of having an open forum are that these things are going to happen , and we feel they reflect poorly on the identity of the newspaper .
But if we take the alternate route of eliminating comments , then I think we are not fulfilling our goal of allowing legitimate discussion within our community and would be disserving our community by doing that . ”
The Star - News has had far fewer problems with online hate speech than the Daily News — the source of the three comments quoted above — and removed posts that contained hate speech following conversations with the Pasadena Weekly .
“ Our policy for the comments is that we do not moderate or edit the comments before they ’re posted online .
However , we will remove comments that are deemed to be offensive or inappropriate , ” said San Gabriel Valley Newspaper Group Senior Editor Frank Pine , who supervises the Star - News , Whittier Daily News and San Gabriel Valley Tribune .
Pine said he was not aware of Viking Knight ’s hateful posts until hearing from this newspaper , and that the only complaints about comments made over the Internet had been from sources in news stories who felt they were being characterized unfairly .
Although Topix terms of service prohibit content that is “ hateful , or racially , ethnically or otherwise objectionable , ” it also warns that users “ may be exposed to content that is offensive , indecent or objectionable . ”
Topix is a Palo Alto - based limited liability corporation owned largely by publishing giants the Gannett Co. , The McClatchy Co. and the Tribune Co. , according to its Web site .
The Web site for the Los Angeles Times does not use Topix , and reader comments appear to be monitored to exclude hate speech .
At the Star - News site , Viking Knight makes it clear in one anti-affirmative action rant that he ’s no fan of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama , and in a separate post appears to advocate that Obama be assassinated .
“ Robert Kennedy sold our courageous men in uniform out when he became a peacenik .
He sold White people out when he started kissing up to the likes of Chavez , Dr. King , the mestizo farmworkers , etc. Sirhan may not be a prize , but he was just what America needed , just when we needed him , ” wrote Viking Knight in response to a column by Star - News Public Editor Larry Wilson about Kennedy ’s Pasadena - bred assassin .
“ As we approach the November elections , we could use a man like Sirhan again . ”
“ That post is clearly over the line , ” Pine said Monday .
On Tuesday it had been removed from the site , along with other posts disparaging Latino youth .
“ As shocking as these kinds of things are , they are increasingly common on perfectly mainstream Web sites .
Usually the paper will step in and scrub their sites of this kind of material , because if they did n’t they would become absolute nesting grounds for white supremacists .
These guys are looking for a place to safely transmit their ideology and bring more people into the movement , ” said Mark Potok , editor of Intelligence Report , a magazine that monitors hate groups and is produced by the Southern Poverty Law Center .
Potok said that he ’s been forced to keep a close eye on his magazine ’s blog ( www.splcenter.org/blog) to prevent hateful comments from being posted .
People have even tried to post racially motivated threats to assassinate Obama , which he has reported to the Department of Homeland Security .
In the United States , constitutional free speech protections typically prevent legal action on hate speech unless someone is threatening or urging others to physically harm a person or racial group , said Potok , who recently testified before the Helsinki Commission ( also known as the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe ) about threats posed by Internet hate speech .
Potok was testifying not only as an expert , but also as a victim :
A neo - Nazi group once identified him on a Web site as an enemy of their cause and posted his home address .
But because the group did not specifically order its readers to do Potok harm , they did n’t break the law .
In Europe and most other Western nations , hate speech — in Germany , denying or trivializing the Holocaust — can be prosecuted as a crime .
As a result , said Potok , the majority of foreign - language white supremacist Web sites are hosted through computer servers in the United States .
Viking Knight also took aim through the Star - News at the social services organization El Centro de Acción Social , which he or she wrote on May 31 “ is nothing but a Reconquista terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of America . ”
The next day , in response to another reader ’s concern about the achievement levels of some students receiving scholarships from the organization , Viking Knight wrote : “ They ’re Mexican ’ts , What did you expect ?
Their grades suck because in most high schools , you ca n’t major in Lowriding 101 . ”
El Centro Executive Director Randy Jurado Ertll said he thinks the Star - News should prevent racist comments like these — which were pulled from the site after Pine spoke with the Weekly — from reaching readers .
“ Responsibility comes with freedom of expression , ” said Ertll .
“ I was just disgusted by this .
We need to be vigilant of people who use hate language .
Just as we denounce hate crimes , we have to denounce hate language .
Words impact people ’s actions and influence others to promote more hate . ”
But it does n’t end there .
One conversation chain from the Daily News involving Viking Knight and others was so rife with prejudice against a Latino teen shot to death at a party — “ like all the rest of the scum too hell he went too face satan , ” wrote catwomome n4u69 — that someone claiming to be the victim ’s ex-girlfriend was actually pleading with people to stop .
“ Certainly we could do a better job of moderating comments , ” said Garfat , who acknowledged that recent staffing cuts have affected the paper ’s ability to monitor the Web site .
“ But , I still maintain the need to allow people to have conversations supersedes the vile comments that sometimes permeate our boards .
We work with what we ’ve got . ”
In another conversation that devolved into slurs against “ Mexicans and blacks , ” someone wrote : “ It ’s time for a good old fashion clan meeting … come on my arean [ sic ] brothers … lets get out our rebel flags and let the lynching begin . ”
Such vitriol targeting Latinos in general or people perceived to be illegal aliens is , sadly , “ very much par for the course , ” in terms of hate speech to be found on mainstream Web sites , said Potok .
“ We ’re in a whole new age , ” said the ADL ’s Lauter .
“ The anonymity of the Internet provides a forum so the people who would n’t have the proclivity to say it in public can hide behind screens .
We used to say the Klan hid behind their white hoods ; these [ people ] hide behind their screens . ”
And in many ways , newspapers are behind the times in figuring out how to respond .
“ There ’s a larger issue in this story , ” said Pine , “ that is , to what degree should newspaper Web sites allow people to comment anonymously .
It ’s something that warrants further scrutiny .
Certainly it ’s a conversation we ’ve been having in the newsroom and will continue to have . ”
Pine and Garfat said they are reluctant to restrict comments until they are screened or increase registration requirements , as that would hinder access to the service .
“ We want to facilitate the free exchange of ideas and have people feeling comfortable speaking their minds , but on the other hand you do n’t want people to hide behind anonymity and use it to promote hatred and say things that have no place in civilized public discourse , ” he said .
That such vicious comments sat for more than a week on the Web sites of local daily newspapers angers Nat Nehdar , a friend of the Pasadena Human Relations Commission and its former chair , who dedicates much of his time to activities combating prejudice , hate and violence .
“ I feel strongly that newspapers should more carefully monitor their Web sites and eliminate such trash , which in some ways can reflect on the newspaper itself .
If you allow it you are not condemning it , so it seems like you are condoning this type of hate speech , ” he said .
World Bank Leak Biofuels May Be Even Worse than First Thought
An internal report put together by the World Bank and leaked to the Guardian claims that biofuels may be responsible for up to 75 percent of recent rises in food prices .
Even environmental groups have n't gone that far in their estimates .

Ron Paul explains why he is opposed to the “ compromise ” FISA wiretap bill ( June 20 ) :
Mr. Speaker , I regret that due to the unexpected last - minute appearance of this measure on the legislative calendar this week , a prior commitment has prevented me from voting on the FISA amendments .
I have strongly opposed every previous FISA overhaul attempt and I certainly would have voted against this one as well .
The main reason I oppose this latest version is that it still clearly violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution by allowing the federal government to engage in the bulk collection of American citizensâ€™ communications without a search warrant .
That US citizens can have their private communication intercepted by the government without a search warrant is anti-American , deeply disturbing , and completely unacceptable .
In addition to gutting the fourth amendment , this measure will deprive Americans who have had their rights violated by telecommunication companies involved in the Administrationâ€™s illegal wiretapping program the right to seek redress in the courts for the wrongs committed against them .
Worse , this measure provides for retroactive immunity , whereby individuals or organizations that broke the law as it existed are granted immunity for prior illegal actions once the law has been changed .
Ex post facto laws have long been considered anathema in free societies under rule of law .
Our Founding Fathers recognized this , including in Article I section 9 of the Constitution that â€ œNo bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed .â€ 
How is this FISA bill not a variation of ex post facto ?
That alone should give pause to supporters of this measure .
Mr. Speaker , we should understand that decimating the protections that our Constitution provides us against the government is far more dangerous to the future of this country than whatever external threats may exist .
We can protect this country without violating the Constitution and I urge my colleagues to reconsider their support for this measure .
I was in an accident when I was 4 wks ( 2005 ) , I became disfigured .
I have a Furry Will to survive & I am completely healed .
I require medication during the day to keep my eyes moist .
I will always look different but I am in NO PAIN !
I have seen 10 vets and they can attest to that !
Im a happy kitty and hope to help other humans feel just as great about themselves and realize that not everyone looks perfect and that is OK .

The first laptops to make use of the SpursEngine , a multimedia co-processor derived from the Cell chip that powers the PlayStation 3 , will go on sale in Japan in July .
Toshiba will launch its Qosmio G50 and F40 machines with the chip , which contains four of the “ Synergistic Processing Elements ” from the Cell Broadband Engine processor .
The Cell chip used in the PlayStation 3 has eight of the SPE cores plus a Power PC main processor .
The SPE cores perform the heavy number - crunching that makes the console ’s graphics so stunning .
The SpursEngine SE1000 will work in much the same way in the laptops .
The operating system will run on an Intel Core 2 Duo chip and the SpursEngine will be called on to handle processor - intensive tasks , such as processing of high - definition video .
This arrangement means the laptop should be capable of some tricks that have n’t been seen on machines until now .
Internal Ballistics Software
for the Handloader
While away from reloading proper for the last few years , I 've taken time to try to learn more about internal ballistics .
This has included playing with software which claims to help you find suitable loads for any cartridge .
The prices vary from free to about $ 150 , and as with many things in life , I found you get what you pay for .
My observations on these software are presented here .
The software I 've tried includes the Powley Computer , QuickLOAD , Load From A Disk , CalcuLoader , LoadTech , and CABM and NABM .
As a figure of merit , all software was compared to velocities reported in modern load books .
Only load books which offered pressure measurements were considered .
The Powley Computer
In about 1960 , Homer Powley helped introduce a slide rule which allowed the handloader to predict charges and velocities .
Over the years , he improved his equations , and offered more complicated formulas .
One set of these formulas was published by William Davis in the NRA 's 1981 book on handloading , and these equations in turn have been made into software for PC users .
One free implementation is found on this site ; it runs in standard browsers , requires no download , and includes a separate page of notes covering its limitations .
John Knight in England also offers a free Win32 executable , called WinLoad , which I found works as expected ( and there 's also a handy calculator for bullet stability as well ) .
There are also versions for Excel and BASIC .
The published Powley equations are intended for the higher pressure rifle cartridges .
It attempts to predict conservative charges of IMR powder for strong , modern rifles .
It does not attempt to predict charges for low pressure cartridges , nor for reduced loads .
It tries to select the powder which for a nearly full case will produce a pressure of about 45,000 CUP , which is about 8000 CUP below what most modern rifles are rated .
This slightly reduced pressure provides some margin for error and should also result in excellent barrel life .
In predicting charges , the equations can pick a powder too fast , possibly resulting in pressures too high for comfort .
The equations in the older slide rules were even more prone to do so .
For a strong modern rifle with good gas handling , you probably wo n't get hurt using the Powley Computer , but you must learn its limitations by comparing its predictions to the pressure tested loads from loadbooks .
One can learn about the trends in internal ballstics using a Powley Computer .
The effects on velocity of barrel length and case capacity are well predicted .
The effects of pressure on velocity are not so well predicted .
To do so , you must use the Pressure Computer " in reverse , " so to speak .
The Pressure Computer attempts to correlate chronographed velocity to peak pressure , but only with limited success .
The pressure estimates are generally decent , but there are classes of cartridges for which it misses badly .
For the price ( free ) , it 's still a useful tool .
Load From A Disk
For home computers , this was one of the first commerical products in this field ( perhaps the very first ) , and W. Square Enterprises is still going after about 10 years , a good record .
The software is derived from Powley 's work , with proprietary extensions .
Like Powley , it is meant to predict charges for rifle cartridges nearly filled with powder .
It does not try to predict the performance of greatly reduced rifle loads or of handgun loads .
Unlike the original Powley Computer , it will predict performance with powders other than those from IMR , and it will predict charges and velocity at most pressures .
The software also includes dimensions " for 1100 cartridges " and hundreds of commercial bullets .
As compared to load book values , the predictions were generally conservative .
I do n't recall being given a load that a load book showed would be dangerous .
A few hot loads , yes , but the variation was not much greater than can be found among different loadbooks .
I last used this software in about 2001 .
That version ( 3.0.3A ) could be a bit frustrating to use , with inputs clumsily spread over several somewhat confusing screens , and I ended up throwing my copy away .
Many new releases have been made since then , and I have little doubt the software is greatly improved .
I can recommend it as an inexpensive alternative to QuickLOAD for those who seek only an estimate of charge and velocity .
QuickLOAD
By far , this is the best software currently available to the handloader .
While it's also the most expensive , I think the price not unreasonable , and I recommend it without reservation .
It is written in Germany and is offered in the US by NECO .
( Also offered is a separate design tool for cartridge cases , QuickDESIGN , which I have not tried . )
QuickLOAD is a simulator , not some fairly simple equation fitted to lab data .
It tries to combine a mathematical description of the burning characteristics of each powder with a decent representation of the heat losses to the barrel , etc. , and in this way mathematically predict the gas pressure and the velocity of the bullet at every fraction of a millimeter down the barrel .
The software comes with a printed manual which includes a fine introduction to the field of internal ballistics .
Included are descriptions of the mathematical representations used for the physical processes which happen inside a gun .
To the very great credit of it's authors , the manual spells out all the shortcomings of the program and how these affect its ability to estimate cartridge performance .
Unlike Powley 's equations and Load From A Disk , QuickLOAD will predict charges for pistol powders , and it does n't do too bad a job .
The results are not , however , as good as with rifle cartridges .
QL 's strong point is correlating rated pressure to velocity .
Used as directed , it seems to be able to always get you within 50 fps of what is possible in pressure barrel tests .
For pistols , I 've seen over 100 fps errors , but it 's often better than that .
QL 's charge estimations seem to always be low , but that is in the safe direction .
( I should note it 's charge predictions are really no worse than the other software I 've tested . )
Related to this is what appears to be a fudge factor on pressure .
The manual recommends pressures always be set to 1/8 below that of the cartridge 's rating .
For instance , if the cartridge is rated at 64 ksi , you should run the calculations at 56 ksi .
Done so , the fps predicted is generally quite close to factory ratings .
A likely explanation is that cartridges make full pressure ( and velocity ) only in a tight , factory test barrel .
However , some load book data includes pressures and velocities from the pressure barrels , and QL predicts these pressures and velocities go together .
An alternate explanation for the 1/8 factor has to do with pressure variations in real loads .
Due to normal shot to shot variations , pressures swing surprisingly , and the velocity follows these swings .
Cartridge ratings allow some random overpressure , but I suspect the load books are showing velocities at pressures low enough the swings remain within the limits .
I really should write the author of QuickLOAD about this , for he has always answered questions promptly .
QL is unique in giving the handloader an insight into internal ballistics .
Being a simulator , it will give you plots of pressure , velocity , etc. as the bullet moves down the barrel .
You can see the effects on pressure rise rates when changing powders .
You can fiddle with powder characteristics to see how this affects powder speed .
The bullet engraving input is simplistic , but you will see changes in the pressure curves due to it .
The program allows for rather extreme inputs .
I tried simulating a " bomb calorimeter " test by " firing " a low load density charge under a 200 lb 30 caliber bullet .
The bullet , of course , does n't move much , so you can see the pressure rise rates for a closed chamber , and powder burn rates are sometimes measured in this way .
By measuring the slope of the pressure cure , I could get numbers not too far from those reported for IMR powders by Davis in the NRA manual .
QL is not a substitute for pressure tested load book data .
In the 06/2004 issue of Handloader , John Barsness reports finding QL predictions of pressure for a given charge can be off 10 ksi , when fired in a piezo set up .
I find QL does do a superb job of estimating cartridge potential , and it does do a very good job of selecting which class ( or " speed " ) of powders to use to obtain that potential .
However , it is not accurate enough to distinguish between two similar powders from different makers , and of course it can't know about all the possible lot variations .
It also is clueless about primer effects , which in extreme circumstances can double pressures .
QuickLOAD comes with QuickTARGET , a fine external ballistics program to predict the trajectory of the bullet in flight .
I find QuickTARGET flexible and easy to use .
QL also will plot a rifle 's free recoil , which includes an estimate of the force on scope mounts .
I highly recommend this software .
( Please keep in mind the limitations all such software must observe ; see below . )
LoadTech
This was AEM Enterprise 's successor to their CalcuLoader , which was a relatively inexpensive program I purchased in about 2002 .
As a testament to their customer support , I received the newly released LoadTech unsolicited , and for no charge , about one year later ; my version ( 1.0 ) was dated 10/19/03 .
CalcuLoader was clearly not a basic Powley derivative , and I do n't know how it worked internally .
My old notes indicate the rate of change of velocity with charge was quite different than Powley suggested , and the rate of change of pressure with charge was higher and variable , as it is in lab data .
It was simple to use but tended to crash .
It 's charge and velocity estimates were n't too bad .
In addition to being very inexpensive , it took little disk space .
In its list of case capacities , the values seemed to be always higher than from other sources .
LoadTech superseded it and " is an entirely new product . "
It was a bit of a disk hog , taking over 110 MB .
While they claimed it " renders CalcuLoader obsolete , " its velocity predictions were beyond optimistic , at times corresponding to proof load speeds when tasked with predicting loads for low and medium pressure cartridges .
In late 2003 , Ed Reynolds of AEM posted comments on the internals of LoadTech on a shooter 's forum .
... we have generated a powder model based on the information available from the powder manufacturers , bullet makers , etc .
From that we have developed formulas that are " best fit " for a specific powder over the entire range of available data ...
If the charge or velocity reliability is 98 % , then our formulas have come within 98 % of the published values provided by ALL of the published data that we have available .
If true , then they have made a statistical fit of published load book data to some simplified model of internal ballistics .
I 've done some work along those lines myself and have had generally good results .
I do n't know what went wrong with that first release of LoadTech , but in 2007 I received word from a recent purchaser of AEM 's software that showed the problems I noticed had been fixed .
In 2013 , I finally decided to update my copy , but sadly , found AEM out of business .
I was able to contact Mr. Reynolds , and he kindly gave me a free upgrade to the last copy of their AccuLoad program , of which LoadTech is only one of many useful modules .
In limited testing , I find it to produce conservative velocity estimates and reasonable charge predictions for medium pressure cartridges measured in CUP .
It was also conservative for high pressure cartridges measured in psi .
However , for a larger , high pressure cartridge measured in CUP , it produced charge and fps predictions a bit high , but not dangerously so , especially were one watching fps with a chronograph .
On the whole AccuLoad was a good effort , and I hope Mr. Reynolds will make his work available again .
Fabrique Scientific
On Steve Faber 's site , Fabrique Scientific , he offers shareware versions of two different internal ballistics simulators .
One he calls CABM , which is based on an analytic solution attributed to a fellow named Coppock , as found in Corner 's standard reference text Theory of the Internal Ballistics of Guns .
It is an older , DOS program , and it ran with some hiccups on my PC under WinXP .
I recall its predictions were in the ball park .
He also wrote NABM , which appears to have been the most sophisticated simulator offered to the handloader .
My PC running XP had trouble rendering the beta release offered for Windows .
In an earlier version of his web site , he had some comments on the internals to NABM , but I 've lost part of my notes on this and so must recall some details from memory .
NABM is a proper simulator , like QuickLOAD , but its representation of internal ballistics is far more detailed .
The powder burning is simulated as individual grains of powder , and to a limited extent you can even design your own grain shapes .
There are fudge factors to allow one to tweak the model for different lots of powder and the effects of deterrent coatings .
( QuickLOAD represents powder burning in bulk , which does account for the effect of deterrent coatings . )
NABM also computes an estimate of bullet engraving forces .
( QL 's bullet engraving is quite crude in comparison . )
I suspect primer effects , if addressed at all , were poorly modeled , for these are difficult to quantify .
While its mathematical representation of the internal ballistics parameters was certainly the most comprehensive , I 'm not aware Faber had tweaked NABM to the point it outperformed QuickLOAD .
Again , NABM is no longer supported , for Faber now recommends one use a strain gauge .
Too bad , since mathematical models can give insights the " real world " can mask .
RCBS.LOAD
Sorry , I have not tried this software , but you can read about it at the RCBS site .
Caution
The internal ballistics of small arms are nearly impossible to predict .
Small changes in bullet construction will change how readily the bullet enters the bore .
The more difficult it is to engrave the bullet , the higher the pressure grows .
The greater the pressure gets to be , the faster the powder begins to burn .
Pressures can and do rise unexpectedly fast .
Another big factor is the primer , for it determines the initial rate of pressure rise , and thus how fast the burning accelerates .
Powder lots sometimes vary greatly in burning " speed " as well .
Because the variability of bullet engraving , primer ignition , and powder lots are difficult to quantify , all commercial internal ballistics software simply ignores these effects .
( QuickLOAD tries to deal with some of them , but it simply cannot do so with accuracy . )
Such software can help you select a powder , but it cannot tell you how much of it to use nor which primer to use .
It also can't tell you what fps you can reliably expect to get at a given pressure .
For safety 's sake , always end load development at a chronographed fps below what the software predicts .
Take at least 5 % off your expecated fps ; your target is n't likely to notice the difference .
The only time you can reasonably expect to reach a certain velocity is if you 're using all the same components listed in a load that was tested in a pressure barrel .
That means not only the same powder , but also the same primer , the same case , and the same make and model of bullet .
Even then , there is no guarentee you 'll be getting the same pressure found under test .

Linux kernel developers issue a statement signed by about 100 developers that they find non-free kernel modules to be undesirable and harmful .
As they say “ Such modules negate the openness , stability , flexibility , and maintainability of the Linux development model and shut their users off from the expertise of the Linux community .
Vendors that provide closed - source kernel modules force their customers to give up key Linux advantages or choose new vendors . ”
Right on .
They have even criticized Nvidia specifically for not releasing free drivers .
Nvidia responded .
They have said nobecause , as they say , the drivers contain “ intellectual property NVIDIA wishes to protect ” and have further explained how they are already greatly supporting Linux and have a kernel team taking care of the non- free driver , all in all trying to make it sound like they are still offering their GNU / Linux using customers a sweet deal .
So let me get this straight , what is a part of this deal .
You buy a video card , get the driver CD which may or may not contain a Linux version of the driver ( in which case you have to go to their site to download it ) , finally install it and it works .
Sounds great , right ?
But what if you could do better ?
What if you are a programmer who wants to improve a particular aspect of the driver ?
You ca n’t do it .
So the question is , do you really fully and entirely own the card you bought ?
Perhaps .
But what about the thing that makes it work , that makes it do what you bought it to do ?
Well , apparently , that one you do n’t own .
You are merely rented it with the right to use it as is and that ’s about it .
If you think something does n’t work because there is a bug in the driver , nope , ca n’t fix it .
Gotta contact their sweet customer service and beg them to fix it .
So in short , the deal is , you get the card , but the only way to use it is to rent a driver to which you have an incomplete access , thereby making your fruitful use of the card consistently dependent on Nvidia and , quite obviously , therefore limiting the control you as a supposed owner of the card really have over it .
Who gives them the right to do this ?
Well , frankly , you , so long as you buy the card .
I ’ve said in my last post here that I do n’t necessarily believe anymore that them offering such a ( distasteful ) deal is an immoral thing to do , but the question is do you wish to accept it ?
Do you agree that paying for something and then having limited access is a good deal for you ?
That ’s something everyone has to answer for themselves .
I for one , while I ’ve been contemplating buying Nvidia as my next card because of the reverse engineered noveau driver which , last time I checked , was progressing quite well , now feel like spitefully saying no .
AMD is helping develop a free driver for their modern cards and is therefore the way to go .
Bottom line is .
Nvidia , you say no to freedomware drivers , I say no to you .
How about that ?
Perhaps with enough people in the market acting on that same sentiment will make the value of NVIDIA ’s precious “ intellectual property ” suddenly seem trivial ( that “ property ” is the recipe that makes MY card ( should I buy it ) work ! ) .
Thank you
Everything We Know About The PlayStation 5
In June , during an 85 - minute event called “ The Future of Gaming , ” Sony finally revealed the PlayStation 5 .
Between the presenters who may not have been human , we got a thorough look at plenty of video games ( and some technical stuff , too ) .

Advertisement Seventy people have been arrested in Australia in a nationwide operation to crack down on the use of images of child sex abuse posted on the internet .
The arrests , which include a policeman and several teachers , followed a six month investigation by police into paedophile communities online .
The probe was launched after 95 explicit pictures were posted by a hacker on a respected European website .
Over 76 hours , the site had 12 million hits from 150,000 users in 170 nations .
More than 2,800 internet protocol ( IP ) addresses were traced back to Australia and then identified by police .
The first arrests were made in cases where young people might be at risk and four children had been taken from their homes , investigators said .
Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty said that the probe was ongoing and there would be more arrests in the coming days .
Investigators had worked both with international partners and state police in what Mr Keelty described as one of Australia 's largest single operations against images that show child sex abuse .
" In Australia the operation has netted over a million images of children , and these are not children in passive positions , these are children who are being abused , " he said .
' All technology ' Correspondents say that the operation has highlighted the increasing sophistication with which paedophiles trade images online .
In the latest case , temporary chat rooms - which suddenly appear and then close almost as quickly - were used to pass on details of the location of the images .
Previous cases have shown that legal photo album websites are an increasingly common way for abusers to trade images .
Some commercial child abuse websites , run by criminal gangs , break up images on to several servers around the world .
The fragments , like pieces of a jigsaw , are only united when a paedophile downloads an image .
Other websites or chat rooms only appear on the web for a short period of time , or move servers regularly to different legal jurisdictions .
And the latest technology , such as web - enabled devices like the Sony PlayStation and new generation mobile phones , is being used to download these images .
A spokesman for the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre told the BBC : " Whilst this may not be run - of - the - mill it 's not surprising that they 're using these tactics to trade images .
" They 're using all types of technology .
" They use websites , they use newsgroups , online communities , peer to peer networking ; they 're looking to exploit all means possible . "

What are these ?
The platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is an odd - looking creature whose features combine the furry torso and wide , flat tail of a beaver with the rubbery bill and webbed feet of a duck .
But its looks are not all that is strange about it .
A new study indicates that the distinctive mammal 's genetic code is an eclectic brew of bird , reptile and mammal .
This mix - and - match animal is more than just an oddity , though .
Researchers report in Nature that its genome provides important clues into how mammals , birds and reptiles evolved from a common ancestor some 315 million years ago .
And researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine report in Genome Research that they linked the evolution of a gene in the old platypus to a mutated version in humans responsible for moving the testes outside of the body and into an external pouch , or scrotum .
" As you look at the [ platypus ] genome , effectively what you 've got is a patchwork : places that look a bit more avian , places that look a bit reptilian , and places that look a bit mammalian , " says Mark Batzer , a geneticist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and co-author of the Nature study .
" Looking at different genomes and seeing where various processes were created gives you some insight into how things work and why they were generated . "
Batzer was part of an international team of researchers that sequenced and analyzed the genome of a wild female platypus named Glennie , which lives in southeastern Australia .
Among its findings :
The platypus ' genome is two thirds the size of the human genome and contains 18,500 genes .
( The human genome comprises 20,000 to 25,000 genes . )
Eighty - two percent of the animal 's genes are found in other mammals .
The genome is organized into 52 chromosomes ( tightly packed structures of DNA stored in a cell 's nucleus ) , 10 of which determine the animal 's sex .
( In humans , there are 46 chromosomes — 23 pairs — and only two ( X and Y ) are sex- determining . )
The Stanford group compared the platypus genome with those of fish , frogs , birds , marsupials and placental mammals .
Their goal : to track the evolution of a family of genes known as relaxins .
Relaxins are behind the development of features unique to most mammals — placentas ( organs that allow nutrients to pass from pregnant females to their developing fetuses ) , mammary glands for milk production , nipples and external testes .
The only type of mammal that does not have these traits belongs to the classification monotreme , an order that includes the platypus and the echidna ( or spiny anteater ) and which split off from other mammals 170 million years ago .
Monotremes have a single orifice ( called a cloaca ) for urinating , defecating and laying eggs .
Like other mammals , the platypus secretes milk through its skin to feed offspring and is warm - blooded — though its body temperature is nine degrees Fahrenheit ( five degrees Celsius ) cooler than that of a human .
Like reptiles , it lays eggs , has no nipples and houses its testicles inside its body near its kidneys .
" Testicular descent is a very specialized process that required the evolution of specific genes , " says Sheau Yu Teddy Hsu , a Stanford assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology and co-author of the study in Genome Research .
" The platypus serves as a ' bridge ' animal between nonmammals like birds and reptiles , which maintain their testicles in a body cavity , and placental and marsupial mammals , which hold their testes in an external scrotum . "
External testes allow for animals to have a higher body temperature without jeopardizing heat - sensitive sperm cells , Hsu says .
( An increased body temperature allows for faster energy production , leading to greater agility and faster reflexes — all of which are reproductively advantageous . )
Scientists already know that a gene called Insl3 is important for testicular descent in placental mammals and marsupials .
During their study , Hsu and his colleagues determined that Insl3 and a second relaxin , Rln3 , whose function is unknown , evolved from an ancestral gene found in fish .
Hsu says that fish have one copy of the ancestral gene ; the frog evolved to have has two copies of the same gene .
" In order for something to evolve , duplication of a gene is the most important event , " Hsu says .
" We found that in all [ four - legged animals ] , there is a duplication of the ancestral gene . "
One copy of this gene went on to become Rln3 ; the other developed into Insl3 sometime after the monotremes split off from the rest of the mammals .
Hsu says that learning how Insl3 adapted may eventually offer a way to reverse the fortunes of the 30 percent of boys born prematurely whose testes fail to properly descend .
The Stanford team is now looking into the evolution of Rln2 , the gene believed to be linked to mammary gland and nipple formation .
The following is taken from a talk delivered at the Conference for the Right of Return and the Secular Democratic State , held in Haifa on June 21 .
In 1895 Theodor Herzl , Zionism ’s chief prophet , confided in his diary that he did not favor sharing Palestine with the natives .
Better , he wrote , to " try to spirit the penniless [ Palestinian ] population across the border by denying it any employment in our own country Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly . "
He was proposing a program of Palestinian emigration enforced through a policy of strict separation between Jewish immigrants and the indigenous population .
In simple terms , he hoped that , once Zionist organizations had bought up large areas of Palestine and owned the main sectors of the economy , Palestinians could be made to leave by denying them rights to work the land or labor in the Jewish - run economy .
His vision was one of transfer , or ethnic cleansing , through ethnic separation .
Herzl was suggesting that two possible Zionist solutions to the problem of a Palestinian majority living in Palestine  separation and transfer  were not necessarily alternatives but rather could be mutually reinforcing .
Not only that : he believed , if they were used together , the process of ethnic cleansing could be made to appear voluntary , the choice of the victims .
It may be that this was both his most enduring legacy and his major innovation to settler colonialism .
In recent years , with the Palestinian population under Israeli rule about to reach parity with the Jewish population , the threat of a Palestinian majority has loomed large again for the Zionists .
Not surprisingly , debates about which of these two Zionist solutions to pursue , separation or transfer , have resurfaced .
Today these solutions are ostensibly promoted by two ideological camps loosely associated with Israel ’s center - left ( Labor and Kadima ) and right ( Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu ) .
The modern political arguments between them turn on differing visions of the nature of a Jewish state originally put forward by Labor and Revisionist Zionists .
To make sense of the current political debates , and the events taking place inside Israel and in the West Bank and Gaza , let us first examine the history of these two principles in Zionist thinking .
During the early waves of Jewish immigration to Palestine , the dominant Labor Zionist movement and its leader David Ben Gurion advanced policies much in line with Herzl ’s goal .
In particular , they promoted the twin principles of " Redemption of the Land " and " Hebrew Labor " , which took as their premise the idea that Jews needed to separate themselves from the native population in working the land and employing only other Jews .
By being entirely self - reliant in Palestine , Jews could both " cure " themselves of their tainted Diaspora natures and deprive the Palestinians of the opportunity to subsist in their own homeland .
At the forefront of this drive was the Zionist trade union federation , the Histadrut , which denied membership to Palestinians  and , for many years after the establishment of the Jewish state , even to the remnants of the Palestinian population who became Israeli citizens .
But if separation was the official policy of Labor Zionism , behind the scenes Ben Gurion and his officials increasingly appreciated that it would not be enough in itself to achieve their goal of a pure ethnic state .
Land sales remained low , at about 6 per cent of the territory , and the Jewish - owned parts of the economy relied on cheap Palestinian labor
Instead , the Labor Zionists secretly began working on a program of ethnic cleansing .
After 1937 and Britain ’s Peel Report proposing partition of Palestine , Ben Gurion was more open about transfer , recognizing that a Jewish state would be impossible unless most of the indigenous population was cleared from within its borders .
Israel ’s new historians have acknowledged Ben Gurion ’s commitment to transfer .
As Benny Morris notes , for example , Ben Gurion " understood that there could be no Jewish state with a large and hostile Arab minority in its midst . "
The Israeli leadership therefore developed a plan for ethnic cleansing under cover of war , compiling detailed dossiers on the communities that needed to be driven out and then passing on the order , in Plan Dalet , to commanders in the field .
During the 1948 war the new state of Israel was emptied of at least 80 per cent of its indigenous population .
In physically expelling the Palestinian population , Ben Gurion responded to the political opportunities of the day and recalibrated the Labor Zionism of Herzl .
In particular he achieved the goal of displacement desired by Herzl while also largely persuading the world through a campaign of propaganda that the exodus of the refugees was mostly voluntary .
In one of the most enduring Zionist myths , convincingly rebutted by modern historians , we are still told that the refugees left because they were told to do so by the Arab leadership .
The other camp , the Revisionists , had a far more ambivalent attitude to the native Palestinian population .
Paradoxically , given their uncompromising claim to a Greater Israel embracing both banks of the Jordan River ( thereby including not only Palestine but also the modern state of Jordan ) , they were more prepared than the Labor Zionists to allow the natives to remain where they were .
Vladimir Jabotinsky , the leader of Revisionism , observed in 1938  possibly in a rebuff to Ben Gurion ’s espousal of transfer  that " it must be hateful for any Jew to think that the rebirth of a Jewish state should ever be linked with such an odious suggestion as the removal of non-Jewish citizens " .
The Revisionists , it seems , were resigned to the fact that the enlarged territory they desired would inevitably include a majority of Arabs .
They were therefore less concerned with removing the natives than finding a way to make them accept Jewish rule .
In 1923 , Jabotinsky formulated his answer , one that implicitly included the notion of separation but not necessarily transfer : an " iron wall " of unremitting force to cow the natives into submission .
In his words , the agreement of the Palestinians to their subjugation could be reached only " through the iron wall , that is to say , the establishment in Palestine of a force that will in no way be influenced by Arab pressure " .
An enthusiast of British imperial rule , Jabotinsky envisioned the future Jewish state in simple colonial terms , as a European elite ruling over the native population .
Inside Revisionism , however , there was a shift from the idea of separation to transfer that mirrored developments inside Labor Zionism .
This change was perhaps more opportunistic than ideological , and was particularly apparent as the Revisionists sensed Ben Gurion ’s success in forging a Jewish state through transfer .
One of Jabotinsky disciples , Menachem Begin , who would later become a Likud prime minister , was leader in 1948 of the Irgun militia that committed one of the worst atrocities of the war .
He led his fighters into the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin where they massacred over 100 inhabitants , including women and children .
Savage enough though these events were , Begin and his followers consciously inflated the death toll to more than 250 through the pages of the New York Times .
Their goal was to spread terror among the wider Palestinian population and encourage them to flee .
He later happily noted : " Arabs throughout the country , induced to believe wild tales of ‘ Irgun butchery ’ , were seized with limitless panic and started to flee for their lives .
This mass flight soon developed into a maddened , uncontrollable stampede . "
Subsequently , other prominent figures on the right openly espoused ethnic cleansing , including the late General Rehavam Ze’evi , whose Moledet party campaigned in elections under the symbol of the Hebrew character " tet " , for transfer .
His successor , Benny Elon , a settler leader and rabbi , adopted a similar platform : " Only population transfer can bring peace " .
The intensity of the separation vs transfer debate subsided after 1948 and the ethnic cleansing campaign that removed most of the native Palestinian population from the Jewish state .
The Palestinian minority left behind  a fifth of the population but a group , it was widely assumed , that would soon be swamped by Jewish immigration  was seen as an irritation but not yet as a threat .
It was placed under a military government for nearly two decades , a system designed to enforce separation between Palestinians and Jews inside Israel .
Such separation  in education , employment and residence  exists to this day , even if in a less extreme form .
The separation - transfer debate was chiefly revived by Israel ’s conquest of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 .
With Israel ’s erasure of the Green Line , and the effective erosion of the distinction between Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories , the problem of a Palestinian majority again loomed large for the Zionists .
Cabinet debates from 1967 show the quandary faced by the government .
Almost alone , Moshe Dayan favored annexation of both the newly captured territories and the Palestinian population there .
Others believed that such a move would be seen as transparently colonialist and rapidly degenerate into an apartheid system of Jewish citizens and Palestinian non-citizens .
In their minds , Jabotinsky ’s solution of an iron wall was no longer viable .
But equally , in a more media - saturated era , which at least paid lip - service to human rights , the government could see no way to expel the Palestinian population on a large scale and annex the land , as Ben Gurion had done earlier .
Also possibly , they could see no way of persuading the world that such expulsions should be characterized as voluntary .
Israel therefore declined to move decisively in either direction , neither fully carrying out a transfer program nor enforcing strict separation .
Instead it opted for an apartheid model that accommodated Dayan ’s suggestion of a " creeping annexation " of the occupied territories that he rightly believed would go largely unnoticed by the West .
The separation embodied in South African apartheid differed from Herzl ’s notion of separation in one important respect : in apartheid , the " other " population was a necessary , even if much abused , component of the political arrangement .
As the exiled Palestinian thinker Azmi Bishara has noted , in South Africa " racial segregation was not absolute .
It took place within a framework of political unity .
The racist regime saw blacks as part of the system , an ingredient of the whole .
The whites created a racist hierarchy within the unity . "
In other words , the self - reliance , or unilateralism , implicit in Herzl ’s concept of separation was ignored for many years of Israel ’s occupation .
The Palestinian labor force was exploited by Israel just as black workers were by South Africa .
This view of the Palestinians was formalized in the Oslo accords , which were predicated on the kind of separation needed to create a captive labor force .
However , Yitzhak Rabin ’s version of apartheid embodied by the Oslo process , and Binyamin Netanyahu ’s opposition in upholding Jabotinsky ’s vision of Greater Israel , both deviated from Herzl ’s model of transfer through separation .
This is largely why each political current has been subsumed within the recent but more powerful trend towards " unilateral separation " .
Not surprisingly , the policy of " unilateral separation " emerged from among the Labor Zionists , advocated primarily by Ehud Barak .
However , it was soon adopted by many members of Likud too .
Ultimately its success derived from the conversion to its cause of Greater Israel ’s arch - exponent , Ariel Sharon .
He realized the chief manifestations of unilateral separation , the West Bank wall and the Gaza disengagement , as well breaking up Israel ’s right - wing to create a new consensus party , Kadima .
In the new consensus , the transfer of Palestinians could be achieved through imposed and absolute separation  just as Herzl had once hoped .
After the Gaza disengagement , the next stage was promoted by Sharon ’s successor , Ehud Olmert .
His plan for convergence , limited withdrawals from the West Bank in which most settlers would remain in place , has been dropped , but its infrastructure  the separation wall  continues to be built .
How will modern Zionists convert unilateral separation into transfer ?
How will Herzl ’s original vision of ethnic cleansing enforced through strict ethnic separation be realized in today ’s world ?
The current siege of Gaza offers the template .
After disengagement , Israel has been able to cut off at will Gazans ’ access to aid , food , fuel and humanitarian services .
Normality has been further eroded by sonic booms , random Israeli air attacks , and repeated small - scale invasions that have inflicted a large toll of casualties , particularly among civilians .
Gaza ’s imprisonment has stopped being a metaphor and become a daily reality .
In fact , Gaza ’s condition is far worse than imprisonment : prisoners , even of war , expect to have their humanity respected , and be properly sheltered , cared for , fed and clothed .
Gazans can no longer rely on these staples of life .
The ultimate goal of this extreme form of separation is patently clear : transfer .
By depriving Palestinians of the basic conditions of a normal life , it is assumed that they will eventually choose to leave  in what can once again be sold to the world as a voluntary exodus .
And if Palestinians choose to abandon their homeland , then in Zionist thinking they have forfeited their right to it  just as earlier generations of Zionists believed the Palestinian refugees had done by supposedly fleeing during the 1948 and 1967 wars .
Is this process of transfer inevitable ?
I think not .
The success of a modern policy of " transfer through separation " faces severe limitations .
First , it depends on continuing US global hegemony and blind support for Israel .
Such support is likely to be undermined by the current American misadventures in the Middle East , and a gradual shift in the balance of power to China , Russia and India .
Second , it requires a Zionist worldview that departs starkly not only from international law but also from the values upheld by most societies and ideologies .
The nature of Zionist ambitions is likely to be ever harder to conceal , as is evident from the tide of opinion polls showing that Western publics , if not their governments , believe Israel to be one of the biggest threats to world order .
And third , it assumes that the Palestinians will remain passive during their slow eradication .
The historical evidence most certainly shows that they will not .
Nearly half of British men surveyed would give up sex for six months in return for a 50 - inch plasma TV , a survey - perhaps unsurprisingly carried out for a firm selling televisions - has found .
Electrical retailer Comet surveyed 2,000 Britons , asking them what they would give up for a large television , one of the latest consumer " must - haves " .
The firm found 47 per cent of men would give up sex for half a year , compared to just over a third of women .
" It seems that size really does matter more for men than women , " the firm said .
A quarter of people said they would give up smoking , with roughly the same proportion willing to give up chocolate .

Government web sites have been a joke for almost as long as there have been web sites .
They tend to be slow , clunky , and far behind their private - sector counterparts .
All three presidential candidates have signaled that they want the federal government to make better use of the Internet , but there 's a real danger that the next administration will simply add another coat of lipstick to a very ugly pig .
A new paper from researchers at Princeton University suggests a different strategy .
David Robinson , Harlan Yu , William Zeller , and Ed Felten , all of Princeton 's Information Technology Policy Center , suggest that government officials abandon the dream of developing usable web sites , and instead focus on providing raw public data such as regulatory decisions , Congressional votes , and campaign finance data in open , structured formats such as RSS and XML .
This raw data would be made freely and publicly available to anyone who wanted it and could be used for any purpose .
Robinson et al predict that the private sector would quickly surpass the feds at the task of organizing and presenting this information in a user - friendly manner .
Indeed , they note that in several cases , private parties have already produced user - friendly web sites with government data despite the high barrier to entry created by the need to manually scrape the data from the feds ' existing web sites .
The THOMAS system
For example , GovTrack presents information about the legislative process in ways that are superior in some respects to Thomas , the government 's official source for legislative information .
It is maintained by linguistics graduate student Joshua Tauberer in his free time .
The Princeton researchers suggest that once the private sector has been relieved of the irritating task of manually scraping data from government web sites , a proliferation of user - friendly sites will allow people to sort , search , and analyze the data in a variety of ways .
Govtrack.us
To ensure that governments ' release of structured data does not become an afterthought , the study 's authors advocate a requirement that agencies ' user - facing web sites must exclusively use the publicly - available data sources as their " back ends . "
This would give agencies a strong incentive to ensure the data sources remain in good working order , and that they contain complete and up - to - date information .
Hack , Mash , and Peer
Robinson and his colleagues are not the only researchers advocating that government agencies release public data in structured formats .
Last fall , Jerry Brito of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University released a paper called " Hack , Mash , and Peer . "
The paper explained the basics of structured data formats and argued that releasing raw data in open , structured formats would make government more transparent and accountable .
Mandating the release of structured data would also discourage the manipulation of public data for self - serving reasons .
For example , Brito relates the story of a Washington Post researcher who discovered on the Senate web site out - of - date XML files containing Senators ' congressional votes .
The researcher e-mailed the Senate webmaster , who replied that the XML files had been disabled because Senators " have a right to present and comment on their votes to their constituents in the manner they prefer . "
In other words , allowing access to structured voting data might expose Senators to too much public scrutiny .
The current administration has proven less than enthusiastic about government transparency , so it is unlikely to make these proposals a priority .
But when a new administration takes office , it will have an historic opportunity to increase government transparency through the use of open , structured data formats .
Researchers at Princeton , George Mason , and elsewhere are laying the groundwork by developing specific proposals for administrative and legislative changes .
We can only hope the next president listens .
Disclosure : Beginning this fall , Timothy B. Lee will be a student at Princeton 's Center for IT Policy , studying under Ed Felten , one of the study 's authors .
Also , Lee and Jerry Brito both contribute to the Technology Liberation Front blog .
US Politics A Bundle of Sticks on Fire By Ryan McGreal
Published March 07 , 2007
So Ann Coulter , speaking at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) convention , called John Edwards , a Democratic Party presidential candidate , a " faggot " .
The less said about the remark itself , the better , though Andrew Sullivan gets it just about exactly right in his analysis of Coulter 's insistence that it was only a joke .
More interesting to me is the way Edwards responded :
Ann Coulter 's use of an anti-gay slur yesterday was un-American and indefensible .
In America , we strive for equality and embrace diversity .
The kind of hateful language she used has no place in political debate or our society at large .
I believe it is our moral responsibility to speak out against that kind of bigotry and prejudice every time we encounter it .
Coulter 's slur was a typical Republican tactic : an attempt to portray Edwards as a sissy , a weakling , a pretty boy , not man enough for the job , and his petulant response played right into that tactic .
For two case studies on how - or how not - to deal with these kinds of slurs , consider the recent kerfuffle between US Vice President Dick Cheney and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
1. The Morass of Outrage
In an interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News , Cheney said :
I think , in fact , if we were to do what Speaker Pelosi and Congressman [ Jack ]
Murtha are suggesting , all we 'll do is validate the al Qaeda strategy .
The al Qaeda strategy is to break the will of the American people .
In fact , knowing they can't win in a stand - up fight , try to persuade us to throw in the towel and come home , and then they win because we quit .
It was typical macho right - wing posturing at its best : Doing what Pelosi recommends generates the weasel words and phrases " break the will of the American people " , " throw in the towel " , and " quit " .
Pelosi took real umbrage with the statement :
You cannot say as the president of the United States , ' I welcome disagreement in a time of war , ' and then have the vice president of the United States go out of the country and mischaracterize a position of the speaker of the House and in a manner that says that person in that position of authority is acting against the national security of our country .
This opened the door to a he - said , she - said back and forth that buried the real issue in a morass of charge and counter - charge .
Cheney retorted :
I did n't question her patriotism .
I questioned her judgment .
If you 're going to advocate a course of action that basically is withdrawal of our forces from Iraq , then you do n't get to just do the fun part of that , that says , we 'll we 're going to get out and appeal to your constituents on that basis .
You also have to be accountable for the results .
Well , she did n't actually accuse him of questioning her patriotism , but that , like most actual facts , is beside the point .
The details get lost in the back - and - forth , and the tendency of journalists to give equal weight to each side in the interest of " balance " means the debate ends up as a wash .
2. The Power of Ridicule
Around the same time , Senator Barack Obama , another Democratic candidate for president , chose a different way to fire back at Cheney .
Speaking about British Prime Minister Tony Blair 's decision to start withdrawing troops from Iraq during an outdoor speech , Obama scored some rhetorical points :
Obama , speaking at a massive outdoor rally in Austin , Texas , said British Prime Minister Tony Blair 's decision this week to withdraw 1,600 troops is a recognition that Iraq 's problems can't be solved militarily .
" Now if Tony Blair can understand that , then why ca n't George Bush and Dick Cheney understand that ? "
Obama asked thousands of supporters who gathered in the rain to hear him .
" In fact , Dick Cheney said this is all part of the plan ( and ) it was a good thing that Tony Blair was withdrawing , even as the administration is preparing to put 20,000 more of our young men and women in .
" Now , keep in mind , this is the same guy that said we'd be greeted as liberators , the same guy that said that we 're in the last throes .
I 'm sure he forecast sun today , " Obama said to laughter from supporters holding campaign signs over their heads to keep dry .
" When Dick Cheney says it 's a good thing , you know that you 've probably got some big problems . " [ emphasis added ]
Can you see the difference ?
Pelosi's approach trips right into the Republican playbook , giving the GOP bought priesthood the chance to portray the Democrats as a bunch of hysterical sissies ; whereas Obama 's approach uses humour and ridicule to shift the context over to Cheney 's own record on Iraq .
Controlling the Terms of Debate
In US politics , the Republicans control the terms of debate .
They 're the ones framing the issues in their interest .
To the extent that they lost some ground in the November election , it 's because the split between their words and actions is getting too big for voters to ignore , not because they 've lost control over the framework .
Psychologically , Americans are torn between narcissism and prudentry .
They want to be titillated and simultaneously to feel outrage over the source of the titillation .
The Republicans have managed to play off both sides of this unstable equation through a very careful , very savvy communications program .
Thus Coulter is able to call someone a faggot even as she scolds her listeners about Christian values .
Until now , the Democrats have been playing catch - up , essentially falling right into the Republicans ' trap , again and again .
When Edwards reacts with something that can be described as petulance to an attack on his masculinity , he simply reinforces Coulter 's slur among her followers .
Look at that whiny bitch , they 're saying about him .
The difference between the Edwards / Pelosi approach and the Obama approach is that the former accepts the Republican framework and tries to operate inside it , which simply reinforces the framework itself .
The latter weakens the framework by subjecting it to ridicule and exposing its shaky connection to reality .
There 's nothing like laughter to break the spell a charismatic bully holds over his or her stooges .
What bullies hate more than anything else is to look ridiculous , and Obama made Cheney look ridiculous .
The Obama Approach
Now imagine the difference if Edwards had responded the way Obama did .
The next time an interviewer asks him why he thinks he should be President , he could say , " Well , Anne Coulter says I 'm a faggot , so I must be doing something right . "
Alternately , he could examine the context of her remark for a way to highlight its hypocrisy .
Something like :
So Anne Coulter says I 'm a - let me make sure I 'm quoting her correctly - a ' faggot ' .
To robust applause from the Conservative Political Action Conference , no less .
Interestingly , CPAC grew out of the National Conservative Political Action Committee , which was founded by Terry Dolan , a militant homophobe - and closeted homosexual .
Hey , you 're welcome to your opinion on Coulter 's sense of humour , but her sense of irony , however unintentional , is clearly firing on all eight cylinders .
Okay , so I 'm not very good at writing political speeches , but Edwards is an experienced trial lawyer , so I 'm pretty sure he knows how to make a case .
The point is that rrogressives are barely winning by default when they should be sweeping American politics .
They wo n't start beating the reactionary bullies and thugs until they break out of the Republican ideological framework and impose their own framework on the issues .

cryptogon.com news – analysis – conspiracies
June 24th , 2008
It is absolute madness that commodities are bought and sold using leveraged vehicles in markets that allow participation by speculators ; individuals and organizations who have no interest or connection to the underlying physical commodity .
— Cryptogon , March 21 , 2008
You know , I wrote something that turned out to be wrong in that piece above :
Pigs ( Pork Bellies ? ) will fly before anyone takes my suggestion seriously .
I never , in my wildest dreams , thought that Congress would even look at this , much less consider doing anything about it !
I guess lots of things become possible when the wheels are coming off the cart .
Now , the Market Watch piece below is interesting , indeed .
It mentions some key Bush administration officials who reject the notion that speculators are playing a substantial role in driving up oil prices :
Both Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman have dismissed the impact of speculators on prices paid by consumers .
Anyone who “ dismisses ” the role of speculators in this shakedown is either stupid , or in on the scam .
Hank Paulson and Samuel Bodman are n’t stupid .
So …
Let ’s take a quick walk through the revolving door to see what Henry Paulson and Samuel Bodman did before taking their jobs as high government officials .
Henry Paulson was formerly the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs .
Well , well , well .
Hank might have us believe that the Tooth Fairy has more to do with the price of oil than speculators .
I mean , what possible impact could a firm with more black boxes than DARPA and some of the deepest pockets on Wall Street have on leveraged commodity markets ?
Meh ! Fuggetaboutit .
How about Samuel Bodman ?
He ’s the former President and Chief Operating Officer of Fidelity Investments and the former Director of the Fidelity Group of Mutual Funds .
You know , Fidelity , that little mom and pop operation with $ 1.57 trillion of assets under management as of September 2007 …
Perish the thought that speculators would have anything to do with this oil situation !
How could anyone suggest such a stupid thing !?
Via : Market Watch :
The price of retail gasoline could fall by half , to around $ 2 a gallon , within 30 days of passage of a law to limit speculation in energy - futures markets , four energy analysts told Congress on Monday .
Testifying to the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Michael Masters of Masters Capital Management said that the price of oil would quickly drop closer to its marginal cost of around $ 65 to $ 75 a barrel , about half the current $ 135 .
Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Co. , Edward Krapels of Energy Security Analysis and Roger Diwan of PFC Energy Consultants agreed with Masters ’ assessment at a hearing on proposed legislation to limit speculation in futures markets .
Krapels said that it would n’t even take 30 days to drive prices lower , as fund managers quickly liquidated their positions in futures markets .
“ Record oil prices are inflated by speculation and not justified by market fundamentals , ” according to Gheit .
“ Based on supply and demand fundamentals , crude - oil prices should not be above $ 60 per barrel . ”
Futures trading in London has not been a major factor in rising oil prices , testified Sir Bob Reid , chairman of the Chairman of London - based ICE Futures Europe .
Rising prices are largely a function of fundamental supply and demand , not manipulation or speculation , he said .
“ Energy speculation has become a growth industry and it is time for the government to intervene , ” said Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich . , chairman of the full committee .
“ We need to consider a full range of options to counter this rapacious speculation . ”
It was Dingell ’s strongest statement yet on the role of speculators .
Dingell introduced a bill on June 11 that would ask the Energy Department to gather the facts on energy prices , including the role played by speculators .
There are two kinds of speculators in the futures markets , Masters said .
Traditional speculators are those who need to hedge because they actually take physical possession of the commodities .
Index speculators , on the other hand , are merely allocating a portion of their portfolio to commodity futures .
Index speculation damages price - discovery mechanisms provided by futures markets , Masters added
The committee will likely consider legislation that would rein in index speculation by imposing higher - margin requirements ; setting position limits for speculators ; requiring more disclosure of positions ; and preventing pension funds and investment banks from owning commodities .
Both major presidential candidates have supported closing loopholes that encourage speculation in the energy markets .

However , other witnesses said that pure speculators have had little impact on energy prices , which have doubled in the past year to about $ 135 per barrel .
Both Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman have dismissed the impact of speculators on prices paid by consumers .
Speculators now account for about 70 % of all benchmark crude trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 37 % in 2000 , said Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich. , chairman of the investigations subcommittee .
Stupak introduced a bill on Friday that would limit index speculation .
There has been much discussion recently about how big a role speculators have been playing in the sharp rise in energy prices , though no consensus has emerged on this point .
Congress , however , has grown increasingly concerned over speculative investors ’ role in the energy market in comparison with those buying futures contracts to hedge against risk from price changes .
Lawmakers are expected to consider legislation to set strict limits — or in some cases , an outright ban — on speculative trading in energy futures in some markets .
Dingell is looking into any legal loopholes that may have contributed to speculation in energy markets .
In 1991 , according to documents provided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to the committee ’s investigators , the agency authorized the first exemption from position limits for swap dealers with no physical commodity exposure .
This began what Dingell said was “ a process that has enabled investment banks to accumulate enormous positions in commodity markets . ”
Is Congress barking up the wrong tree ?
Neal Ryan , manager at Ryan Oil & Gas Partners , said that if Congress develops regulations to cut back speculative trading , speculation will just find a new home .
“ Speculation is the root of capitalism , ” he said .
“ If the speculation is forced out of the U.S. exchanges , it ’ll simply show up on other exchanges that are OTC like the ICE , or new exchanges will pop up to allow for the spec trades to continue functioning . ”
Ryan said he does see a reason for Congress to look at eliminating aspects such as allowing West Texas intermediate crude oil futures to trade on foreign markets and the “ Enron loophole , ” but “ these exchanges are currently functioning as they are supposed to in a free marketplace . ”
The creation of a comprehensive U.S. energy policy that tackles issues of increasing domestic supply and reining in consumer demand via conservation should be Congress ’ focus , Ryan said .
“ Instead we ’re on bended knee begging the Saudis to put more oil on the market and talking about shutting down spec trades . ”
( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton is arguing that she is ahead of rival Sen. Barack Obama when it comes to the popular vote .
If Michigan and Florida are counted , Sen. Hillary Clinton is ahead in the popular vote .
" I 'm very proud that as of today , I have received more votes by the people who have voted than anyone else , " Clinton said Wednesday , one day after her decisive win in Pennsylvania .
Not so fast , says Obama 's campaign .
Clinton 's count includes her wins in Michigan and Florida , but the Democratic presidential candidates agreed not to campaign in those states because they violated party rules by scheduling their contests too early .
Obama did n't even have his name on the Michigan ballot , so he received no votes from that contest .
" We think that , in the end , if we end up having won twice as many states and having the most votes , then we should be the nominee , " Obama said .
If Michigan and Florida are counted , Clinton is ahead by 100,000 votes -- 15.1 million to Obama 's 15 million .
Without those states , Obama has a 500,000 vote lead , 14.4 million to 13.9 million .
Clinton says she has received more votes than any Democratic candidate in history .
" It 's a very close race , but if you count , as I count , the 2.3 million people who voted in Michigan and Florida , then we are going to build on that , " the New York senator said .
Obama 's campaign manager said he does n't expect the Illinois senator to lose his lead by June 3 , the date of the last contest .
But Obama is facing questions about why he can't just bring the race to an end .
" You know the way we 're going to close the deal is by winning .
And right now we 're winning .
And what we 'll do is keep on campaigning in Indiana and North Carolina and Oregon and these other states , " he said .
Watch how the candidates are prepping for the next contests »
" And at the conclusion of all these contests , people will go back and take a look and say , ' Who 's won ? ' "
Obama leads Clinton in the overall delegate count , 1,719 to 1,586 .
Neither candidate can capture the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination with wins in the remaining Democratic contests , meaning the party 's superdelegates will probably decide who gets the Democratic nomination .
Superdelegates are party leaders and officials who vote at the August convention for the candidate of their choice .
Clinton is hoping the popular vote argument will persuade them to endorse her .
Of the superdelegates who have made public their choice , Clinton leads Obama 255-232 .
Watch a report on the superdelegate struggle »
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean has called on the superdelegates to make up their minds , but superdelegate Debra Kozikowski said it makes sense for her to wait until the primary process is completed .
" We only have a few short weeks to go , and there 's been a lot of talk about which states matter and which states do n't .
Big states , small states -- all states matter , all contests matter , " she said on CNN's " American Morning . "
The Democrats next face off on May 6 , when North Carolina and Indiana hold their contests .
Obama has a comfortable lead in North Carolina , and it's a tight race in Indiana , according to recent polls .
Clinton on Thursday is focusing on North Carolina , where she 'll make stops in Fayetteville and Asheville .
Obama has no public events scheduled Thursday .
As the race for the Democratic nomination drags on , Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , is focusing on the general election .
The Arizona senator said earlier this week he is n't sure if the prolonged Democratic race is benefiting him , but exit polls from Tuesday 's contest in Pennsylvania suggest that could be the case .
Only 50 percent of Clinton voters in Pennsylvania said they would support Obama if he is the nominee .
Twenty - six percent said they would back McCain over Obama , and 19 percent said they would not vote at all .
Among Obama 's Pennsylvania voters , 67 percent said they would support Clinton if she is the party 's nominee .
Seventeen percent said they would back McCain instead , and 12 percent said they would choose neither .
McCain is spending Thursday touring the 9th ward and attending a town hall meeting in New Orleans , Louisiana , as part of his weeklong tour to reach out to people who typically would n't vote Republican .

Iraqis want US out of Iraq .
( Photo : ABC News )
Washington – A majority of the Iraqi parliament has written to Congress rejecting a long - term security deal with Washington if it is not linked to a requirement that U.S. forces leave , a U.S. lawmaker said on Wednesday .
Rep. William Delahunt , a Massachusetts Democrat and Iraq war opponent , released excerpts from a letter he was handed by Iraqi parliamentarians laying down conditions for the security pact that the Bush administration seeks with Iraq .
The proposed pact has become increasingly controversial in Iraq , where there have been protests against it .
It has also drawn criticism from Democrats on the presidential election campaign trail in the United States , who say President George W. Bush is trying to dictate war policy after he leaves office .
" The majority of Iraqi representatives strongly reject any military - security , economic , commercial , agricultural , investment or political agreement with the United States that is not linked to clear mechanisms that obligate the occupying American military forces to fully withdraw from Iraq , " the letter to the leaders of Congress said .
The signatures represented just over half the membership of Iraq 's parliament , said Delahunt , a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee chairman .
Two Iraqi lawmakers whose parties were listed as signatories testified to Delahunt 's panel on Wednesday that U.S. troops should leave Iraq , and that talks on the long - term security pact should be postponed until after they are gone .
" What are the threats that require U.S. forces to be there ? " asked Nadeem Al - Jaberi , a co-founder of the al - Fadhila Shi'ite political party , speaking through a translator .
" I would like to inform you , there are no threats on Iraq .
We are capable of solving our own problems , " he declared .
He favored a quick pullout of U.S. forces , which invaded the country in 2003 and currently number around 155,000 .
A Sunni Iraqi lawmaker , Khalaf Al - Ulayyan , founder of the National Dialogue Council , said bilateral talks on a long - term security deal should be shelved until American troops leave -- and until there is a new government in Washington .
" We prefer to delay until there is a new administration in the United States , " he said .
The United States elects a new president in November ; Democrat Barack Obama , who clinched his party 's nomination this week , is among senators sponsoring a bill requiring any long - term pact with Iraq be submitted to Congress for approval .
A senior U.S. official said in Baghdad earlier this week that the United States still hopes to reach a new security agreement with Iraq by July , even though officials in the government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki say negotiations are at an early stage .

Court documents show that a hacker , hired by the MPAA , offered to reveal the identities of the Pirate Bay founders .
The hacker , who also retrieved private information from TorrentSpy , was paid $ 15.000 for his efforts .
It turns out that the MPAA will do pretty much anything to obtain information about BitTorrent sites and its users .
Back in 2006 , they made a deal with a “ hacker ” , better known as Robert Anderson , to steal e-mail correspondence and trade secrets from TorrentSpy .
The hacker later admitted that this was indeed true , and in a surprising turn of events , he switched sides , and joined TorrentSpy .
The court case between the MPAA and TorrentSpy eventually led to the downfall of TorrentSpy , but it turned out that the MPAA was also interested in intel on The Pirate Bay .
Cnet cites court documents showing that Anderson wrote to the MPAA : “ We can provide the names , address , and phone ( numbers ) of the owners of Torrentspy.com and Thepiratebay.org — along with evidence , including correspondence between the two companies . ”
In addition , the court documents reveal that MPAA ’s Dean Garfield stated : “ We were going to get information about the location and identity of the people who were running Torrentspy , as well as information related to a general conspiracy and relationship between Torrentspy and a number of other prominent services including ThePirateBay . ”
I a response to the news , Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak : “ We ’re very open with what we do .
I think the e-mails between us and Justin would be something along the lines with “ what ’s up with the scraper that is going berserk ” or “ what the fuck is up with that filerights - shit ? ” ..
I think it ’s amazingly funny if the MPAA bought information like that , expensively , and against the US law .
Only proves their stupidity and that they have no case . ”
The Pirate Bay has always been one of the main targets of the MPAA .
In 2006 , John Malcolm , Executive Vice President of the MPAA wrote a letter to Sweden ’s State Secretary in which he urged the authorities to take action against the site : “ It is certainly not in Sweden ’s best interests to earn a reputation among other nations and trading partners as a place where utter lawlessness with respect to intellectual property rights is tolerated . ”
It is of course interesting to see that the MPAA is interested in the identities of the Pirate Bay founders , but they could have easily done a Google search , because that info is pretty much public information .
I guess they rather use a hacker .
The Pirate Bay website is offline at the moment , unrelated to this news , as they are doing some server maintenance and site upgrades .
They will be back soon .
This week the world learned that economic " decoupling " from America is a myth .
The next lesson to re-learn is that the Federal Reserve 's monetary mistakes have global consequences , and that one result of the Fed 's great dollar miscalculation this decade has been a dangerous breakdown in world monetary cooperation .
Look no further than the European Central Bank , which was notably absent when the Fed made its emergency rate cut amid falling global stocks on Tuesday .

WIMBLEDON , England -- Rafael Nadal , grass stains on his white shirt and a Spanish flag tucked under his arm , scampered through the Centre Court stands to celebrate his first Wimbledon title with hugs and handshakes .
Roger Federer sat in his changeover chair , protected from the night 's chill by his custom - made cream cardigan with the gold " RF " on the chest .
Alone with his thoughts , alone with the knowledge that he had come so close to becoming the first man since the 1880s to win a sixth consecutive championship at the All England Club .
Two points from victory , the No. 1 - ranked Federer could n't pull it out , instead succumbing to No. 2 Nadal 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 7 ( 5 ) , 6 - 7 ( 8 ) , 9 - 7 Sunday night in a 4 - hour , 48 - minute test of wills that was the longest men's final in Wimbledon history -- and quite possibly the greatest .
Even Nadal felt sympathy for Federer .
" I am very happy for me , " Nadal said , " but sorry for him , because he deserved this title , too . "
Rafael Nadal prevailed 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 ,
6 - 7 ( 5 ) , 6 - 7 ( 8 ) , 9 - 7 in the longest final in Wimbledon history .
Alessia Pierdomenico - Pool / Getty Images
Through rain , wind and descending darkness , the two greatest players of their generation swapped spectacular shots , until , against a slate sky , Nadal earned the right to fling his racket aside and collapse on his back , champion of the All England Club at last .
" Is impossible to explain what I felt in that moment , no ? " Nadal said after accepting the golden trophy that has belonged to Federer since 2003 .
The first man since Bjorn Borg in 1980 to win Wimbledon and the French Open in the same year , Nadal stopped Federer 's streaks of 40 victories in a row at the All England Club , and a record 65 in a row on grass , thereby stamping his supremacy in their rivalry , no matter what the rankings say .
" Probably my hardest loss , by far , " Federer said .
" I mean , it 's not much harder than this right now . "
No man since 1927 had come back to win a Wimbledon final after losing the first two sets , and none had overcome a match point to seize victory since 1948 .
If anyone could , it figured to be Federer , especially on this particular lawn .
He had n't lost a match on grass since 2002 , and he had n't lost a set during this tournament before Sunday .
He also had n't faced anyone nearly as talented and indefatigable as Nadal .
" Look , Rafa 's a deserving champion , " Federer said .
" He just played fantastically . "
Indeed he did , earning Spain its first Wimbledon men's title since Manolo Santana won in 1966 .
Nadal managed to regroup after blowing a two - set lead , managed to recover after wasting two match points in the fourth - set tiebreaker , managed to hold steady when Federer needed only two points to end the match while ahead 5 - 4 in the fifth .
It is with some trepidation that I go to buy my ticket to this year 's european GNOME conference , GUADEC .
Decadence \ De*ca " dence\ , Decadency \ De * ca " den*cy\ , n .
[ LL . decadentia ; L. de- + cadere to fall : cf. F. décadence .
See Decay . ]
A falling away ; decay ; deterioration ; declension .
" The old castle , where the family lived in their decadence . "
-- Sir W. Scott .
[ 1913 Webster ]
Take a look at the list of slated talks .
What is your general impression ?
Mine is of a large project in a state of marginal returns , in which a larger and larger part of the effort goes to maintenance .
On the one hand you have the large deployments , the integration with other software projects .
On the other hand the new developments that we have are very careful not to bite off too much : a printing dialog ; another revision of ekiga ; a new image library .
Ed : Ekiga was probably not a good example of this .
The problem , as I see it , is that GNOME is in a state of decadence -- we largely achieved what we set out to achieve , insofar as it was possible .
Now our hands are full with dealing with entropic decay .
Take , for example , Evolution 's random walk to improvement .
In most releases it 's better , in a few it 's worse , but basically it still works fine , and has been that way since about 3 or 4 years ago .
It 's like , welcome back to 1984 's Macintosh plus interweb .
We did it !
Seriously though , it does not seem to me that GNOME is on a healthy evolutionary track .
By that I mean to say that there is no way there from here , if " there " is universal use of free software , and " here " is our existing GNOME software stack .
The evolutionary thing to do would be to do something web - like , because that 's where all of the programmers are these days .
But that 's not part of our culture .
Until recently , with WebKit / GTK , it was n't part of our software stack either -- all of the new web platform bits were dribbled to us over the wall from Mozilla , or embedded within GNOME as Firefox .
The other side of that is that while the web will be a core part of the computing future , it 's not clear that swallowing it wholesale is the best strategy for client development .
There are too many things that local computing offers : other software paradigms ( emacs , unix , independence ) , unmediated input ( sound , video , alternate input devices ) , direct access to powerful output devices ( control part or the entirety of a screen , access the underused GPU ) .
But even if we eschew " going with the flow " - style evolution , it 's not like GNOME is on a revolutionary track which will win in the end with its compelling UI or programming - linguistic metaphors .
The screen is still constructed as a static landing strip on which the mouse pointer might alight , an array of possibilities necessarily constricted by decontextualized space .
The metaphors are the same : file , folder , desktop , even as these things cease to exist for many people .
And techologically , we do n't even have a way of considering how the visual elements of space might be anything other than static , much less have any way of interacting with those elements other than the impoverished point and click .
What we 're left with is the GUI equivalent of chartjunk .
There are exceptions to this story .
There 's Clutter , which I expect will be the " way out " both for GTK + and for GNOME .
( I know there are technological differences with other canvas models , but at least they have the hackers and the maintenance resources . )
There 's Moonlight , which is interesting and hacked by very smart folk , but whose fortunes are too bound to Microsoft .
There are heroic retrofix efforts like MPX , not really a part of GNOME .
But other than that , we have the decay of slavish adherence to the HIG , the logout dialog , the wallpaper chooser , the last - percent efforts of refining an increasingly irrelevant stack of software .
The GTK + maintainers are well aware of the decadent state of GTK + , and are moving as much as possible to plug the leaks .
But it is no longer a nimble codebase , and will take at least 6 and possibly 12 months before a 3.0 release can come out .
And that 's just stopping retrograde motion ; actual construction must take place outside of the " core " until the core is ready for it .
This disenchantment is personal as well : among other things , I 've spent thousands of hours on bindings to GNOME libraries , and just now when I am ready to make an API and ABI stable release , I just do n't feel like packing another button into another hbox .
Anyway , I 'm buying my ticket , but mostly for the hallway track -- GNOME folks are smart and kind , and I want to see what 's going on , what people are really thinking about .
Istanbul ho !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A
House panel weighed overturning the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy Wednesday , the first time Congress has considered the rule since it was implemented 15 years ago .
The policy , adopted in 1993 , allows gay and lesbian individuals to serve in the armed forces as long as they do not publicly engage in homosexual behavior .
The law also prevents military leaders from asking a service member about his or her sexual orientation .
Congress implemented the " do n't ask , do n't tell " law after President Clinton backed away from a plan to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military .
The armed forces ' most senior officers resisted the plan , saying they feared that homosexuals would disrupt unit cohesion and morale .
The House Armed Services Committee 's subcommittee was considering a bill by Rep. Ellen Tauscher , D - California , that would repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " law .
A recent Washington Post / ABC
News poll found that 75 percent of respondents supported allowing gays to serve openly in the military , up from 62 percent in 2001 and 44 percent in 1993 .
Rep. Susan Davis , the California Democrat who chairs the subcommittee , said , " many Americans who happen to be gay or lesbian want to answer our nation 's call to service , and allowing them to serve in an open and honest manner would uphold the ideals of military service . "
Do n't Miss
During the hearing , two gay former service members -- former Navy Capt .
Joan Dorrah and former Marine Sgt. Eric Alva -- testified against the current law , arguing that unit cohesion would not be hurt if homosexuals served openly .
Alva , a 13 - year Marine veteran , was one of the first service members wounded in the Iraq war and lost a leg .
He said his unit 's ability to function was not hurt when other service members learned of his orientation .
" My being gay , and even many of my colleagues knowing about it , did n't damage unit cohesion , " Alva said .
" They still put their lives in my hands , and when I was injured , they risked those lives to save mine . "
Retired Army Maj. Gen. Vance Coleman , a black man who joined the Army when it was segregated , testified that the current treatment of gays and lesbians is similar to how African - Americans were treated before President Truman integrated the military in 1948 .
" I know what it is like to be thought of as a second - class citizen , and I know what it is like to have your hard work dismissed because of what you are or what you look like , " Coleman said .
Coleman said the nation 's security was hurt because gay and lesbians were either dismissed from the service or were reluctant to join the military , noting that five dozen Arabic language experts have been dismissed .
" ' Do n't ask , do n't tell ' hurts our military readiness , " Coleman said .
" It undermines our commitment to being a nation where we are all equal in the eyes of the law .
And it ties the hands of commanders who want to welcome and retain America 's best and brightest into the military fold . "
But Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness said that allowing gays to serve openly in the military would be disruptive .
She said service members often have to live in close quarters while on tour , which would open them to " inappropriate passive / aggressive actions common in the homosexual community , short of physical touching and assault . "
" Such a policy would impose new , unneeded burdens of sexual tension on men and women serving in high pressure working conditions , far from home , that are unlike any occupation in the civilian world , " Donnelly said .
Brian Jones , a retired sergeant major in the Army , also argued that allowing gays to serve publicly could hurt recruiting .
" Allowing homosexuality in the military would cause unnecessary sexual tension and disruptions to good order , morale , discipline and unit cohesion , " Jones said .
" This would erode the very qualities of military service that presently appeal to potential recruits . "
Davis argued that the portions of the military code that cover sexual conduct of service members would also cover homosexual activity and that any inappropriate conduct by an openly gay individual would be punished by commanders .
Tauscher said she did not expect her bill repealing the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy to pass this year because of opposition from the current administration , The Associated Press reported .
" We need a new president in order to get this passed , " Tauscher said , referring to presumed Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama , the AP reported .
The presumed Republican presidential nominee , Sen. John McCain , supports keeping the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .

The two churches are architectural jewels in the heart of Rome
The diocese of Rome has banned filming in its churches of the prequel to the Da Vinci Code , a popular book and film that has angered many Catholics .
Producers of Angels and Demons were turned down because the film " does not conform to our views " , a spokesman for diocese told AP news agency .
The Da Vinci Code in 2006 was based on the idea that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and had children .
It also depicted a conservative Catholic movement as a murderous cult .
Release date
The diocese of Rome said it had barred the producers from filming in its two famous churches of Santa Maria del Popolo and Santa Maria della Vittoria in the heart of the Italian capital .
" It 's a film that treats religious issues in a way that contrasts with common religious sentiment , " Monsignor Marco Fibbi , the diocese spokesman , told AP .
" We would be helping them create a work that might well be beautiful but that does not conform to our view , " he added .
Angels and Demons , directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks , is expected to be released next year .

Rack はRubyのためのWebサーバインターフェイスだ。
Ruby でWebっていうとRailsが有名だけど、実はRails以外にもいろんなRuby用のWebアプリ用フレームワークが存在する。
Ramaze
Merb
Camping
Waves
などなど … 。
一方Webを実際に動かすに はWebサーバが必要だ 。Rubyのため のWebサーバも、これまたいろんなものがある。
Apache ( CGI , FastCGI ..)
WEBrick
Mongrel
Ebb
Thin
などなど … 。
ここで問題が一つ。それは 「 フレームワークが増えるたびに、いろんなサーバをサポートするためのコードが必要になる」ってとこだ。
各フレームワークの作者がみんなそれぞれにCGIやMongrelに対応するためのコードを書いてるなんて、無駄だと思わないか？
Rack はWebアプリ用のフレームワークと、Webサーバの間を取り持ってくれるライブラリだ。
[ ブラウザ ] [ Webサーバ ] [ フレームワーク ]
* IE * Apache * Ramaze * Firefox <=> * WEBrick < => [ Rack ] < => * Merb < => [ Webアプリ ] * Safari * Mongrel * Camping * ... * ... * ...
フレームワーク作者 はRackにだけ対応しておけば、Apache/WEBrick/Mongrelなど
いろんなサーバがすぐに使えるようになる。逆にWebサーバの作者も、 Rackにだけ対応しておけばRack/Merb/CampingなどいろんなWebアプリ用フレームワークから すぐに使ってもらえるようになる。
というわけで、これか らRuby用のWebアプリ用フレームワークやWebサーバを書こうとするなら Rackは間違いなくチェックすべきライブラリだ。 そうでなくて、単にWebアプリを作りたいだけの場合でも、「超シンプルなWebアプリ用 フレームワーク」としてRackを使うという選択肢もあるだろう。

まずはインストール 。
$ gem install rack
hello.rbを用意。
require ' rubygems ' require ' rack ' class HelloApp def call ( env ) [ 200 , { " Content - Type " => " text / plain " } , [ " Hello , Rack " ] ] end end
hello.ruを用意。

どう、簡単でしょう ？
rackupのオプションでポートとかサーバとかいろいろ設定できる。詳しくは rackup -- help で。
Rackの思想
「 Webアプリって要するにリクエストをレスポンスに変換するだけの関数だよねー 」 ってのがRackの基本っぽい。
なので、
env( 環境変数のハッシュ ) を受け取っ て
ステータスコード とHTTPヘッダとHTTPボディを返す
ような関数を書け ばWebアプリになります。
だけどこのままだとさすがに使いにくいんで、
Rack :: Request とRack :: Responseという補助クラスも用意されています。 これを使うと、「 Webアプリ＝RequestをResponseに変換する処理」となる。
ミドルウェ ア
Rackではさらに、「 Responseを別のResponseに変換する処理」も扱えるようになっています。例えば ruファイルで
require ' hello ' use Rack :: ShowExceptions use Rack :: CommonLogger use Rack :: Auth : : Basic { |user , pass| user == ' alibaba ' and pass == ' open sesame '} run HelloApp.new
のように書くと 、Webアプリで起きた例外を綺麗に表示してくれたり、Apache形式のログを出力したり、Basic認証をかけてくれたりします。
つまり、ラック(棚)にサーバを追加するみたいに機能を追加することができる。

Pelosi says House Judiciary may hold hearings on Kucinich impeachment resolution
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) said this morning that the House Judiciary Committee may hold hearings on an impeachment resolution offered by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) .
Kucinich is expected to offer a " privileged resolution " this afternoon calling on the House to look at whether President Bush should be removed from office for lying to Congress and the American public when he sought congressional approval back in 2002 for taking military action to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein .
Pelosi has said previously that impeachment " was off the table , " so her comments this morning were surprising , and clearly signaled a new willingness to entertain the idea of ousting Bush , although no one in the Democratic leadership believes that is likely since the president has only six months left in this term .
" This is a Judiciary Committee matter , and I believe we will see some attention being paid to it by the Judiciary Committee , " Pelosi told reporters .
" Not necessarily taking up the articles of impeachment because that would have to be approved on the floor , but to have some hearings on the subject . "
Pelosi added : " My expectation is that there will be some review of that in the committee . "
A spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee had no immediate comment when asked whether Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) , the panel 's chairman , planned hearings on Kucinich 's impeachment resolutions .
Update : Conyers said he had just gotten Kucinich's new impeachment resolution , and he was not sure of when hearings would occur , or what kind of hearings be held .
Democratic aides said they would examine " abuses of power " by the Bush administration , although it is unclear why or how that is different from what has taken place already throughout the 110th Congress .
One thing is clear , however — there will be no move to remove Bush from office , despite Pelosi 's comments this morning , or Kucinich 's resolution .

Internet " e- mail marketer " e360 insight has had a rough time of it in the courts .
The company first came to the public 's attention when it sued to try to knock spam blacklist provider Spamhaus off the Internet , an attempt that was ultimately thwarted .
e360 insight 's latest attempts to further its business through the courts has now been dismissed , as a judge has ruled that Comcast 's decision to filter e-mails sent by the company is perfectly legal .
The case centered on what has become an increasing fact of life for the Internet service business ; over 90 percent of the mail that reaches Comcast 's servers is spam , and the company filters out half a billion e-mails daily .
Each of the filtered mails prompts a return mail to the sender , notifying them of Comcast 's spam policies .
e360 insight sued to have this policy terminated , and asked for $ 500,000 compensation in addition to damages .
They argued that they were n't actually a spammer , as they used opt - in / out mailing lists , making Comcast 's filtering an unlawful interference with their business .
The suit included a number of other claims , including the suggestion that Comcast 's response e-mails constituted a denial - of - service attack .
Judge James Zagel of the US District Court of Northern Illinois found none of e360 insight 's arguments compelling .
The key part of his decision was based on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , termed the " Good Samaritan provision . "
This provision explicitly protects any Internet service provider from liability for , " any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene , lewd , lascivious , filthy , excessively violent , harassing , or otherwise objectionable , whether or not such material is constitutionally protected . "
Judge Zagel 's analysis seemed grounded in real - world experience .
The second sentence of the decision notes that , " Some , perhaps even a majority of people in this country , would call it [ e360 insight ] a spammer . "
He also notes that the fact that Comcast 's filtering software might make mistakes is precisely why Section 230 was crafted : " Congress , and , I think , everyone else who studied the issue understood that blocking software would probably block too much . "
Given that , the only way to find Comcast liable was to find that they did not act in good faith , and Zagel concluded that e360 insight had n't offered sufficient evidence to support such a finding .
The judge also dismissed the denial of service claim , suggesting that e360 insight brought the problem on itself : " it is e360 's choice to submit very large numbers of e-mails for transmission which , after the first Comcast block , it should have known of this possibility and been prepared for it . "
Section 230 has been somewhat controversial , given that extreme interpretations of it could be used to justify either ISPs doing nothing about fraudulent materials flowing across their networks or to justify blocking protected speech .
This decision shows that a reasonable reading of both the intent behind the law and the facts of the case can actually help ensure a less painful Internet experience .
The SEC today announced adoption of a final rule making important — and , in my opinion — long overdue changes to Rule 14a - 8 ( the shareholder proposal rule ) .
Before today 's amendments , under Rule 14 a –8 ( b ) ( 1 ) , a shareholder - proponent must have owned at least 1 % or $ 2,000 ( whichever is less ) of the issuer ’s voting securities for at least one year prior to the date on which the proposal is submitted .
Per Rule 14 a –8 ( c ) , the proponent may only submit one proposal per corporation per year .
The proponent may continue to submit the same proposal to the same firm year after year in the hopes that it will eventually be adopted by the shareholders , provided the proposal annually receives a specified level of support .
Under Rule 14 a–8 ( d ) , a proposal and any accompanying supporting statement may not exceed 500 words in length .
There are a number of substantive grounds on which a proposal may be excluded from the company 's proxy statement , which I detail in my book Corporate Law ( Concepts and Insights ) .
Absent Rule 14–8 , there would be no vehicle for shareholders to put proposals on the firm ’s proxy statement .
Shareholders ’ only practicable alternative would be to conduct a proxy contest in favor of whatever proposal they wished to put forward .
The chief advantage of the shareholder proposal rule , from the perspective of the proponent , thus is that it is cheap .
The proponent need not pay any of the printing and mailing costs , all of which must be paid by the corporation , or otherwise comply with the expensive panoply of regulatory requirements .
As I explained in my article , Revitalizing SEC Rule 14a - 8 ’s Ordinary Business Exclusion : Preventing Shareholder Micromanagement by Proposal , 85 Fordham L. Rev. 705 ( 2016 ) :
The shareholder proposal rule long was a tool mainly of gadflies and social activists .
Shareholder proposals were rare and almost uniformly defeated by wide margins .
The process thus “ amounted to little more than a nuisance for corporate management . ”
Much of the law governing shareholder proposals developed during this period in which the stakes were low .
In contrast , today the stakes are quite high .
The volume of shareholder proposals has increased dramatically over the last two decades .
Proponents are no longer just gadflies and social justice warriors , but rather now include major institutional investors such as hedge funds and union and government pension funds .
Although most proposals still fail to receive majority shareholder support , a growing number do .
This is true not only for laggard firms , but increasingly even for successful ones .
As a result , all corporate directors and managers now must take shareholder proposals quite seriously .
Simultaneously with the rising volume of proposals came a dramatic shift in their subject matter .
Historically , most shareholder proposals focused on issues of corporate social responsibility .
Over the last two decades , however , a growing number of proposals focused on corporate governance questions .
Today , many proposals address issues traditionally regarded as board or management prerogatives , as a substantial number effectively seek to manage or even micromanage corporate decisions .
This shift has become especially prominent in the growing use of shareholder proposals by hedge funds seeking to effect changes in management personnel or corporate strategy of targeted companies .
Rule 14a - 8 was never intended to permit shareholders to micromanage a corporation .
But that is , increasingly , what activist shareholders are trying to use it to do .
The SEC's Adopting Release is best described as prolix .
One hundred and ninety five pages to adopt amendments that total four and a half pages .
As those who labor in this vineyard know , however , the SEC was reprimanded by courts repeatedly in the years 2005 - 2012 for adopting rules without a sufficient evidentiary basis and / or a sufficiently detailed cost - benefit analysis :
The United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia , the country ’s most important administrative law court , has told the S.E.C. that it has a “ statutory obligation to determine as best it can the economic implications of the rule . ”
Between 2005 and 2012 , the court consistently reversed the agency for not conducting an adequate cost - benefit analysis of the rules it proposed .
The court said , for example , that the S.E.C. had “ inconsistently and opportunistically framed the costs and benefits ” of its 2010 proxy access rule , a major agency initiative , and had “ failed adequately to quantify the certain costs or to explain why those costs could not be quantified . ”
For a 2005 mutual fund governance regulation , the agency had failed to adequately apprise itself of “ the economic consequences of a proposed regulation before it decided whether to adopt the measure . ”
Of late , the SEC has been trying to avoid that problem by explaining its actions at interminable length .
In any event , the amendments make several key changes — almost all procedural , rather than substantive — that limit who can make proposals but do not change the subject matters to which proposals can be addressed :
Amend the criteria that a shareholder must satisfy to be eligible to have a proposal included in a company ’s proxy statement .
A shareholder now must demonstrate continuous ownership of at least :
$ 2,000 of the company ’s securities entitled to vote on the proposal for at least three years ; $ 15,000 of the company ’s securities entitled to vote on the proposal for at least two years ; or $ 25,000 of the company ’s securities entitled to vote on the proposal for at least one year .
Aggregation of holdings for purposes of meeting the ownership requirements will no longer be permitted .
Modify the rule limiting the number of proposals that may be submitted for a particular company ’s shareholders ’ meeting ( the “ one - proposal rule ” ) to establish that a single person may not submit multiple proposals at the same shareholders ’ meeting , whether the person submits a proposal as a shareholder or as a representative of a shareholder .
Under the existing rule , some activists tried to get around the one proposal per company limit by advancing a proposal in their own name while advancing a second proposal purportedly while acting as a representative of another shareholder .
The change shuts down that loophole .
The proponent must state in writing that it is available to meet with company management ( at the latter 's option ) at specified times not less than 10 days or more than 30 days after the proposal is submitted .
This is purported to increase the likelihood of shareholder - management engagement .
Revise the levels of shareholder support a proposal must receive to be eligible resubmit the same proposal at the same company ’s future shareholders ’ meetings .
A shareholder proposal will be excludable from a company ’s proxy materials if it addresses substantially the same subject matter as a proposal , or proposals , previously included in the company ’s proxy materials within the preceding five calendar years if the most recent vote occurred within the preceding three calendar years and the most recent vote was :
• Less than 5 percent of the votes cast if previously voted on once ;
• Less than 15 percent of the votes cast if previously voted on twice ; or
• Less than 25 percent of the votes cast if previously voted on three or more times .
Predictably , these rather modest changes have produced ferocious complaints from activist shareholders and their allies in both the academy and politics .
Consider , for example , the complaints from SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee ( Democrat ) :
Letters in opposition to these changes vastly outnumber those in support and evidence a stark division of views between shareholders and management .
It is true that the activist community put together a massive astroturf campaign to oppose the changes , but so what ?
The SEC does n't take polls to decide public policy .
... in connection with smaller shareholders , Main Street investors , who will be dramatically disadvantaged by the changes we adopt today .
Nonsense .
First , the previous $ 2,000 limit was adopted in 1998 and has never been adjusted for inflation :
Under the new rule , as long as the shareholder is a long - term investor , you actually need a smaller investment — in real dollars — than you did in 1998 .
In addition , the thresholds are set so low that owners of minuscule percentage of a company 's stock get to force a vote on their pet proposal :
While Commissioner Lee purportedly is concerned for the poor investor who must cobble together a few thousand dollars to make a proposal ( at the company 's expense ) , she knows full well that many — if not most — meaningful and substantive proposals these days come from certain subsets of institutional investors — " socially responsible " investment funds , religious investment funds , union pension funds , and the like — who typically hold many times the required amount of stock .
I must assume that Commissioner Lee also knows , although she does n't admit it , that the retail investors who do use the shareholder proposal are three longstanding gadflies who have abused the system for years ( charts from Proxy Monitor ) :
In fact , when you break it down , basically what Ms. Lee is doing here is protecting one person :
John Chevedden is an interesting fellow .
In any case , however , add in his less vigorous compatriots , Ken Steiner and James McRitchie , and the three of them " sponsored 38 % of all shareholder proposals . "
Why is Commissioner Lee so bound and determined to ensure that these three hobbyists get to keep being gadflies with no skin in the game ?

History
Adamantium is a virtually indestructible man-made steel alloy which does not occur in nature and whose exact chemical composition is a United States government classified secret .
Adamantium is not an element : its properties do not qualify it for any known space on the Periodic Table of Elements .
Rather , adamantium is a series of three closely - related compounds of Iron created through a secret process discovered by the metallurgist , Dr. Myron MacLain .
MacLain began experimenting with the process that creates adamantium as a young scientist in the employ of the United States government in the early 1940s .
By accident he created a special adamantium compound , which is more durable than any form of adamantium created since , and then through another accident , fused this adamantium sample he had created with a sample of an unknown metal catalyst and the metal which is now known to have been Wakandan Vibranium .
The result was the large rounded specimen of alloy which is the most virtually indestructible substance known to man .
This alloy specimen was given to Captain America to serve as his Shield .
The exact chemical composition of Captain America 's shield and the exact degree to which it is indestructible have never been determined , nor has MacLain or anyone else ever learned how to duplicate either the special adamantium compound used in the creation of the shield , which Is known as Proto - Adamantium , or the process which fused the Proto - Adamantium with the Wakandan Vibranium .
Over the following decades , MacLain experimented , attempting to duplicate the process that created adamantium .
Finally , in recent years , although he realized that he could never again create Proto - Adamantium , he succeeded in developing the process by which the substance known as True Adamantium is created .
True Adamantium is nearly as strong as the Proto - Adamantium used to create Captain America 's shield , and is , for virtually all practical purposes , indestructible .
The degree of indestructibility varies directly with the thickness of the adamantium .
A direct blow from
Thor 's hammer , Mjolnir , conveyed with the thunder god's full strength , will only slightly dent a solid cylinder of true adamantium .
A sufficient mass of adamantium could survive a direct hit from a nuclear weapon .
Adamantium is created through the mixing of certain chemical resins whose composition is a United States government secret .
For eight minutes after the resins are mixed , the adamantium can be molded into a particular shape as long as it is kept at a temperature of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit .
After this brief period , the process of creating adamantium is completed , and it is cured .
The extremely stable molecular structure of the adamantium prevents it from being molded further , even if the temperature remains high enough to keep it in liquid form .
Only a device called a “ Molecular Rearranger ” can alter the form of hardened adamantium .
The United States government has shared the secret of adamantium ’s composition with certain of its allies , and the secret has also fallen into the hands of various criminals , such as the Constrictor , who has made special weaponry from adamantium .
Wolverine possesses indestructible claws and skeleton of true adamantium that was bonded into his bones during Weapon X .
The outer portion of the robotic body of Ultron is also composed entirely of true adamantium , although Ultron 's inner mechanisms are not .
Adamantium is extraordinarily expensive to produce ,
Therefore , certain parties who wish to use adamantium on a large scale have resorted to utilizing a similar , but somewhat weaker compound similar to True Adamantium called Secondary Adamantium .
Although Secondary Adamantium is still far stronger than even titanium steel , it can be destroyed by sufficiently great amounts of force .
Blastaar 's energy discharges and the vibratory force created by the Overkill Horn have both proved able to destroy Secondary Adamantium , although they would probably have little or no effect on True Adamantium .
The sentient computer known as F.A.U.S.T. had a casing made of Secondary Adamantium , and the factory which housed it was also constructed to a large extent of Secondary Adamantium ; both have been destroyed .
The Red Skull and the Hate - Monger had a dome of Secondary Adamantium constructed to protect their Island fortress ; the dome was destroyed by the Overkill Horn and by powerful incendiary bombs .
Objects made of Adamantium
Objects made of Adamantium in the Marvel Universe include :
Some S.P.I.N.
Tech darts were tipped with adamantium needles .
The US Army used Adamantium bullets on the Hulk during his rampage of New York City .
Also a Nanotech carried cure for Gamma Mutation made by Doc Green .
Types of adamantium
Proto - Adamantium
Proto -Adamantium is the original Adamantium created by Dr. MacLain .
This is the Adamantium present in Captain America 's Shield .
It has never been recreated .
True adamantium
True Adamantium is the attempt at recreation of Proto - Adamantium .
It is nearly as strong / durable and is possible to be produced .
It is impossible to break .
It could withstand a nuclear bomb , though Thor with all his strength and Mjolnir has slightly dented a small cylinder of it .
Being this strong , it is very rare and expensive to create / manipulate and is top secret in the US government , though it has shared it with some of their " allies " .
Secondary adamantium
This type is much more easier to work with , making it much more cost effective though at the expense of its strength .
Someone with super - strength ( say the Hulk ) can break it or warp it .
Also referred to as Adamantium Steel .
Adamantium Beta
This was created by an experiment involving Wolverine .
As a side effect of bonding true adamantium with his bones , and his rapid healing ability there was a molecular change which has adapted adamantium to the biology of normal bone .
This Adamantium acts like a biological component , regenerating as his bones do .
Adamantium Allotropes
In X - Men # 191 , when confronting Wolverine , one of the Children of the Vault named Serafina claims that adamantium has thirteen allotropes , all of which are " unstable , and short - lived , but virulently poisonous " .
She throws a small device that clamps onto his claws and makes them glow green , claiming that it is " adamantium nine " .
This causes Wolverine to become stricken , incoherent and collapse .
Carbonadium
Russia wanted to create its own type of adamantium , and thus carbonadium was born .
This form of adamantium is not as durable as true adamantium , but it is also flexible .
For most purposes , however , carbonadium is still virtually indestructible .
Omega
Red is probably the best known to use this metal with his tentacles , which act as a conduit for his energy draining powers .
For more information see Carbonadium .
Like adamantium it is poisonous to the body without a healing factor .
Omega Red 's healing factor is not enough to keep the poison at bay , perhaps it is more potent than adamantium or Omega Red 's healing factor is less effective than Wolverine's .
Breaking the Unbreakable
Though adamantium is said to be unbreakable and indestructible , there have been instances when objects made of the metal have been damaged .
Images in Gallery .
Fatal Attractions
In in X - Men # 25 from the Fatal Attractions story arc , Magneto was able to remove the adamantium bonded to Wolverine by manipulating the metal and pulling it from his body through his skin .
Magneto's powers allow him to reshape and manipulate indestructible metals including adamantium .
Wolverine : The End
In Wolverine : The End , a tale that told about an elderly Wolverine in the future , some of Logan 's claws were broken .
How they got in this condition was never specified .
Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk
Ultimate Spinal Surgery
In the miniseries Ultimate Wolverine Vs Hulk , it appears like Hulk breaks adamantium when he rips the mutant in half .
Upon closer inspection and the application of a little logic , it 's becomes apparent that though Hulk did rip Wolverine apart , he did n't actually break adamantium .
For the clearest explanation as to why Wolverine 's spine , but not the adamantium , could be broken , read the following .
Satyrquaze says :
" As far as Hulk breaking Wolverine in half ... ( quick biology and metallurgy lesson here )
Despite propaganda saying otherwise , Wolverine 's skeleton is not completely coated with adamantium , if it were he could n't move .
Adamantium porously coats each bone individually ( and it would have to be porous because blood and oxygen is required to get inside the bone to the marrow for a person to live ) .
Also there is a malleable disc between each bone ( especially in vertebrae in the spine ) which allows freedom of movement along with joints and ligaments ( which would n't be coated in adamantium if Wolverine hopes to do things like walk , stand , move in the slightest ... ) .
Now what Hulk did was indeed rip Logan apart , but it 's most likely that Wolverine 's spine separated at it's weakest point ( the discs between each vertebra ) and everything tore apart quite easily from there .
So no , Hulk more than likely did n't break adamantium at all in this instance .
Not to say that he could n't if suitably pissed . "
Hulk can damage adamantium , or at least adamantium alloys ( as seen below ) , but he did not do so in this instance .
Adamantium Ball
In MARVEL TEAM-UP # 18 , Hulk fought the villain Blastaar in a factory built with an adamantium alloy ( not true admantium ) .
To defeat the enemy , he wrapped the metal around him , formed a ball , and threw him in the sea .
MODOK
In Incredible Hulk # 167 , the Hulk shatters MODOK 's armor , which is an alloy of adamantium ( but not true adamantium ) .
Anti-Metal
This rare substance also known as Antarctic vibranium can produce vibrations of a specific wave length that can liquefy all metal including adamantium .
Dogs of War
In Hulk : Future Imperfect # 1 , Maestro explains that he has created mechanical dogs ( Dogs o' War ) with jaws capable of crushing adamantium in 7.3 seconds .
That feat is never depicted on - panel .
Hulk destroys the robot canine .
Thor vs Hulk vs Statue
In a fight with the Hulk , Thor let loose and hit him with enough power to send him flying into a statue supposedly made of pure adamantium .
The base of the statue that Hulk slammed into was cracked and when the Hulk got to his feet and picked up the statue , pieces of it fell off where he grabbed it .
Captain America's Shield
Captain America 's shield , which is an adamantium - vibranium alloy , has been broken five times in the history of comics .
The Molecule Man once destroyed the shield ( along with Mjolnir , IronMan 's armor , and the Silver Surfer 's board ) by unmaking them on the molecular level .
Klaw and Dr. Doom ( both amped by the power of The Beyonder ) damaged the shield on separate occasions .
Thanos , wielding the Infinity Gauntlet , effortlessly shattered the shield with a backhand .
Finally , King
Thor destroyed the shield with eye beams in an alternate universe .
Guardians of the Galaxy
On the 31st century Earth that the Guardians of the Galaxy hail from there are several metals that are capable of piercing adamantium .
The Punishers of that era shot Vance Astro with a bullet made of Dragonite that punctured his adamantium body mesh .
Dragonite is said to be invented by the 26th century .
Omega Hulk
After an Extremis infused brain surgery gave rise to an all new and incredibly cunning as well as dangerous Hulk Persona ( Who may be , in point of fact , a precursor to the Maestro ) singlehandedly tore off a piece of pure raw adamantium ; an arm , from one of the original bodies of Ultron that was lingering within Kang the Conqueror 's citadel at the end of time .
Other Media
Liquid adamantium
In X - men Origins : Wolverine , they give Logan his adamantium skeleton .
In X - 2 : X - Men United , William Stryker 's lab is shown to have an adamantium infusion chamber where both Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike were created .
During the climactic battle , Wolverine defeats Deathstrike by pumping her full of liquid adamantium , which then hardens and causes her to sink into a vat of water .
The term “ exploitation ” typically conjures up images of horrendous working conditions , perhaps sweatshops in China or India , or the child labour used by Western clothes manufacturers .
We think of people working long hours for little pay in terrible conditions ruthlessly bullied by unscrupulous bosses or gangmasters .
Such “ exploitation ” is presented to us as exceptional – and contrasted with the “ normality ” of working life for most people , particularly in countries such as Britain .
Karl Marx had a different understanding of exploitation .
Rather than seeing it as exceptional , he argued that exploitation is fundamental to capitalism .
For Marx , exploitation was not just about the level of wages received , or working conditions , but was the very process whereby capitalism creates profit out of the work we do .
In order to understand what Marx meant by exploitation we need to start with his explanation of where profits ultimately come from – the “ labour theory of value ” .
Marx argued that human labour is the source of all value .
At the time many economists agreed with this .
But Marx went further – he argued that the amount of value created by people when they work is greater than the amount they receive back in wages .
Therefore the capitalist is stealing from workers some of the value that their labour has created .
This “ surplus value ” forms the basis of profit .
This argument is an anathema to any mainstream economist or commentator .
They generally accept that the world of work involves an equitable exchange – “ a fair day ’s pay for fair day ’s work ” .
If anything , we are told that workers are being “ greedy ” when they demand pay increases over and above what is considered “ fair ” .
Such “ selfish ” pay demands risk the “ health of the whole economy ” , they claim .
Fair ’s fair ?
But for Marx , this ideology of “ free and fair exchange ” masks the exploitation built into the capitalist system .
It hides the exploitation that goes on every day in a society where a tiny minority of people make vast profits out of the work done by the majority .
So how did Marx arrive at such a radical view ?
Capitalism was just developing when Marx was writing , but already he could see how different it was from previous societies .
For most of human history people had worked primarily for their own consumption .
They produced things that met their needs directly , whether it was food grown on their land or clothes they made at home .
In contrast , capitalism is all about commodity production – things are produced not for immediate use but as commodities to be sold on the market .
Commodities do have to be of some use eventually , but they have to be exchanged for money before the producers can get any benefit from their efforts .
Therefore all commodities have what Marx called an “ exchange value ” .
Their price reflects this exchange value .
But how is this exchange value determined ?
Marx argued that the one thing all the very different commodities bought and sold under capitalism have in common is that they are products of human labour .
It is this that provides the basis for exchange .
In previous societies , before money was universally used , people would swap or barter items with one another .
How much or how little was exchanged would generally depend on how long people had taken to make the items .
Two people would only swap items if they felt it had taken roughly the same amount of time for each to make their items – otherwise it would not seem like a fair deal .
It was not just an exchange of things that had taken place but an exchange of the labour time of the people involved .
The method of barter is obviously very time consuming and inefficient .
As commodity production increased , the use of money became more important as a way of equating different products .
Previously one table may have been swapped for two chairs based on the amount of labour time used .
Now one table may equal £ 10 , and therefore one chair would equal £ 5 .
The price charged still reflects the amount of labour time gone into making the product , but the use of money – since it can be exchanged for any commodity – cuts out the need for direct exchange between producers .
Money allows us to equate things that seem to have nothing in common , in terms of materials , how they have been made or their actual use .
Because of this money appears to be the goal of production under capitalism .
Acquiring it often feels like our own personal goal , since it will enable us to buy the things for a better life .
Therefore it can seem like money is the source of value .
But money only has value to the extent that it gives you a claim on the labour of others .
If you had stacks of money , but nothing was being produced , then it would be no use .
It is the common element of human labour that allows us to measure how much a particular commodity should be sold for on the market .
And it is this that Marx argued determines their value .
The price of a commodity reflects the labour time needed to produce it .
So far it still seems as if everyone is on a more or less equal footing .
But if all commodities are exchanged according to amount of labour needed to produce them , where does profit come from ?
The answer lies in the relationship between the capitalist and wage labour .
Under capitalism , our ability to work – Marx called this our “ labour power ” – is also a commodity to be bought and sold like everything else .
No secret
This is not a secret .
We talk of “ joining the labour market ” after finishing education .
We try to make ourselves more “ marketable ” to employers .
Workers sell their ability to labour ( their labour power ) to a particular employer or capitalist for an agreed price ( our wage ) .
Our labour power is extremely useful to the capitalist since it is able to create all sorts of products .
But how is its exchange value ultimately determined ?
The price of labour power is determined just like that of any other commodity .
It depends on the amount of labour required to produce it .
Now behind the term labour power lies a human being , although the capitalists often like to forget this .
So workers get paid enough money to keep them going .
You get enough money for food , the cost of your rent or mortgage , clothing and enough rest time to enable you to arrive at work each morning able to put in the required amount of effort and attention .
So what determines wages is the cost of living in a society .
You go to work where you create products for the capitalist .
In return you get money – your wage – with which you buy the different products you need to live , products that have themselves been created by other people ’s labour .
This still seems quite fair , since you get paid the amount needed to cover your cost of living .
But there is a difference between the amount you are paid for your labour power and the value that your labour creates when you work .
For example , it may only take four hours of society ’s total labour to produce the things you and your family require .
So by lunchtime , you have covered your wage and by rights you should go home .
But you do not stop work then .
You go back to work in the afternoon and perhaps do an eight hour day .
If four hours of your labour has created enough value to pay your wage , then the capitalist takes the next four hours of work from you for nothing .
Pocketing profits
In this example the capitalist is able to pocket a “ surplus ” of four labour hours a day from each worker .
This is what Marx called “ surplus value ” , which is the source of profit .
Your labour creates more value than the value of your labour power .
So exploitation is not an anomaly under capitalism – it is part of the normal workings of the system .
But there is another side to exploitation .
The problem for capitalists is that when they buy labour power , what they get are people who can think and act for themselves .
Most people do not go into work thinking their wages should just cover the minimum required to enable them to keep on working another day .
Instead we look at the tremendous wealth in society and think – rightly – that we are entitled to a better standard of living .
So there is a continual struggle over the cost of labour power .
Battles over pay break out regularly , especially at times when the real cost of living is going up .
If exploitation is crucial to capitalism , the logical conclusion is that an end to exploitation would require an end to capitalism .
But all the day to day battles over pay and conditions represent more limited battles against exploitation .
If we win some of these battles , it gives workers the confidence and strength to win more .
It also helps us to win the battle of ideas to convince people that we have to get rid of the whole system .
Marx ’s labour theory of value identifies labour as the source of value .
It exposes how capitalists steal part of the value that our labour produces .
But this theory is not just a commentary on the system we live under .
It is a weapon for workers who want to fight to get rid of the system of capitalism – and end exploitation forever .

A conference to plan the prosecution of President Bush and other high administration officials for war crimes will be held September 13 - 14 at the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover .
" This is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred , " said convener Lawrence Velvel , dean and cofounder of the school .
" It is , rather , intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up , to pursue the guilty as long as necessary and , if need be , to the ends of the Earth . "
" We must try to hold Bush administration leaders accountable in courts of justice , " Velvel said .
" And we must insist on appropriate punishments , including , if guilt is found , the hangings visited upon top German and Japanese war - criminals in the 1940s . "
Velvel said past practice has been to allow U.S. officials responsible for war crimes in Viet Nam and elsewhere to enjoy immunity from prosecution upon leaving office .
" President Johnson retired to his Texas ranch and his Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was named to head the World Bank ; Richard Nixon retired to San Clemente and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was allowed to grow richer and richer , " Velvel said .
He noted in the years since the prosecution and punishment of German and Japanese leaders after World War Two those nation 's leaders changed their countries ' aggressor cultures .
One cannot discount contributory cause and effect here , he said .
" For Bush , Richard Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and John Yoo to spend years in jail or go to the gallows for their crimes would be a powerful lesson to future American leaders , " Velvel said .
The conference will take up such issues as the nature of domestic and international crimes committed ; which high - level Bush officials , including Federal judges and Members of Congress , are chargeable with war crimes ; which foreign and domestic tribunals can be used to prosecute them ; and the setting up of an umbrella coordinating committee with representatives of legal groups concerned about the war crimes such as the Center for Constitutional Rights , ACLU , among others .
The Massachusetts School of Law at Andover was established in 1988 to provide an affordable , quality legal education to minorities , immigrants and students from low - income households that might otherwise be denied the opportunity to obtain a legal education and practice law .
Its founder , Dean Velvel , has been honored by the National Law Journal and cited in various publications for his contributions to the reform of legal education . #

University of Utah engineers took an early step toward building superfast computers that run on far - infrared light instead of electricity :
They made the equivalent of wires that carried and bent this form of light , also known as terahertz radiation , which is the last unexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .
" We have taken a first step to making circuits that can harness or guide terahertz radiation , " says Ajay Nahata , study leader and associate professor of electrical and computer engineering .
" Eventually -- in a minimum of 10 years -- this will allow the development of superfast circuits , computers and communications . "
Electricity is carried through metal wires .
Light used for communication is transmitted through fiberoptic cables and split into different colors or " channels " of information using devices called waveguides .
In a study to be published April 18 in the online journal Optics Express , Nahata and colleagues report they designed stainless steel foil sheets with patterns of perforations that successfully served as wire - like waveguides to transmit , bend , split or combine terahertz radiation .
" A waveguide is something that allows you to transport electromagnetic radiation from one point to another point , or distribute it across a circuit , " Nahata says .
If terahertz radiation is to be used in computing and communication , it not only must be transmitted from one device to another , " but you have to process it , " he adds .
" This is where terahertz circuits are important .
The long - term goal is to develop capabilities to create circuits that run faster than modern - day electronic circuits so we can have faster computers and faster data transfer via the Internet . "
Nahata conducted the study with two doctoral students in electrical and computer engineering : Wenqi Zhu and Amit Agrawal .

Developing Terahertz Technology
The electromagnetic spectrum , which ranges from high to low frequencies ( or short to long wavelengths ) , includes : gamma rays , X - rays , ultraviolet light , visible light ( violet , blue , green , yellow , orange and red ) , infrared light ( including radiant heat and terahertz radiation ) , microwaves , FM radio waves , television , short wave and AM radio .
Fiberoptic phone and data lines now use near - infrared light and some visible light .
The only part of the spectrum not now used for communications or other practical purposes is terahertz - frequency or far - infrared radiation -- also nicknamed T - rays -- located on the spectrum between mid-infrared and microwaves .
With so much of the spectrum clogged by existing communications , engineers would like to harness terahertz frequencies for communication , much faster computing and even for anti-terrorism scanners and sensors able to detect biological , chemical or other weapons .
Nahata says the new study is relevant mainly to computers that would use terahertz radiation to run at speeds much faster than current computers .
In March 2007 , Nahata , Agrawal and others published a study in the journal Nature showing it was possible to control a signal of terahertz radiation using thin stainless steel foils perforated with round holes arranged in semi-regular patterns .

This February , British researchers reported they used computer simulations and some experiments to show that indentations punched across an entire sheet of copper - clad polymer could hold terahertz radiation close to the sheet 's surface .
That led them to conclude the far - infrared light could be guided along such a material 's surface .
But the London researchers did not actually manipulate the direction the terahertz radiation moved , such as by bending or splitting it .
" We have demonstrated the ability to do this , which is a necessary requirement for making terahertz guided - wave circuits , " Nahata says .
Circuits : From Electrical to Optical to Terahertz
Wires act as waveguides for electricity .
Wires connect active devices such as transistors , which switch or adjust the electric signal .
That is the basis for how computers work today .
An electronic integrated circuit is a computer processor made of wires , transistors , resistors and capacitors on a semiconductor chip made of silicon .
In optical communications , the waveguides carry laser - generated light in fiberoptic cables and lines etched or deposited on an insulator or semiconductor surface .
Nahata says photonic integrated circuits now are used for phone and Internet communications , mainly for combining or " multiplexing " different colors or channels of light entering a fiber - optic cable and separating or " demultiplexing " the different wavelengths exiting the cable .
" Electronic circuits today work at gigahertz frequencies -- billions of cycles per second .
Electronic devices like a computer chip can operate at gigahertz , " Nahata says .
" What people would like to do is develop capabilities to transport and manipulate data at terahertz frequencies [ trillions of hertz . ]
It 's a speed issue .
People want to be able to transfer data at higher speeds .
People would like to download a movie in a few seconds . "
" In this study , we 've demonstrated the first step toward making circuits that use terahertz radiation and ultimately might work at terahertz speeds , " or a thousand times faster than today 's gigahertz - speed computers , Nahata says .
Channeling , Bending , Splitting and Coupling T - Rays
" People have been working on terahertz waveguides for a decade , " he says .
" We 've shown how to make these waveguides on a flat surface so that you can make circuits just like electronic circuits on silicon chips . "
The researchers used pieces of stainless steel foil about 4 inches long , 1 inch wide and 625 microns thick , or 6.25 times the thickness of a human hair .
They perforated the metal with rectangular holes , each measuring 500 microns ( five human hair widths ) by 50 microns ( a half a hair width ) .
The rectangular holes were arranged side by side in three different patterns to form " wires " for terahertz radiation :
One line of rectangles that served as a " wire " and carried terahertz radiation .
A line that becomes two lines -- like the letter Y -- to split the far - infrared light , similar to a splitter used to route a home cable TV signal to separate television sets .
Two lines that curve close to each other in the middle -- like an X where the two lines come close but do n't touch -- so the radiation could be " coupled , " or moved from one line or " wire " to another .
The straight pattern successfully carried terahertz radiation in a straight line .
The other two patterns " changed the direction the terahertz radiation was moving " by splitting it or coupling it , Nahata says .
The study showed the terahertz radiation was closely confined both vertically ( within 1.69 millimeters of the foil 's surface ) and horizontally ( within 2 millimeters of the pattern of rectangles as it moved over them ) .
" All we 've done is made the wires " for terahertz circuits , Nahata says .
" Now the issue is how do we make devices [ such as switches , transistors and modulators ] at terahertz frequencies ? "
When terahertz radiation is fed into the stainless steel waveguides , it spans a range of frequencies .
One frequency is guided across the steel surface .
That frequency is determined by the size of perforations in the foil .
The engineers chose a frequency they could generate and measure : about 0.3 terahertz , or 300 gigahertz .
Terahertz radiation is defined as ranging from 0.1 terahertz ( or 100 gigahertz ) to 10 terahertz .
The design of the waveguide means that it carries terahertz radiation in the form of surface plasma waves -- also known as plasmons or plasmon polaritons -- which are analogous to electrons in electrical devices or photons of light in optical devices .
The surface plasma waves are waves of electromagnetic radiation at a terahertz frequency that are bound to the surface of the steel foil because they are interacting with moving electrons in the metal , Nahata says .
Backing a major - party candidate for president would have been anathema to Michael Klonsky 40 summers ago , when the organization he led , Students for a Democratic Society , urged young people to spurn elections .
“ By ’ 68 , our line was ‘ Vote in the Streets , ’ ” Klonsky told me last spring .
“ We thought we had to fight with Eugene McCarthy and those people . ”
In August 1968 , protesters clashed with police outside the Democratic Party ’s national convention in Chicago — but far from being political innocents who took to the streets to protest Vietnam War hawks ’ capture of the Democratic presidential nomination , many of them never supported antiwar candidates McCarthy and Robert Kennedy .
“ Those of us who have been in the streets for the past five days did n’t give a flying fuck whether McCarthy would win or lose , ” SDS declared in posters around Chicago , “ and now that he ’s lost , still do n’t . ”
On the eve of the general election of that year — in which less than 1 percentage point would separate the popular - vote totals of Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey — Klonsky ’s SDS bluntly proclaimed : “ The elections do n’t mean shit . ”
Klonsky , whose disgust for mainstream politics led him to launch a new , Maoist Communist Party in the 1970s , today supports Barack Obama so enthusiastically that until recently he was blogging on the Illinois senator ’s campaign website .
And boycotting this November ’s election , Klonsky maintains , would be a “ tragic mistake . ”
He notes that Barack Obama is n’t Hubert Humphrey , 2008 is n’t 1968 , and the strong movement he served back then is “ relatively weak ” now .
“ My own support for Obama is not a reflection of a radically changed attitude toward the Democratic Party , ” Klonsky recently explained to me .
“ Rather , it ’s a recognition that the Obama campaign has become a rallying point for young activists and offers hope for rebuilding the civil rights and antiwar coalitions that have potential to become a real critical force in society . ”
Michael Klonsky is hardly the only ’ 68 radical supporting Obama this year .
In 1968 , when Mark Rudd organized the student strike that shut down Columbia University , the SDS chapter that he chaired ridiculed Kennedy and McCarthy as “ McKennedy , ” claimed that “ neither peace candidate offers an alternative to the war policies of Lyndon Johnson , ” and suggested “ sabotage ” as an alternative to voting .
Rudd succeeded Klonsky as national SDS leader , presiding over the organization ’s metamorphosis into Weatherman and performing “ a liaison function ” for the plot to bomb a Fort Dix soldiers ’ dance that instead killed three Weathermen , including two of Rudd ’s Columbia SDS colleagues .
Today , Rudd renounces bombs , embraces ballots — and supports Obama .
“ Probably the biggest difference between Columbia SDS people in 1968 and in 2008 is forty years , ” Rudd explained in an e-mail .
“ Most of us have lived with compromise our whole lives .
As kids we were raving idealists who thought that ‘ The elections do n’t mean shit ’ was a slogan that meant something to somebody .
It did n’t . ”
Then there ’s Carl Davidson , who was one of SDS ’s three elected national officers in 1968 , when the organization first urged young people to refrain from voting .
His disillusionment with traditional politics became so pronounced that , in the post - sixties hangover that followed , Davidson joined Klonsky in rejecting traditional politics for fringe Marxist movements .
More recently , he helped organize the 2002 rally in which Obama first spoke out against the Iraq War and now serves as the webmaster of Progressives for Obama .
“ The last thing we need is a simple repeat of 1968 , which saw Nixon and the new Right as an outcome , as well as the defeat of [ Humphrey ] , ” Davidson contends .
“ One thing I ’ve learned .
Social change is not made by elections , but it certainly proceeds through them , not by ignoring them or chasing the illusion of end runs around them . ”
Former SDS president Tom Hayden is also in the Obama camp .
Hayden organized the made - for - TV protest outside the 1968 Chicago convention .
But the catharsis of throwing debris at the Chicago police , the purer - than - thou sanctimony that tolerated no distinction between Lyndon Johnson and Eugene McCarthy , and the exhilaration of “ voting in the streets ” instead of in election booths combined to ensure liberal defeats .
Hayden ’s orchestrated anarchy proved more damaging to Humphrey ’s presidential aspirations than any dirty trick Nixon ’s henchmen could have dreamed up .
Klonsky remembers
Hayden plotting to spread nails on a highway ; another SDS leader recalls Hayden encouraging activists to firebomb police cars .
If the Democrats could n’t run a convention , many Americans wondered , how could they run the country ?
“ Did the radicalism of Chicago elect Richard Nixon ? ”
Hayden asked , clearly pained , in his 1988 memoir .
“ Having struggled with that question for twenty years , I find there is no ‘ neat ’ answer . ”
Now Hayden is one of the organizers of Progressives for Obama .
“ The difference is that back then the Democratic Party was directly carrying out the Vietnam War , which meant there was no anti-war critic to vote for after Kennedy was assassinated and McCarthy defeated by the establishment , ” he offered in an e-mail last month .
“ Today the Republican Party is directly carrying out the war , which obviously will make a lot of people favor changing the presidency despite the uncertainty of what the Democratic candidate will do when in office . ”
Progressives for Obama resembles a Who ’s Who of SDS luminaries .
In addition to Hayden , Rudd , and Davidson , the group includes Bob Pardun , SDS ’s education secretary during the 1966 – 67 school year ; Paul Buhle , a radical professor who has recently attempted to revive SDS ; Mickey and Dick Flacks , red - diaper babies who helped craft 1962 ’s Port Huron Statement , a seminal New Left document ; and SDS ’s third president , Todd Gitlin .
Age and experience have mellowed some of the SDSers in Obama ’s camp .
Gitlin , for instance , has evolved into a respected Ivy League professor and milquetoast liberal .
But others still glory in a past that can only damage Obama ’s future .
The aging New Left still practices a therapeutic politics that places a higher value on feelings of personal liberation than on restrained pursuit of political aims .
Obama has already taken political hits for his connection to Weathermen Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn .
In the sixties , Ayers advocated that young people kill their parents , and Dohrn praised the Charles Manson murders .
Alongside their Weather Underground cohorts , the pair declared war on the United States and participated in a bombing campaign that hit the Capitol , the Pentagon , and numerous law enforcement agencies .
The couple eventually reinvented themselves — first as academics , then as players in Chicago - area Democratic politics .
Obama praised Ayers ’s book in the Chicago Tribune , sat with him on a foundation ’s board , and benefited from a fundraiser held at the couple ’s home .
Ayers spoke at events organized by Michelle Obama ; Barack Obama spoke at events organized by Ayers .
With the public revelation of this unseemly relationship — between unrepentant terrorists and the man who now seeks to oversee America ’s war on terror — and the impact it ’s already had on voter attitudes , one would think that other sixties extremists might be more reserved in proclaiming their support for Obama , knowing the damage such associations can do to his candidacy .
As for Obama , he ’ll need to do some distancing of his own .
He protested that he was only eight when Ayers , Dohrn , Rudd , and company embarked on their bombing campaign , and that ’s reasonable enough .
But he ’ll need to go further .
Fortunately for him , the Left has a long history of cold - shouldering predecessors to perpetuate its ideology , cleanse it from past failures , and make it appear fresh .
The New Left dissociated itself from the Old Left ’s Russophilic dogmatism through the Port Huron Statement and other declarations of independence .
Even the phrase “ New Left ” was adopted to divorce the Left from its history .
SDS ’s history offers a template for eliminating the embarrassing past .
Jack London , Upton Sinclair , and others founded the Intercollegiate Socialist Society ( ISS ) during the Progressive era , but by World War I the word “ socialist ” had fallen from favor .
So , with the Left seeing labor unions as the agent of societal change , the ISS became the League for Industrial Democracy ( LID ) .
Then , by the end of the 1950s , theorists Herbert Marcuse , C. Wright Mills , and Norman O. Brown scoffed at the idea of blue - collar workers — often violently hostile to the Left ’s aims — as transformative agents , and the LID ’s student arm , the Student League for Industrial Democracy ( SLID ) , rechristened itself Students for a Democratic Society .
Just as SDS killed SLID as the fifties became the sixties , Weatherman killed SDS as the sixties became the seventies : SDS ’s spirit of “ participatory democracy ” could not peacefully coexist with the vanguardism of Weatherman .
And now , completing the circle , the SDS alumni of “ progressives ” for Obama resurrect a term that would have been more familiar to their distant forebears in the Intercollegiate Socialist Society .
On the Left , everything old is eventually new again .
In 1968 , the Left served as unwitting allies of Republicans , costing the Democrats the White House by rioting at their convention and withholding votes from Hubert Humphrey .
In 2008 , it is their vocal support that may cost Barack Obama the presidency .
Obama can take a page from the early days of the New Left , which — initially , at least — refused to allow discredited radicals to discredit it .
Either Obama publicly divorces himself from radical supporters whose association does more for them than it does for him , or he faces the prospect of Bill Ayers as his Willie Horton .
Honda staff say they can only eat certain types of chocolate
Staff at Swindon 's Honda factory say they have been banned from eating cakes and fruit in their break rooms .
They also claim they can only eat certain types of chocolate bars that do not contain a biscuit base .
Questionnaires are now being issued by the Unite union to consider what action staff should take .
A Honda spokesman said : " Our overall objective is to always deliver the highest quality product and we cannot compromise on achieving this . "
He added : " Therefore our company standards are an essential aspect of our business . "
Jim D'Avila of Unite told BBC
News : " They 've barred things like fruit or any product with a biscuit in it so it 's got to the ludicrous state where a Mars bar is ok but a Twix bar , because it has a biscuit base , is n't allowed .
" Frankly they 've lost the plot .
The vast majority of people just can't believe that the company are being so picky in what they 're doing . "
Digging of ' Snow White ' Begins
NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander began excavating a new trench , dubbed " Snow White , " in a patch of Martian soil near the center of a polygonal surface feature , nicknamed " Cheshire Cat . "
The " dump pile " is located at the top of the trench , the side farthest away from the lander , and has been dubbed " Croquet Ground . "
The digging site has been named " Wonderland .
"
The trench is about 2 centimeters (.8 inches ) deep and 30 centimeters ( about 12 inches ) long .
At this early stage of digging , the Phoenix team did not expect to find any of the white material seen in the mission 's first trench , now called " Dodo - Goldilocks . "
That trench showed white material at a depth of about 5 centimeters ( 2 inches ) .
More digging of Snow White is planned for coming sols , or Martian days .
Snow White was dug on Sol 22 ( June 17 , 2008 ) with Phoenix 's Robotic Arm .
This picture was acquired on the same day by the lander 's Surface Stereo Imager .

Industry experts say in the last three years companies like Anadarko Petroleum , Chesapeake Energy and Cabot Oil and Gas have leased up to two million acres for drilling in the region , half of that in the last nine months .
Whether their bets will pay off is by no means a sure thing .
Researchers at Penn State and the State University of New York at Fredonia estimate that the Marcellus has 50 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas , roughly twice the amount of natural gas consumed in the United States last year .
But government estimates of the amount of gas recoverable from the Marcellus are relatively modest .
Early test results have encouraged companies to keep drilling , but most are holding details of their test wells close to the vest .
The company that has done the most work is Range Resources of Fort Worth , which says it plans to invest at least $ 426 million in the Appalachia region this year .
The company has reported promising results from the first 12 wells that it has drilled horizontally , the technique considered by most experts to be the most effective in the Marcellus .
The most recent six have each produced more than three million cubic feet of production a day in recent months , and company executives say that is better than the average for wells recovering natural gas in the Barnett Shale in north Texas .
“ The Marcellus is important to Range and it could be important to the country but it really is still early , ” said Rodney L. Waller , a senior vice president at Range .
“ I can build you a scenario where it can be significantly better than the Barnett but it ’s a function of economics . ”

Energy experts say the Marcellus , along with other smaller shale formations being developed around the country , is coming under scrutiny at an opportune moment , just when conventional domestic natural gas production and imports from Canada are diminishing .
With easy - to - find gas fields in decline , the country will need to explore in deeper waters in the Gulf of Mexico and penetrate deeper under the surface on land .
The MDC has frequently complained of intimidation The US ambassador to Zimbabwe warned post-election violence is " spinning out of control " , as the government set a date for a second - round run-off .
James McGee told the BBC he had found evidence of " politically - inspired " violence against hundreds of people .
The diplomat warned the situation made it impossible for the second vote , set for 27 June , to be fair .
MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the first round , but not by enough to avoid a run-off with President Robert Mugabe .
The US ambassador said he had uncovered " firm evidence " of state - sponsored political bloodshed against supporters of Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) in the aftermath of the elections on 29 March .
The people who beat them up found their grandmother and hit this 80 - year - old woman in the head with an axe
James McGee
He told the BBC's Newsnight programme : " Violence is spinning out of control .
" Too many people have been killed , too many people have been maimed , too many people have been dislocated from their homes . "
He said the attacks involved " mainly beatings to the back and buttocks , we 've seen quite a few broken limbs , we 've seen cuts to the head " .
He also said he had met an elderly woman who had been struck with a hatchet .
" Her two grand - sons were activists with the MDC party , " said Mr McGee .
" They were beaten up and then the people who beat them up found their grandmother and hit this 80 - year - old woman in the head with an axe . "
' Unadulterated violence '
Mr McGee said he had met the victims on a fact - finding trip with British , Japanese , EU , Dutch and Tanzanian diplomats , during which he said they were harassed by police .
Along with so - called war veterans , he said they had evidence " police and military are involved in these attacks " .

It was " pure unadulterated violence designed to intimidate people from voting in the next election " , he said .
But the state - owned Herald newspaper poured scorn on the US ambassador 's claims in an editorial , accusing the US of trying to demonise Zimbabwe .
And Zanu - PF spokesman Bright Matonga told the BBC : " Let me make it very clear that the Zimbabwe government does not support any violence - whether by MDC or Zanu - PF . "
Mr Mugabe told a Zanu - PF meeting on Friday the party should have been more prepared for the election .
' Disastrous '
" Although the presidential result did not yield an outright winner , it was indeed disastrous , " he said .

Mr Tsvangirai told the BBC's Orla Guerin Zanu - PF had made " overtures " to the MDC about the possibility of a national unity government .
He has said he will contest the second - round vote , after originally threatening to boycott it .
Mr Tsvangirai has also accused Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party of a campaign of violence and torture against opposition activists , as well as vote - rigging .
The opposition leader has been out of Zimbabwe since the first - round vote because of alleged threats to his life .
But the MDC says he will return to address a rally in Bulawayo on Sunday .

What are these ?
Sony is getting ready to directly link its consumer electronics products and considerable movie and TV content libraries .
Later this year the company will begin providing video content to PlayStation 3 users via the recently - launched PlayStation Network , and will start a streaming video service for owners of Bravia TVs with a network connection .
" This continues to be one of the clearest opportunities for Sony to leverage its entertainment assets to differentiate its electronics products , " said Howard Stringer , chairman and CEO of Sony at a Tokyo news conference .
As part of the push the company will increasingly build Internet connectivity into its products .
By March 2011 , it plans to have network - enabled and wireless capable products available in 90 percent of its product categories , and aims to roll out the video services to key devices by the same date .
The PlayStation 3 , which shipped with an Internet connection from launch , is one of its most widely used network - capable products beyond PCs .
Around 50 million of the consoles are in the hands of consumers and just under 10 million accounts exist on its PlayStation Network , which is used largely for games .
" We have an enormous global installed base upon which we can build network services , " said Stringer .
" With the inclusion of our Blu-ray player , Wi-Fi and hard drive in every PS3 , I am confident that the PS3 is the network home entertainment server of the future . "
The next step in the roll - out will be to extend the PlayStation Network to personal computers and later to networked consumer electronics products like televisions and Blu-ray Disc players , many of which can already be hooked up to the Internet .
Portable devices like the video Walkman and Sony Ericsson cell phones will also be supported .
Before the PlayStation Network gets to televisions Sony will begin offering streaming content via Bravia Internet Video Link , an Internet contents service it launched in the U.S. in 2007 .
The Bravia service will launch in the U.S. later this year and in November Sony Pictures will offer the upcoming Will Smith movie , " Hancock , " at no cost to all Internet - connected Bravias before the movie 's DVD release .
" Sony now has the capability to deliver feature films and television shows of ours or our peers directly to consumer televisions across the open IP network outside the conventional satellite , cable or terrestrial distribution systems ...
This initiative is a clear but important glimpse into the future of home entertainment , " said Stringer .
For Sony the network strategy has been a long time coming .
Despite enjoying a position as one of the biggest creators of movie and television content in the world and one of its top consumer electronics companies , previous attempts to directly link with consumers , through services like Mora or Connect , have failed in part because Sony chose its own systems over those with wider support in the industry .
But the company 's reliance -- or insistence -- on its own technology has changed in the years since Stringer took over .
The new PlayStation Network service , for example , will use Marlin , an open digital rights management system that was developed by Sony , Panasonic , Samsung , Philips and Intertrust .
" We will embrace open standards to improve interoperability among all of our customers ' devices , " Stringer said .
Uh huh , right .
This from the guy who tells us the US has a strong dollar policy .
Are there other factors involved as well ?
Of course , but let ’s try living in the real world Hank , where the disastrous economic policies of Bush and the GOP have severely damaged the economy and the living quality for many Americans .
As Mark Twain said “ there are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies , and statistics . ”
Yesterday the New York Times published an article , " Return to Old Spy Rules Is Seen as Deadline Nears , " which allowed various Administration official to push their talking points supporting expanding their warrantless wiretapping powers .
The main focus of the talking points is to suggest that Congress faces a deadline in August 2008 due to the expiration of the Protect America Act , and must pass surveillance legislation before that deadline .
The talking points have been effective : " Even some Democrats , at odds with the White House for months over the surveillance issue , said they were worried about the summer situation . "
Yet , contrary to the government ’s fear mongering , America will have tremendous tools available to monitor terrorist threats in August 2008 and beyond .
Marty Lederman at Balkinization has provided an astute analysis of " What the FISA Debate is Not About " , also discussing what will happen in August .
PAA Orders Can Remain Valid Through February 2009
Under the Protect America
Act , orders expire one year from the date they are issued .
Given the Bush Administration ’s stance on surveillance , it would be shocking if the Administration did not re-issue orders in February 2008 , as it became clear that the Protect America
Act would expire .
The only reason for the Administration not to re-issue the PAA orders for another year would be a cynical attempt to manufacture an intelligence crisis .
Thus , the government should be able to freely conduct surveillance on Al Qaeda , Hamas , Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations through at least February 2009 .
Of course , it may be possible that the Government is so cynical as to refuse to get new order so that some PAA order will expire in August .
In such as case , the responsibility for any “ degradation ” of intelligence capacity lies firmly with the Administration .
Moreover , Congress can quickly resolve this issue by extending the existing PAA orders by six months .
The Government Can Still Wiretap Foreign - to - Foreign Communications
As reported by the Washington Post , " in response to a question at the [ American Bar Association ] meeting by David Kris , a former federal prosecutor and a FISA expert , [ Assistant Attorney General for National Security Kenneth ]
Wainstein said FISA 's current strictures did not cover strictly foreign wire and radio communications , even if acquired in the United States . "
As Deeplinks has previously discussed , Wainstein said that the current interpretation of FISA does not impede the interception of foreign - to - foreign telephone calls - even after the secret FISA court ruling that McConnell claims required the change in the law .
Thus , according to the Department of Justice 's own interpretation of FISA , the surveillance law does not require court orders for foreign - to - foreign phone calls , or any other communications where both ends are known to be overseas , even if the communication passes through a U.S. switch .
The Government does not need prepare individual warrants for surveillance of terrorism targets overseas .
The Government Can Wiretap Known Terrorists Calling to People in the United States , With an Easily Obtained FISA Order
Pursuant to FISA , the government can freely wiretap any “ agent of a foreign power , ” which includes those who “ engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefore . ”
Any one who the Intelligence Community has evidence is a terrorist is fair game , even if the terrorists are communicating with a United States person .
The FISA court approves almost every application put before it .
For example , the court granted all but four of 2,371 government requests in 2007 .
FISA Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth , has said he has approved FISA orders in minutes with only an oral briefing .
The Government Can Wiretap Overseas
Even without the Protect America Act , the Government may conduct surveillance where the collection occurs overseas .
Surveillance operations in Iraq or Afghanistan may continue unabated .
FISA only protects U.S. persons .
The Government Can Conduct Emergency Surveillance Without A FISA Court Order
Under FISA , surveillance can begin immediately and approval of the FISA Court can be obtained retroactively within three days .
FISA Will Remain Up To Date with Modern Technology
FISA has been updated more than 50 times since being enacted in 1978 , including several times after 2001 .
There is no new technology that evades FISA .
Iraqi critics say security firms act with little concern for civilian life
The US has agreed to scrap immunity for foreign security guards in Iraq , Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari says .
The US embassy in Baghdad has not confirmed the announcement , which comes as the US and Iraq are negotiating a controversial security pact .
Foreign firms employing thousands of guards won huge contracts in Iraq after the 2003 US - led invasion , but were not subject to Iraqi or US military law .
Iraqi frustration became fury last year when guards killed 17 people in a day .
Correspondents say a deal on scrapping contractors ' immunity brings the two countries closer to signing the long - term security pact .
The pact is meant to establish ground rules for a continuing US troop presence in Iraq after the UN mandate for foreign forces stationed there expires in December 2008 .
' Trigger - happy '
The firm involved in the 2007 killings - Blackwater , one of the biggest security contractors in Iraq and which protects US diplomats - says its guards were acting in self - defence .
Eyewitnesses say guards of a US diplomatic convoy started shooting without provocation .
The incident brought to the fore a long - standing Iraqi complaint that the guards were little more than trigger - happy mercenaries .
In addition to the immunity question , there are also discussions about the number of permanent US military bases in Iraq , immunity for the US military and its rights to detain and imprison Iraqi citizens .
BAGHDAD —
By the time American soldiers walked into Hadi al - Farji ’s darkened home , a half - dozen people had complained to U.S. Army Lt. Rusty Mason about the lack of infrastructure in their neighborhood .
Now Farji was going at it as well .
“ The power supply is really bad , ” said Farji , a judge who loves old Arabic poetry .
“ We barely get any power from the city , and the power we have from the generator is not enough to make even one refrigerator work .
“ When the British colonized Iraq they built something — power lines , a railroad .
What did the Americans build ? ” the judge persisted .
“ When Americans came here we hoped it would get better .
But it ’s been five years and we are still struggling . ”
Mason , who arrived in Baghdad ’s upscale Saidiyah neighborhood last fall , when streets here were ravaged by sectarian violence and abandoned by most of its residents , could barely contain his frustration .
“ In Saidiyah , it ’s easy to focus on the power because for the average person Saidiyah is safe .
But there are parts of other neighborhoods that do n’t have paved roads , let alone power , ” said Mason , a platoon leader in Alpha Company of the 4 - 64 armor battalion of the Fourth Brigade , Third Infantry Division .
The company has surrounded the neighborhood with a 12 - foot concrete wall and set up checkpoints , effectively putting an end to the sectarian violence that raged here .
“ It seems that they do n’t see all the things we do for them , ” he said .
That Saidiyah residents can complain about power , Mason said , is a measure of success and “ a sign of things being good in the community , ” whereas less than a year ago Sunni and Shiite militias showered each other with submachine - gun fire and dead bodies sometimes lay unclaimed in the rubble - strewn streets for days .
But on the other hand , Mason acknowledged , the lack of basic services in this neighborhood exemplified how little has changed for the better since American troops invaded Iraq in 2003 .
“ It ’s frustrating for me because I do n’t really see much improvement as far as power goes since we ’ve been here , ” he said .
In fact , basic services all over Baghdad have improved little , if at all , in the last two years .
In 2006 , Baghdad ’s neighborhoods got power four hours a day — one hour on , six hours off .
Many blocks have purchased generators to augment their electricity supply .
Today , some parts of Saidiyah get power four hours a day , according to Lt. Col.
Johnnie Johnson , the 4 - 64 battalion commander , but Farji ’s street had not received any electricity through the city ’s power supply in the last two weeks .
Residents there rely entirely on privately owned generators , which transmit power on no particular schedule two or three hours a day and charge about $ 12 per ampere .
A typical family , with an average monthly income of about $ 400 a month , spends about $ 65 each month on electricity .
“ Yesterday was a good day :
The power came on for two hours in the afternoon , then for an hour in the evening , and for 15 minutes at 4 a.m. , ” said Basem as - Zuwaidi , a chemical engineer who works for the Ministry of Industry .
“ Sometimes we only get one hour of power . ”
The water supply is equally inconsistent .
Baghdad residents use electric pumps to draw water from the city supply .
In some areas on Baghdad ’s outskirts people have no running water at all , Johnson said .
Trash pickup , which stopped shortly after the war began , is irregular or nonexistent , and varies from one neighborhood to the next .
In Saidiyah , garbage collection is more or less steady , but still not robust enough to remove discarded soda cans , rotting food , empty paint containers , plastic bags and scraps of paper and cardboard that line some streets .
A block away from Judge Farji ’s house , a car mangled by a roadside bomb sits on the curb , an unintentional monument to the neighborhood ’s violent past .
In other parts of the city , where no one regularly collects the trash , people are using the yards and rooftops of their neighbors ’ abandoned houses as impromptu landfills .
Plastic bags get stuck in sewage pipes , clogging them and causing waste to spill into city streets in putrid pools of green .
In some parts of the city , the pools have been stagnant for years .
Johnson accuses Sunni and Shiite militias , which target garbage collectors because they work for the Iraqi government , of sabotaging trash pickup .
“ If you have contractors hired to clean the road , and if they are threatened to not come back here , it ’s hard for us to get someone to come back to work , ” said Johnson .
Saidiyah residents acknowledge that , compared to the devastation that sectarian warfare wrought here a year ago , the neighborhood has improved significantly , even though occasional gunshots still puncture the air at night .
But they are impatient to see improvements in their lifestyle and miss the relative luxury of prewar times , when the area got power and water almost round the clock .
They see the current Iraqi government as largely powerless to improve their lives , and complain about contractors who are corrupt or incompetent .
Last week , for example , a contractor hired to upgrade decrepit power lines in one section of Saidiyah started digging for cables and punctured the pipe supplying water to the area , said Ali al - Ameri , the chairman of the Saidiyah neighborhood council , which has been trying to improve life and infrastructure in the area for months .
“ I think fixing these problems is very simple , ” said Faras al - Qabi , the secretary of the council .
“ All you need to do is to give money to contractors who wo n’t steal .
To tell you the truth , many of them do [ steal ] , ” he said .
“ Not all of them , but many of them . ”
Johnson , who attends most of the neighborhood council ’s meetings , said he is used to hearing Iraqis complain about poor infrastructure , and considers it a sign of their trust in what they see as the Americans ’ ability to make things work .
“ Because the government has been not as effective as it should be , we represent progress , ” Johnson said .
“ If they want something done quickly , they ask us .
Unfortunately , the power supply is not up to me .
The entire country is like this , and the Iraqi government has to fix it . ”

Add multitouch gesture support to a TouchPad - equipped laptop
Enable ' Three - Finger Swipe , ' and open - and close - pinch gestures using synclient and synthetic X events
Multitouch interfaces provide a great deal of benefits for integrating new interaction modes within applications .
Newer hardware and drivers on Mac OS X and Microsoft ® Windows ® allow for a variety of gestures beyond point and click that create more efficient application navigation .
This article provides tools and code needed to add some of this new gesture support on older Linux® - enabled hardware .
Building on the output of the synclient program , the Perl code presented here allows you to assign specific application functions to " Three - Finger Swipe , " as well as open - and close - pinch gestures .
Requirements
Hardware
The code presented here is designed for use with a computer equipped with a Synaptics TouchPad only and happened to be developed on an IBM ®
ThinkPad T30 .
You can find Synaptics touch - pads on many laptops ranging from Acer Aspires to Toshiba Tecras .
Consult the Related topics for a Synaptics TouchPad software project hardware compatibility list to see if you hit the jackpot .
Software
You need a modern Linux kernel with evdev support .
Fortunately , most modern distributions have this functionality built in .
Many distributions come with the Synaptics package as well , which includes synclient , used for monitoring Touch Pad events .
Fedora Core , for example , also includes the proper X Window System configuration to enable TouchPad usage with minimal modification by the user .
Other distributions , such as Ubuntu V7.10 , may require further configuration before the Synaptics package — installed with the command sudo apt - get install tpconfig — will work correctly .
Consult Related topics for more information on achieving basic functionality with Synaptics TouchPads under Linux .
You also need the Time : : HiRes module from CPAN to provide subsecond timing control for processing Touch Pad events .
In addition , you need the X11: : GuiTest module to send synthetic X Window events to applications .
See Related topics for these tools .
Ensuring basic functionality
If mouse control is enabled with the TouchPad , check for adequate multifinger detection for gesture support .
Run synclient -m 100 and try different touches on the TouchPad .
You should see output similar to the following .
Listing 1 . Example synclient -m 100 output
time x y z f w l r u d m multi gl gm gr gdx gdy 13.872 5680 4409 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00000000 0 0 0 0 0 14.891 1072 3945 28 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 00000000 0 0 0 0 0 14.994 3529 2667 104 2 5 0 0 0 0 0 00000000 0 0 0 0 0 15.605 3669 3667 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00000000 0 0 0 0 0 16.625 2628 2841 255 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 00000000 0 0 0 0 0 17.951 3117 2843 255 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 00000000 0 0 0 0 0 18.053 2902 3142 3 1 15 0 0 0 0 0 00000000 0 0 0 0 0 18.155 2430 3062 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00000000 0 0 0 0 0
Try one - , two- , and three - finger touches to make sure events are detected correctly .
Make sure the TouchPad can detect three fingers , as the first gesture to be added is " Three - Finger Swipe . "
Notice how the TouchPad picks up zero fingers , as well as the X and Y coordinate readings when pressing two fingers at widely varying spaces .
The processing script below makes use of some these characteristics to help detect open and close pinches .
Press Ctrl+c to exit the synclient program .
General program approach
Using syclient output for monitoring the TouchPad state is a simple and effective way for adding further interface options to Linux applications .
The gestureListener.pl program introduced below opens a pipe to read from the synclient program and processes the TouchPad events to detect gestures .
These gestures are linked with keyboard commands sent to the current in - focus application in X Window System .
Swipe gestures
The Three - Finger Swipe is a relatively simple gesture to detect , as it simply requires three fingers on the TouchPad moving left or right .
Listing 2 shows the beginning of the gestureListener.pl program required to begin processing the synclient output for gesture detection .
Listing 2 . gestureListener.pl program beginning
#!/usr/bin/perl -w # gestureListener.pl listens for pinch and swipe events use strict ; use Time : : HiRes ( ) ; use X11:: GUITest qw( : ALL ) ; my @xHist = ( ) ; # x coordinate history my @yHist = ( ) ; # y coordinate history my @xHistThree = ( ) ; # x coordinate history ( three fingers ) my $ lastTime = 0 ; # time monitor for Touch Pad event reset my $ eventTime = 0 ; # ensure enough time has passed between events my $ eventString = " default " ; # the event to execute my $ centerTouch Pad = 3000 ; my $ openSt = 1000 ; # start of open pinch my $ openEn = 500 ; # end of open pinch my $ closeSt = 1000 ; # start of close pinch my $ closeEn = 1000 ; # end of close pinch my $ synCmd = qq{synclient TouchpadOff=1 -m 10} ; my $ currWind = GetInputFocus ( ) ; die " could n't get input window " unless $ currWind ; open ( INFILE , " $ synCmd | " ) or die " ca n't read from synclient " ;
Note that the centerTouchPad variable and other parameters may require customization based on your specific Synaptics hardware or driver level .
The TouchPadOff=1 option to the synclient command turns off regular Touch Pad events .
The red " mouse stick " ( on ThinkPads and others ) is still available , as well as PS2 and USB mouse support .
Turning off the TouchPad is not necessary , but it reduces the problem of identifying nongesture - related mouse events from the swipes and pinches .
The call to GetInputFocus finds the current window identifier for the window in focus .
This allows the SendKeys command ( used later ) to send synthetic X Window events to the currently in focus window .
Listing 3 starts the main program loop and reads the synclient output .
Listing 3 . Main logic loop start
while ( my $ line = < INFILE >) { chomp ( $ line ) ; my ( $ time , $ x , $y , $ z , $f ) = split " " , $ line ; next if ( $ time =~ / time / ) ; #ignore header lines if ( $ time - $ lastTime > 1 ) { @x
Hist = ( ) ; @yHist = ( ) ; @x HistThree = ( ) ; }#if time reset $ lastTime = $ time ;
Resetting the event - detection history arrays at each timeout is critical to eliminating carry - over between Touch Pad gestures .
Listing 4 shows the beginning of the three - finger detection in the main program loop .
Listing 4 .
Three - finger processing
# three finger swipe detection if ( $f eq " 3 " ) { @xHist = ( ) ; @yHist = ( ) ; push @xHistThree , $ x ; if ( @xHistThree > 10 ) { my @srt = sort @xHistThree ; my @revSrt = reverse sort @xHistThree ; if ( " @srt " eq " @xHistThree " ) { # alt + right arrow - forward $ eventString = " ' %( {RIG} ) " ; }elsif ( " @revSrt " eq " @xHistThree " ) { # alt + left arrow - back $ eventString = " ' % ( {LEF} ) " ; }#if forward or backward @xHistThree= ( ) ; }#if more than 10 data points in 3 finger array
After 10 points of three - finger data are collected , the X coordinates are processed to create ascending and descending sorts .
If the ascending sort matches the current value of X coordinates , the right - swipe condition is set .
Conversely , if the descending sort is matched , the left - swipe condition is set .
The eventString variable holds this condition and will be executed as shown below .
Listing 5 . Main logic continued , event execution
}else { # reset all data points , yes you can have 0 fingers at x , y @xHist = ( ) ; @yHist = ( ) ; @x HistThree = ( ) ; }# if not one or two or three fingers # only process one event per time window if ( $ eventString ne " default " ) { if ( abs ( time - $ eventTime ) > 1 ) { $ eventTime = time ; SendKeys ( " $eventString " ) ; }#if enough time has passed $ eventString = " default " ; }#if non default event }#synclient line in close ( INFILE ) ;
At this point , each data structure for pinch or swipe is reset if three fingers are not detected .
If an event has been set and the current time is far enough from the last event execute time , a new event is executed .
The SendKeys subroutine sends the appropriate event ( Alt+left or right arrow ) to the currently focused application .
As shown in the demo video ( see Related topics ) , these three - finger gestures are used to move forward and backward in the browsing history .
Pinch gestures
Pinch gestures are substantially more complicated to detect , especially on the older hardware used to develop this article .
Monitoring the open - and - close gestures in real time using a tool like kst is a helpful way to extract relevant features from the TouchPad data .
Insert the code in Listing 6 at line 65 ( above the else ) to begin the close - pinch detection section .
Listing 6 . Close - pinch detection
}elsif ( $f eq " 2 " || $f eq " 1 " ) { # accept 1 or 2 finger entries as part of pinch section @xHistThree = ( ) ; push @xHist , $ x ; push @yHist , $y ; if ( @xHist > 50 ) { if ( ( getStrAvg(\@xHist ) > $ closeSt && getStrAvg(\@yHist ) > $ closeSt ) && ( getEndAvg(\@yHist ) < $ closeEn && getEndAvg(\@yHist ) < $ closeEn ) ) { # wide to narrow detected , now search for enough ' wiggle ' my $ tenX = 0 ; my $ tenY = 0 ; for my $ each ( @x Hist [ 40..49 ] ) { $ tenX += $ each } for my $ each ( @yHist [ 40..49 ] ) { $ tenY += $ each } $ tenX = $ tenX / 10 ; $ tenY = $ tenY / 10 ; my $ diffX = 0 ; my $ diffY = 0 ; for my $ each ( @x Hist [ 40..49 ] ) { $ diffX += abs ( $ each - $ tenX ) } for my $ each ( @yHist [ 40..49 ] ) { $ diffY += abs ( $ each - $ tenY ) } # ctrl - decrease font size if ( ( $ diffX+$diffY ) > 80 ) { $ eventString = " ^ ( { - } ) " } @xHist = ( ) ; @yHist = ( ) ; @x HistThree = ( ) ; }#if x and y in range }#if enough data for 50 close pinch detection
One or two fingers are accepted as part of the pinch - detection step to enhance the overall tracking .
Slightly offset timings of touches and releases , as well as moving one finger slightly off the TouchPad during pinch movements are dealt with more easily by accepting one or two touches as part of the pinch movement .
After 50 or more data points have been collected , the average start and end positions of the past 50 data points are computed .
The third if statement performs four separate checks to ensure that the start and end points are in the correct parts for a close - pinch detection — specifically if the X and Y averages for the start points need to be more than the close - pinch start points .
That is , the positions of the fingers need to be in the corners .
Conversely , the end points need to be within the close - pinch end points .
getStrAvg and getEndAvg create averages of the three start and end points , which are a more reliable data point for the check .
True multitouch capability would allow for an X and Y coordinate reading of each finger position .
The Synaptics hardware available does not have this capability , but does provide consistent behaviors as the two - finger touch points are " averaged " into one output for the synclient program .
Monitoring the output of the synclient program shows that when two fingers touch in the southwest and northeast corners , the values rapidly go from the corners to the center of the TouchPad .
If the fingers are kept in the corners , the synclient output shows the X and Y coordinates staying near the center .
As the fingers are moved toward the center , this automatic averaging shows slight perturbation .
The wiggle in the data is detected by the section of code above to indicate a close pinch , as opposed to the synthetic averaging of data points when the fingers are held in the corners without movement .
Ten of the trailing values of the X and Y coordinate history are averaged together .
The difference between each of the last 10 trailing values and the average for the last 10 is then computed .
If the overall difference is great enough ( greater than 80 in this case ) , enough wiggle has been detected and the close - pinch condition is set in eventString .
Add the code shown in Listing 7 at line 103 ( below the close - pinch 50 - point if closing bracket ) for open - pinch detection .
Listing 7 . Open - pinch detection
#open pinch requires substantially fewer data points if ( @x Hist > 10 ) { if ( ( getStrAvg(\@xHist ) < $ openSt && getStrAvg(\@yHist ) < $ openSt ) && ( getEndAvg(\@yHist ) > $ openEn && getEndAvg(\@yHist ) > $ openEn ) ) { # ctrl + increase font size $ eventString = " ^( {+} ) " ; @x Hist = ( ) ; @yHist = ( ) ; @x HistThree = ( ) ; }#if absx and absy }#if enough data
In addition to requiring substantially fewer data points for reliable detection of an open pinch , the wiggle - detection step is not necessary .
With real - time monitoring using a program like kst , synclient output shows a much broader range of data points collected for the open - pinch gesture .
The automatic averaging of the two fingers positions does not produce a large influence on the synclient X and Y coordinates during an open - pinch gesture .
Therefore , it is no longer necessary to recognize the wiggle for accurate gesture detection .
Listing 8 shows the getStrAvg and getEndAvg averaging subroutines .
Listing 8 .
Two averaging routines
sub getStrAvg { my $ arrRef = $ _ [ 0 ] ; my $ val = ( @$arrRef [ 0 ] + @$arrRef [ 1 ] + @$arrRef [ 2 ] ) / 3 ; $ val = abs ( $ val - $ centerTouch Pad ) ; return ( $val ) ; }#getStrAvg sub getEndAvg { my $ arrRef = $ _ [ 0 ] ; my $ val = ( @$arrRef[@$arrRef - 3 ] + @$arrRef[@$arrRef -2 ] + @$arrRef[@$arrRef -1 ] ) / 3 ; $ val = abs ( $ val - $ centerTouch Pad ) ; return ( $val ) ; }#getEndAvg
Place the code shown in Listing 8 at line 144 ( the end of the file ) to complete the gestureListener .pl program .
getStrAvg and getEndAvg are responsible for returning the average of the first three array elements and the average of the last three array elements , respectively .
Usage
Activating the program is a simple matter of running the command perl gestureListener.pl .
Bring your Web - browsing window into focus and try moving through the browsing history with left and right swipes .
Note that due to the smaller track - pad size , as well as the inherent limitations of the ability of the hardware , it may take some practice before you can reliably trigger gesture events .
Consult the demonstration video ( see Related topics ) for examples of hand movements that work on the author 's ThinkPad .
If you want to re-enable TouchPad " mouseiness , " run synclient TouchPadOff=0 after exiting the gestureListener.pl program .
Conclusion and further examples
Linkage between gestures and events

For a game I had n't really spent much time with , Mirror 's Edge sure has blossomed in my thoughts lately .
My first thoughts , when I saw this trailer last month was that I wished that the actual game looked like this and that it was n't just an animated tease for Mirror 's Edge .
But then I saw the actual game again and quickly changed my mind .
The ultra realistic look of the game , the crisp lines , the colors , theres something about them that coalesce into a look that deepens the impact of the game 's fast - moving parkour feel .
From what I saw of Mirror 's Edge it looks like the sort of game you would want to play through over and over again until you got a level perfect .
Missed a step ?
Screwed up a jump ?
Start over .
Not because you have to but because you want to .
And do n't worry , they showed some combat as well .
People have guns , they want to kill you , and you are fast enough , dexterous enough to deal with them in style .
Oh yeah , this is shaping up to be a must have .

Early this year , the price of crude oil surpassed its previous inflation - adjusted peak of $ 103.76 a barrel ( a record established in 1980 ) .
Since then , the price of crude has been making new record highs on a regular basis .
And that ’s not all .
On June 6th , it surged by $ 10.58 a barrel – a record one - day move .
This was enough to bring the chattering classes out in full force .
They produced a great deal of commentary – much of it unfounded – about what was causing oil prices to go through the roof .
They were also quick to condemn the traditional bogeyman – the speculators .
Not surprisingly , the finance ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized nations focused on oil prices during their recent two - day meeting in Osaka , Japan . ”
“ Just what is pushing prices skyward ?
Surprisingly , the G - 8 finance ministers failed to mention the US dollar ’s role .
Every commodity trader knows that all commodities trade off changes in the value of the greenback .
When the value of the dollar falls , the nominal dollar prices of internationally traded commodities , like gold , rice , and oil , must increase because more dollars are required to purchase the same quantity of any commodity .
Accordingly , a weak dollar should signal higher commodity prices .
And it does . ”

Leona Helmsley ’s pet pooch , Trouble , is going from rich bitch to good dog by throwing a $ 10 million bone to charity .
A Manhattan judge quietly reduced the notoriously ill - tempered canine ’s $ 12 million trust fund and signed off on a deal to pay the late billionaire ’s two disinherited grandchildren $ 6 million amid allegations that Helmsley was n’t mentally competent when she signed her will .
Trouble now will have to get by for the rest of her life on a measly $ 2 million .
While Helmsley , who died last August , was exceedingly generous to her 9 - year - old Maltese in her will , she pointedly excluded grandkids Craig Panzirer , 40 , and Meegan Panzirer Wesolko , 37 , “ for reasons which are known to them . ”
In bombshell papers filed in Manhattan Surrogate ’s Court , the siblings say the so - called Queen of Mean was not of sound mind or memory and did not have the mental capacity to make a will when she signed the document on July 15 , 2005 .
She died at 87 .
The grandchildren quietly worked out a deal with the executors of Helmsley ’s estate in March .
Under its terms , the grandchildren withdrew their objection in return for some changes to Helmsley ’s will .
Those alterations include Panzirer receiving a tax - free $ 4 million bequest and Wesolko a tax - free $ 2 million bequest .
The estate will also cover their legal fees , the deal says .
Their two other brothers , Walter and David , see their $ 10 million bequests from Helmsley reduced to $ 9.5 million , while Helmsley ’s brother , Alvin Rosenthal , has his $ 15 million inheritance cut by $ 1 million .
Panzirer and Wesolko agreed not to ever speak publicly concerning their disputes and to turn over all their financial and legal documents related to their grandmother ’s affairs .
The highly unusual deal was signed off on by both the state Attorney General ’s Office , which oversees charities , and Surrogate ’s Court Judge Renee Roth .
Wesolko did not return a call for comment , and Panzirer and the executors declined comment .
In an apparently unrelated move , the trustees of Trouble ’s kennel - full of cash said the persnickety pooch does n’t need the full $ 12 million she was left .
They received permission from Roth to reduce the fund by $ 10 million , which will go into Helmsley ’s multibillion - dollar charitable foundation .
Helmsley ’s will had asked that either her brother or grandson David Panzirer care for the dog , but both passed on tending the notoriously bitey beast .
Trouble is living in Florida with Carl Lekic , the general manager of the Helmsley Sandcastle Hotel .
In an affidavit , Lekic says Trouble appears to be very happy in her new permanent home and is doing well in all respects , and the extra cash would n’t buy her more happiness .
“ Two million dollars . . . would be enough money to pay for Trouble ’s maintenance and welfare at the highest standards of care for more than 10 years , which is more that twice her reasonably anticipated life expectancy , ” he said .
Lekic put her annual expenses at $ 190,000 , which includes his $ 60,000 guardian fee , $ 100,000 for ’ round - the - clock security , $ 8,000 for grooming , $ 3,000 for miscellaneous expenses , $ 1,200 for food and anywhere from $ 2,500 to $ 18,000 for medical care .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. needs to open its coastline to additional oil and gas exploration to meet an expected shortfall in long - term production , Phil Wright , president of Williams Cos Inc 's WMB.N gas pipeline unit , told the Reuters Global Energy Summit on Monday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ Clearly there are basins that we ought to be allowed as an industry to drill in , ” Wright said .
“ For example , we are a strong proponent of opening the costal areas and the federal regions that have been off limits at this point to drilling .
It would be a game changer for the domestic production outlook . ”
U.S. demand for natural gas is seen rising 12 percent over the next 10 years , while U.S. production is seen growing less than 2 percent , Wright said , citing data from consulting firm Wood Mackenize .
Williams and other oil and gas companies have argued they need access to potential energy reserves along the U.S. coast and in other protected areas , a notion that many environmentalists and politicians find unpalatable .
For example , Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly blocked attempts to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to drilling .
Even so , the industry has shown that it has been able to safely drill in ecologically sensitive areas like the Piceance Basin in Colorado , Wright noted .
Still , the executive said it “ seems a little strange ” that China is exploring for oil on Cuba ’s behalf within view of the Florida coast .
Possible places to drill include the waters off Florida and the Eastern seaboard , the executive said , but even if permission is granted , actual production would be still be years away , Wright said .
Some states , including Louisiana and Texas , allow drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
“ Once those properties are open to drilling , even if we are allowed to move fairly unfettered , you are probably looking at three to four years before you can bring some of those basins online , ” Wright said .
Other ways the industry might be able to fill a gap between supply and demand include higher imports of liquefied natural gas and additional drilling in the lower 48 states , Wright said .

( n. ) A rare individual .
When found in its true from , it manages to combine qualities of the bitch , the blabbermouth , and the cum dumpster in a veritable shitstorm of evil .
The cock - juggling thunder cunt is in fact so evil , that it transcends the plane of the urban , and lives on the plane of the spiritual .
Spiritually speaking , it is akin to if Satan douched out his vagina , assuming he had a vagina and was prone to acts of vaginal hygiene , and then left the contents of his vaginal douche in the fridge for like a month and a half , because Satan 's a big asshole and would do that kinda thing , even though it would mean all the butter and yogurt in there would start to smell like douche and you'd have to throw it out because he did n't even have the common sense to open up another thing of baking soda because i know there 's already one in there but he know 's it 's old .
The cock - juggling thunder cunt should be avoided at all costs .
A friend or relative beginning an intimate or sexual relationship with a cock - juggling thunder cunt requires strict measures of spiritual salvation including , although not limited to , " Dude , what the fuck ?
Alright , come on out with us tonight , we 're gonna get you LAID . "
If you yourself encounter a cock - juggling thunder cunt , call her out as one , then jingle any loose change you have in your pockets as a distraction and back away slowly .
If she corners you , just remember her fatal weaknesses : that all of her friends hate her , the combination of Sex in the City and Edy 's Cookies and Cream , and of course , cock juggling *VERY IMPORTANT NOTE : Cock - jugglling thunder cunt is a very powerful term , and should only be used socially as a sort of coup - de - gras .

Yesterday I spoke of the Mind Projection Fallacy , giving the example of the alien monster who carries off a girl in a torn dress for intended ravishing — a mistake which I imputed to the artist 's tendency to think that a woman 's sexiness is a property of the woman herself , woman .
sexiness , rather than something that exists in the mind of an observer , and probably would n't exist in an alien mind .
The term " Mind Projection Fallacy " was coined by the late great Bayesian Master , E. T. Jaynes , as part of his long and hard - fought battle against the accursèd frequentists .
Jaynes was of the opinion that probabilities were in the mind , not in the environment — that probabilities express ignorance , states of partial information ; and if I am ignorant of a phenomenon , that is a fact about my state of mind , not a fact about the phenomenon .
I cannot do justice to this ancient war in a few words — but the classic example of the argument runs thus :
You have a coin .
The coin is biased .
You do n't know which way it 's biased or how much it 's biased .
Someone just told you , " The coin is biased " and that 's all they said .
This is all the information you have , and the only information you have .
You draw the coin forth , flip it , and slap it down .
Now — before you remove your hand and look at the result — are you willing to say that you assign a 0.5 probability to the coin having come up heads ?
The frequentist says , " No. Saying ' probability 0.5 ' means that the coin has an inherent propensity to come up heads as often as tails , so that if we flipped the coin infinitely many times , the ratio of heads to tails would approach 1:1 .
But we know that the coin is biased , so it can have any probability of coming up heads except 0.5 . "
The Bayesian says , " Uncertainty exists in the map , not in the territory .
In the real world , the coin has either come up heads , or come up tails .
Any talk of ' probability ' must refer to the information that I have about the coin — my state of partial ignorance and partial knowledge — not just the coin itself .
Furthermore , I have all sorts of theorems showing that if I do n't treat my partial knowledge a certain way , I 'll make stupid bets .
If I 've got to plan , I 'll plan for a 50/50 state of uncertainty , where I do n't weigh outcomes conditional on heads any more heavily in my mind than outcomes conditional on tails .
You can call that number whatever you like , but it has to obey the probability laws on pain of stupidity .
So I do n't have the slightest hesitation about calling my outcome - weighting a probability . "
I side with the Bayesians .
You may have noticed that about me .
Even before a fair coin is tossed , the notion that it has an inherent 50 % probability of coming up heads may be just plain wrong .
Maybe you 're holding the coin in such a way that it 's just about guaranteed to come up heads , or tails , given the force at which you flip it , and the air currents around you .
But , if you do n't know which way the coin is biased on this one occasion , so what ?
I believe there was a lawsuit where someone alleged that the draft lottery was unfair , because the slips with names on them were not being mixed thoroughly enough ; and the judge replied , " To whom is it unfair ? "
To make the coinflip experiment repeatable , as frequentists are wont to demand , we could build an automated coinflipper , and verify that the results were 50 % heads and 50 % tails .
But maybe a robot with extra-sensitive eyes and a good grasp of physics , watching the autoflipper prepare to flip , could predict the coin 's fall in advance — not with certainty , but with 90 % accuracy .
Then what would the real probability be ?
There is no " real probability " .
The robot has one state of partial information .
You have a different state of partial information .
The coin itself has no mind , and does n't assign a probability to anything ; it just flips into the air , rotates a few times , bounces off some air molecules , and lands either heads or tails .
So that is the Bayesian view of things , and I would now like to point out a couple of classic brainteasers that derive their brain - teasing ability from the tendency to think of probabilities as inherent properties of objects .
Let 's take the old classic :
You meet a mathematician on the street , and she happens to mention that she has given birth to two children on two separate occasions .
You ask : " Is at least one of your children a boy ? "
The mathematician says , " Yes , he is . "
What is the probability that she has two boys ?
If you assume that the prior probability of a child being a boy is 1/2 , then the probability that she has two boys , on the information given , is 1/3 .
The prior probabilities were : 1 /4 two boys , 1 / 2 one boy one girl , 1/ 4 two girls .
The mathematician 's " Yes " response has probability ~ 1 in the first two cases , and probability ~0 in the third .
Renormalizing leaves us with a 1/3 probability of two boys , and a 2/3 probability of one boy one girl .
But suppose that instead you had asked , " Is your eldest child a boy ? " and the mathematician had answered " Yes . "
Then the probability of the mathematician having two boys would be 1/ 2 .
Since the eldest child is a boy , and the younger child can be anything it pleases .
Likewise if you 'd asked " Is your youngest child a boy ? "
The probability of their being both boys would , again , be 1/2 .
Now , if at least one child is a boy , it must be either the oldest child who is a boy , or the youngest child who is a boy .
So how can the answer in the first case be different from the answer in the latter two ?
Or here 's a very similar problem :
Let 's say I have four cards , the ace of hearts , the ace of spades , the two of hearts , and the two of spades .
I draw two cards at random .
You ask me , " Are you holding at least one ace ? " and I reply " Yes . "
What is the probability that I am holding a pair of aces ?
It is 1 / 5 .
There are six possible combinations of two cards , with equal prior probability , and you have just eliminated the possibility that I am holding a pair of twos .
Of the five remaining combinations , only one combination is a pair of aces .
So 1/5 .
Now suppose that instead you asked me , " Are you holding the ace of spades ? "
If I reply " Yes " , the probability that the other card is the ace of hearts is 1/3 .
( You know I 'm holding the ace of spades , and there are three possibilities for the other card , only one of which is the ace of hearts . )
Likewise , if you ask me " Are you holding the ace of hearts ? " and I reply " Yes " , the probability I 'm holding a pair of aces is 1/3 .
But then how can it be that if you ask me , " Are you holding at least one ace ? " and I say " Yes " , the probability I have a pair is 1/5 ?
Either I must be holding the ace of spades or the ace of hearts , as you know ; and either way , the probability that I 'm holding a pair of aces is 1/3 .
How can this be ?
Have I miscalculated one or more of these probabilities ?
If you want to figure it out for yourself , do so now , because I 'm about to reveal ...
That all stated calculations are correct .
As for the paradox , there is n't one .
The appearance of paradox comes from thinking that the probabilities must be properties of the cards themselves .
The ace I 'm holding has to be either hearts or spades ; but that does n't mean that your knowledge about my cards must be the same as if you knew I was holding hearts , or knew I was holding spades .
It may help to think of Bayes 's Theorem :
P( H|E ) = P( E|H ) P( H ) / P(E )
That last term , where you divide by P( E ) , is the part where you throw out all the possibilities that have been eliminated , and renormalize your probabilities over what remains .
Now let 's say that you ask me , " Are you holding at least one ace ? "
Before I answer , your probability that I say " Yes " should be 5/6 .
But if you ask me " Are you holding the ace of spades ? " , your prior probability that I say " Yes " is just 1/2 .
So right away you can see that you 're learning something very different in the two cases .
You 're going to be eliminating some different possibilities , and renormalizing using a different P( E ) .
If you learn two different items of evidence , you should n't be surprised at ending up in two different states of partial information .
Similarly , if I ask the mathematician , " Is at least one of your two children a boy ? "
I expect to hear " Yes " with probability 3/4 , but if I ask " Is your eldest child a boy ? "
I expect to hear " Yes " with probability 1/ 2 .
So it should n't be surprising that I end up in a different state of partial knowledge , depending on which of the two questions I ask .
The only reason for seeing a " paradox " is thinking as though the probability of holding a pair of aces is a property of cards that have at least one ace , or a property of cards that happen to contain the ace of spades .
In which case , it would be paradoxical for card - sets containing at least one ace to have an inherent pair - probability of 1/5 , while card - sets containing the ace of spades had an inherent pair - probability of 1/3 , and card - sets containing the ace of hearts had an inherent pair - probability of 1/3 .
Similarly , if you think a 1/3 probability of being both boys is an inherent property of child - sets that include at least one boy , then that is not consistent with child - sets of which the eldest is male having an inherent probability of 1 / 2 of being both boys , and child - sets of which the youngest is male having an inherent 1 /2 probability of being both boys .
It would be like saying , " All green apples weigh a pound , and all red apples weigh a pound , and all apples that are green or red weigh half a pound . "
That 's what happens when you start thinking as if probabilities are in things , rather than probabilities being states of partial information about things .
Probabilities express uncertainty , and it is only agents who can be uncertain .

At about the same time , the company ’s staff psychologists were beginning to extend their understanding of how habits are formed .
“ For most of our history , we ’ve sold newer and better products for habits that already existed , ” said Dr. Berning , the P.& G. psychologist .
“ But about a decade ago , we realized we needed to create new products .
So we began thinking about how to create habits for products that had never existed before . ”
Academics were also beginning to focus on habit formation .
Researchers like Wendy Wood at Duke University and Brian Wansink at Cornell were examining how often smokers quit while vacationing and how much people eat when their plates are deceptively large or small .
Those and other studies revealed that as much as 45 percent of what we do every day is habitual  that is , performed almost without thinking in the same location or at the same time each day , usually because of subtle cues .
For example , the urge to check e-mail or to grab a cookie is likely a habit with a specific prompt .
Researchers found that most cues fall into four broad categories : a specific location or time of day , a certain series of actions , particular moods , or the company of specific people .
The e-mail urge , for instance , probably occurs after you ’ve finished reading a document or completed a certain kind of task .
The cookie grab probably occurs when you ’re walking out of the cafeteria , or feeling sluggish or blue .
Our capacity to develop such habits is an invaluable evolutionary advantage .
But when they run amok , things can become tricky .
Consider a series of experiments Dr. Wansink performed with a bowl of tomato soup that was secretly connected to a tube that pumped more and more liquid into the bowl .
Diners ended up eating almost twice as much soup as usual , though they did n’t report feeling any fuller after the meal .
A former bishop has ended Paraguay 's 61 years of one - party rule , beating the reigning party 's candidate to win the country 's presidential election .
Late last night , Fernando Lugo , a mild - mannered leftist who quit the clergy three years ago , saying he felt powerless to help Paraguay 's poor , was announced as the winner of the elections after some uncertainty .
Lugo had been given 40 to 43 % of the vote in four separate exit polls earlier in the evening .
The ruling Colorado party 's candidate , Blanca Ovelar , the first woman to run for president in Paraguay , was on 36 to 38 % .
Ovelar , 50 , a former education minister and protege of the outgoing president , Nicanor Duarte , at first refused to concede , predicting she would score heavily in rural areas beyond the reach of the exit pollsters .
But with Lugo nine points up after partial counting of votes , she gave way .
Another candidate , retired army general Lino Oviedo , freed last year after the supreme court overturned a sentence for plotting a coup , was in third place .
" We ask you never to abandon us .
We 'll make democracy together ! "
Lugo , 56 , told cheering supporters as firecrackers resounded around Asuncion last night .
Lugo , nicknamed the " bishop of the poor " , was confident Paraguayans would elect him in the hope of seeing " a different country " , likening himself to a David fighting a " monstrous Goliath " .
The Colorado party has stayed in power by means of democracy and dictatorship , ruling even longer than Cuba 's Communist party .
Eight months ago , Lugo welded unions , Indians and poor farmers into a coalition with the main opposition party to form the Patriotic Alliance for Change .
Many ordinary Paraguayans had become fed up of what they saw as a corrupt establishment , that failed to safeguard the poorest in a country landlocked by wealthier neighbours Argentina and Brazil , and economically dependent on its agricultural and hydroelectric power exports .
Lugo campaigned heavily on trying to charge Brazil more money for the power it imports from the jointly owned Itaipu hydroelectric plant - following in the footsteps of Bolivia , which negotiated to charge its neighbours more for natural gas .
Lugo calls himself an independent and has steered clear of Latin America 's more radical leftwing leaders , such as Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales in Bolivia .
But he is seen as a likely ally of moderate leftist presidents in the region .
Lugo will take office on 15 August , and has vowed to carry out agrarian reform to ensure poor peasant farmers can till their own land in a country where a small , wealthy elite owns the vast majority of farmland and cattle ranches .
Warped Tour 2008 features a band roster that 's so brutally and invasively stupid that the whole event inevitably becomes an eight - hour brain rape .
Revisiting the trauma now feels like ripping open a freshly stitched gash , but Warped Tour remains at large for more than a month , and if I can save someone in Elkton , Florida or Shakopee , Minnesota from the horrors of enduring this torture marathon , well , it 's worth the searing agony .
When the Warped Tour launched in 1994 , nearly all the featured acts played really fast , got profanely angry about politics , and said funny shit on stage .
Also , unwatched by most , " extreme athletes " performed .
The heavy corporate presence , amphitheater settings and lofty concession prices bristled some Mohawks .
Other than that , it was n't the worst possible way to spend a day , if you were 14 or so .
Scattered decent acts participated , and you 'd leave not much dumber than you entered .
By contrast , attending Warped 2008 is like having someone attach sand to your skin with liquid cement , blowtorch that sand into a form - fitting glass shell , then forcibly shatter that encasing , driving shards into every inch of your naked flesh .
I can say without reservation that Shwayze , the first group I observed , is the worst rap act ever featured on Warped Tour , even knowing that the competition in this category consists almost entirely of white - rap nerds like MC Chris ( also on the 2008 bill ) .
Shwayze regurgitates Will Smith 's subject matter ( summertime , parents who just do n't understand ) , without any semblance of the erstwhile Fresh Prince 's wordsmithing skills .
Also , instead of rolling with Jazzy Jeff , Shwayze consorts with some crooning stoner hype man who looks like a Beastie Boy in a video - stunt wig .
These budding reality - show exhibitionists rap and sing lethargically about leisure topics , achieving a level of exertion similar to that exhibited in comatose sloths .
The next group , Set Your Goals , did little to assuage my sudden desire to die , despite the fact that they were all about espousing positivity .
These sissified hardcore drips attempt to inspire with rallying cries such as " Do n't say ' I quit ' " and " I value you more than you will ever know . "
If I 'm going to have to sit through self - help aphorisms , I 'd rather grit my teeth through a witless parody such as Stuart Saves His Family than watch some cheeseballs who actually believe their music - as - savior hype .
" We love these songs with all our hearts , we know you do , too , " one of their twerpy vocalists announced .
Then the crowd started a circle pit , which was like the running of the bulls , with the stampeding oxen replaced by Hot Topic shoppers of roughly bovine weight and brain power .
Set Your Goals takes its name from an album by posi-core progenitors CIV , who played Warped in 1995 , 1996 and 1998 , proving that while the tour has always been a haven for Pollyana punk , it was never a musical utopia .
Carrot Top hearts boobies , props .
While en route to Against Me ! , the next recognizable offender , I noticed a mass gathering around unknown clown tent We The Kings .
I stopped for a brief yet nearly lethal sample before fleeing , with parking - lot gravel carving blood rivulets in my knees as I crawled away in a weakened state .
Billboard describes We The Kings as " MySpace heroes , " a phrase that is quickly becoming synonymous with " mysteriously popular lame - ass band that no one normal has heard of . "
The redesigned profile for Facebook users will finally be rolled out as an optional beta on July 16th .
If you 're a developer , this date is rather important to you , as you 'll need to be ready with the new design implementations that will affect your applications and their presence within a user 's profile .
The sandbox has been open to developers for a couple months , so many will be very close to being ready for the July 16th release date .
But what about the users ?
As with most of Facebook 's actions , the self - proclaimed objective is to make the overall experience better for the end users .
And the redesign is no different .
The changes being made to the user profiles essentially break content up into various tabs , and make sharing and viewing profile content easier and more digestible to profile visitors .
The organization options for users are also modified , with tweaks being made to the newsfeeds .
Things like the size of newsfeeds and the amount of content present in a newsfeed update are being changed , as well as the placement of information surrounding added applications .
The end result is a varied set of options for pushing application - related content out to users , which they may or may not appreciate .
Given the presence of newsfeed updates in the recently - launched Facebook chat tool , I imagine that more access to newsfeed content wo n't go over well with a large number of users .
But a good amount of the modifications to the newsfeed system seem to at least be reflective of individual behavior pertaining to each user , so there will be some action - oriented customization on that end .
Facebook 's platform is about a year old , and we 've seen loads of changes that have been made to the whole of Facebook as a result of permitted access to portions of its database by third - party applications .
But this next major shift in the Facebook user experience will nevertheless lead to even more changes being made , some of which will appear to be unnecessary and controlling , but hopefully will indeed be in the best interests of the users .
George Grantham writes :
In recent decades the conventional dating of the origins of Western Europe ’s economic ascendancy to the tenth and eleventh centuries AD has been called in question by archaeological findings and reinterpretations of the early medieval texts indicating significantly higher levels of material prosperity in Antiquity than conventional accounts consider plausible .
On the basis of that evidence it appears likely that at its peak the classical economy was almost as large as that of Western Europe on the eve of the Industrial Revolution .
Here is sixty pages more , noting that every single page of this paper has interesting material , a remarkable achievement .
Here is one bit :
Between 1300 and 900 BC three innovations turned out to be crucial for the eventual integration of Europe ’s economic space .
The earliest was the improvement in ship construction and sailing technique .
As will be discussed in more detail below , the decisive changes in rigging and hull construction that permitted larger and more robust ships were achieved before the Aegean collapse in response to the growing bulk trade in timber and agricultural produce .
The perfection of ferrous metallurgy by Cypriot and Aegean smiths was the second decisive innovation .
Unlike the changes in naval architecture , the metallurgical innovations of the Aegean Dark Age were an unexpected by - product of economic collapse .
The third major development affecting the later expansion of trading networks was the transformation of Proto - Canaanite syllabaries into a true alphabet consisting of approximately two dozen phonetic signs .
The triumph of the alphabet was also a consequence of the Aegean collapse , which destroyed the earlier and slightly more cumbersome cuneiform script employed to document administrative and commercial transactions outside Egypt .
Clouds are alive with tiny bacteria that grab up water vapor in the atmosphere to make cloud droplets , especially at warmer temperatures , a new study shows .
The water droplets and ice crystals that make up clouds do n't usually form spontaneously in the atmosphere — they need a solid or liquid surface to collect on .
Tiny particles of dust , soot and airplane exhaust — and even bacteria — are known to provide these surfaces , becoming what atmospheric scientists call cloud condensation nuclei ( CCN ) .
" Nucleation events and this ice formation is widely recognized as a process that is important to the initiation of precipitation , whether it be snowfall or rain , " said lead author of the new study , Brent C. Christner of Louisiana State University .
Biological nuceli Bacteria and other particles of biological origin are actually pretty good at collecting water vapor to form cloud droplets .
" Biological particles such as bacteria are the most active ice nuclei in nature , " Christner told LiveScience .
" In other words , they have the ability to catalyze ice formation at temperatures warmer than a particle of abiotic origin . "
Whereas abiotic ( or non-biological ) particles such as dust are good at collecting water at temperatures below about 14 degrees F ( - 10 degrees C ) , biological particles seem to be the main active nuclei above that temperature , according to Christner 's findings .
This talent of bacteria could have implications for understanding cloud formation at warmer temperatures .
Atmospheric bacteria
To see how widespread biological nuclei were in the atmosphere , Christner and his team took samples of freshly fallen snow from sites all over the world .
Antarctic snowfall had the lowest concentrations of biological nuclei , while sites in Montana and France had the highest .
Christner said this finding was expected because Antarctica is isolated geographically and far from the suspected source of most of the biological nuclei , plants .
" But the concentrations were n't zero ; you could still measure some level of them , " Christner said .
" And that implies that these particles travel large distances in the atmosphere and retain their ice nucleating " properties .
Most of the biological nuclei identified in the study , detailed in the Feb. 29 issue of the journal Science , were plant pathogens .
These microbes could be carried into the atmosphere from an infected plant by winds , strong updrafts or the dust clouds that follow tractors harvesting a field .
Christner and others suspect that becoming cloud nuclei is a strategy for the pathogen to get from plant to plant , since it can be carried for long distances in the atmosphere and come down with a cloud 's rain .
The next step in determining how big a role biological particles play in cloud droplet formation is to directly sample the clouds themselves , Christner says .
The author of over a dozen books , including the well - received Probability trilogy , Nancy Kress loves to thwart our expectations about the future .
In her new short story collection Nano Comes to Clifford Falls and Other Stories , out this month , she takes stereotypical SF tales of galactic colonization , alien invasion , and nanotech singularities — and slaps them upside the head .
In one story , aliens " invade " Earth by landing a spaceship and just letting it sit in rural Minnesota for centuries ; in another , we see the nanotech singularity from the perspective of people in a small prairie town .
A story ostensibly about exploring a black hole at the center of the galaxy turns out to be about how AI uploads of people actually have better personalities than their originals .
Though often uneven , the collection will tweak your preconceptions enough to stay with you long after you 've put it down .

The book leads off with Kress ' story " Nano Comes to Clifford Falls , " which was originally published via scifi podcast Escape Pod .
The tale of a single mother coping with what happens when her small town , Clifford Falls , gets several nano - fabricators sparked a great deal of controversy online , in part because nobody could figure out if Kress was for or against nanotech .
And that 's part of what appeals about this tale : Kress shows the dark side of being liberated from the need to work , showing us people in Clifford Falls who quit their awful factory jobs and spend all day getting drunk on nano - whiskey or primping in their nano - fashions .
Her heroine refuses to use the nano - fabricators , preferring to farm and sew her own clothes as a way of not giving up on work .
One of the strongest stories in the book , this tale exhibits Kress ' allure as a writer : she manages to explore hard science while also looking at its social consequences among ordinary people rather than scientists or elite space explorers .
A similarly strong story is " Computer Virus , " about a woman trapped inside her computer - secured fortress by an invading A.I. who wants to escape being killed by the government agency that made him .
While our hero figures out an ingenious way to use her skills with proteomics to fight the A.I. , she also struggles with a sense that her biology skills are inferior to those of her dead husband .
And in " Savior , " we follow several generations of mostly - humble Minnesota families as they struggle to understand why a strange alien craft landed on a patch of farmland and never moved or transmitted any information to Earth for over two centuries .

Kress has a way of making the vast reaches of the galaxy and the tiniest nanomachines seem familiar and comprehensible — while also making the Earth itself into a creepy alternate world .
At times her depressed single mothers , dysfunctional siblings , and cruelly condescending male authority figures feel like figures out of a Dorothy Allison novel .
Until they grow new bodies in nano - vats , or blast themselves into the heart of a black hole .
Or destroy an entire solar system by merging with a universe - spanning synthetic intelligence that 's slowly being tortured to death by a similar intelligence from another universe .
At her best , Nancy Kress evokes the surreal unhappiness of Katherine Dunn 's mutant - family novel Geek Love .
But many of the stories in this volume , such as " Shiva in Shadow , " suffer from a kind of overly - ambitious metaphorical symmetry in which science becomes a fancy symbol for human psychology .
In that story , three characters studying anomalous gravitational artifacts at the center of the galaxy find their own relationships haunted by ( you guessed it ) anomalous , unseen forces that cause them to get sucked slowly into a swirling pit of hellish destruction — just like a black hole .
" The Most Famous Little Girl in the World " has the same problem .
A girl who is abducted by aliens becomes ( wait for it ) alienated from her little cousin , and the story tracks the two women for their whole lives as their alienation from each other too - perfectly reflects the humans ' growing relationship with the aliens who once abducted the girl .

Despite these moments when Kress bashes the reader over the head with simple allegories , the collection is generally strong and worth a read .
I was especially impressed with Kress ' ability to quickly invoke posthuman worlds with just a few deft paragraphs , and bring us deeply into the emotional lives of her sometimes quite alien characters .
And her heaping doses of bio - geekery , usually based in extrapolations from today 's state - of - the - art science , give these stories a grounding in realism that a lot of great science fiction lacks .
Nano Comes to Clifford Falls and Other Stories
Like pervious versions of Windows Server , Windows Server 2008 includes a very nice Connection Manager Administration Kit ( CMAK ) that you can use to create VPN connectoids that users can use to connect to your Windows Server 2008 VPN servers .
Actually , you can use the connectoids to connect to any Windows VPN server , as along as you 're using the supported protocols .
The advantage to using the CMAK is that you can create an executable file that users can download from a Web site .
Then all they have to do is double click on the file and the connectoid that you 've configured for them will be automatically installed on their computers .
The users then just need to double click on the connectoid object in the Network Connections folder to dial up the VPN connection .
This incurs much less overhead than trying to teach the users how to create their own VPN connections .
The CMAK is a Windows Server 2008 Feature that you can install using the Windows Server 2008 Server Manager .
Just click on the Features link in the left pane of the console and then click the Add Features link .
On the Select Features page , select the Connection Manager Administration Kit open and complete the installation .
You can then open the CMAK from the Administrative Tools menu .
The first thing you 'll see is the Welcome to the Connection Manager Administration Kit Wizard page .
Click Next .
Figure 1
On the Select the Target Operation System page , you select the operating system for which you want to create the connectoid .
One major difference between Windows XP and Windows Vista is that Vista supports the SSTP SSL VPN protocol .
In this example , we 'll choose the Windows Vista option and click Next .
Figure 2
On the Create or Modify a Connection Manager profile page , you can choose to make a new profile , or merge the settings you create now with another profile that you previously created .
In this example we 'll create a new profile .
Click Next .
Figure 3
On the Specify the Service Name and the File Name page , you give the name to the connectoid and the file name of the CMAK package .
In the example , we 'll use a Service name of Corporate VPN .
This name is what the end users will see after they install the CMAK package .
In the File name box , we 'll enter CorpVPN .
This will be the name of the CMAK package that will be created and the name of the file the users will download and install .
Figure 4
On the Specify a Realm Name page , you can enter a realm name to the user name .
This is typically used when you 're using your ISP as an authentication gateway to your VPN server .
We wo n't be using a realm name in this example , so we 'll click Next .
Figure 5
You can merge information from other profiles on the Merge Information from Other Profiles page .
This is different from the previous page where we were given the option to update a previous profile .
This page allows us to import phone book information from multiple other profiles .
In this example we do n't have other profiles with phone book information , so we 'll click Next .
Figure 6
In the Add Support for VPN Connections page , you can configure the VPN connectoid to connect to the VPN directly over the Internet , or through a dial - up connection .
Dial - up connections are n't used much anymore , so we 'll continue this one to allow a VPN connection through a direct link to the Internet .
Put a checkmark in the Phone book from this profile checkbox and then select either the always use the same VPN server or the Allow the user to choose a VPN server before connecting option .
If you select the Allow the user to choose a VPN server before connecting option , you will need to browse to a . txt file that contains the names of those VPN servers , as seen in the figure below .
In this example we have a single VPN server or a VPN server that is using NLB and a single IP address , so we 'll enter that IP address in the Always use the same VPN server text box .
Click Next .
Figure 7
Figure 8
On the Create or Modify a VPN Entry page , you can set configuration details for the VPN connection .
A default value , Corporate VPN Tunnel is created for us already .
Click the Edit button to make changes .
Figure 9
On the General tab , you have the option to enable or disable file and printer sharing for the VPN client .
This is generally a good idea for VPN client connections , since these hosts are unlikely to have files and printers that will be shared with networks to which they connect .
You also have the option to enable both IP v4 and IP v6 , just IP v4 or just IP v6 connectivity to the VPN client .
In this example , we 'll allow both IP v4 and IP v6 connectivity .
Figure 10
On the IP v4 tab , we can set the primary and secondary DNS server addresses .
Or , you can set it up so that the client receives this information from the VPN server .
In most cases , you 'll want the VPN client to obtain this information from the VPN server .
You can also choose to make the client use the VPN connection as the client 's default gateway .
When you do this , you disable split tunneling , which is a good thing .
However , it also means that if the client needs to connect to the Internet , it will need to do that either through the VPN server to which the client is connected to , or through a Winsock and Web Proxy server ( such as the ISA Firewall ) that is on another machine on the network .
While this put additional stress on your Internet connection , disabling split tunnel is a VPN networking best practice and you 'll be more secure if it 's disabled .
Finally , you can enable or disable header compression .
This is enabled by default and in general should be left enabled .
This allows you to increase the throughput through your remote access VPN client connections .
Figure 11
We will bypass the IP v6 tab .
On the Security tab , you can set the client up to require encryption .
You can also set the VPN strategy , which is how the VPN client will try to connect to the VPN server .
You can see that you have the following options :
Only use Point to Point Tunneling protocol ( PPTP )
Try Point to Point Tunneling Protocol First
Only use Layer Two Tunneling Protocol ( L2TP )
Try Layer Two tunnel Protocol First
Only use Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol ( SSTP )
Try Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol First
The VPN client will try VPN protocols in the order of PPTP first , L2TP / IPsec second and SSTP third .
However , if you choose to try another protocol first , it will change this order .
For example , if you say to check the SSTP VPN protocol first , then SSTP will be first , then PPTP and then L2TP / IPsec .
In the Logon security frame , you can choose to use Use Extensible Authentication Protocol or Authentication methods .
If you choose the former , then you can configure the EAP authentication you want to use .
If you choose the latter , then you can put checkmarks in the checkboxes for the protocols you want to support , including PAP , CHAP , and MS - CHAPv2 .
Figure 12
If you choose the PEAP option , you can force the client to validate the server certificate , and also force the client to connect to a specific server , as defined by the common / subject name on the server certificate presented to the client by the VPN server .
You also can limit what Trusted Root Certification Authorities are trusted .
Note that I selected PEAP in this example , but from what I read in TechNet in several articles on PEAP , it says that PEAP is not supported on VPN clients .
Perhaps this was a Windows Server 2003 limitation , or an error in the CMAK interface , or something else .
I 'll let you know if I ever find out the answer to this question .
For more information on PEAP for Windows Server 2003 , check out PEAP
However , if you check this table you 'll see that PEAP - MS - CHAPv2 is supported for remote access VPN client connections .
Figure 13
On the Advanced tab , you can enter the DNS suffix that the VPN client connection will use and this will also be used to register with the DDNS on your internal network if you have DDNS enabled for these clients .
Figure 14
On the Add a Customer Phone Book page , you can include the numbers used to connect to a dial - up server first , before the VPN connection is established .
Since we are n't using dial - up servers in this scenario , we wo n't create a custom phone book .
Figure 15
On the Specify Routing Table Updates page , you can choose to update the routing table on the remote access VPN client so that it knows the custom routes on the network to which it is connected .
If you choose the Define a routing table update option , you will need to provide a route file using the format described here .
If you put in an entry in the URL to a route file , the routing table entries will be updated based on the entries included at the file accessible through that URL .
Click Next .
Figure 16
On the Configure Proxy Settings for Internet Explorer page , you set the Web proxy address that the browser should use when it 's connected to the VPN .
Note that this is a different address that the client might use when it's not connected to the VPN .
The options are :
Do not configure proxy settings
Automatically copy the Internet Explorer proxy settings for the current user to the tunnel interface .
This requires that the user had already configured the Web proxy settings in the Internet Explorer , which defeats the point of automating the configuration of the VPN client
Automatically configure proxy settings
The last option requires that you create a text file that has the Web proxy settings configured .
This URL contains the details for the text file requirements .
Configuring a
Web proxy server is useful when you want the VPN client to use a Web proxy server , which is on a computer different from the VPN server to which the VPN client is connected .
In addition , most Web proxies used by corporations have the ability to do site and content filtering , thus increasing the security if your remote access VPN client connections .
Click Next .
Figure 17
There are a number of custom actions that you can configure the VPN client to carry out .
For example , you can configure some actions to take place before the connection is established , some actions that are carried out after the connection is established , and some actions that are carried out after the client disconnects .
This requires some developer expertise , but if you are interested in this kind of custom actions , check out the CMAK page for details .
Figure 18
On the Display a Custom Logon Bitmap page , you can include a custom graphic that will appear in the VPN client connection window .
If you create the custom graphic , it must be 330x140 pixels .
Use the Browse button to find the custom graphic .
I wo n't use a custom graphic in this scenario , so I 'll accept the default setting , Default graphic , and click Next .
Figure 19
You can also create a custom graphic for the Phone Book .
This graphic needs to be 114x309 pixels .
We do n't have a Phone Book in this example , so we 'll accept the default setting , Default graphic , and click Next .
Figure 20
You can even create custom icon files that will appear in the Network Center or Network Connection folder .
This is icon files ( .ico ) that will be used instead of the default icons .
We do n't have any custom icon files in this example , so we 'll accept the default value , Default icons , and click Next .
Figure 21
If you have a custom help file in the .chm format , you can choose to include that custom Help file on the Include a Custom Help File page .
We do n't have a custom Help file in this example , so we 'll click Next .
Figure 22
On the Display Custom Support Information page , you can include a phone number that users can call for tech support .
Click Next .
Figure 23
On the Display a Custom License Agreement page , you can include a license text file that the user will see when installing the VPN connectoid .
We do n't have a license file in this example , so we 'll click Next .
Figure 24
On the Install Additional Files with the Connection Manager profile page , you can include additional files that might be used in pre-connect , post - connect or disconnection custom actions .
For example , if you were to use the Windows Remote Access Quarantine Control feature , you would include components of that solution as part of the profile .
We do n't have any additional files to include in this scenario , so we 'll click Next .
Figure 25
That 's it !
The Profile is complete and the installation file is ready to be compiled .
Click Finish to create the CMAK installation file .
Figure 26
A Windows Explorer window will open to the folder containing the installation file .
Also included in this folder are other files that you can use in the future to update the package .
Copy the .exe file to a place where users can download the file , such as a file share or a Web site , then tell the users who require the VPN connection to get the file and install it on their computers .
Figure 27
Let 's run the file and see what the installation experience is like for the end -user .
The first think they 'll see is a dialog box that asks if they want to install the Corporate VPN .
Not that this is based on the name you included at the beginning of the CMAK .
Click Yes .
The user will be given the choice to make the connection available for All users or My use only .
One thing that your users need to be aware of is if they want to log on via dial - up networking , then they need to make the connectoid available to All users .
Otherwise , they machine does n't have a logged on user prior to log on and can't tell who the user is and wo n't make it available for logging on via dial - up networking .
If users do n't log on via dial - up networking , then they can select My use only for a more secure configuration .
Figure 28
The log on dialog box appears .
Enter a user name and password and domain , if the VPN server is a domain member of you 're using RADIUS for domain authentication .
Click Connect .
And that 's it !
The user will connect to the VPN .
Figure 29
Summary
The Connection Manager Administration Kit provides you an easy way to create connection service profiles for VPN users .
Users will not need to know the details of the configuration , will not need to remember the name of the VPN server , and will not have to delve into the VPN protocols that should be used to connect to the VPN server .
This should help reduce
Help desk calls due to problems with end - user related problems with configuring VPN connectoids .
Note that while the configuration is pre-built for the user , the user can still make changes to the configuration , so this is not an ironclad method against end - user " fiddling " around with application configuration .
The flooding in eastern Iowa has reached the point of catastrophe .
Towns are overwhelmed , businesses destroyed , and crops are gone .
A fifth of the corn and soybeans are gone .
Fox News is calling it " Iowa 's Katrina . "
Here is a gallery of aerial phtographs at the web site of the newspaper I used to deliver every afternoon , the Iowa City Press - Citizen .
The thing is , though , the people of eastern Iowa seem to be stepping up in the Iowa stubborn way .
I have seen any number of man-on - the - street interviews , and nobody is complaining .
They all seem to be working to solve their problem , which is not surprising because Iowans do not complain about tragedy .
They complain about hot weather and dry weather , but not tragedy .
And I have looked for reports of looting and come up empty so far .
Katrina has become a metaphor for many things beyond natural disaster , including governmental and individual incompetence ( depending on your point of view ) .
In Iowa there is a 500 year flood , but the people are not paralyzed , whining , or looting .
There will be no massive relief effort from around the world , and nobody will step up to help Iowans except for other Iowans .
Yet years from now , there will be no Iowans still in FEMA camps .
The difference is not in the severity of the flood , but in the people who confront the flood .
UPDATE ( late Sunday afternoon ) :
This post obviously touched a nerve .
Oops .
I certainly could have chosen my words more carefully .
Sorry if I ruined Father 's Day for any of you .
In any case , the University of Iowa , home of the Hawkeyes , is mounting its last stand .
Last week it came out that , in Firefox ( and other Gecko - based browsers ) you could dip into the private scope of a function using eval , like so :
// Getting " private " variables var obj = ( function ( ) { var a = 21 ; return { // public function must reference ' a ' fn : function ( ) { a;} } ; } ) ( ) ; var foo ; eval ( ' foo=a ' , obj.fn ) ; console.log ( foo ) ; // 21
I think the common response to seeing the above was something like : WUH !?!?
As can be seen in the ensuing discussions .
Perhaps more interestingly is the dig in to try and figure out how on earth this feature made it in to the language to being with .
Brendan Eich provides some insight :
3.2 < fur > 1998-04-23 17:30 : Initial checkin of JavaScript 1.3 , migrated from JSFUN13 _BRANCH in /m/ src repository
This eval extension , if memory serves ( I was in mozilla.org at the time , not in the JS group at Netscape ) originated in conversations with Microsoft ’s rep during ECMA - 262 standardization , trying to reach agreement on a way to eval in other scopes .
At this point , however , it ’s pretty safe to say that since so few people know about it , and that ( hopefully ) there are no important sites relying upon its behavior , it can be stricken from the record .
Which it has been .
It ’s been a crazy ride but you can expect to see this feature gone in Firefox 3.1 ( the next release of Firefox , set to debut this year ) .
A team from the ETH university in Zurich has managed to create a soft silicone heart that pumps in a way similar to its organic counterpart .
This could one day lead to a working replacement to this most vital organ .
The heart is an incredibly complex muscle .
With its numerous chambers , pumps and valves , it is notoriously difficult to engineer an alternative .
And that ’s before you take into consideration the way that the human body rejects materials placed into it .
One material that has proven to be accepted by bodies , that can also be 3D printed , is silicone .
With advancements in 3D printing , it has become easier to print soft shapes , an essential thing when thinking about replacing organs .
Feel the beat
Nicholas Cohrs , a doctoral student at ETH created the heart using an organic heart as a template , adding an extra chamber where the central wall of the heart would usually be that can be filled with air , in order to ‘ pump ’ the heart .
To see the ‘ heart ’ in action , check out the video from ETH below :
There are currently blood pumps that exist that can stand in while a patient is waiting for a donor heart to arrive , but the artificial nature of the pumping mechanism means the patient lacks a physiological pulse which : “ is assumed to have some consequences for the patient ” .
Being able to create a functional artificial heart would be revolutionary .
According to ETH : “ about 26 million people worldwide suffer from heart failure while there is a shortage of donor hearts . ”
This heart is definitely a step in the right direction , but is still a long way off being a working model .
Under test conditions , the heart was only able to maintain 80 BPM ( beats per minute , a slightly elevated average heart rate ) for 3,000 pumps .
This would mean at present , the heart would only last between half an hour to three quarters of an hour .
Repetition is one of the greatest demands on the heart , if you factor 80 BPM as an average , by the age of 80 your heart will have performed over 3 billion beats .
Creating a pump that has the structural integrity that it can perform this many pumps without needing continuous maintenance is going to be a big hurdle .

SAN DIEGO -- Tiger Woods cradled the silver U.S. Open trophy in his right hand and limped toward the edge of the Pacific bluffs , each step as much a burden as the 91 holes he played at Torrey Pines for a major that might have been his most amazing yet .
Out of competition for two months because of knee surgery , he won the toughest test in golf .
For the second straight day , Woods came to the 18th hole one shot behind and stood over a birdie putt to avoid a shocking collapse .
His knee throbbing and heart pounding , he delivered .
He always does .
An epic U.S. Open finally ended Monday afternoon on the 19th hole of a playoff when Woods outlasted a gritty Rocco Mediate for a victory that surprised even him .
" I think this is probably the best ever , " Woods said .
" All things considered , I do n't know how I ended up in this position , to be honest with you .
It was a long week .
A lot of doubt , a lot of questions going into the week .
And here we are , 91 holes later . "
Now the greater question is his future .
All week , Woods had managed to mask the pain , walking with an almost imperceptible limp .
Finally , he could give in to it .
Walking toward the bluffs for his last round of interviews , he could barely make it up the hill .
A printer can help preserve images or documents , but these high - tech machines aim to do the job much more efficiently .

Toshiba B- SX8R
Toshiba has developed a printer ( B - SX8R ) that can erase and reprint — up to 500 times — on a single sheet of paper .
This process involves heat - activated pigments that turn black at 180 - degrees - plus .
When the pigments are heated from 130 - degrees to 170 - degrees , the pigements revert back to white , which essentially erases the sheet ’s contents .
Please view below for a video — courtesy of Vnunet .
Memjet
SilverBrook Research has developed a new type of “ Memjet ” printer technology .
The devices use a printhead that consists of individual microchip segments , with each measuring 20 mm and containing 6400 nozzles .
This enables them to print at speeds of up to 2 pages per second .

Boris Johnson said Mr Aziz had subsequently offered the case as a gift Police have forced London Mayor Boris Johnson to hand over a cigar case belonging to Iraq 's former deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz .
The ex-MP , who obtained the red leather case from Mr Aziz 's bombed - out home while visiting Iraq as a journalist in 2003 , said the situation was " stupid " .
He said : " The police have no choice but to investigate this ludicrous affair . "
Under the Iraq ( UN Sanctions ) Order 2003 , anyone possessing Iraqi cultural property must give it to the police .
Mr Johnson deposited the case into custody on Monday afternoon , following instructions from the police .
' Wasting police time ' Scotland Yard said it would be held " while further enquiries are made " .
Writing in the Daily Telegraph , Mr Johnson said he had obtained Mr Aziz 's case a few days after the Americans had captured Baghdad , claiming the circumstances were " so morally ambiguous that I cannot quite think of it as theft " .
None of the major players is going to be arraigned for the Iraq disaster and the long arm of the law is instead reaching out - incredibly - for me
Boris Johnson
London Mayor
" As I stared at the remains of his home , I saw utter destruction - surely the looters had left nothing of value ? " he said .
" And there , just by my toe , protruding from beneath a piece of dusty plywood , was the cigar case .
Actually , it was only the bottom half of a cigar case , in thick red leather and coarsely stitched .
" But I immediately saw its importance .
If this was the cigar case of Tariq Aziz , think of the scenes it had witnessed . "
The mayor , who says he subsequently received a letter from Mr Aziz offering the case as a gift , claims the police only became involved after " Labour stooges " demanded he be prosecuted when they found an article he had written about the case .
" I briefly toyed with making a fuss , and pointing out how utterly selfish and stupid it was of Labour to waste police time on this kind of thing , " he said .
What he has done is not to deny he 's committed the crime but has blamed the person who has brought it to the attention of the police
Stephen Pound
Labour MP
" Just when the police are trying to focus on beating knife crime and making the streets safe , they are told they must lavish money and manpower on a preposterous investigation that will do nothing for the security of the public . "
He asked why other politicians , such as Tony Blair who he says " the Commons failed to impeach " over the Iraq war , had not been " brought to book " .
" I am informed by my friends in the Metropolitan Police that I am shortly to become the one and only Western politician to be brought to justice for crimes committed in Iraq . "
' Double standards ' Stephen Pound , Labour MP for Ealing North , said he was " less worried about the cigar case " than he was about London 's mayor spending " half a day " writing a column for the Daily Telegraph .
" What he has done is not to deny he 's committed the crime but has blamed the person who has brought it to the attention of the police , " he said .
" Boris adds to the gaiety of the nation , there 's no doubt about that .
I would rather have a full time mayor than a part - time journalist running this city . "
A police spokesman said : " The Met works very closely with a number of countries , including Iraq , to recover items that are considered culturally significant .
" In order to establish the origin and potential significance of the item , such items must be submitted to police custody for further examination . "
Failing to adhere to the 2003 order is considered an offence , unless the person can prove they were not aware that the property was illegally removed from Iraq .

PITTSBURGH has undergone a striking renaissance from a down - and - out smokestack to a gleaming cultural oasis .
But old stereotypes die hard , and Pittsburgh probably does n’t make many people ’s short list for a cosmopolitan getaway .
Too bad , because this city of 89 distinct neighborhoods is a cool and — dare I say , hip —city .
There are great restaurants , excellent shopping , breakthrough galleries and prestigious museums .
The convergence of three rivers and surrounding green hills also make it a surprisingly pretty urban setting .
And if the Pirates are in town , head over to PNC Park .
Besides the game , the ballpark offers a great excuse to explore downtown Pittsburgh and the river views .

1 ) GRIDIRON AND STEEL
Get to know what makes the city tick at the Senator John Heinz History Center ( 1212 Smallman Street ; 412-454-6000 ; www.pghhistory.org), which chronicles the city ’s past and present glories from United States Steel to the Pittsburgh Steelers .
This is actually a two - fer : the main museum is devoted to everything from the Heinz food empire to the polyglot population .
The upper two floors are occupied by the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum , which pays homage to the region ’s rich sports heritage .
It ’s hard to miss the seven - story brick warehouse building ; look for the giant photograph of the Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris .
7 p.m.
2 ) WATERFALL DINING
The martini menu almost changes as often at the seasonal specials at Soba ( 5847 Ellsworth Avenue ; 412-362-5656 ; www.bigburrito.com/soba), a pan-Asian restaurant with a Victorian exterior and a Zen - like interior that features a two - story wall of cascading water .
The menu includes a rock - shrimp tempura lettuce wrap ( $ 11 ) and pan-roasted Alaskan halibut ( $ 30 ) .
The wine list is extensive , as is the variety of over 20 sakes .
The vibe is upscale and trendy , but not in an overbearing way .
If you arrive early , grab a special martini , perhaps made with ginger - infused vodka , on the rooftop deck .
10 p.m .
3 ) BRILLO PAD
Brillobox ( 4104 Penn Avenue ; 412-621-4900 ; www.brillobox.net) feels like an arty East Village bar — little wonder , considering the 30 - something artist couple who own it are former New Yorkers .
They came back home to Pittsburgh , they said , to contribute to the city ’s growing arts scene .
Art film screenings , spoken - word performances and live music are held upstairs in a room decked out in velvet wallpaper and murals .
Or just hang loose in the downstairs bar with its atmospheric red lights and an eclectic jukebox that has Goldfrapp , Patsy Cline and Snoop Dogg .
Cities in the Arab world were on average much larger than those in
Europe , and the size of the “ primate ” city – the megapolis such as
Baghdad , Damascus , Cairo or Istanbul – was much bigger ; a fact that is
indicative of a predatory state and low trade openness .
Europe , on the other hand , developed a very dense urban system , with
relatively small principle cities .
Big cities in Europe were quite
often located near the sea , being able to optimally profit from
long - distance trade , whereas the largest cities in the Arab world were
almost all inland .
The sociologist Max Weber introduced a distinction between ‘ consumer
cities ’ and ‘ producer cities ’ .
Using this classification , Arab cities
were – much more than their European counterparts – consumer cities .
The classical consumer city is a centre of government and military
protection or occupation , which supplies services – administration ,
protection – in return for taxes , land rent and non-market
transactions .
Such cities are intimately linked to the state in which
they are embedded .
The flowering of the state and the expansion of its
territory and population tend to produce urban growth , in particular
that of the capital city .
In Europe cities are instead much closer to being producer cities .
The primary basis of the producer city is the production and exchange
of goods and commercial services with the city ’s hinterland and other
cities .
The links that such cities have with the state are typically
much weaker since the cities have their own economic bases .
It is this
aspect that accounts for the fact that Arab cities suffered heavily
with the breakdown of the Abbasid Empire , while European cities
continued to flourish despite political turmoil .
No good deed involving doughnuts , it appears , goes unpunished .
Two weeks after an employee at a Tim Hortons in London was fired , then rehired , after she gave a child a free Timbit , Toronto investment manager Teresa Lee bought breakfast Wednesday for a pregnant homeless woman at a Tim Hortons downtown – then was scolded by a restaurant employee unhappy that the homeless woman stayed in the restaurant to eat .
The employee , Lee said , told her the Tim Hortons at King and Victoria Sts. does not let homeless people eat inside , even if they are eating Tim Hortons food , because they " make a mess . "
" I said , ` She purchased the goods , there 's no reason she should n't be able to eat in the store , ' " said Lee .
" He said , ` No , she did n't purchase it , you purchased it . '
I said , ` They were purchased .
There 's no reason she does n't have the right to eat it in the store . '
He said , ` No , she 's going to make a mess , who 's going to clean up that mess ?
Are you going to clean up that mess ? ' "
The homeless woman , Tim Hortons spokesperson Rachel Douglas wrote in an email yesterday , had been " disruptive to customers and staff " on " several " occasions in the past .
But Douglas did not say the woman had caused any problems Wednesday morning , and she apologized later to Lee — though Lee was unsatisfied with what Douglas said .
Walking to her office Wednesday around 8 a.m. , Lee , 34 , said she saw the homeless woman lying on a grate on King St .
When the woman got upset after police told her to move , Lee asked if she was hungry .
Lee bought her a sandwich , a Boston cream doughnut , and chocolate milk .
The woman , Lee said , sat down at a corner table , " not bothering anybody , " to eat .
When Lee walked out the door , the employee followed to admonish her .
Douglas said the homeless woman , who could not be located later for comment , had been asked to leave the restaurant on several previous occasions .
Tim Hortons , she said , does not have a policy on the treatment of the homeless ; it is up to franchises to " make delicate judgment decisions when dealing with any disruptive customers to ensure the store is pleasant , comfortable and safe . "
But she acknowledged the woman had not been disruptive Wednesday before the employee rebuked Lee .
" What happened here was the act of a Good Samaritan and we agree it was not handled in the best of manners .
We have since apologized to the customer . "
Lee , who works at an investment firm at Yonge and King Sts. , said that apology was incomplete .
Douglas appeared to apologize only for how the restaurant treated her , she said , not the homeless woman .
" I do n't think she directly admitted what they did wrong , " Lee said .
The Lee incident Wednesday and the Timbit controversy two weeks earlier illustrates the challenges companies like Tim Hortons face in protecting their brand images from negative publicity created by the decisions of their franchises .
Ninety - five per cent of the Canadian stores in the Tim Hortons chain are owned by independent franchisees who pay annual fees to the company , not by Tim Hortons itself .
The company , " a Canadian icon of best practices from a franchising perspective , " extensively trains franchisees on the treatment of customers , said Perry Maisonneuve , the principal at Northern Lights Franchise Consultants in Mississauga .
" But it comes down to judgment .
Somebody is Johnny - on - the - spot , they 're there at that time , and they 're going to react . "

Maisonneuve said a specific company policy on the treatment of the homeless would probably be " too narrow " ; Tony Wilson , a franchise lawyer at Boughton Law Corp. in Vancouver , said " it 's just common sense " to most restaurant owners that they should not evict homeless customers .
But after another public controversy , Wilson said , " I 'll bet you dollars to navy beans Tim Hortons is developing a policy right now on it . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Former terrorist suspects detained by the United States were tortured , according to medical examinations detailed in a report released Wednesday by a human rights group .
The Massachusetts - based Physicians for Human Rights reached that conclusion after two - day clinical evaluations of 11 former detainees , who had been held at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and in Afghanistan .
The detainees were never charged with crimes .
" We found clear physical and psychological evidence of torture and abuse , often causing lasting suffering , " said Dr. Allen Keller , a medical evaluator for the study .
In a 121 - page report , the doctors ' group said that it uncovered medical evidence of torture , including beatings , electric shock , sleep deprivation , sexual humiliation , sodomy and scores of other abuses .
The report is prefaced by retired U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba , who led the Army 's investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in 2003 .
Watch why a rights group says there 's evidence of torture »
" There is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes , " Taguba says .
" The only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account . "
Over the years , reports of abuses at Abu Ghraib and allegations of torture at Guantanamo prompted the Bush administration to deny that the U.S. military tortures detainees .
Since only 11 detainees were examined " the findings of this assessment cannot be generalized to the treatment of all detainees in U.S. custody , " the report says .
However , the incidents documented are consistent with findings of other investigations into government treatment , " making it reasonable to conclude that these detainees were not the only ones abused , but are representative of a much larger number of detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment while in U.S. custody . "
Four of the men evaluated were arrested in or taken to Afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 and later were sent to Guantanamo Bay , where they were held for an average of three years before being released without charge , the report says .
The other seven were detained in Iraq in 2003 and released within a year , the report says .
All the subjects told examiners that they were subjected to multiple forms of torture or ill treatment that " often occurred in combination over a long period of time , " the report says .
While the report presents synopses of the detainees ' backgrounds based on interviews with them , the authors did not have access to the detainees ' medical histories .
Therefore , there 's no way to know whether any of the inmates may have had medical or mental problems before being detained .
Among the ex-detainees was an Iraqi in his mid-40s , identified only as Laith , whom U.S. soldiers took into custody in October 2003 and who was released from Abu Ghraib in June 2004 .
According to the report , Laith was subjected to sleep deprivation , electric shocks and threats of sexual abuse to himself and his family .
" They took off even my underwear .
They asked me to do some movements that make me look in a very bad way so they can take photographs .
...
They were trying to make me look like an animal , " Laith told examiners , according to the report .
According to the report , Laith said the most " painful " experiences involved threats to his family : " And they asked me , ' Have you ever heard voices of women in this prison ? '
I answered , ' Yes . '
They were saying , ' Then you will hear your mothers and sisters when we are raping them . ' "
The examiners concluded in the report that " Laith appears to have suffered severe and lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of his arrest and incarceration at Abu Ghraib prison . "
Another detainee , Youssef , was detained by U.S. soldiers nearly seven years ago when he tried to enter Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan without a passport , the report says .
He initially was held in an Afghan prison , where he describes " being stripped naked , being intimidated by dogs , being hooded and being thrown against the wall on repeated occasions , " the report says .
A few months later , he was taken to the Guantanamo Bay facility , where he was subjected to interrogators who would enter his cell and force him to lie on the floor with his hands tied behind his back to his feet , the report says .
Youssef said the interrogators wanted him to confess of involvement with the Taliban , the report says .
Based on its investigation , the report calls on the U.S. government to issue a formal apology to detainees subject to torture and ill treatment by the military since fall 2001 in Afghanistan , Iraq , Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere .
The rights group also demands that the Bush administration :
• " Repudiate all forms of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " ;
• Establish an independent commission to investigate and report publicly the circumstances of detention and interrogation at U.S. - run prisons in Afghanistan , Iraq and Guantanamo Bay ;
• Hold individuals involved in torturing detainees accountable through criminal and civil processes ; and
• Monitor thoroughly the conditions at U.S. - run prisons all over the world .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The International Monetary Fund is sticking to its estimate that losses on U.S. assets from the subprime crisis and its wider fallout would be about $ 1 trillion despite fresh U.S. banking problems recently , a senior IMF official said on Wednesday .
“ Basically , we think this is a reasonable figure and we are not revising the figure every day , ” Jaime Caruana , director of the IMF ’s monetary and capital markets department , told reporters in Brussels .
Earlier he told the European Parliament that the financial system , still suffering from a near year - long credit crisis , may have more difficulty in extending credit needed for the economy to grow .

He walked naked through the Australian outback and died without clothes in a canoe in the jungle - but it was learned yesterday that the so - called ' Naked Nomad ' had left behind a £ 2 million fortune .
Eccentric Victor Flanagan wandered the sun-scorched roads of Australia without a stitch of clothing , slipping on a simple sarong when he entered towns , a curious figure with shoulder - length greying hair who had rejected civilisation .
Everyone believed he was penniless , but it has now been revealed that Mr Flanagan had left behind land worth £ 2 million near Busselton , in Western Australia .

Loner : Victor Flanagan on the road Port Augusta , South Australia , in 1995
He had inherited the property from his father .
Now the home has been awarded to his sister , Violent Jenkins , by a judge who decided that the naked and dying white man found in a canoe in the tropical wilds of Papua New Guinea was Mr Flanagan - even though he had not been formally identified .
Mrs Jenkins told the West Australian Supreme Court , in a hearing to decide whether Mr Flanagan should be declared dead and his estate should be passed to her , that she last spoke to her brother in 1996 while he was living in Papua New Guinea , north of Australia .
He had moved there , she said , after years of wandering naked around outback Australia .
Her research into her brother 's movements had led her to speak to loggers at a remote camp in Papua New Guinea .
They told her they had found a naked man close to death in a canoe and descriptions of him had led her to believe he was her brother .
She learned the man had been buried in a mass grave in the Papua New Guinea town of Lae , where other unidentified people had been interred .
Supreme Court Judge Andrew Beech ruled that it was ' fair to say ' that Mr Flanagan , who would have turned 57 this year , was dead .
" It is to be expected that he would have been in contact with Mrs Jenkins if he were still alive ' said the judge .
He once told reporters : ' My goal is simply to be in touch with nature , " he said .
" I want to spend the rest of my life as a nomad , not owning land or food or anything individually but collectively owning it and sharing it with everyone in the universe . "
Keep your fingers crossed , as a brand new Google Earth is going to be launched on April 18 , at a pre Earth Day event in New York City .
Google has been intensively working at an overhauled version of its Google Earth that is going to be released during a pre Earth Day event on April 18 , in New York City .
A week ago , a report in Express.co.uk has confirmed the fact that Google has already sent invitations for an event with the theme of Earth Day that is going to be held at the Whitney Museum of Art from New York City .
The search giant has promised to take the lid off of a “ brand new experience ” for Google Earth .
Google Earth is a virtual globe that can be used in order to trawl satellite images of the whole planet ’s surface .
Google Earth uses resolutions between 15 m and 15 cm and you can search any area on the planet through it .
Rumors say that the new version of Google Earth is going to replace the Google Maps application .
In Google Maps , Google has included 9 years ago the Street View feature that offers a great panoramic view from an eye - level of streets across the whole world .
A renewed version of Google Earth might bring in some increased functionality from Google Maps , and this might include local listings and also traffic reports .
Last year , the Google Earth has launched a virtual reality version of the planet - visualizing application on Steam , but the app was only available for HTC Vive headsets .
The team promised at that moment that in the near future it ’s going to add support for additional platforms .
Maybe the event from next week is going to bring an update for Google Daydream which is going to make the VR educational tool more affordable .
Stay tuned for more information on the upcoming event .
Speechless .
This has been confirmed , it ’s real and coming soon .

Okay , what do we do about this ?
I want suggestions .
This is what we have to deal with in America , as Democrats .
A liberal media that bends over so far backwards to be “ fair ” that it becomes just as bad as FOX News .
A liberal publication like the New Yorker thinks it ’s funny to make Mrs. Obama some radical black panther , Barack Obama basically a terrorist ( you ’ll note that he looks just like Osama bin Laden on the wall ) , and they ’re even burning the American flag in the Oval Office ( that ’s supposed to be the White House , get it ? ) .
They put Osama bin Laden on the wall of the Oval Office .
And this is funny ?
Is the New Yorker so out of touch that they do n’t realize that much of America , or at least too much of America , harbors these very concerns about Obama and his wife ?
I ’m sure the New Yorker thinks they ’re actually poking holes in the myth by making light of the stereotypes .
Yeah , and tell us how this pokes fun at the stereotype ?
It reinforces it .
And yet again , you ’d never see them try anything like this with John McCain .
God forbid you even ask a question about John McCain ’s experience , the media will destroy you .
But paint Obama and his wife as America - hating flag - burning violent terrorists , and it ’s funny .
I ca n’t wait to hear what Mrs. Greenspan and Bob Schieffer over at NBC have to say about this .
Somehow I ’m betting their outrage wo n’t be as great as when anyone questions Saint McCain .
More from Jake Tapper at ABC :
The DNC will today announce that they intend to file a lawsuit next week in U.S. District Court to spur an FEC inquiry over whether John McCain illegally withdrew from the federal financing system .
The committee first issued a complaint to the FEC in February , but In April a federal judge ruled that , even though the FEC lacked a quorom , they still could convene before the end of the 120 days they 're given to examine complaints .
Now , with those 120 days expiring on June 24th , the DNC is acting again in hopes a judge will compel the FEC to act on their complaint , as is allowed by law .
At issue is whether McCain locked himself into spending limits in the primary by putting up anticipated matching funds as collateral for the loan that helped keep his underfunded campaign alive at the end of 2007 .
Democrats hope to puncture a hole in McCain 's good government image by pressing the issue while Republicans dismiss it as totally groundless .
First , though , the FEC needs to have sufficient members to form a quorom .
With one nominee having withdrawn from consideration last month , the Senate appears to be finally ready to confirm additional commissioners in the next few weeks .
UPDATE : RNC Chief Counsel Sean Cairncross responds and dismisses the coming suit .
“ Having been thrown out of court just one month ago , the DNC now announces that it will once more file the same meritless lawsuit , again wasting judicial resources for its own political agenda .
Once again , the DNC has neither the law nor the facts on their side .
The controlling FEC regulation unequivocally states that the primary spending limits ‘ shall not apply to a candidate who does not receive matching funds at any time during the matching funds period . ’
( 11 CFR § 9035.1(d ) )
No one claims the Campaign ever received a matching funds payment .

Amtrak , America 's struggling passenger railroad , saw record numbers in May when ridership rose 12.3 percent from a year earlier , and ticket sales climbed 15.6 percent , according to company data .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Amtrak President Alex Kummant said the numbers point to a sixth straight year of record passengers .
He estimated a more than 11 percent rise this year on its 21,000 miles of track , building on last year 's 26 million passengers .
He attributes about half that growth to higher gas prices .
" It depends on the service but certainly our ridership growth is linked to the fuel prices , " he said in an interview .
" We are up against capacity limits . "
The Bush administration has sought to scrap direct federal funding for Amtrak , a for - profit federal corporation that has bled red ink since its 1971 creation .
Its backers contend that passenger rail services in other countries also lose money .
The White House threatened on Monday to veto legislation to fund Amtrak for the next five years , saying the U.S. House of Representatives failed to include language that would make the railroad more accountable .
The House legislation would authorize Amtrak funding of $ 14 billion and set up a program of federal matching grants to states for projects to improve passenger service , an arrangement Kummant says is crucial for any expansion .
" That would have a huge impact , " Kummant said .
" We are in a different world than even just three or four years ago with gas prices at these levels , with the congestion we face on the highways and with the difficulty in air travel . "
Rail advocates say the rise in passenger numbers underlines the need for greater federal and state funding in railways to bring the United States in line with Europe and Japan and give Amtrak the muscle to compete with commercial airlines .
They point to long - distance routes where ridership jumped 15 percent in May as evidence that railways can compete with airlines , as the rising cost of jet fuel pushes up air fares .
While Britain , France and Germany all have passenger rail systems that account for about 6 - 8 percent of total annual passenger travel miles , Amtrak carries less than 1 percent .
Japan , which operates the world 's busiest high - speed rail network with its Shinkansen trains , carries about 18 percent .
" It 's a matter of getting a huge ship like the American transportation industry to change direction , " said Ross Capon , executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers , which lobbies for more subsidies for Amtrak .
FUEL COSTS 'GETTING TOO HIGH '
Many travelers say they would like to see more services , citing frustration over U.S. gasoline pump prices averaging above $ 4 a gallon and rising air ticket prices .
" Even for business travelers there 's a lot of corporate pressure to cut down on travel costs , " said Paul Clapis , 53 , after stepping off Amtrak 's only high - speed service , the Acela Express , following a trip from New York to Boston .
Clapis , a director of a financial company , said he usually made the trip by air until two months ago when he switched to the train to save money .
Sharon Danaher - Henry , a senior citizen , decided not to fly to Maine from Connecticut .
It 's too expensive , she said , to fly with the top U.S. carriers , which tried to raise most domestic fares by $ 20 round - trip over the weekend .
" The cost of flying is outrageous , " she said , while waiting in Hartford , Connecticut , for an Amtrak train to take her about 200 miles to Portland , Maine .
The ticket to Portland costs about $ 100 , less than a third of one of the cheapest available airline tickets that would require two stopovers .
Both trips require more than seven hours when including time needed for switching between planes .
" The train is inexpensive and it takes the same travel time as flying but at least with the train , you get to see scenic things , " she said .
The question of whether to expand the nation 's only long - haul passenger railroad could spill into presidential politics .
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama has said on his Web site he would fight for Amtrak funding while seeking reforms .
His Republican rival , Sen. John McCain , has in the past sought to block federal subsidies for Amtrak .
Critics say Amtrak remains woefully slow and inefficient .
On tracks shared with commuter trains on the Washington - New York - Boston corridor , Amtrak 's premier service , the Acela , averages 82 miles per hour ( 132 km per hour ) although it can hit 150 mph ( 241 kph ) in parts of Rhode Island and Connecticut .
In contrast , Japan , France and Germany have developed nationwide rail systems capable of speeds of 150 mph ( 241 kph ) to 185 mph ( 297 kph ) on dedicated tracks with sophisticated signaling systems designed for high - speed trains .

I walked into the room where my wife was watching the American program So You Think You Can Dance - sort of an American Idol for dancers as opposed to singers .
To my amazement , one of the American teams , Joshua and Katee - an African - American and an Asian - American - were performing a highly emotive , kick - ass Bollywood number to to Hindi music .
The song was Dhoom Taana from the Bollywood picture Om Shanti Om .
This was ground - breaking fun for an otherwise cheesy television show .
I loved the whole idea and was pleasantly surprised to see another of my favorite blogs , Salon 's How the World Works writing about it as well .
